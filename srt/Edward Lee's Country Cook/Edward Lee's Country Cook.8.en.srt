1
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,245
(Today's guest is Bae Jung Nam, Yo Han's good friend.)

2
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:36,568
(Jung Nam's Mission: Take over Country Cook.)

3
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,469
(First, dominate Yo Han.)

4
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,269
(Yo Han isn't an easy match.)

5
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:42,585
(Yo Han and Jung Nam's chemistry really brings up the mood.)

6
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,609
(This stream of water? Unfamiliar with the standard accent)

7
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:44,609
(Jung Nam keeps attacking them with his country accent.)

8
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,930
(Look at the size of this thing.)

9
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,749
(He's so funny.)

10
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:50,319
(My friend told me to tell her, "You-roo-koo style.")

11
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:52,555
("You look good style" means "You have a good style.")

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,859
(Second, dominated the Country Family with his accent.)

13
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,058
(Jung Nam's endless antics are coming soon.)

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,029
(And Yo Han prepared a secret weapon.)

15
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,159
(1. He enjoyed eating this in Yeosu.)

16
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,229
It seemed Kyun...

17
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,959
(2. Eddie is interested in it.)

18
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,669
(3. It's very addictive.)

19
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,319
(What could it be? I'm excited.)

20
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:12,799
(How will Eddie react?)

21
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,709
(What do you think, Kyun?)

22
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,169
(Eating away)

23
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:17,438
(Inhaling the food)

24
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,579
(Yum!)

25
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,478
(What is this food...)

26
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,109
(that Eddie can't stop eating?)

27
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,079
(Edward Lee's Country Cook)

28
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:29,859
(The new morning has come to Yeosu.)

29
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,889
(The last day with Du Jun, our special guest.)

30
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,599
(Our three members are asleep under the morning sunlight.)

31
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,129
(But where is Eddie?)

32
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,299
(He woke up early to give an interview.)

33
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:50,109
(Stop sleeping and get up!)

34
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:53,549
(The bedroom door finally opens.)

35
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,979
(A Sung woke up first. Poking out)

36
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,879
(Being careful not to wake Du Jun)

37
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,049
(Deeply asleep)

38
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,718
(She quietly walked...)

39
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,789
(into the kitchen.)

40
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,929
(She opens the refrigerator...)

41
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,369
(and grabs whatever she sees.)

42
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,039
(Eggs, spinach, bacon)

43
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:22,739
I thought I should cook...

44
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:25,209
something light for everyone's stomachs.

45
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:28,208
So I made Eggs Benedict for everyone.

46
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,809
(A Sung's breakfast menu, Eggs Benedict)

47
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,089
(The first step to making Eggs Benedict)

48
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,589
(Rinse the spinach in running water.)

49
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,089
(Cut the spinach roots off with scissors.)

50
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:44,829
(Focused)

51
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,469
(Second, saute the spinach!)

52
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,439
(Add some oil to a heated pan.)

53
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:58,109
(Add the spinach.)

54
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,649
(Lightly saute the spinach until it turns soft.)

55
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,618
(Sweet sauteed spinach...)

56
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,619
(to go with the Eggs Benedict is done.)

57
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:09,988
A Sung.

58
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,258
(Foodie Si A also woke up at the tasty sounds.)

59
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,459
- Good morning. What are you up to?
- Good morning.

60
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,559
American-style breakfast.

61
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,699
That sounds nice. Brunch?

62
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,029
Yes, kind of.

63
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,169
Eggs Benedict, good?

64
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,899
Yes. Then I'll wake Du Jun up...

65
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:28,008
- and help you.
- That sounds good.

66
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,269
Have a tangerine.

67
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,778
Eat while you cook.

68
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,749
(Giving A Sung some sweetness for working hard.)

69
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:36,749
(Let's go to wake Du Jun Up.)

70
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,919
(Du Jun is sleeping comfortably as if he's in his own house.)

71
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:41,889
(Wake up.)

72
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,459
- Well...
- Oh, my.

73
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,318
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

74
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,359
Yes.

75
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:50,429
A Sung is preparing brunch.

76
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,058
- Do you want to sleep more?
- No.

77
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,199
I should get up.

78
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,769
I'm a guest.

79
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,099
- Then should we...
- Okay.

80
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:00,109
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

81
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,339
The weather is nice.

82
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:02,809
I'll go and wash my hands.

83
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,309
Oh, me too.

84
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,978
(After getting changed, )

85
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,385
(Du Jun jumped in to help in the kitchen.)

86
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,148
Can you cut the buns in half?

87
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,019
- Okay. Half like this?
- Yes.

88
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,665
(Si A and Du Jun are here to support the cooking efforts.)

89
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:17,089
(The next ingredient to cook)

90
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,819
(Now is the time!)

91
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,128
(Poached eggs cooked in boiling water)

92
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,409
(The highlight of Eggs Benedict)

93
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,598
(Crack an egg in a mug...)

94
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,739
(and drop it into the pot.)

95
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,508
(Leave it in the boiling water for 3 minutes.)

96
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,579
(Make sure not to touch it.)

97
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,979
(Poached egg with bouncy yolk is done.)

98
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,719
(Nice and round)

99
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,319
Oh, that's nice.

100
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,259
Oh, that smells nice.

101
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,658
- I'm hungry. Are you?
- Yes.

102
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,459
- I'm hungry.
- Smelling food made me hungry.

103
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,258
(The base ingredients for Eggs Benedict are ready.)

104
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,029
(The poached eggs are here.)

105
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,599
What are you grilling now?

106
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:04,369
I just have to make the Eggs Benedict sauce.

107
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:08,338
The sauce is quite important.

108
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,939
You make the sauce with two egg yolks,

109
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,249
two drops of vinegar,

110
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,809
and two drops of lemon juice.

111
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,648
You have to melt the butter...

112
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:20,189
and make it creamy by blending the sauce.

113
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,088
(Add 2 egg yolks, vinegar, and lemon juice...)

114
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,989
(into a blender.)

115
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,758
(It's time to add melted butter.)

116
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,129
I have to close this, right?

117
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:33,869
- This is hard.
- What?

118
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:35,499
(Getting up right away to help A Sung)

119
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,939
I should put it here.

120
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,408
(It won't come out.)

121
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,569
Please open this for me.

122
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:43,778
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, that scared me.

123
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,809
You were so strong when we arm-wrestled yesterday.

124
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:48,609
(I used all of my strength yesterday.)

125
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:49,918
(Shaking)

126
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,219
(They had an intense arm-wrestling match last night.)

127
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,789
(Neither of these strong-headed contestants knew how to lose.)

128
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,519
Two of my fingers aren't moving right now.

129
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:02,188
Didn't you use three fingers?

130
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:03,959
Oh, I used two.

131
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,598
(In charge of the dishes)

132
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,799
(Time to make the sauce)

133
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,608
(The key is to find the right thickness...)

134
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:15,869
(by adding melted butter.)

135
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,538
(When the sauce is thick enough, it's ready.)

136
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:20,578
That's amazing.

137
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,049
- It's done.
- That smells good.

138
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,549
It turned out so well.

139
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,679
Look at this.

140
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,988
- You just need egg yolks, - Oh, my.

141
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:29,748
- vinegar, - That smells so good.

142
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:31,189
And lemon juice.

143
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,528
(On top of the bread, add spinach, )

144
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,828
(bacon, and a poached egg.)

145
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,029
Then pour the sauce.

146
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:42,898
(Add a generous amount of the delicious sauce.)

147
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:43,939
That's so pretty.

148
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,209
This...

149
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,108
I've seen this before...

150
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,039
at a brunch cafe in Cheongdam-dong.

151
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:54,978
I've seen this dish before.

152
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,848
(A Cheongdam-dong brunch cafe-like dish...)

153
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,179
(in Yeosu)

154
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,058
(Finishing off with pepper and parsley)

155
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,159
This looks delicious.

156
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,019
- It's so pretty.
- It's so pretty.

157
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:12,259
(Breakfast in Yeosu, A Sung's Eggs Benedict)

158
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:14,928
- Chef!
- Chef!

159
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:16,168
- Good morning, Chef.
- Hey.

160
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,338
Hi.

161
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,738
- How are you doing?
- Good morning.

162
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,409
Good morning!

163
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,608
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

164
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,139
- We slept well.
- Good morning.

165
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,879
What's going on?

166
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:29,709
- You can come this way.
- Go and take a look.

167
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,648
Oh, my goodness.

168
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:33,249
(Breakfast is waiting for Eddie.)

169
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:36,959
Very nice.

170
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,058
A Sung made all of this.

171
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,059
Oh, really?

172
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,458
- Yes.
- We all made it together.

173
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,128
- No, A Sung did it all.
- Thank you.

174
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,599
- Look at this. Isn't it so pretty?
- I know.

175
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,098
(Touched)

176
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,569
Since you said you didn't eat...

177
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,239
- eggs and bacon for breakfast...
- Right.

178
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,538
(A special dish for Eddie, Blueberry Acai Bowl)

179
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,268
So I made an acai bowl for Chef Lee.

180
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,409
We had some blueberries left from the day before.

181
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,308
He likes refreshing dishes.

182
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:02,278
So I thought it'd be nice for him to have this light dish.

183
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,919
Chef Lee likes sweet things.

184
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:06,789
Just enough for it to melt.

185
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,259
(Blend it all with a happy heart.)

186
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,758
(Add the blueberry milk to the bowl.)

187
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,329
Look at the color. It's so intense.

188
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,798
(Sweet Shine Muscats)

189
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,798
(Nutrient-rich granola)

190
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,375
- This looks delicious.
- It looks good.

191
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,698
Can we all have a drink first?

192
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,779
(A special breakfast for Eddie, Blueberry Acai Bowl)

193
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,068
(Oh, my!)

194
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:30,039
- Is it good?
- Yes.

195
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,279
- Should we...
- It's so healthy.

196
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,049
It's so healthy.

197
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:35,809
Yes. For you.

198
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,178
- I needed it.
- Bon appetit.

199
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,148
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

200
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,689
- A Sung, thank you.
- Thank you for the food, A Sung.

201
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,959
- Should I just break this?
- Yes.

202
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,719
Shall I have a taste?

203
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:52,299
A Sung, seriously. Doesn't this look...

204
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,899
like something at a restaurant, Chef? Like a hotel?

205
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,138
This looks delicious.

206
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,909
(It looks nice enough to be served at a restaurant!)

207
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,279
(How does it taste?)

208
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,449
(Surprised)

209
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:09,748
Oh, my gosh. This is good.

210
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,049
(Si A has a big bite too!)

211
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:13,818
- Isn't it tasty?
- It's so tasty.

212
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,188
(Evidence of how tasty it is)

213
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,818
- Isn't it tasty?
- It is.

214
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:17,819
So tasty.

215
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:21,629
This is so tasty.

216
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,329
Thank you.

217
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,899
You're becoming a professional chef.

218
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,969
(Super happy)

219
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:29,998
This is so delicious.

220
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,369
(Glancing over)

221
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:33,199
(Wondering)

222
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:35,069
Okay, that's enough. I have to taste that.

223
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,539
No!

224
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:41,209
(Having a bite of Du Jun's)

225
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,978
I clearly remember you saying that you didn't eat...

226
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,619
- eggs and bacon for breakfast.
- Well...

227
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:47,748
- What happened?
- Well...

228
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:48,788
What?

229
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,258
- He wants to try some.
- You were enjoying it so much.

230
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,259
(Having a bite)

231
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:55,859
(By "Oh, my," he means that it's very tasty.)

232
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:57,259
It's so good.

233
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,929
Is there another one?

234
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,469
(I want this too.)

235
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:04,368
Seriously.

236
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,045
(You said you didn't eat eggs for breakfast.)

237
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:08,739
(I want to today.)

238
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:12,038
This is tastier than the ones in restaurants.

239
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,379
Oh, thank you.

240
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,008
When we were playing the word-chain game yesterday,

241
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,778
someone said, "eumak,"

242
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,859
- and Chef said, "akkaweo." - As in "It's too good."

243
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,288
That was so funny.

244
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,359
I was thinking about that before I fell asleep.

245
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:26,859
(Proud)

246
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,089
One more round?

247
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:29,089
- Morning word chain game?
- Shall we?

248
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,398
Should we? Morning word chain game?

249
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,428
Morning word chain game.

250
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:32,549
"Shigeumchi," as in spinach.

251
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,229
- Am I next?
- Yes.

252
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:35,809
"Chiyak," as in toothpaste.

253
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,169
- "Chiak?" - "Chiyak?"

254
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,798
"Chiyak." Toothpaste.

255
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,809
"Yakkapda."

256
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,779
(Laughing)

257
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,379
(Applauding in awe)

258
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,309
(He's the king of the word chain game.)

259
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,909
You're funny, Chef.

260
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,618
You have a sense of humor...

261
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,649
that works for Korean variety shows.

262
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,989
"Yakkapda."

263
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,458
Isn't that some sort of accent?

264
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,488
(Laughing at himself)

265
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:01,529
Just looking at Chef makes me laugh now.

266
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,388
- Word chain game...
- We start laughing...

267
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,858
- whenever our eyes meet.
- Yes.

268
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:06,229
I just can't stop laughing.

269
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,099
- He's so cute.
- He's so cute.

270
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,069
You'll travel all day today, right?

271
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,209
After you go...

272
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,508
I have to go now.

273
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,638
(It's time for Du Jun to go back to Seoul.)

274
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,139
I'm sorry. I'm going to miss you.

275
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,709
- Me too.
- Oh, no.

276
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,848
- I'm sad.
- Me too.

277
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:23,849
(We don't want to say goodbye.)

278
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,349
You should stay for longer.

279
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:28,949
(So we prepared one last trip for them.)

280
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:31,018
(Since he came all the way to Yeosu, )

281
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,579
(let's take him luging before he goes!)

282
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,489
- It's so big.
- I'm the best driver.

283
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,698
"Ticket office." "Entrance."

284
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:38,699
- Is it here?
- Yes.

285
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,758
Here are your tickets.

286
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,998
If you want to use it,

287
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,968
it's on the sixth floor of the next building.

288
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,899
Then please go to the first floor, go outside...

289
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:47,138
Hello.

290
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,709
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

291
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,539
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

292
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:53,038
- He's so popular.
- Thank you.

293
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,379
(Eddie was having a meet-and-greet by himself.)

294
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:57,179
He's a famous person.

295
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:58,179
- Chef Lee.
- Yes.

296
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,548
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

297
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:00,618
Thank you.

298
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,388
Chef Lee is so popular.

299
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,519
(Meanwhile, our 3 famous celebrities...)

300
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,529
(are watching the superstar.)

301
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,058
Superstar.

302
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:10,758
(I'm the number 1 celebrity in the Country Family.)

303
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,258
- Should we go this way?
- Shall we go?

304
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:13,259
Okay.

305
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,569
Let's go.

306
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,799
(They're so excited for their luge experience.)

307
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,339
This looks scary.

308
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,568
(The Country Family and Du Jun got on their luges.)

309
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:23,108
- Oh, my back hurts.
- Before you start,

310
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,708
we'll first watch a video on the screen in front of you.

311
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:26,709
- Okay.
- A Sung.

312
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,509
Why is Chef Lee so cute?

313
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,208
(Eddie looks so excited.)

314
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,648
(Having fun)

315
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,749
When Chef Lee...

316
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,618
was wearing the helmet, I was reminded of Super Mario.

317
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,718
(Am I Mario?)

318
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,888
Press the brake.

319
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,928
To change directions, move the handle right and left.

320
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,189
Oh, like this?

321
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,499
Oh, my.

322
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,929
Unless you have any questions,

323
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:49,428
you can let go of the brakes, and we'll get going.

324
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:50,639
We'll push you forward.

325
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,168
- Oh, my. Hold on.
- Oh, my.

326
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:55,238
Let's go!

327
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,039
(Let's race!)

328
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,439
Go ahead, Chef!

329
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,019
(Oh, my!)

330
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:05,649
(Loud)

331
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:07,949
(Why is this thing so fast?)

332
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:11,119
(Totally at ease)

333
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,289
Oh, this is amazing.

334
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:13,419
Oh, my.

335
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,729
(Going super fast as soon as they start)

336
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,998
What?

337
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,199
(Camera: Save me...)

338
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,429
All of our cameras fell off.

339
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:24,368
(Laughing)

340
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:25,999
(Has he lost it?)

341
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,538
(This is totally...)

342
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,079
(my style!)

343
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,849
(The thrilling race...)

344
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:39,249
(makes them excited.)

345
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:44,359
A Sung!

346
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,059
Are you coming?

347
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,359
Drifting!

348
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,499
A Sung! The view is so nice!

349
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:54,329
(Forget the view. It feels like I'm flying.)

350
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:57,429
(The distances between them start to grow in the fast race.)

351
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,639
(Currently in 1st place, racer Eddie)

352
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,769
(Scratching his ear with ease)

353
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,439
(Oh, my!)

354
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,209
This is so fun.

355
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,049
(Let's ride through the wind.)

356
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,379
Hi!

357
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,718
We're done.

358
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:14,149
(The Country Family and Du Jun made it to the finish line.)

359
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,659
(That was intense.)

360
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,688
- This was so fun.
- That's fun.

361
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,029
That was so fun.

362
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,928
I want to bring Arden later.

363
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,929
- I know. She would like this.
- Yes.

364
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:29,869
- Oh, that was fun.
- That was fun.

365
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,069
Let's go.

366
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,015
(After the fun luge ride, they need to say bye to Du Jun.)

367
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,939
Because we had too much fun at the park,

368
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,878
I think we'll need to get some rest back at our lodging.

369
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,078
I need a snack.

370
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,348
- Oh, do you want to eat something?
- A snack?

371
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,518
I need just a little something.

372
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,678
I need a snack.

373
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,489
(A snack?)

374
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:50,689
(The Country Family doesn't want to let Du Jun go.)

375
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,288
(Foodie)

376
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:53,989
Should we order chicken?

377
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,258
- Chicken?
- Chicken?

378
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:56,359
That sounds great.

379
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,428
- Chicken?
- What kind of chicken?

380
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:01,669
Chicken... I'll just order a variety.

381
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,469
- Okay.
- If so...

382
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,268
(They successful kept Du Jun for a bit longer.)

383
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,109
(I'll really leave after eating some chicken.)

384
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,779
(Du Jun took the bait.)

385
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,379
Oh, look what we got.

386
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,579
(Chicken is quietly waiting for the Country Family and Du Jun.)

387
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,879
Oh, my gosh.

388
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,278
- How nice.
- It came already.

389
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,488
(Already excited at the tasty smell filling the yard)

390
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,619
I'll bring it in.

391
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,719
Oh, my. That looks so delicious.

392
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,459
Okay. Are we ready?

393
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,759
- Oh, my.
- Okay.

394
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:29,859
Oh, this is crazy.

395
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,828
Thank you.

396
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:33,128
- Those who buy people chicken...
- It's nothing.

397
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:34,398
- are nice people.
- Thank you.

398
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,169
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Okay.

399
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:39,599
Shall I have this one?

400
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:41,768
(Just one bite makes her hum in joy.)

401
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:42,909
Oh, this is delicious.

402
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,209
Oh, my.

403
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:47,349
- This is so delicious.
- It is.

404
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,679
- This chicken is so delicious.
- It is.

405
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,349
- We have French fries.
- This is good.

406
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,088
This is good.

407
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,189
- This is perfect for a snack.
- It is.

408
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,229
(Du Jun eats a cheese ball.)

409
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,959
These are my first French fries...

410
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,999
- after coming to Korea.
- I see.

411
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,268
Chicken is so delicious.

412
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,029
(Happy at the first fry he's had in a while)

413
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:15,738
I missed French fries.

414
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:19,239
Like how we miss Korean food after being abroad for a while.

415
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,579
Exactly.

416
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,879
I kind of smell something.

417
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,349
- Bourbon whiskey sauce.
- Bourbon whiskey?

418
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:30,859
- They put that in the chicken?
- Yes.

419
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:32,289
Oh, my.

420
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:35,029
Bourbon whiskey is famous in Kentucky, right?

421
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,529
- I see.
- Oh, that's why.

422
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,598
Since I'm a chef,

423
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:43,269
I also think of bourbon whiskey as an ingredient.

424
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,099
So I like to cook with bourbon whiskey a lot.

425
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:48,668
This is so good.

426
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:49,868
(Bourbon whiskey and chicken, an unexpected but tasty combo)

427
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:51,109
This is so good.

428
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,278
Oh, I can smell the whiskey.

429
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,609
- Can you?
- Yes.

430
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:57,249
It has a richness, right? The scent.

431
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,649
This is so good.

432
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:01,018
Oh, that was nice.

433
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,849
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

434
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:07,529
That was so tasty and nice.

435
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,729
- That was fun.
- That was fun.

436
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,628
I'll head back to Seoul now.

437
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:13,969
- Thank you.
- Have a good rest of your trip.

438
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,368
I think I'll remember it as a trip...

439
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,139
that had a big impact compared to the length of time.

440
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,608
I came as a guest,

441
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,379
not knowing a single person here.

442
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,449
I think that made it more fun.

443
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,749
(The Country Family and Du Jun grew close by sharing tasty food.)

444
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,618
I'll remember it for a long time as a fun memory.

445
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:37,819
I had a fun time.

446
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,628
- Be careful on the way back.
- It's cold,

447
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:43,228
so I'll go right away. Don't come out.

448
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,258
- Okay.
- It doesn't seem like you will.

449
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,658
- It was fun.
- I'll get going.

450
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:47,668
- Bye.
- Bye.

451
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:49,029
- Bye.
- Bye, Chef.

452
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:52,299
- He was a very nice guest.
- He was.

453
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,509
Oh, he is gone now.

454
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:57,809
He was a very nice guest.

455
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,679
(Oh, this is nice.)

456
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:03,309
(An unusual accent and fashion)

457
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:05,295
(Du Jun has left, and he is now here.)

458
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,979
(It can't get spicier than this.)

459
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:09,709
(The man who has come to dominate the Country Family)

460
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:11,069
(He even got Eddie on his knees.)

461
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,459
(A man of devilish charm)

462
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,128
(Doom is here.)

463
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,788
(Jung Nam is here.)

464
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:17,459
Yo Han. I'm here.

465
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,468
- It's cold today.
- It's so cold.

466
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:23,469
It's so different from yesterday.

467
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,868
- Back to cold weather.
- Yes.

468
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,838
Chef, I'm going to stay here...

469
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,139
- while you guys go winter fishing.
- Okay.

470
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,339
Bye.

471
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:32,709
Oh, well.

472
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,249
- Can I stay with you?
- Sure.

473
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,049
Oh, you can't. You're the man of the ocean.

474
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,548
You have to go.

475
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:42,349
You're the yacht master, so you can't stay.

476
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:44,418
(Man of the Ocean, A Sung, and Eddie head to the ocean.)

477
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:45,559
Do you want me to drive?

478
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:46,989
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

479
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:48,958
Okay.

480
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,839
(They head to a new place with excited hearts.)

481
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:53,329
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

482
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,329
Everybody left us.

483
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,468
- What happened to us?
- Only two...

484
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:00,808
Only two left.

485
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,145
(There are only two people left in the car.)

486
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:05,279
It's like... In America, it's like a horror movie.

487
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:07,409
One by one, they die off.

488
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,578
We had a lot of people.

489
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:11,449
Dianne, Arden,

490
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,649
- Yo Han, - Nobody.

491
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:15,349
Si A, Du Jun...

492
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,488
This is a land of zombies.

493
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,235
(In Country World, everyone has become zombies.)

494
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,188
Only two survivors.

495
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:23,388
And then, there's nobody here.

496
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,135
(Where are these two going to get away from the zombies?)

497
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,668
We're going to meet the haenyeos now.

498
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:28,929
- Okay.
- Haenyeo.

499
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,099
(Oh, I'm excited!)

500
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,168
Yo Han is in charge of Yeosu, right?

501
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:37,039
So he contacted these haenyeos a long time ago.

502
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,108
So, is Yo Han meeting us?

503
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:40,308
- Yes.
- Okay.

504
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,549
Yo Han will get on the boat with us.

505
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:44,779
(I miss my brother, Yo Han.)

506
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,278
But do you know that?

507
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,788
In 2016,

508
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,419
haenyeos were recognized on a global basis...

509
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:53,258
- and officially made UNESCO's...
- Right.

510
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,928
Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

511
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,628
("Haenyeo Was Named a National Intangible Cultural Heritage")

512
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:58,798
I'm so happy.

513
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,535
("Haenyeo" Has Become the 132nd Intangible Cultural Heritage")

514
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,568
It's crazy.

515
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,638
- Because they can dive so much, - Exactly.

516
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:06,738
- their lungs get bigger, - Right.

517
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,838
And they can hold their breaths for longer.

518
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,579
So, especially in cold water,

519
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,378
when you're swimming,

520
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,648
you can't hold your breath.

521
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:18,778
But they can do it for 3, 4, even 5 minutes.

522
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:19,949
It's crazy.

523
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,789
So haenyeos are very special...

524
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:28,258
and rare. They're very specialized divers.

525
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,899
I'd just be interested to see what kind of seafood they come up with...

526
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,958
and to hear about their lives...

527
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:37,068
and how they've developed this skill...

528
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,938
of holding their breaths and diving.

529
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,908
It'd be exciting to see what they do there.

530
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:44,239
(They're both excited and curious to meet the haenyeos.)

531
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,378
Is there a job like haenyeo in the US too?

532
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,849
- No.
- I see.

533
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:51,119
In the US, grandmas...

534
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,719
watch Netflix.

535
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:55,749
No diving.

536
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,189
Watch Netflix.

537
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:58,319
Eat popcorn.

538
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:00,519
Pet their cats.

539
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,858
Knit.

540
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,059
(According to Eddie, that's what American grandmas do.)

541
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,498
- Here?
- Yes, this is it.

542
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,699
(They finally arrived at today's meeting place.)

543
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,339
Oh, yes. Look.

544
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:14,839
Oh, my.

545
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,889
(Dozens of times a day, boats head out to the sea...)

546
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:21,319
(from Yeosu Port, where the haenyeos and fishermen of Yeosu live.)

547
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,649
(Let us introduce the haenyeos who will be joining us today.)

548
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:28,089
(Park Chun Rye, The boss haenyeo, 72)

549
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:30,719
(Hyun Bong Ja, The boss's niece, 68)

550
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,919
(Cho Soon Ja, The boss's in-law, 73)

551
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:38,429
(They stayed with the ocean for a long time.)

552
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,669
(Today, they will be the Country Family's guides.)

553
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,039
Yes.

554
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,908
(Eddie and A Sung arrived at the dock earlier than Yo Han.)

555
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,338
Look at all these boats.

556
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:51,509
Oh, my.

557
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:54,379
(Right behind them, another car of the same model arrived?)

558
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:57,779
(Yo Han, who we have missed, is here!)

559
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,789
Yo Han!

560
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:05,318
(Desperately shouting his name)

561
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,289
Yo Han!

562
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:10,258
- How are you?
- How were things?

563
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,198
- How were things?
- I'm good.

564
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,399
I'm good too.

565
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:14,599
Let's go.

566
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:18,739
- Hello.
- Hello.

567
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:20,939
Why did you come so late?

568
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,068
We got here way before and were waiting for you.

569
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:25,378
Why weren't you on time?

570
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,009
We're freezing to death here.

571
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,609
They're scolding us already.

572
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:32,848
- You...
- Yes. Hello.

573
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:34,519
Nice to meet you.

574
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,518
- I'm Ko A Sung.
- Hello.

575
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,419
- I'm Cho Soon Ja.
- Oh, you're so handsome.

576
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,818
You must be an actor.

577
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:41,629
- Let me grab your hand.
- Hello.

578
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,059
Oh, we've really made it.

579
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,298
Shall we get going?

580
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,869
Come this way.

581
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,268
How are the waves today, ma'am? Are they strong?

582
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,368
- They're okay. Yes.
- They're okay?

583
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,139
In this wind, the sea will be quiet where we go.

584
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,939
Kyun. This feels like our first day again.

585
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,508
The first day.

586
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:00,538
(Yo Han is nervous like that first day they met.)

587
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,379
Because you took two days off.

588
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,148
- Come in.
- May we?

589
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:07,379
Come in. It's cold.

590
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:10,688
- So this is what it's like.
- What's this?

591
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,958
(Amazed)

592
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,519
Unlike in the fishing boat,

593
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,959
there was a hideout for the haenyeos.

594
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,499
Each piece of equipment looked as if it had history.

595
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:23,498
There was warmth,

596
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:28,268
but I was careful so as not to mess...

597
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:30,239
with the rules of the hideout.

598
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:34,108
- The basket is cute.
- Come in.

599
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:35,379
Come into the warm area.

600
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,418
Sit where it's warm in the center.

601
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:39,548
Give me a cushion.

602
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:40,918
You brought one.

603
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,919
Yes.

604
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,148
Sit on a towel.

605
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:44,319
(Looking around)

606
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,259
This room is adorable.

607
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,659
(Here we go.)

608
00:23:57,129 --> 00:23:59,638
I'd like to know your names.

609
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:00,898
- May I ask for your names?
- My name?

610
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,808
- I'm Cho Soon Ja.
- Cho Soon Ja.

611
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,338
- Cho Soon Ja.
- Cho Soon Ja.

612
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:05,678
My name is Hyun Bong Ja.

613
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,008
- Hyun Bong Ja.
- Ja.

614
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,079
And you, ma'am?

615
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:11,579
Park Chun Rye.

616
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,279
Chun Rye.

617
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,019
It's a pleasure to meet you.

618
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:17,789
(Likewise.)

619
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:21,159
Are you two sisters?

620
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,328
- Us?
- Yes.

621
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,329
Both your names end with "Ja."

622
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,799
Am I wrong?

623
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,899
The shipowner is my sister.

624
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:29,969
She's my sister's sister-in-law.

625
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,038
(The sister-in-law...)

626
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,138
(of Cho Soon Ja's sister)

627
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,139
The cousin.

628
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,908
(The daughter of Cho Soon Ja's brother)

629
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,168
We're all related.

630
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:38,238
(We're all family.)

631
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:41,549
How did your family start the haenyeo business?

632
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:45,218
- Our hometown is Jeju Island.
- I see.

633
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:48,118
Every woman on Jeju Island dives for seafood...

634
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,489
- from an early age.
- I see.

635
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:52,019
My sister was a haenyeo on Jeju Island...

636
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,828
and came here to earn money...

637
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,088
when she met her husband.

638
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:57,089
- Right.
- Right.

639
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,098
My sister worked under someone at first.

640
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,598
She then started her own business...

641
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,499
with this boat and by buying the sea.

642
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:03,999
Yes.

643
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,199
- She bought the sea?
- Yes.

644
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:08,208
She didn't buy it with money.

645
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:09,838
There's a contract regarding territory.

646
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,638
Something like, "This is my territory?"

647
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:15,378
After my sister started her own business,

648
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:17,849
we joined her from the other boats.

649
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:19,879
- I have a question.
- Okay.

650
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,048
Why are there no male haenyeos?

651
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:24,288
- There are male haenyeos.
- Really?

652
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,318
Yes.

653
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,358
What do you call them?

654
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,959
- Is it haenyeo or haeja?
- Haenyeo.

655
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:30,329
Simply male haenyeo.

656
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,498
- Haenam?
- Haenam.

657
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:33,628
They're called haenyeo.

658
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:35,098
- We call them haenyeo.
- Even males.

659
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,599
- But haenam is correct.
- Haenam?

660
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:39,969
But don't call us haenyeo.

661
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,169
- Then what?
- How come?

662
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,508
We hate the word haenyeo.

663
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:47,738
- What do we call you?
- Now,

664
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:50,209
the word "haenyeo" from Jeju Island...

665
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,578
has been registered with UNESCO, which is indeed great.

666
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:55,789
But in the past, it was considered a lowly job.

667
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,748
- No...
- It's a hazardous job.

668
00:25:57,749 --> 00:25:59,118
- I never thought it like that.
- An extreme one.

669
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,989
- Back in the day on Jeju Island, - Yes?

670
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,058
People said haenyeos made money in the otherworld...

671
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,958
and fed their families in this world.

672
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,198
That's just how dangerous the job is.

673
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,328
- Yes, it's dangerous.
- Right?

674
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:10,029
That's why I hate being called haenyeo.

675
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:13,238
(Life as a haenyeo wasn't easy, )

676
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,719
(despite doing it to make ends meet.)

677
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,608
(The illness caused by going underwater...)

678
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,408
(and straining the body, )

679
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:21,449
(decompression sickness)

680
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:28,918
There could be steel frames, treasures, and more in the sea.

681
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,489
I get startled multiple times a day if my swimming goggles get caught...

682
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,488
while I am swimming carelessly.

683
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:35,858
(Even in dangerous situations, )

684
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:37,088
There are many dangerous moments.

685
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:38,649
(she can't stop diving into the water.)

686
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,568
- What shall we call you?
- Call me Madam.

687
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,799
(Feisty)

688
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,198
Call me Madam.

689
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:47,199
(Madam Chun Rye)

690
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,208
Madam.

691
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:49,708
(Madam Chun Rye)

692
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,708
- Have a cup, Madam.
- I had one earlier.

693
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:52,738
- Madam.
- I just had one.

694
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:54,009
Madam. Here.

695
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,509
- I had one.
- Is it for us? Thank you.

696
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,219
Madam Sea.

697
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:59,719
- Madam Sea.
- Madam Sea.

698
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,819
May I call you Madam too?

699
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:04,858
Yes.

700
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,859
- Madam.
- Madam is nice.

701
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,158
(Madam is good!)

702
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,759
What can you catch in the Yeosu sea?

703
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:15,069
It has all kinds of fish.

704
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:18,339
Sea cucumber, sea squirt, stone sea squirt,

705
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:22,009
abalone, sea urchin, and Korean common sea urchin.

706
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:23,368
(Yeosu Sea is a paradise of fresh seafood.)

707
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:26,579
Can you tell at once when you go...

708
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:28,848
into the sea?

709
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,479
Or do you follow some trace?

710
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,078
You can't see it. Sometimes, you can.

711
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,218
For sea cucumber, even when you spot it,

712
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,118
it'd poop, and then go into hiding.

713
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,618
- It hides after pooping?
- Yes.

714
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:40,889
The sea cucumber.

715
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,188
(A tip on catching sea cucumber)

716
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:45,058
(Locate it with the poop floating around)

717
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,729
But abalone leaves no traces.

718
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:49,069
You must find it, not the trace.

719
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:53,769
As for sea urchins, they're on things.

720
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:55,408
- I see.
- With them on things,

721
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:58,379
they're visible, so we just pick them out.

722
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:00,139
(Acquiring marine knowledge)

723
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:02,209
(Acquiring marine knowledge)

724
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:05,649
What's your day like? What time do you wake up?

725
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,948
In the morning, I leave home...

726
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:10,388
at around 6:30am for the first shift.

727
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:11,919
I work...

728
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:15,159
inside the water for 2 to 3 hours.

729
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:17,428
Do you work, have lunch,

730
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,998
- and then go back inside?
- No.

731
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,058
- Is it done all at once?
- All at once.

732
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:21,199
I see. All at once.

733
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,799
We always skip lunch.

734
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:25,368
I brought us some lunch like mulhoe and all.

735
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:26,369
- Really?
- Yes.

736
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,238
I made it and brought it from home.

737
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,508
- Want to try it?
- Of course.

738
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:31,938
- Of course.
- We've got rice too.

739
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:33,678
- Let's see.
- Let's see.

740
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,908
(Madam haenyeo's food with love)

741
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:36,349
Yes, that one.

742
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,348
My goodness.

743
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,518
Look how it's made with so much care.

744
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,089
Oh, my. I'm deeply moved.

745
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,058
- What is this?
- Sea cucumber mulhoe.

746
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,629
- Sea cucumber mulhoe?
- Yes.

747
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:50,228
It looks good.

748
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,429
As expected, you're all generous.

749
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,258
The spoons are outside.

750
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:55,528
Ask the captain for them.

751
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:57,329
- Let's give it a taste.
- I don't want some.

752
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:00,668
But I feel bad for enjoying it alone.

753
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:01,968
It's okay.

754
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:02,969
(We're good.)

755
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:06,039
(Eddie smells the food first if he has never had it before.)

756
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:07,809
(Starting with sea cucumber mulhoe)

757
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,848
Oh, my gosh.

758
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,248
- Here.
- Thank you.

759
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,249
No, this one.

760
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,348
- Try and see if it's good.
- You mean the rice?

761
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:14,748
- Glutinous rice.
- Glutinous rice.

762
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:16,218
- Peas.
- Peas.

763
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:17,618
(Having a spoonful of sea cucumber mulhoe)

764
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:19,319
Is it okay?

765
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,219
- Is it good?
- It's good.

766
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,329
(She's happy to see him like it.)

767
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:25,158
This is...

768
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:26,758
way better than a restaurant's.

769
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,128
- Is it?
- Here.

770
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:29,329
Kimchi soup.

771
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:32,239
- Just do one.
- Leave it here.

772
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:33,669
Enough.

773
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,738
(I'll have a try too.)

774
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,669
We normally eat on land before coming out.

775
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,878
(Yo Han and A Sung dig in without a word.)

776
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:41,879
Try some kimchi.

777
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,240
- Do you want some kimchi?
- Sure.

778
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:44,978
When did you catch the sea cucumber?

779
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:47,448
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday?

780
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,218
No wonder it's so fresh and good.

781
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,949
The way you eat this one?

782
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,088
(Observing the sea cucumber)

783
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:55,558
(Eddie is curious about something.)

784
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,558
- To catch it...
- A bit of sugar was added.

785
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,499
How do you boil this?

786
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,328
We don't boil it. It's raw.

787
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:02,498
- Is it raw?
- Yes.

788
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:03,598
And...

789
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,098
Does it not have a shell? Do you just cut it?

790
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:07,668
- It doesn't have a shell.
- It doesn't have a shell, does it?

791
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:08,739
No, it doesn't.

792
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:11,539
Can you tell me the full recipe?

793
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,709
For this one.

794
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,309
This one? It has pear and cucumber inside.

795
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:18,319
Cut the poop off.

796
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:21,149
Take out all the insides, wash it clean,

797
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:22,919
and cut it into pieces.

798
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,959
(Cutting into bite-sized pieces)

799
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:29,989
Leave it in vinegar water for a bit.

800
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:32,659
You need to add a bit of doenjang.

801
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,568
(Sea cucumber mulhoe sauce)

802
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,298
(Into the doenjang base water, )

803
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:39,669
(add gochujang, sugar, and vinegar to taste.)

804
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,509
(Madam Yeosu Haenyeo's versatile sauce is complete!)

805
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,138
(Sea cucumber mulhoe recipe)

806
00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:46,508
(Pour the mulhoe sauce into the prepped sea cucumber...)

807
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,749
(with various vegetables like pear, cucumber, and more.)

808
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:52,179
(Madam Yeosu Haenyeo's sea cucumber mulhoe)

809
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,049
(He might even devour the plate.)

810
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:56,619
Try it.

811
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:00,618
- It's so good that...
- Is it?

812
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:02,328
My motion sickness has run away.

813
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,389
Did it run away?

814
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,628
- The food...
- That's a relief.

815
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:06,659
What great news.

816
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,398
- It looks good.
- So is that like little...

817
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,468
- Try it.
- Cockle.

818
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,239
- Here. Give me your rice.
- This is cockle.

819
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,569
(Madam Yeosu Haenyeo's homemade seasoned cockle)

820
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:18,839
The way you eat this one?

821
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,479
Just put it in your mouth and suck it out.

822
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:23,279
- Just a bit of it.
- Okay.

823
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,479
(Eating the cockle flesh only)

824
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:27,719
- The other one.
- That's good.

825
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:29,889
(Another cockle)

826
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,658
(The cockle killer of the area)

827
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,659
(Another cockle)

828
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:36,489
The rest.

829
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:38,829
It's delicious.

830
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,099
(He eats so well.)

831
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,868
(Scraping the bottom of it)

832
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,968
(A meticulous eating show on the sea)

833
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:49,009
Have some.

834
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:51,708
It tastes much better if you mix rice in this.

835
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,739
Really?

836
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,208
Rice in mulhoe is good.

837
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:56,478
- Mix it.
- Mix the two.

838
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:58,279
Put the cockle shell in here.

839
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:01,648
- Here.
- No.

840
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:02,649
What?

841
00:32:02,749 --> 00:32:04,289
(No!)

842
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,718
- Here.
- Why are you scolding me?

843
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,719
(Realizing)

844
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,659
(Picking out the cockle shells)

845
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,799
Kyun. This is love.

846
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,599
Mix the rice in here.

847
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,728
- Mix it with that.
- The soup.

848
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:17,329
A bit more soup in here.

849
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:20,369
Yes, that's it.

850
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:22,239
Dig in.

851
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:24,979
Don't scold me.

852
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:26,878
You're really scary.

853
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:27,908
Am I?

854
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:29,079
How about I feed you?

855
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:32,919
How about I feed you?

856
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:37,388
Shall I feed you with love?

857
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,689
You felt her affection.

858
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:43,458
I don't just feed anyone.

859
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:44,528
Okay. Please do it.

860
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,499
(Ready to receive the madam's love)

861
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,829
(Okay. Please do it.)

862
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,328
- But...
- Oh, my.

863
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:53,539
My goodness.

864
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,109
- It tastes much better.
- Does it?

865
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:58,779
(A happy ending)

866
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,349
(The Yeosu madams are funny.)

867
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:05,249
Are you done?

868
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,178
Thank you.

869
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:08,419
- Thank you.
- No problem.

870
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,849
Thank you, Madam.

871
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:12,119
Thank you, little brother.

872
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:14,759
"Little brother?"

873
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,859
Thank you, little brother.

874
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,798
It was such a delicious meal.

875
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,119
(While the Yeosu madams and little siblings are traveling)

876
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,999
(Meanwhile, Si A is alone in the house.)

877
00:33:27,469 --> 00:33:28,469
(Preparing to welcome the guest)

878
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:29,469
(Busy)

879
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,139
(Organizing the clothes)

880
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:33,309
(Cleaning the table)

881
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:35,809
(Doing the dishes)

882
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,849
(Washing thoroughly)

883
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,519
(She's done cleaning.)

884
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,889
(Enjoying her break alone)

885
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:52,999
(How about I lie down a bit?)

886
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:55,499
Nice.

887
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,469
The countryside is nice.

888
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,638
(A voice with a strong presence)

889
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,809
There's even the sea.

890
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,268
How heavy.

891
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:05,739
(Is someone here?)

892
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:09,649
(Or not?)

893
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:10,749
Is this the place?

894
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,779
(The guest is here!)

895
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,879
Gosh, what's that?

896
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:16,149
This is no joke.

897
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,089
To think they made this.

898
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,519
Amazing.

899
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,028
It's pretty.

900
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,158
(This man talks to himself a lot.)

901
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,959
It has a vintage vibe.

902
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,799
I better carry it.

903
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:32,669
Yo Han! I'm here!

904
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:38,479
(Today's Special Guest: Bae Jung Nam)

905
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,238
(He's fashionable, )

906
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,678
(good at acting, )

907
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,149
(and puts on a good eating show.)

908
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,349
(Why did Bae Jung Nam come all the way to Yeosu?)

909
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:52,989
Yo Han...

910
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:58,229
wanted me to come over to travel and take a break.

911
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:00,899
(They became friends through the drama "Mr. Sunshine.")

912
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:03,569
(They support each other with coffee trucks, )

913
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,939
(travel together during breaks, )

914
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:09,839
(and take each other's clothes.)

915
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:13,809
(Yo Han and Jung Nam are celebrity best friends.)

916
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:15,909
Because Chef Edward is here too,

917
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:18,778
I thought we'd get delicious food and came at once.

918
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:19,979
(The loyal Bae Jung Nam)

919
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:22,919
Yo Han! I'm here!

920
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,289
- Yo Han! I'm here!
- What?

921
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,159
Where's Yo Han?

922
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,758
- Hey.
- Hi.

923
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:31,028
- Jung Nam?
- Why are you here?

924
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,258
- Where's Yo Han?
- Jung Nam.

925
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:34,829
- Yes.
- What's with you?

926
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,228
- Have you been well?
- Yes. Hi.

927
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:39,138
- I came because Yo Han told me to.
- Really?

928
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,075
- But Yo Han isn't here right now.
- Where did he go?

929
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,368
He went fishing.

930
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:44,308
He had me come from Seoul.

931
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,678
- Are you here as a special guest?
- Yes.

932
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,748
- Gosh. What a nice house.
- I see.

933
00:35:48,749 --> 00:35:49,949
Welcome.

934
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:53,718
I got to know Jung Nam along with Yo Han.

935
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,948
I was invited to a magazine event.

936
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,989
That was when we first met.

937
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:03,589
I'm kind of hungry. Is there something I can chew on?

938
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:05,399
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

939
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,859
(She's in guest greeting mode.)

940
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:10,499
It's pretty.

941
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,299
Look at the weather. It's amazing.

942
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:15,839
I'd love to live in this house.

943
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:19,209
(Preparing in a hurry)

944
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,349
(I've kept you waiting, Mr. Guest.)

945
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:25,618
- Gosh.
- I had it all prepared.

946
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,148
- It looks nice.
- Right?

947
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:29,748
- Is it glutinous rice cake?
- Yes. We lined up to buy it.

948
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:30,848
- Is it famous?
- Yes.

949
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:32,519
I love mugwort. Let me try it.

950
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:34,459
You lined up for it?

951
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,928
Yes. The chef and A Sung lined up to buy it.

952
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,558
How thoughtful of you for the guest.

953
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,869
We were prepared.

954
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:44,969
(How is it?)

955
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,239
It's incredible.

956
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,339
Is it fun? Not bad?

957
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,578
The chef must've cooked you amazing dishes.

958
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,038
- He did.
- You're lucky.

959
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,748
We had so much delicious food.

960
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:57,108
That's the best.

961
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:58,878
Have you met the chef before?

962
00:36:58,879 --> 00:36:59,949
No.

963
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:02,419
I'm a big fan.

964
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:06,019
I'm here to see the chef, not Yo Han.

965
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:10,389
(How can you be so mean?)

966
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:11,688
(Joking around)

967
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:12,769
(He loves to tease Yo Han.)

968
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,099
- The chef...
- Yes?

969
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:16,898
- is a great person, right?
- Yes.

970
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:18,169
He has a friendly face.

971
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,639
I could tell he was mischievous from the show.

972
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:23,938
What do I call him?

973
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:25,039
How about Chef?

974
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:27,438
Calling him that feels too distant.

975
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,908
I'll call him Bro when we get along.

976
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,578
- Bro sounds good.
- Bro Kyun.

977
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:32,179
Bro Kyun is nice.

978
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,118
I doubt anyone calls...

979
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,419
- the chef "Bro." - Nice.

980
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,989
Do you think he'll understand me?

981
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,928
The chef is quite good at Korean.

982
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,929
There's Korean, but also my Korean.

983
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,828
You speak Korean.

984
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,549
- You're right.
- And there's Busan Korean.

985
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:51,029
Should I talk so that he can't understand one bit?

986
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,398
I bet it'll be funny. You know, those words.

987
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:54,399
Like what?

988
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,209
- I don't know if you'll know.
- Like?

989
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:57,769
"Is ga, ga?"

990
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:01,178
- Is that person, that person?
- You know.

991
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,708
- Is ga, ga? I know.
- You do.

992
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:07,219
How about... "Is ga, ga ga?"

993
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,348
- Sorry?
- You don't get it, right?

994
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:11,648
- There's three "ga." - I don't know. Did that person go?

995
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:14,789
It means, "Is that person's last name Ga?"

996
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:17,129
You mean like the Kim family and the Ga family?

997
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:18,358
It's hard, right?

998
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,728
How many "ga" was that again?

999
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:22,198
- It's tough.
- Is ga, ga ga?

1000
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,399
This one's hard.

1001
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,168
(The haenyeos' ship has arrived at the diving point.)

1002
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:28,269
We're at our sea.

1003
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,438
We'll leave first...

1004
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:32,599
- so that you can get changed.
- Please don't mind us.

1005
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:36,149
(See you in a bit.)

1006
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,649
(After getting into the haenyeo suit, )

1007
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:45,959
(the haenyeo boss appears.)

1008
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:52,759
(Putting the diving cap on)

1009
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:59,038
(I'm feeling shy.)

1010
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,739
(Don't film me.)

1011
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:04,369
(Putting on the gloves thoroughly)

1012
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:08,879
(Taking the tewak, which is the haenyeo's lifeline)

1013
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,219
(She's wearing the flippers that'll help her swim faster.)

1014
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,179
So that's lead.

1015
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:17,989
- It weighs 8kg.
- 8kg.

1016
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:21,189
(An 8kg lead belt to help her dive deeper)

1017
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:28,229
It's really cool to be able to see what they do up close.

1018
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,668
It just goes to show how human beings can...

1019
00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:37,139
push themselves to the limit and do remarkable things.

1020
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:40,379
How long have you used these pieces of equipment?

1021
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,509
If we don't lose them, we use them for more than ten years.

1022
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,879
- Gosh, that's cool.
- Here.

1023
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,348
When going into the water,

1024
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,218
they put knives in their belts like warriors.

1025
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:55,289
They looked really cool.

1026
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:57,458
(A Sung watched the haenyeo get ready.)

1027
00:39:57,459 --> 00:39:59,259
So this is all the equipment.

1028
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:01,459
I should clean them up.

1029
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:06,399
(To be of help, A Sung wipes the swimming goggles.)

1030
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:11,869
(All preparations are done!)

1031
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:16,079
(Exclamations of respect and worry)

1032
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:19,419
(Don't worry, Yo Han. We're fine.)

1033
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,649
- Madam. Good luck.
- Let's do this.

1034
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,889
We'll catch a bunch.

1035
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,059
Okay, pull it.

1036
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:31,359
(Haenyeo Cho Soon Ja goes into the water first!)

1037
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:41,068
(After taking a deep breath, )

1038
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:43,309
(she goes in.)

1039
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:47,879
(Into the sea world)

1040
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,349
Let's go catch some seafood.

1041
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:55,319
Good luck!

1042
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,859
(The rest of the haenyeos go into the water.)

1043
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:02,489
(Diving without hesitation)

1044
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:06,729
(The haenyeos take their own spots.)

1045
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,299
- I'm curious.
- Yes?

1046
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,568
Do they stay in the water for two hours straight?

1047
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:13,838
Or do they come out in between?

1048
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:14,938
They stay in there.

1049
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,738
They don't come out for a bit?

1050
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,339
They stay in the water for three hours.

1051
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:22,078
- I'm worried.
- Why?

1052
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,148
(The Country members are worried.)

1053
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:25,078
- It's...
- We've never seen it before.

1054
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,149
Yes.

1055
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:27,748
(He's sincerely worried.)

1056
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:29,948
They're diving into the sea in the winter.

1057
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:32,518
I was the one who got worried and nervous.

1058
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,819
The sea isn't always calm.

1059
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:37,889
In any situation, throughout all four seasons,

1060
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:39,629
they dive...

1061
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,469
into the water for their children...

1062
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,469
and us.

1063
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,999
I'm very grateful, which moved me a lot more.

1064
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,108
(Once they start, the haenyeos dive in...)

1065
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:55,309
(for seafood for 2 to 3 hours straight.)

1066
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:01,979
(After catching their breath, they dive back in countless times.)

1067
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,228
(As shallow as 5m)

1068
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:11,529
(As deep as 20m)

1069
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:18,169
(The haenyeos dive for about 2 minutes at a time.)

1070
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:23,309
(The breath the haenyeos take after coming out of the water)

1071
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:28,379
(Soombisori)

1072
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,178
(Soombisori)

1073
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:31,848
(The whistle-like sound a haenyeo makes at the surface...)

1074
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,849
(when exhaling the breath she has been holding in)

1075
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,759
(It's also a breath of life as if to say, "I'm alive.")

1076
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,958
- Our hometown is Jeju Island.
- It's been 50 years.

1077
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,728
Everyone on Jeju Island dives for seafood...

1078
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:49,399
- from an early age.
- Since birth...

1079
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:51,569
When there was spare time, one said,

1080
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:54,398
"I'm going to go catch conch."

1081
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:56,439
And that's how you naturally became a haenyeo.

1082
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:58,538
Not to become one, I moved to Seoul.

1083
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:02,508
I even got a job there, but it still didn't work out.

1084
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:04,308
It was fate.

1085
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:06,549
(It was my fate to become a haenyeo.)

1086
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:13,659
(The sea became a part of her life like a destiny.)

1087
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:17,028
(Yet again today, the haenyeos forage...)

1088
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:21,129
(as much as the sea allows them.)

1089
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:25,269
There they are.

1090
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:28,199
- They go in and out.
- Yes.

1091
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:35,549
(The net is becoming full with the seafood they foraged.)

1092
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:38,808
- Madam.
- Yes?

1093
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:39,979
(The show was filmed safely.)

1094
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:42,589
- You worked hard.
- This is nothing.

1095
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:46,659
(She passes them the net full of seafood first!)

1096
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:49,858
Get yourself warm first.

1097
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,429
(Take this first!)

1098
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,129
- Put it there.
- Here?

1099
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:54,959
Okay.

1100
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:56,669
She got a lot of abalones.

1101
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,499
(Curious)

1102
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,968
- It's small.
- It's small?

1103
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:03,269
(Which seafood are in the net?)

1104
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:04,868
(Opening Haenyeo Cho Soon Ja's net!)

1105
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:05,939
It's so big.

1106
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:08,178
(Huge abalones)

1107
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,379
- Here are sea cucumbers.
- We'll take them out.

1108
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:12,179
My goodness.

1109
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,379
(They look very fresh.)

1110
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:17,689
The octopus...

1111
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:20,458
(They're literally alive.)

1112
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:22,059
This one is strong.

1113
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,529
We have four octopuses.

1114
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,299
Look at this.

1115
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:28,428
Do you normally get a lot of octopuses?

1116
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:29,828
- No.
- No?

1117
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:32,369
You're lucky that you came today.

1118
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:34,569
We're very lucky.

1119
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:38,668
(Precious seafood the haenyeos got from diving)

1120
00:44:38,669 --> 00:44:39,709
Goodness.

1121
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:43,509
- Goodness.
- I'll sell them all.

1122
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:45,008
They're pretty good.

1123
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:46,518
- Should I slice one for you?
- Sure.

1124
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:47,825
- A small one.
- Get me a cutting board.

1125
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:49,418
It's so fresh.

1126
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:51,419
(She willingly gives her guests precious seafood.)

1127
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:54,588
(It's time to taste the freshness of the sea as it is!)

1128
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:55,589
It looks delicious.

1129
00:44:58,089 --> 00:45:00,528
(A plate full of seafood and the haenyeos' love!)

1130
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:01,728
Take one each.

1131
00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:02,769
- Okay.
- Okay.

1132
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,428
Just like that?

1133
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:05,639
Yes, you go first.

1134
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:08,769
(His first time eating raw abalone on a boat)

1135
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:10,869
- Dip it in some sauce.
- It'll be salty.

1136
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:13,139
- What?
- This.

1137
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:15,979
(I can taste the sea in my mouth.)

1138
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:18,349
Is it nice?

1139
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:22,589
(It's A Sung's turn to try now.)

1140
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:27,589
(Amazed)

1141
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,889
(There's no need for words.)

1142
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:35,629
This is the best abalone I've ever tasted.

1143
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:39,799
It made me think, "All the seafood I've had so far..."

1144
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:43,208
"didn't capture the taste wholly."

1145
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:45,409
It was the essence of the sea.

1146
00:45:45,979 --> 00:45:48,708
I've never had abalones right out of the water.

1147
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:51,109
So it's quite a different taste.

1148
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:54,919
And it just has a very clean ocean flavor.

1149
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:59,188
I mean, seeing seafood so fresh...

1150
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,119
kind of gives me ideas to make something.

1151
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:07,158
Good job.

1152
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:09,328
How did you catch four octopuses?

1153
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:10,999
We got lucky.

1154
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,239
When we find a huge abalone once in a while...

1155
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:17,739
Sometimes, when I try to remove it,

1156
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,508
I accidentally poke it and kill it.

1157
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:21,938
It's such a waste.

1158
00:46:21,939 --> 00:46:25,548
I can take the dead ones myself.

1159
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,979
But not the alive ones.

1160
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:29,648
I thought you'd eat abalones and other delicious seafood...

1161
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:31,218
- every day.
- No way.

1162
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:32,618
People think we eat them...

1163
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:34,659
just because we catch them.

1164
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:37,359
We can't eat them. We must sell them and make money.

1165
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:40,528
We can't even eat any abalones that we foraged ourselves.

1166
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:41,598
- Really?
- Yes.

1167
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,068
- If we want...
- Because you need to sell them?

1168
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:44,298
- to eat...
- Yes.

1169
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:47,398
The live ones, we must buy them too.

1170
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:49,668
We forage them, give them to the shipowner,

1171
00:46:49,669 --> 00:46:51,409
and buy them back from the shipowner.

1172
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,239
That's the only way we can eat them.

1173
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,408
We were very honored that they were able to...

1174
00:46:58,409 --> 00:47:00,349
come out and show us what they do.

1175
00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:02,048
I felt a little guilty...

1176
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:04,349
because I felt like we should be diving with them.

1177
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:07,118
I kind of wanted to treat them to...

1178
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,159
what I do best, which is making food.

1179
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:14,058
Kyun will treat you to an amazing meal today.

1180
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:15,059
I think so too.

1181
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,128
You said you couldn't eat conchs and abalones...

1182
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:19,669
and such because you had to sell them.

1183
00:47:19,939 --> 00:47:23,739
Today, you'll get to eat them until you're full.

1184
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:25,069
Okay?

1185
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,738
Eat as much as you like today.

1186
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:30,409
(What kind of dinner will he prepare for the haenyeos?)

1187
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,548
(Guest Greeting Project 3 for the haenyeos)

1188
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:36,119
(What are you cooking today?)

1189
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,479
(Today's special dinner menu: Nurungji with this)

1190
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:42,189
(I was a bit surprised.)

1191
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:44,159
(I was a bit disappointed.)

1192
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,929
(Guys, don't worry.)

1193
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:47,459
(Question 1: Like this?)

1194
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,298
(Question 2: Are you okay?)

1195
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,999
(No, before that...)

1196
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:53,938
(The collaboration of seafood with the strong smell of the sea...)

1197
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:55,669
(and savory nurungji)

1198
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:58,869
(Chef Eddie's Great Cooking returns.)

1199
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:00,538
(Is that the one?)

1200
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:02,859
(He even adds an unidentified ingredient to the nurungji?)

1201
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,778
(He keeps making the Country Members doubt him.)

1202
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:05,779
(Are you ready?)

1203
00:48:06,379 --> 00:48:07,619
(What's the name of this dish?)

1204
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:09,348
(Even Madam Haenyeos are seeing this dish..)

1205
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:11,669
(for the 1st time in their 30 years of diving experience.)

1206
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:14,818
(Will they be enticed with the food?)

1207
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,058
(Guest Greeting Project 3, coming soon)

1208
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:19,029
(Nervous)

1209
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:20,876
Shall we have a gonggi match?

1210
00:48:21,146 --> 00:48:22,206
Let's do it.

1211
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:23,845
I'm good at this.

1212
00:48:23,846 --> 00:48:25,845
Let's slap the loser's wrist.

1213
00:48:25,846 --> 00:48:26,985
Are you really okay with that?

1214
00:48:26,986 --> 00:48:28,415
(Are you ready for the pain?)

1215
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:29,416
Sure.

1216
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:31,116
How many years? Ten years?

1217
00:48:31,556 --> 00:48:32,656
- Yes, ten years.
- Okay.

1218
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:34,085
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1219
00:48:34,086 --> 00:48:35,156
- Go on.
- Okay.

1220
00:48:35,356 --> 00:48:36,876
- We're playing for ten years.
- Okay.

1221
00:48:37,756 --> 00:48:39,325
One, two.

1222
00:48:39,326 --> 00:48:40,525
(It seems like she played it often.)

1223
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:41,626
You're so smooth.

1224
00:48:42,296 --> 00:48:43,465
(As soon as Jung Nam praises her...)

1225
00:48:43,466 --> 00:48:44,896
Oh, no! Okay.

1226
00:48:45,566 --> 00:48:46,766
You lost focus.

1227
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:48,805
(I am a self-proclaimed gonggi king, Bae Jung Nam.)

1228
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:49,836
Okay.

1229
00:48:50,306 --> 00:48:53,205
(I'll show you my skills.)

1230
00:48:53,206 --> 00:48:55,506
Okay. Level Two.

1231
00:48:56,346 --> 00:48:57,815
(Why is he so good at it?)

1232
00:48:57,816 --> 00:48:58,816
Level Three.

1233
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:00,145
(He is already at Level 3!)

1234
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,546
Level Three.

1235
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:03,316
Level Four now.

1236
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:05,555
(He even succeeds this!)

1237
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:07,232
- Why are you so good?
- I'm at Level Four.

1238
00:49:07,256 --> 00:49:08,826
Here I go.

1239
00:49:09,556 --> 00:49:10,596
Okay.

1240
00:49:10,896 --> 00:49:12,202
(He gets three on the back of his hand!)

1241
00:49:12,226 --> 00:49:13,765
If you drop any one of those...

1242
00:49:13,766 --> 00:49:14,966
Be quiet!

1243
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:16,735
Three years.

1244
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:17,995
- You...
- I'll do my best.

1245
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:18,996
Okay.

1246
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:20,806
One.

1247
00:49:21,466 --> 00:49:22,476
Two.

1248
00:49:22,736 --> 00:49:24,576
(Clearing her throat)

1249
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:27,576
(He doesn't budge even with Si A distracting him.)

1250
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:29,746
Level Four.

1251
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:31,067
(Jung Nam is already at Level 4.)

1252
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:35,222
- Seven years.
- Seven years?

1253
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:36,255
(Giggling)

1254
00:49:36,256 --> 00:49:38,356
Jung Nam, why are you suddenly so good at this game?

1255
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:40,825
I'm going to hit your wrist until it gets bruised.

1256
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:42,155
No, you're just hitting it once.

1257
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:44,055
- One hit.
- Yes, one. Just one hit.

1258
00:49:44,056 --> 00:49:46,126
- One strong swing.
- One strong swing, okay.

1259
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:47,825
- Don't whine about it later.
- I won't.

1260
00:49:47,826 --> 00:49:49,765
- Okay.
- We can't do that.

1261
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:51,606
- This is just a game.
- Okay, this is a game.

1262
00:49:53,036 --> 00:49:54,036
One.

1263
00:49:54,037 --> 00:49:56,036
- Goodness.
- Jung Nam.

1264
00:49:56,406 --> 00:49:57,435
Goodness.

1265
00:49:57,436 --> 00:49:59,376
(You're so annoying.)

1266
00:50:00,746 --> 00:50:02,346
(Jung Nam wins if he catches 3 or more.)

1267
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:03,852
(He gets 4 on the back of his hand.)

1268
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,846
(He really caught them all!)

1269
00:50:06,516 --> 00:50:08,446
(I'm doomed.)

1270
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:12,256
Wait.

1271
00:50:12,686 --> 00:50:14,355
Let me prepare myself.

1272
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:16,356
(Forget about preparing. Here comes a hard swing!)

1273
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:18,595
(How exciting.)

1274
00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:20,866
That was so fun playing a game with you.

1275
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:22,635
(It wasn't fun for me.)

1276
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:24,635
- Let's stop now.
- Seriously. Come back.

1277
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:26,035
- Let's play one more round.
- Okay.

1278
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:27,036
No!

1279
00:50:27,336 --> 00:50:29,275
- I got it!
- What?

1280
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,336
(Jung Nam wins again.)

1281
00:50:30,506 --> 00:50:31,535
It will leave a mark. My gosh!

1282
00:50:31,536 --> 00:50:32,706
(Another hard swing)

1283
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,946
- I'll hit softly.
- I'm done playing.

1284
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:36,716
I won't play gonggi anymore.

1285
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:41,215
- Good job.
- Good job.

1286
00:50:41,216 --> 00:50:42,216
Thank you.

1287
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:45,456
This is super heavy.

1288
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:48,825
They really gave us a lot.

1289
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:50,026
Are you okay? Let me carry it.

1290
00:50:50,796 --> 00:50:52,696
(And the abalones they bought themselves)

1291
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:56,496
(They came back with both hands full.)

1292
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:57,895
(They are feeling awkward.)

1293
00:50:57,896 --> 00:51:00,665
(The two are exhausted from the game and are in a daze.)

1294
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:03,235
They really gave us a lot.

1295
00:51:03,236 --> 00:51:04,236
(Wait.)

1296
00:51:05,176 --> 00:51:06,846
- Is it them?
- Wasn't that the car?

1297
00:51:06,946 --> 00:51:08,576
(Si A has been waiting.)

1298
00:51:09,106 --> 00:51:10,415
Yo Han, A Sung!

1299
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:12,075
- Are they here?
- They're here!

1300
00:51:12,076 --> 00:51:13,215
Yo Han, A Sung!

1301
00:51:13,216 --> 00:51:14,216
(Are they here?)

1302
00:51:14,217 --> 00:51:15,246
They're here!

1303
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:17,186
Where? They're not.

1304
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:19,255
They are. I saw them.

1305
00:51:19,256 --> 00:51:20,256
(I heard A Sung's voice!)

1306
00:51:23,856 --> 00:51:25,826
(Si A, what's wrong?)

1307
00:51:26,266 --> 00:51:28,396
(A Sung! What took you so long?)

1308
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:32,335
Hello.

1309
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:34,065
- I've been waiting for you.
- Hello, man.

1310
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:35,905
- That brat.
- Welcome back.

1311
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:37,175
You worked hard.

1312
00:51:37,176 --> 00:51:38,235
Hello.

1313
00:51:38,236 --> 00:51:40,446
You worked hard. It's nice to see you again.

1314
00:51:40,606 --> 00:51:42,075
- Hello.
- Hello.

1315
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:43,216
Nice to meet you.

1316
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:45,516
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1317
00:51:45,876 --> 00:51:47,045
You worked hard.

1318
00:51:47,046 --> 00:51:48,515
(Jung Nam approaches him in a friendly manner.)

1319
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:49,915
- We have food.
- You worked hard.

1320
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:51,056
- Goodness.
- Yes.

1321
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:53,025
- I...
- Take a rest.

1322
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,826
- You're going into this room?
- This...

1323
00:51:55,086 --> 00:51:56,295
I've been waiting here for six hours.

1324
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:57,395
Good to see you.

1325
00:51:57,396 --> 00:51:58,836
- How have you been?
- Hi, Jung Nam.

1326
00:51:58,926 --> 00:52:00,406
- I've waited for six hours.
- I see.

1327
00:52:00,896 --> 00:52:02,495
"It's Bae Jung Nam."

1328
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:05,396
"How did he come all the way to Yeosu?"

1329
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:07,805
He acted like he lived there...

1330
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:09,605
and said, "Welcome, A Sung."

1331
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:12,905
It made me wonder if he was the homeowner.

1332
00:52:12,906 --> 00:52:15,905
Thanks to him, I could approach him easily.

1333
00:52:15,906 --> 00:52:16,916
Hello.

1334
00:52:17,146 --> 00:52:18,626
- I've waited for six hours.
- I see.

1335
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:20,046
I was lonely.

1336
00:52:20,546 --> 00:52:23,956
Jung Nam is my old friend.

1337
00:52:24,286 --> 00:52:27,626
I thought he would get along with the girls well too.

1338
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:31,626
What I'm most worried about is his dialect.

1339
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:34,796
Will Eddie understand what he says?

1340
00:52:35,396 --> 00:52:37,956
I was quite curious about what kind of relationship they'd have.

1341
00:52:39,336 --> 00:52:42,836
(Eddie starts cleaning the precious abalones first.)

1342
00:52:43,806 --> 00:52:45,136
What is this, Yo Han?

1343
00:52:45,306 --> 00:52:47,905
- This is amazing.
- That's nice.

1344
00:52:47,906 --> 00:52:49,266
(The box is full of big abalones.)

1345
00:52:49,576 --> 00:52:50,675
I'm Jung Nam.

1346
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:52,615
Yes. Edward Lee. Nice to meet you.

1347
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:55,146
- Ed, I know.
- Nice to meet you.

1348
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:57,715
- This... What is this in Korean?
- Here.

1349
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,015
- "Jeonbok." - "Jeonbok."

1350
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:01,655
- We need to wash the abalones.
- Shall we?

1351
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:03,496
- Yes.
- I've washed abalones before.

1352
00:53:03,596 --> 00:53:04,596
- Me too.
- Abalones?

1353
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:06,866
- Me too.
- Let's do it.

1354
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:08,425
- Do you know how to clean?
- Sure.

1355
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:10,535
- Scrub it with this brush.
- Yes.

1356
00:53:10,536 --> 00:53:11,835
I've done it before.

1357
00:53:11,836 --> 00:53:12,935
- I'll do it, Chef.
- Like this.

1358
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:14,936
- You should go and cook ramyeon.
- Okay.

1359
00:53:15,636 --> 00:53:18,836
- Have you tried brushing it?
- So many times.

1360
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:20,345
(Brush?)

1361
00:53:20,346 --> 00:53:21,346
Where should I put it?

1362
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:23,916
I can use this brush.

1363
00:53:24,846 --> 00:53:26,045
It's so big.

1364
00:53:26,046 --> 00:53:28,086
(The size of the abalone never fails to shock him.)

1365
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:30,115
Shouldn't we let those two get some rest?

1366
00:53:30,116 --> 00:53:31,286
All you did was sleep.

1367
00:53:31,816 --> 00:53:34,425
Jung Nam, aren't you being too mean?

1368
00:53:34,426 --> 00:53:36,055
Those two must be exhausted.

1369
00:53:36,056 --> 00:53:37,295
A Sung, you should really rest.

1370
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:39,355
- Yes, go and rest.
- You too, Yo Han.

1371
00:53:39,356 --> 00:53:40,566
(What did he say?)

1372
00:53:41,726 --> 00:53:43,266
Go and rent...

1373
00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:44,842
They're abalones and conchs, right?

1374
00:53:44,866 --> 00:53:47,736
- Go and rent...
- Rest? Do you want to rest?

1375
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:49,106
You should rest too.

1376
00:53:49,206 --> 00:53:50,336
No, "rent."

1377
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:52,505
- Why?
- His pronunciation.

1378
00:53:52,506 --> 00:53:53,846
(What's wrong?)

1379
00:53:53,946 --> 00:53:54,946
His pronunciation.

1380
00:53:55,906 --> 00:53:57,215
- His...
- Oh, you heard "rent."

1381
00:53:57,216 --> 00:53:59,145
- Rent?
- You heard "rent."

1382
00:53:59,146 --> 00:54:01,145
- Rent? That was his dialect.
- I'm from Busan.

1383
00:54:01,146 --> 00:54:02,545
Okay. Busan.

1384
00:54:02,546 --> 00:54:04,016
You might not understand some words.

1385
00:54:04,086 --> 00:54:05,586
I'll speak in English.

1386
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:06,956
"Rent."

1387
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:09,755
Then I'll speak slowly.

1388
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:11,895
It's okay, I've had a lot of practice recently.

1389
00:54:11,896 --> 00:54:12,925
Speak slowly.

1390
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:13,965
I speak the Seoul language just fine.

1391
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:14,966
Okay.

1392
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,566
I'll speak slowly.

1393
00:54:18,096 --> 00:54:20,506
- Should I boil the water?
- Yes.

1394
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:22,236
(Laughing)

1395
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:26,606
I can tell he's speaking Korean, but he's...

1396
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:29,616
Maybe I can catch three words in a sentence.

1397
00:54:30,176 --> 00:54:32,645
And it makes me smile even though I don't understand...

1398
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:33,946
most of the jokes he's saying.

1399
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:37,956
Look at its size.

1400
00:54:38,356 --> 00:54:40,426
Natural abalones are amazing.

1401
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:41,855
Amazing.

1402
00:54:41,856 --> 00:54:42,856
(Practicing his dialect)

1403
00:54:43,896 --> 00:54:45,225
Haenyeos themselves...

1404
00:54:45,226 --> 00:54:47,926
Okay. Let's make some ramyeon.

1405
00:54:48,126 --> 00:54:49,126
Okay.

1406
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:51,036
I'm craving ramyeon.

1407
00:54:51,436 --> 00:54:54,436
You know, we get back from the boat and we're hungry.

1408
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:56,836
We should feed the new guest something.

1409
00:54:57,276 --> 00:54:58,876
There was toowoomba in the kitchen,

1410
00:54:59,206 --> 00:55:01,246
and I had a good recipe for it. So we made it.

1411
00:55:05,546 --> 00:55:07,145
(Snack of the 2nd day in Yeosu)

1412
00:55:07,146 --> 00:55:08,866
(Revealing Eddie's special ramyeon recipe!)

1413
00:55:09,146 --> 00:55:12,356
- Let's make ramyeon.
- Chef, how many packs?

1414
00:55:13,286 --> 00:55:16,156
- Three? Two?
- Yes, maybe three.

1415
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,495
The ramyeon was just an appetizer.

1416
00:55:18,496 --> 00:55:20,816
(Today's special snack, ramyeon, to make them less hungry)

1417
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,966
(I can't believe I get to eat Chef Edward's ramyeon!)

1418
00:55:24,766 --> 00:55:27,506
(Starting with cutting an avocado!)

1419
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:30,035
You can.

1420
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:31,436
(I need to remove the seed.)

1421
00:55:31,706 --> 00:55:32,706
I can use this.

1422
00:55:33,046 --> 00:55:35,275
- Isn't this how you do it?
- Yes.

1423
00:55:35,276 --> 00:55:36,676
(Like this?)

1424
00:55:38,076 --> 00:55:39,376
(Isn't this how you do it?)

1425
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:41,086
(Should I try hitting it like this?)

1426
00:55:42,146 --> 00:55:43,266
Those two must be exhausted.

1427
00:55:43,516 --> 00:55:45,155
A Sung, you should really rest.

1428
00:55:45,156 --> 00:55:46,655
- Or is it this way?
- No.

1429
00:55:46,656 --> 00:55:48,126
I shouldn't have done it.

1430
00:55:48,886 --> 00:55:50,525
I'll help him with it then.

1431
00:55:50,526 --> 00:55:52,656
He split it.

1432
00:55:52,996 --> 00:55:53,996
I mean...

1433
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:55,357
(Yo Han butchered up the avocado.)

1434
00:55:55,466 --> 00:55:57,866
- I'm sorry.
- You killed the seed.

1435
00:55:58,236 --> 00:55:59,435
I couldn't control my strength.

1436
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:00,436
(I'm so sorry...)

1437
00:56:00,806 --> 00:56:02,336
I'm sorry. What should I do?

1438
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:04,075
- It's okay.
- Chef, I...

1439
00:56:04,076 --> 00:56:06,175
- What should I do?
- Dig it up.

1440
00:56:06,176 --> 00:56:07,805
- Use your strength.
- Dig it all the way up.

1441
00:56:07,806 --> 00:56:08,806
There you go.

1442
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:10,615
Is this it?

1443
00:56:10,616 --> 00:56:12,192
- Then pass it to me.
- Yes. That's right.

1444
00:56:12,216 --> 00:56:13,715
You're good. Dig it.

1445
00:56:13,716 --> 00:56:15,676
(After complimenting him, he assigns him a task.)

1446
00:56:15,786 --> 00:56:16,816
That's how you do it.

1447
00:56:17,486 --> 00:56:20,056
- It's so big.
- You should do the last one.

1448
00:56:20,156 --> 00:56:21,185
No, you do it.

1449
00:56:21,186 --> 00:56:22,186
(It's not happening.)

1450
00:56:23,526 --> 00:56:26,326
You're doing great right now.

1451
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:28,996
(These two are hilarious.)

1452
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:32,466
(While they're arguing over the abalones, )

1453
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:35,605
(toowoomba ramyeon is smooth sailing...)

1454
00:56:35,606 --> 00:56:38,236
(with Assistant Chef Si A.)

1455
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:40,645
(To add to the texture, they add an avocado, )

1456
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,105
(white kimchi, )

1457
00:56:42,106 --> 00:56:45,116
(and an apple.)

1458
00:56:45,676 --> 00:56:47,715
(Put well-cut ingredients to one side.)

1459
00:56:47,716 --> 00:56:48,986
This looks so nice.

1460
00:56:49,346 --> 00:56:52,155
An avocado, an apple, and white kimchi.

1461
00:56:52,156 --> 00:56:53,796
(Mix them well so they become delicious.)

1462
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:55,156
What about pollack roe?

1463
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:56,495
Yes, pollack roe.

1464
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,496
Should I take it out?

1465
00:56:57,556 --> 00:56:59,476
- Yes, I think... Yes.
- I'll peel it off, then.

1466
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,325
You're just going to use the roe, right?

1467
00:57:01,326 --> 00:57:03,465
- Yes, just the roe.
- I'll cut it in half.

1468
00:57:03,466 --> 00:57:04,466
Okay.

1469
00:57:04,536 --> 00:57:06,536
(Eddie boils noodles.)

1470
00:57:06,866 --> 00:57:08,565
Let's eat ramyeon.

1471
00:57:08,566 --> 00:57:10,852
(You must let it get in contact with cold air for chewy texture!)

1472
00:57:10,876 --> 00:57:12,406
Chef, is this big enough?

1473
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:13,946
Yes, I think that's perfect.

1474
00:57:16,206 --> 00:57:19,576
(Mix the liquefied sauce with the powdered soup base.)

1475
00:57:21,216 --> 00:57:24,486
(It is boiling and turning into thick sauce.)

1476
00:57:25,256 --> 00:57:27,926
(Tasting the sauce)

1477
00:57:29,256 --> 00:57:30,256
(Humming)

1478
00:57:30,257 --> 00:57:31,556
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1479
00:57:32,026 --> 00:57:33,026
My goodness.

1480
00:57:33,596 --> 00:57:34,666
It's spicy.

1481
00:57:34,896 --> 00:57:35,976
It's going to be delicious.

1482
00:57:36,396 --> 00:57:38,466
We can maybe put a little bit of butter?

1483
00:57:38,796 --> 00:57:39,805
Butter?

1484
00:57:39,806 --> 00:57:42,005
Gosh, butter is going into ramyeon?

1485
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:44,006
Not yet, but it will soon.

1486
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:46,746
(My mouth is watering already.)

1487
00:57:46,806 --> 00:57:48,706
I hope you like my toowoomba ramyeon.

1488
00:57:48,946 --> 00:57:50,216
It looks good.

1489
00:57:50,576 --> 00:57:51,576
It's an honor.

1490
00:57:51,577 --> 00:57:52,645
(Horror?)

1491
00:57:52,646 --> 00:57:54,515
- It's nothing. It's okay.
- It's an honor.

1492
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:55,516
(Saying whatever)

1493
00:57:55,846 --> 00:57:57,255
(They may face a problem with communication.)

1494
00:57:57,256 --> 00:57:58,256
Goodness.

1495
00:57:59,356 --> 00:58:00,356
I'll add it.

1496
00:58:02,486 --> 00:58:06,395
(A slice of butter to make it creamier!)

1497
00:58:06,396 --> 00:58:08,466
(He cannot take his eyes off it.)

1498
00:58:09,026 --> 00:58:11,935
Are they selling this to the public now?

1499
00:58:11,936 --> 00:58:13,306
- Yes.
- This is so good.

1500
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:15,236
Toowoomba.

1501
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:17,306
Is this right?

1502
00:58:18,636 --> 00:58:20,846
Did you add butter in it?

1503
00:58:21,776 --> 00:58:25,016
(Very thick and savory)

1504
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:27,346
- My gosh.
- Yes.

1505
00:58:27,786 --> 00:58:29,245
(He cannot take his eyes off again.)

1506
00:58:29,246 --> 00:58:30,955
(He divides them into equal shares.)

1507
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:32,786
(He cannot take his eyes off again.)

1508
00:58:34,256 --> 00:58:36,395
Yes. Put that on top.

1509
00:58:36,396 --> 00:58:38,396
(Once you add the garnish as you like, it's done!)

1510
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,596
This is amazing.

1511
00:58:40,126 --> 00:58:41,626
Okay.

1512
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:45,266
Okay, ramyeon is here.

1513
00:58:46,066 --> 00:58:47,335
Thank you.

1514
00:58:47,336 --> 00:58:48,696
- It looks delicious.
- Let's eat.

1515
00:58:50,636 --> 00:58:52,596
- Thank you for the food.
- Let's eat. Thank you.

1516
00:58:53,506 --> 00:58:55,146
- Let's see.
- I'll mix them all.

1517
00:58:55,306 --> 00:58:56,592
- Here.
- Thank you for the ramyeon.

1518
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,776
- You're welcome.
- It looks so good.

1519
00:58:59,016 --> 00:59:00,046
It looks delicious.

1520
00:59:01,716 --> 00:59:03,385
(Eat it with garnish!)

1521
00:59:03,386 --> 00:59:04,586
- Should I mix it?
- Yes.

1522
00:59:05,856 --> 00:59:07,576
I've never tried anything like this before.

1523
00:59:07,726 --> 00:59:09,155
You added butter in it too, right?

1524
00:59:09,156 --> 00:59:10,156
- Yes.
- Yes.

1525
00:59:10,157 --> 00:59:11,655
It's so nice.

1526
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:13,495
It's so chewy.

1527
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:14,496
I'm about to cry.

1528
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:16,326
It's so good.

1529
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:17,666
This will work wonderfully to remove your hangover.

1530
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:20,236
It's not overly spicy, and it's so creamy. It's great.

1531
00:59:20,536 --> 00:59:22,005
- How is it? Good? Do you like it?
- Yes.

1532
00:59:22,006 --> 00:59:23,366
It's not too spicy. It's so tasty.

1533
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:26,206
(Let me try it quickly!)

1534
00:59:27,006 --> 00:59:29,046
(Amazed)

1535
00:59:29,476 --> 00:59:31,676
It has multiple flavors.

1536
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:35,785
The creamy flavor is different, right?

1537
00:59:35,786 --> 00:59:37,315
- I agree.
- Makes a different flavor.

1538
00:59:37,316 --> 00:59:39,686
- Yes.
- The tastes are perfectly balanced.

1539
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:41,325
And the sauce is so thick. I love it.

1540
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:42,925
(The perfect ratio of creaminess and spiciness)

1541
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:43,926
It's so nice.

1542
00:59:44,256 --> 00:59:47,366
The noodles are so chewy.

1543
00:59:48,496 --> 00:59:50,365
- The noodles are so chewy.
- Noodles.

1544
00:59:50,366 --> 00:59:51,566
(Picking up his accent)

1545
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:54,206
The toowoomba ramyeon was good.

1546
00:59:54,406 --> 00:59:56,406
I don't like my food too cheesy, but it wasn't.

1547
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,935
It was a bit spicy and nice.

1548
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:00,876
(The guest is 100 percent satisfied.)

1549
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:03,846
It's delicious.

1550
01:00:04,946 --> 01:00:07,145
- Is there kimchi in it?
- You're right.

1551
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:08,786
That's the crunchy bit.

1552
01:00:08,986 --> 01:00:10,655
The avocado is so soft too.

1553
01:00:10,656 --> 01:00:11,736
It goes well with the dish.

1554
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,626
The perilla leaves add a kick to it.

1555
01:00:15,586 --> 01:00:16,756
I love the creaminess.

1556
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:18,156
It's so good.

1557
01:00:18,496 --> 01:00:20,025
This will work wonderfully to remove your hangover.

1558
01:00:20,026 --> 01:00:22,165
I've never seen a taste like this. I've never tasted such a thing.

1559
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,142
- "Seen a taste?" - I've never tasted such a thing.

1560
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,166
Speak slowly.

1561
01:00:25,466 --> 01:00:29,666
First time.

1562
01:00:30,106 --> 01:00:32,006
It's my first time feeling this.

1563
01:00:32,436 --> 01:00:35,576
Not in English. Speak Korean, but slowly.

1564
01:00:35,676 --> 01:00:37,756
I've never seen... Never tasted such a thing before.

1565
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:40,086
(Let's study Korean together.)

1566
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:42,986
We are old friends.

1567
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:44,356
Really? Okay.

1568
01:00:44,716 --> 01:00:48,155
How should I address you?

1569
01:00:48,156 --> 01:00:50,225
- However you like.
- However I like?

1570
01:00:50,226 --> 01:00:51,226
Bro Kyun.

1571
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:52,602
- Just call him Kyun.
- I'll call you Bro Kyun.

1572
01:00:52,626 --> 01:00:54,166
- What's "haengnim?" - No, just...

1573
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:55,665
- "Older brother" in Busan dialect.
- "Older brother."

1574
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:57,035
- It's a Busan dialect.
- A dialect of "hyungnim."

1575
01:00:57,036 --> 01:00:58,765
- Okay, sure.
- Bro Kyun.

1576
01:00:58,766 --> 01:00:59,796
- Yes.
- Okay.

1577
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:01,805
Jung Nam waited a long time for you.

1578
01:01:01,806 --> 01:01:02,806
I know.

1579
01:01:02,807 --> 01:01:04,776
I'm not here for Yo Han.

1580
01:01:05,636 --> 01:01:07,245
- I came here for you.
- Thank you.

1581
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,375
(I'm here just for you, Bro Kyun!)

1582
01:01:08,376 --> 01:01:09,805
- I mean it.
- Thank you.

1583
01:01:09,806 --> 01:01:11,715
If it was just Yo Han here, I wouldn't have come.

1584
01:01:11,716 --> 01:01:12,815
I'm serious.

1585
01:01:12,816 --> 01:01:15,245
- It was too far.
- All the way to Yeosu.

1586
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:17,315
I've been waiting for six hours.

1587
01:01:17,316 --> 01:01:19,232
(Using a lot of body language in case he doesn't understand)

1588
01:01:19,256 --> 01:01:22,226
And you treat me with such good food as soon as you arrive.

1589
01:01:22,326 --> 01:01:24,596
I cleared up the whole bowl.

1590
01:01:24,696 --> 01:01:25,855
- Thank you.
- It was so delicious.

1591
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:28,176
(As the snack time finishes, one man smiles mysteriously.)

1592
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,996
(Actually, Yo Han...)

1593
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:34,306
(wanted to feed the Country members and Jung Nam a certain dish.)

1594
01:01:35,336 --> 01:01:37,036
There was this dish that I really enjoyed.

1595
01:01:37,136 --> 01:01:39,336
That was my first time eating it.

1596
01:01:39,636 --> 01:01:40,905
I had skate.

1597
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,346
(Skate?)

1598
01:01:43,976 --> 01:01:46,176
(Peekaboo)

1599
01:01:47,146 --> 01:01:49,515
(Yo Han's secret menu, skate)

1600
01:01:49,516 --> 01:01:52,756
I had it for the first time when I filmed "The Book of Fish."

1601
01:01:53,256 --> 01:01:56,056
I really loved it. It was so addictive.

1602
01:01:58,926 --> 01:02:02,225
Some eat it with sesame oil sauce.

1603
01:02:02,226 --> 01:02:03,835
It left a big impression on me.

1604
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:05,516
(Skate is one of Yo Han's favorite foods.)

1605
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:10,305
Kyun is interested in fermented foods.

1606
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:12,075
So, I want him to have the strongest ones,

1607
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:13,846
the skate and skate liver.

1608
01:02:14,346 --> 01:02:15,845
I want to introduce those to him.

1609
01:02:15,846 --> 01:02:17,052
(How will Eddie react after tasting skate?)

1610
01:02:17,076 --> 01:02:18,275
(The skate moving operation was planned meticulously...)

1611
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,516
(even before the trip began.)

1612
01:02:20,346 --> 01:02:22,362
(The Country members and Jung Nam are on the way without any idea.)

1613
01:02:22,386 --> 01:02:23,986
Kyun, have you tried skate before?

1614
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:27,286
(Why does he mention the skate all of a sudden?)

1615
01:02:28,326 --> 01:02:29,955
- I've tried it.
- Really?

1616
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:31,455
- Yes. Once.
- How was it?

1617
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,126
(Sounding him out)

1618
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:34,466
It was too strong.

1619
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:36,996
- Did it feel too strong?
- Yes. When I had it.

1620
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:40,766
That was maybe 20 years ago.

1621
01:02:41,366 --> 01:02:42,905
Your appetite might have changed.

1622
01:02:42,906 --> 01:02:44,306
- In that case...
- Yes. We'll see.

1623
01:02:45,436 --> 01:02:47,376
(He has a bad feeling.)

1624
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:50,015
- So, is there something...
- Yes.

1625
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,345
In Korean food...

1626
01:02:52,346 --> 01:02:54,046
- Right.
- that you don't eat?

1627
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:55,586
- Me?
- Yes.

1628
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:56,586
Skate.

1629
01:02:57,456 --> 01:02:58,555
(After realizing the plan with skate, he blocks it out.)

1630
01:02:58,556 --> 01:03:00,685
- Me too.
- Seriously. It's skate.

1631
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:02,685
The thing I've never tried is skate.

1632
01:03:02,686 --> 01:03:04,396
- I've never tried it before.
- Okay.

1633
01:03:05,726 --> 01:03:08,326
Is Yo Han the only one who likes it?

1634
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:09,746
Since when did you like it?

1635
01:03:09,796 --> 01:03:12,665
I've grown to love it. I keep thinking of it.

1636
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:15,506
- You get addicted to it.
- I see.

1637
01:03:17,806 --> 01:03:21,676
(There was a man who fell in love with skate.)

1638
01:03:21,846 --> 01:03:25,016
When I have low energy or when I need to relieve stress,

1639
01:03:25,476 --> 01:03:26,886
I have skates.

1640
01:03:27,086 --> 01:03:28,685
After a while, it doesn't stink.

1641
01:03:28,686 --> 01:03:30,755
It's just tasty.

1642
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:32,185
(Skate, is it okay for me to love you?)

1643
01:03:32,186 --> 01:03:33,256
I recommend skate.

1644
01:03:33,486 --> 01:03:35,926
He's out of his mind.

1645
01:03:36,486 --> 01:03:38,202
We should go to a place where everyone would love.

1646
01:03:38,226 --> 01:03:40,896
Many can't eat it. He's the only one who can eat it.

1647
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:43,006
Yo Han, do you know the place we're going?

1648
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:44,666
I know the place.

1649
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:46,666
I couldn't have skate before.

1650
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:51,075
Through Kim Eui Sung, I got to have it with other actors.

1651
01:03:51,076 --> 01:03:52,636
Since then, I've become addicted to it.

1652
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:55,705
Gosh. I can be addicted to it today because of him.

1653
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:56,776
- That's right.
- Gosh.

1654
01:03:57,116 --> 01:04:00,916
In the past, there was no refrigerator.

1655
01:04:01,286 --> 01:04:02,785
- That's right.
- So,

1656
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:04,866
they wondered how they could eat it for a long time.

1657
01:04:05,116 --> 01:04:07,226
They tried the fermented one.

1658
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,356
They realized it became tastier and more nutritional.

1659
01:04:10,696 --> 01:04:13,626
Fermented skate was created for convenience.

1660
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:15,996
Gosh. He sounds like an expert.

1661
01:04:16,096 --> 01:04:17,796
He knows about it very well.

1662
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,166
In fact, I'm addicted to it.

1663
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:25,405
I eat it well and often.

1664
01:04:25,406 --> 01:04:27,945
People who like it go crazy about it.

1665
01:04:27,946 --> 01:04:28,946
I know.

1666
01:04:28,947 --> 01:04:30,915
Like Pyongyang naengmyeon,

1667
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:32,846
once you get used to it, you get addicted to it.

1668
01:04:32,946 --> 01:04:35,246
Yes. It's something like that. You get addicted to it.

1669
01:04:36,246 --> 01:04:38,856
(Skate might be all right.)

1670
01:04:39,286 --> 01:04:40,286
It tastes good.

1671
01:04:41,126 --> 01:04:42,186
I recommend it.

1672
01:04:43,356 --> 01:04:45,126
(Is there something else to talk about?)

1673
01:04:45,456 --> 01:04:47,165
I used to live in New York.

1674
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,195
- Really?
- Yes.

1675
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:49,196
When?

1676
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:51,266
From 2010 to 2011.

1677
01:04:51,366 --> 01:04:53,406
- I went to school.
- I see. Which one?

1678
01:04:54,136 --> 01:04:56,305
- NYU. New York University.
- I went there too.

1679
01:04:56,306 --> 01:04:58,406
- What? You're an alumnus.
- Gosh.

1680
01:04:58,976 --> 01:05:01,076
I went to the language school.

1681
01:05:01,676 --> 01:05:04,416
What was love in New York like?

1682
01:05:04,846 --> 01:05:07,316
I had a crush on a foreign lady.

1683
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:09,216
Because I couldn't speak English,

1684
01:05:09,316 --> 01:05:12,316
my friend told me to tell her, "You-roo-koo style."

1685
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:13,655
"You-roo-koo style?"

1686
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:17,456
- You-look-good style.
- You-look-good style.

1687
01:05:18,256 --> 01:05:20,765
- Then she said...
- "You look good."

1688
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:22,766
I thought you were speaking in Busan dialect.

1689
01:05:23,366 --> 01:05:24,995
- You-look-good style.
- You-look-good style.

1690
01:05:24,996 --> 01:05:26,036
This was what she said.

1691
01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:28,766
I said, "Your phone number?" and she said, "Okay."

1692
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:30,336
- Gosh.
- She was very cool.

1693
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:34,276
So we met a couple of times.

1694
01:05:34,946 --> 01:05:37,475
One day, she went outside while we were eating together...

1695
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:39,076
and fought with someone on the phone.

1696
01:05:39,676 --> 01:05:41,116
I went outside.

1697
01:05:42,116 --> 01:05:44,315
She was fighting, and I thought, "What's going on?"

1698
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:46,476
- You had a bad hunch.
- I had a bad feeling about it.

1699
01:05:46,616 --> 01:05:47,625
So...

1700
01:05:47,626 --> 01:05:49,666
- She had a boyfriend.
- It was her boyfriend. Yes.

1701
01:05:51,226 --> 01:05:53,126
(No way.)

1702
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:58,195
Gosh. She had a girlfriend.

1703
01:05:58,196 --> 01:05:59,465
(A shocking twist to the story)

1704
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:00,466
Goodness.

1705
01:06:00,467 --> 01:06:01,865
Did she have a girlfriend?

1706
01:06:01,866 --> 01:06:03,675
- Yes.
- Goodness.

1707
01:06:03,676 --> 01:06:05,205
(A Sung's surprised.)

1708
01:06:05,206 --> 01:06:06,775
Gosh.

1709
01:06:06,776 --> 01:06:07,776
Eddie and I were...

1710
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:10,776
I mean, she was going to be a loyal friend until the end.

1711
01:06:11,616 --> 01:06:13,096
- A loyal friend.
- As a best friend.

1712
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:14,845
Something like, "Hey."

1713
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,086
- Just as a friend.
- Yes.

1714
01:06:16,246 --> 01:06:18,156
- Did you kiss her?
- I didn't get to.

1715
01:06:19,156 --> 01:06:21,926
When I like someone so badly, I can't even hold her hand.

1716
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:23,156
- Really?
- Yes.

1717
01:06:23,157 --> 01:06:24,526
- He's very pure.
- I'm shy.

1718
01:06:24,826 --> 01:06:26,196
- He's very shy.
- That's right.

1719
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:28,726
American women don't prefer such a guy.

1720
01:06:28,826 --> 01:06:29,965
- They don't, right?
- They don't.

1721
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:31,812
- You have to be...
- I need to approach them actively.

1722
01:06:31,836 --> 01:06:32,836
"Come here."

1723
01:06:32,836 --> 01:06:33,836
(Feisty Eddie)

1724
01:06:33,836 --> 01:06:34,836
"My love."

1725
01:06:36,336 --> 01:06:38,016
(The Korean girls are responding crazily.)

1726
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:40,406
On the second day, can you kiss her?

1727
01:06:40,906 --> 01:06:42,946
- You have to look into her eyes.
- Yes.

1728
01:06:43,716 --> 01:06:46,676
I learn a lot from you. Goodness.

1729
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:48,046
(While talking and laughing...)

1730
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,886
- Gosh. We're here.
- I see.

1731
01:06:51,756 --> 01:06:52,756
We're here.

1732
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:55,755
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1733
01:06:55,756 --> 01:06:57,856
- Gosh.
- Thank you so much.

1734
01:06:59,456 --> 01:07:00,496
Gosh. It's strong.

1735
01:07:01,266 --> 01:07:02,596
Gosh. I can smell it.

1736
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:04,286
I can smell skate right away.

1737
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,966
- I can smell it right away.
- Really?

1738
01:07:07,966 --> 01:07:09,465
It feels like going into an old restroom...

1739
01:07:09,466 --> 01:07:10,976
in the countryside.

1740
01:07:11,336 --> 01:07:12,616
I thought it'd be really strong.

1741
01:07:13,546 --> 01:07:15,076
I was scared from that moment.

1742
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:18,476
"Okay. I don't click with this one."

1743
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,116
That was what I thought.

1744
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:22,386
- Hey. The smell is strong.
- Yes.

1745
01:07:22,586 --> 01:07:24,385
The smell is crazy. Do we go in?

1746
01:07:24,386 --> 01:07:25,386
- Yes.
- Is it here?

1747
01:07:26,056 --> 01:07:28,326
(Welcome. Is it your first time having Yeosu's skate?)

1748
01:07:29,026 --> 01:07:31,896
(It's filled with people who are enjoying the skate.)

1749
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:38,196
(Various dishes made with Korean skates)

1750
01:07:40,336 --> 01:07:43,606
(The highlight of it is skate samhap with suyuk and aged kimchi.)

1751
01:07:44,406 --> 01:07:47,876
(This place will break the prejudice against skate at once.)

1752
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:52,276
(Will Yo Han's plan to get them hooked on skate work?)

1753
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:53,616
Let's go.

1754
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:56,485
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1755
01:07:56,486 --> 01:07:58,316
This way. How many people are you?

1756
01:07:58,416 --> 01:07:59,485
- We're 5.
- We're 5 people.

1757
01:07:59,486 --> 01:08:00,886
Okay. Come this way.

1758
01:08:00,986 --> 01:08:02,185
Take a seat. I'll sit here.

1759
01:08:02,186 --> 01:08:03,726
- Okay. I'll sit here.
- Take a seat.

1760
01:08:06,496 --> 01:08:07,496
What are you having?

1761
01:08:08,266 --> 01:08:09,465
We'll have the skate samhap.

1762
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:10,866
- Do you have a skate liver?
- Yes.

1763
01:08:12,696 --> 01:08:13,705
(So this place is famous for its skate?)

1764
01:08:13,706 --> 01:08:15,806
(Looking around)

1765
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:18,405
(A Sung studies the area too.)

1766
01:08:18,406 --> 01:08:19,606
Do you want the skate samhap?

1767
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,346
What is this?

1768
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,185
- Gosh.
- They are our basic side dishes.

1769
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,185
(With the basic setting of Yeosu's restaurant, )

1770
01:08:29,186 --> 01:08:31,186
(the place gets the start on them.)

1771
01:08:31,516 --> 01:08:32,655
(The table is filled in no time.)

1772
01:08:32,656 --> 01:08:34,656
Gosh. This is Jeolla Province we're talking about.

1773
01:08:34,786 --> 01:08:37,026
The table is full even before the main dish is here.

1774
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:38,656
I know. Seriously.

1775
01:08:39,556 --> 01:08:41,425
- Gosh. Is that maesaengi?
- Yes. It's maesaengi soup.

1776
01:08:41,426 --> 01:08:42,695
(They even serve maesaengi soup.)

1777
01:08:42,696 --> 01:08:44,196
Thank you.

1778
01:08:44,796 --> 01:08:46,866
- What is this?
- Maesaengi.

1779
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:48,506
- It's...
- It's seaweed.

1780
01:08:49,006 --> 01:08:50,876
- Maesaengi is...
- I've never seen it before.

1781
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,006
It's similar to sea mustard.

1782
01:08:54,146 --> 01:08:55,146
I'll have it.

1783
01:08:55,147 --> 01:08:57,547
(Tasting the first maesaengi soup of his lifetime carefully)

1784
01:08:57,576 --> 01:08:58,576
How is it?

1785
01:08:59,976 --> 01:09:00,986
Mugwort?

1786
01:09:02,046 --> 01:09:05,555
- Soup?
- It tastes a bit like mugworts.

1787
01:09:05,556 --> 01:09:08,125
- Really?
- It has a bitter taste, right?

1788
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:09,986
- It's bitter and... Yes.
- That's right.

1789
01:09:10,726 --> 01:09:12,096
It can be a bit bland.

1790
01:09:13,726 --> 01:09:14,726
I love it.

1791
01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:17,136
(I think I like the maesaengi soup.)

1792
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:19,396
- What's that?
- It's sole.

1793
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:21,706
- Sole?
- Yes. It's sole.

1794
01:09:22,536 --> 01:09:23,536
Do I dip it in the sauce...

1795
01:09:23,537 --> 01:09:25,057
- No. Eat it as is.
- or eat it as is?

1796
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:29,046
Thank you.

1797
01:09:29,576 --> 01:09:31,545
- I've never had it before.
- Really?

1798
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:33,666
(Jung Nam is having grilled sole for the first time.)

1799
01:09:38,816 --> 01:09:40,826
- Gosh. It's really good.
- It's good, isn't it?

1800
01:09:44,356 --> 01:09:46,856
(They shuck the fresh oyster right away too.)

1801
01:09:47,366 --> 01:09:49,726
- It's from you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1802
01:09:50,866 --> 01:09:53,636
Gosh. The oyster is huge.

1803
01:09:57,136 --> 01:09:58,136
It's crazy.

1804
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:01,505
The oyster tastes so good.

1805
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:03,352
(The oysters, which are in season, are a delicacy they can't miss.)

1806
01:10:03,376 --> 01:10:06,475
Because we're in Yeosu, the seafood tastes so good.

1807
01:10:06,476 --> 01:10:07,845
- They are so fresh.
- Yes.

1808
01:10:07,846 --> 01:10:09,562
(The basic side dishes stimulate their palates.)

1809
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:10,586
What is this?

1810
01:10:10,986 --> 01:10:12,032
- Persimmons.
- Persimmons.

1811
01:10:12,056 --> 01:10:13,802
- Why persimmons all of a sudden?
- Persimmons.

1812
01:10:13,826 --> 01:10:14,926
Are they for desserts?

1813
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:17,455
No. They're there because you'll have skate.

1814
01:10:17,456 --> 01:10:20,056
- It'll be refreshing.
- It's to clean our palate.

1815
01:10:21,396 --> 01:10:24,335
- Korean foods are so smart.
- Yes. That's right.

1816
01:10:24,336 --> 01:10:27,506
You have this and this. I never thought to eat persimmons...

1817
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:29,206
- That's right.
- with fish.

1818
01:10:29,506 --> 01:10:30,635
They told us to eat sweet potatoes...

1819
01:10:30,636 --> 01:10:32,356
when your mouth gets dry from eating skate.

1820
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:33,876
Have it with the skate.

1821
01:10:34,346 --> 01:10:35,676
It's a great combination.

1822
01:10:35,976 --> 01:10:37,345
This is our signature.

1823
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:39,106
- It's the most delicious dish.
- Thank you.

1824
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:41,346
(Laughing)

1825
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:42,946
Here.

1826
01:10:43,146 --> 01:10:47,155
(Today's main dish, skate samhap, is here.)

1827
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:49,156
- Should we get bossam too?
- Yes.

1828
01:10:50,186 --> 01:10:53,226
(Skate's unique pungent smell and chewiness)

1829
01:10:54,066 --> 01:10:56,726
(Tender pork)

1830
01:10:57,766 --> 01:10:59,796
(Aged kimchi that adds a crunchy texture)

1831
01:11:01,206 --> 01:11:03,105
(The three come together to create a rich flavor.)

1832
01:11:03,106 --> 01:11:04,775
You wrap it with bossam and kimchi.

1833
01:11:04,776 --> 01:11:06,016
- Aged kimchi.
- That's samhap.

1834
01:11:08,146 --> 01:11:10,346
(I've been waiting for today.)

1835
01:11:11,046 --> 01:11:12,992
(Yo Han, who's crazy about skate, tries it first.)

1836
01:11:13,016 --> 01:11:15,146
I'll have it without relying on other stuff.

1837
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:18,256
(After dipping it in chogochujang, he puts it straight into his mouth.)

1838
01:11:18,716 --> 01:11:20,216
(It's just amazing to see.)

1839
01:11:21,256 --> 01:11:22,256
It's crazy.

1840
01:11:22,856 --> 01:11:24,176
- It's strong.
- Can you feel it?

1841
01:11:25,256 --> 01:11:27,055
I'll try it.

1842
01:11:27,056 --> 01:11:28,795
(This time, A Sung tries it.)

1843
01:11:28,796 --> 01:11:29,796
Skate?

1844
01:11:31,196 --> 01:11:32,596
- How is it?
- Really?

1845
01:11:32,936 --> 01:11:34,006
I'm so curious.

1846
01:11:36,136 --> 01:11:37,456
You don't have to worry about it.

1847
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,875
(A Sung's wild reaction makes Eddie laugh.)

1848
01:11:39,876 --> 01:11:42,176
- How do I eat it?
- I'm not going to have it.

1849
01:11:43,006 --> 01:11:44,452
- I'll try it too.
- Are you trying it?

1850
01:11:44,476 --> 01:11:46,046
- Yes.
- Try it.

1851
01:11:46,776 --> 01:11:48,486
- It's pungent.
- Skate.

1852
01:11:51,616 --> 01:11:52,616
Is it okay?

1853
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:54,455
(A strong first encounter between Foodie Si A and skate)

1854
01:11:54,456 --> 01:11:56,486
It's very strong and pungent.

1855
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:01,896
(Even when eaten as samhap, skate has a great presence.)

1856
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:05,236
(Eddie, who has been watching, starts to make samhap too.)

1857
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,606
Make it so it gives you less damage.

1858
01:12:08,106 --> 01:12:09,366
I put double pork.

1859
01:12:10,606 --> 01:12:11,606
That's a good idea.

1860
01:12:13,606 --> 01:12:15,175
I'm putting garlic in there too.

1861
01:12:15,176 --> 01:12:16,682
(After putting garlic, Eddie's samhap is ready.)

1862
01:12:16,706 --> 01:12:18,746
(He wanted to know how Eddie would react the most.)

1863
01:12:19,316 --> 01:12:21,546
(Taking a big bite)

1864
01:12:22,146 --> 01:12:23,885
It feels like my sinus is cleared up.

1865
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,585
(He chews it firmly for now.)

1866
01:12:25,586 --> 01:12:27,956
- It's all right.
- Your Adam's apple is opening up.

1867
01:12:29,056 --> 01:12:30,056
Why are you staring at me?

1868
01:12:30,057 --> 01:12:31,896
(Is Eddie handling it better than expected?)

1869
01:12:33,096 --> 01:12:35,826
- Is it all right?
- Unlike the imported skate...

1870
01:12:35,926 --> 01:12:38,296
- How was it?
- This isn't too pungent.

1871
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:40,266
He is eating the sweet potato.

1872
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:42,005
(Reduce the skate's smell in the mouth!)

1873
01:12:42,006 --> 01:12:43,006
(Sweet potato)

1874
01:12:44,836 --> 01:12:46,535
He ate three sweet potatoes.

1875
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:47,745
(He adds persimmons this time.)

1876
01:12:47,746 --> 01:12:48,746
He eats two persimmons.

1877
01:12:49,806 --> 01:12:51,676
(What's that?)

1878
01:12:53,116 --> 01:12:54,196
He eats maesaengi soup too.

1879
01:12:54,686 --> 01:12:56,045
It's different from skate,

1880
01:12:56,046 --> 01:12:57,255
though it looks the same.

1881
01:12:57,256 --> 01:12:58,355
Why aren't you eating?

1882
01:12:58,356 --> 01:13:00,716
For experts, they are different. But for ordinary people...

1883
01:13:03,056 --> 01:13:04,626
- It's good.
- Is it good.

1884
01:13:05,056 --> 01:13:06,056
What?

1885
01:13:06,057 --> 01:13:07,096
- Is it good?
- Really?

1886
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:08,666
With two sweet potatoes,

1887
01:13:10,026 --> 01:13:11,036
one persimmon,

1888
01:13:12,496 --> 01:13:14,866
and maesaengi soup, it's good.

1889
01:13:15,936 --> 01:13:16,936
Kyun.

1890
01:13:16,937 --> 01:13:18,836
(Laughing)

1891
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,676
It's a difficult one, isn't it?

1892
01:13:23,006 --> 01:13:24,316
- Not bad?
- Not bad.

1893
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:27,176
(The only person who hasn't tried it yet)

1894
01:13:27,286 --> 01:13:29,785
Please make a wrap that will smell the weakest.

1895
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,706
There's no such a thing as smelling the weakest.

1896
01:13:33,016 --> 01:13:35,726
That's a lot of kimchi. Make it less damaging.

1897
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:38,466
- That's a lot.
- It's not that pungent, right?

1898
01:13:39,856 --> 01:13:41,465
- Let me see. Gosh.
- My sinus is cleared up.

1899
01:13:41,466 --> 01:13:42,626
- Gosh.
- Here.

1900
01:13:43,226 --> 01:13:45,996
(Finally, Jung Nam takes a bite.)

1901
01:13:47,366 --> 01:13:50,206
(As he's going for it, he boldly takes a big bite.)

1902
01:13:53,136 --> 01:13:54,816
(It's about time the smell hits his nose.)

1903
01:13:55,646 --> 01:13:56,776
(Suffering)

1904
01:13:57,176 --> 01:13:59,576
(He's in trouble.)

1905
01:14:00,346 --> 01:14:01,516
(Laughing)

1906
01:14:01,986 --> 01:14:02,986
Impressive.

1907
01:14:03,846 --> 01:14:07,356
(The smell of skate clears the whole sinus.)

1908
01:14:08,686 --> 01:14:09,686
My hero.

1909
01:14:09,687 --> 01:14:10,696
(Dizzy)

1910
01:14:10,826 --> 01:14:12,796
Personally, I like it.

1911
01:14:13,556 --> 01:14:16,165
(Is that so? I still find it difficult to eat.)

1912
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:18,866
(Tearing up)

1913
01:14:19,466 --> 01:14:20,966
He's crying.

1914
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:22,406
(Laughing)

1915
01:14:25,906 --> 01:14:28,976
It was something I just couldn't handle.

1916
01:14:29,376 --> 01:14:33,716
I could feel it on my nose as the pungent smell hits it.

1917
01:14:34,616 --> 01:14:35,986
Gosh. It's not easy to eat it.

1918
01:14:36,846 --> 01:14:39,566
- You wrapped it like a regular.
- It's not that pungent for locals.

1919
01:14:40,356 --> 01:14:42,556
- Because the locals here...
- My goodness.

1920
01:14:43,256 --> 01:14:44,536
- What?
- That will be so salty.

1921
01:14:44,956 --> 01:14:45,956
That will be so salty.

1922
01:14:45,957 --> 01:14:47,517
(Worrying, covering her mouth, shocked)

1923
01:14:47,926 --> 01:14:49,625
(Clapping as he approves it)

1924
01:14:49,626 --> 01:14:51,866
Gosh. He put this much jeotgal.

1925
01:14:52,266 --> 01:14:53,266
(Grabbing)

1926
01:14:53,267 --> 01:14:55,105
Sweet potatoes. Persimmons.

1927
01:14:55,106 --> 01:14:56,512
(An air raid alarm for the 2nd skate smell attack)

1928
01:14:56,536 --> 01:14:59,476
(Supplying sweet potatoes and persimmons)

1929
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:04,316
Do we have to fill ourselves with other stuff to eat it?

1930
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:06,775
- Jung Nam, you're a man.
- Gosh.

1931
01:15:06,776 --> 01:15:08,685
- I just had one.
- Come on.

1932
01:15:08,686 --> 01:15:10,416
Jung Nam, have another piece.

1933
01:15:11,156 --> 01:15:14,156
I'm a man. Give it to me. Of course, I can eat it.

1934
01:15:14,756 --> 01:15:16,956
A man shouldn't cut it.

1935
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:20,255
(It's so fun to watch it live.)

1936
01:15:20,256 --> 01:15:22,765
- I'm going to eat it. Look. Yo Han.
- Gosh.

1937
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:25,246
(Masculine Jung Nam tries eating skate without making a wrap.)

1938
01:15:26,196 --> 01:15:27,235
(Covering her mouth)

1939
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:29,506
(Covering her mouth too)

1940
01:15:29,606 --> 01:15:31,435
Jung Nam, you eat it well.

1941
01:15:31,436 --> 01:15:32,476
(Jung Nam can eat it now.)

1942
01:15:34,146 --> 01:15:36,076
I held my breath while eating it.

1943
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:38,306
I didn't feel the pungent smell. Try it.

1944
01:15:38,716 --> 01:15:41,516
It's totally fine when you eat it while holding your breath.

1945
01:15:43,146 --> 01:15:45,556
(He's a skate's fan when holding his breath.)

1946
01:15:46,686 --> 01:15:48,986
(Everyone enjoys skate in their own way.)

1947
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:53,255
Gosh. The skate...

1948
01:15:53,256 --> 01:15:54,572
(Jung Nam, the beginner, is lost every time he eats it.)

1949
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:56,396
- It's... Gosh.
- Are you all right?

1950
01:15:56,996 --> 01:15:59,335
(He can't eat because it's so funny.)

1951
01:15:59,336 --> 01:16:00,966
- Really?
- Another table.

1952
01:16:01,606 --> 01:16:02,606
"Another table."

1953
01:16:03,606 --> 01:16:04,805
- Kyun, I'll go for it.
- Gosh.

1954
01:16:04,806 --> 01:16:06,376
(Yo Han is having the happiest moment.)

1955
01:16:07,036 --> 01:16:08,776
I think it's addictive.

1956
01:16:09,306 --> 01:16:11,815
Malatang can't even compare to this.

1957
01:16:11,816 --> 01:16:15,185
- No. Compared to this, that's...
- Skate is the most sharp-tasting.

1958
01:16:15,186 --> 01:16:16,506
(Skate has the most sharp taste!)

1959
01:16:16,586 --> 01:16:18,686
It's the ultimate fermented food.

1960
01:16:19,886 --> 01:16:22,686
How long did you ferment it?

1961
01:16:22,986 --> 01:16:25,595
- For that one, over 2 months.
- Over 2 months.

1962
01:16:25,596 --> 01:16:27,925
We ferment it in straws in a jar.

1963
01:16:27,926 --> 01:16:29,166
- For 2 months?
- For 2 months.

1964
01:16:31,766 --> 01:16:35,205
To age skate, I lay the straws.

1965
01:16:35,206 --> 01:16:37,006
(1. Lay the straws on the bottom of the jar.)

1966
01:16:37,136 --> 01:16:38,136
Place the skate.

1967
01:16:38,137 --> 01:16:40,676
(2. Place the prepared skate on the straws.)

1968
01:16:42,246 --> 01:16:43,505
Add the straws again.

1969
01:16:43,506 --> 01:16:44,946
(3. Place the straws over it again.)

1970
01:16:45,276 --> 01:16:47,516
It speeds up the process and makes it tastier.

1971
01:16:48,586 --> 01:16:49,985
We ferment it for two months like this.

1972
01:16:49,986 --> 01:16:51,392
(After two months of fermentation, )

1973
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:53,355
(it is born again as fermented skate...)

1974
01:16:53,356 --> 01:16:55,756
(with the taste and smell that will clear up your nostrils.)

1975
01:16:56,156 --> 01:16:59,526
I love it. Actually, I think I'm addicted to it.

1976
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:02,296
- Kyun, I think I'm addicted.
- Do you like it?

1977
01:17:02,396 --> 01:17:04,595
- It's not too pungent.
- It's really good for you.

1978
01:17:04,596 --> 01:17:06,196
- Then...
- It's good for the bones too.

1979
01:17:06,436 --> 01:17:07,705
It's really good...

1980
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,965
- for your bones and joints.
- For bones and joints.

1981
01:17:08,966 --> 01:17:11,705
- For bones and joints.
- Yes. For a long time.

1982
01:17:11,706 --> 01:17:13,706
- You have bad knees.
- Yes.

1983
01:17:13,806 --> 01:17:15,706
If you eat lots of skate, they will get better.

1984
01:17:15,906 --> 01:17:18,216
I'm going to bear the pain in my legs.

1985
01:17:20,616 --> 01:17:22,986
I'll bear it, so I don't need skate.

1986
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:26,156
(Should we go for the one I reserved?)

1987
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:29,855
We're learning like this.

1988
01:17:29,856 --> 01:17:31,056
(What's that now?)

1989
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:32,925
Gosh. That's...

1990
01:17:32,926 --> 01:17:34,686
(Today's highlight that Yo Han reserved for)

1991
01:17:35,226 --> 01:17:37,196
I'll show you how I dismantle it.

1992
01:17:38,296 --> 01:17:40,265
Gosh. Look at that. Look.

1993
01:17:40,266 --> 01:17:41,435
(The Country members and Jung Nam are shocked to see the skate.)

1994
01:17:41,436 --> 01:17:43,405
It's about 30cm. Is that skate?

1995
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:44,435
(It catches everyone's attention.)

1996
01:17:44,436 --> 01:17:45,476
(I have to film this.)

1997
01:17:45,776 --> 01:17:48,175
It's for the beginners who can't eat it at all.

1998
01:17:48,176 --> 01:17:50,146
- It's been fermented for two weeks.
- Gosh.

1999
01:17:50,376 --> 01:17:52,876
- It looks like a ray, indeed.
- Exactly.

2000
01:17:53,746 --> 01:17:55,786
- This is the front.
- It's smiling.

2001
01:17:56,446 --> 01:17:58,785
It's for you to have the raw liver.

2002
01:17:58,786 --> 01:17:59,786
- The liver.
- Okay.

2003
01:17:59,787 --> 01:18:03,726
Only those who made a reservation can have it.

2004
01:18:04,026 --> 01:18:05,595
Ma'am, it won't be that pungent...

2005
01:18:05,596 --> 01:18:07,232
because it hasn't been fermented for long, right?

2006
01:18:07,256 --> 01:18:09,396
- It's like sashimi.
- Sashimi.

2007
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:11,166
Sashimi.

2008
01:18:11,496 --> 01:18:13,036
(The skate master is eating nonstop.)

2009
01:18:13,696 --> 01:18:15,566
Gosh. Look how Yo Han is eating well.

2010
01:18:16,406 --> 01:18:18,736
It's so good for your body because it's a fermented food.

2011
01:18:19,136 --> 01:18:20,976
You won't get sick even if you eat it a lot.

2012
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,075
Do we sprinkle salt or eat it as is?

2013
01:18:23,076 --> 01:18:24,946
No salt. We don't sprinkle salt at all, right?

2014
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:26,246
No salt.

2015
01:18:26,247 --> 01:18:27,375
I want to try it.

2016
01:18:27,376 --> 01:18:28,845
- The imported ones... It's liver.
- Yes.

2017
01:18:28,846 --> 01:18:30,515
- Try the liver. Eat it raw.
- I'll give it to you.

2018
01:18:30,516 --> 01:18:32,185
- With sesame oil?
- Yes. With sesame oil.

2019
01:18:32,186 --> 01:18:33,186
It's tasty.

2020
01:18:33,187 --> 01:18:34,955
It's so flavorful.

2021
01:18:34,956 --> 01:18:36,985
You eat Korean skate to eat the liver.

2022
01:18:36,986 --> 01:18:37,996
I'll try it too.

2023
01:18:38,126 --> 01:18:39,296
Do you want to try the liver?

2024
01:18:40,196 --> 01:18:41,466
- It's the liver.
- The liver.

2025
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:43,525
- I see. I love liver.
- It's skate liver.

2026
01:18:43,526 --> 01:18:45,535
It's very rare and special.

2027
01:18:45,536 --> 01:18:48,336
(How does the rare skate liver taste?)

2028
01:18:50,236 --> 01:18:52,475
- I'll go for it.
- It tastes like milk.

2029
01:18:52,476 --> 01:18:54,275
- I'm going for it.
- Gosh. The liver?

2030
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:55,446
- I'll try it.
- Go for it.

2031
01:18:57,076 --> 01:18:58,176
- It's the liver.
- Gosh.

2032
01:18:58,916 --> 01:19:00,646
It tastes like milk.

2033
01:19:02,046 --> 01:19:03,716
- Great.
- Are you okay?

2034
01:19:03,746 --> 01:19:05,056
- Pardon?
- It tastes like milk.

2035
01:19:05,416 --> 01:19:06,885
You can have a lot of it. This one is all right.

2036
01:19:06,886 --> 01:19:07,886
Hey. It's really good.

2037
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:10,156
Yes. It's good.

2038
01:19:10,726 --> 01:19:11,895
- It doesn't smell.
- No, it doesn't.

2039
01:19:11,896 --> 01:19:12,896
No, it doesn't.

2040
01:19:13,056 --> 01:19:15,566
I'll try it. It's the skate liver, right?

2041
01:19:17,696 --> 01:19:19,535
(Savoring, Surprised)

2042
01:19:19,536 --> 01:19:20,636
It's so flavorful.

2043
01:19:21,536 --> 01:19:23,836
- It's so good, right?
- The liver is so good.

2044
01:19:24,036 --> 01:19:25,135
The liver is the real deal.

2045
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:26,306
(She approves of it.)

2046
01:19:27,236 --> 01:19:28,306
Try it.

2047
01:19:28,406 --> 01:19:29,575
- I already had it.
- Have it again.

2048
01:19:29,576 --> 01:19:31,746
(Yo Han is the only one taking care of Jung Nam.)

2049
01:19:33,546 --> 01:19:36,016
The liver is fine. It's different from the fermented skate.

2050
01:19:36,286 --> 01:19:38,186
It doesn't have that smell at all.

2051
01:19:39,786 --> 01:19:41,066
The skate liver was really good.

2052
01:19:41,826 --> 01:19:44,896
It was flavorful, and it didn't have the fishy and pungent smell.

2053
01:19:45,396 --> 01:19:46,396
I approve of the liver.

2054
01:19:46,956 --> 01:19:48,966
It had a really nice and creamy flavor to it.

2055
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:52,935
That was a new flavor for me. I actually liked eating the liver.

2056
01:19:52,936 --> 01:19:55,736
(The liver left a good impression on skate unlike 20 years ago.)

2057
01:19:55,936 --> 01:19:58,436
- Sister A Sung. Give it a try.
- Yes.

2058
01:19:59,436 --> 01:20:01,145
- "Sister A Sung?" - It's all right.

2059
01:20:01,146 --> 01:20:02,776
(Makgeolli is perfect for skate)

2060
01:20:03,676 --> 01:20:04,676
Is it good?

2061
01:20:05,616 --> 01:20:07,615
(It's the best combination.)

2062
01:20:07,616 --> 01:20:08,886
Cheers.

2063
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:13,286
Gosh. Nice to meet you. Gosh.

2064
01:20:13,716 --> 01:20:14,885
- Yo Han, have a drink.
- Yo Han.

2065
01:20:14,886 --> 01:20:17,246
(With a cup of makgeolli, they become closer to the skate.)

2066
01:20:19,596 --> 01:20:20,895
It's not pungent.

2067
01:20:20,896 --> 01:20:22,626
(The master eats the fermented skate only.)

2068
01:20:22,796 --> 01:20:23,996
I liked the maesaengi soup.

2069
01:20:24,496 --> 01:20:26,796
(The ending for the skate lover is...)

2070
01:20:27,396 --> 01:20:29,706
Gosh. My throat has opened up.

2071
01:20:30,036 --> 01:20:32,412
(He's going to become a good singer after eating the skate.)

2072
01:20:32,436 --> 01:20:34,235
Do you want to go to karaoke today?

2073
01:20:34,236 --> 01:20:35,996
(Should we go to karaoke for the 2nd round?)

2074
01:20:36,046 --> 01:20:37,745
(Others only eat bossam.)

2075
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:40,946
By the way, I can't smell it at all when I'm holding my breath.

2076
01:20:41,686 --> 01:20:43,486
(A beginner of eating skate)

2077
01:20:45,556 --> 01:20:47,256
(Another beginner)

2078
01:20:48,156 --> 01:20:49,156
Suyuk tastes good.

2079
01:20:49,156 --> 01:20:50,156
(Another beginner)

2080
01:20:51,796 --> 01:20:54,426
(He's glad that they're enjoying something, at least.)

2081
01:20:55,596 --> 01:20:57,502
It was a skate restaurant, but they were eating bossam.

2082
01:20:57,526 --> 01:20:59,965
So I thought, "Should I have taken them..."

2083
01:20:59,966 --> 01:21:01,505
"to a jokbal place in Jangchung-dong,"

2084
01:21:01,506 --> 01:21:03,106
"instead of the skate restaurant?"

2085
01:21:03,936 --> 01:21:06,106
(Don't get sulky, Yo Han.)

2086
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:08,345
Anyway, I loved how different it was.

2087
01:21:08,346 --> 01:21:09,845
- Thank you for the opportunity.
- That's right.

2088
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:12,076
In fact, I felt the pressure too.

2089
01:21:12,446 --> 01:21:15,286
I knew you might not like it.

2090
01:21:15,716 --> 01:21:19,156
But since Kyun is a famous chef,

2091
01:21:19,786 --> 01:21:22,185
I wanted him to try it. How was it?

2092
01:21:22,186 --> 01:21:23,986
It was good. I loved it.

2093
01:21:24,896 --> 01:21:27,426
It's the opposite of fresh seafood.

2094
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:30,365
I can see how people like it, though.

2095
01:21:30,366 --> 01:21:32,066
It has a very unique flavor.

2096
01:21:32,536 --> 01:21:33,795
It's interesting...

2097
01:21:33,796 --> 01:21:35,766
that they still continue to make this dish.

2098
01:21:36,466 --> 01:21:37,466
I love tradition.

2099
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:40,075
It's an interesting technique...

2100
01:21:40,076 --> 01:21:41,976
and something that has a historic value.

2101
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,816
- Let's go now.
- Yes. Thank you.

2102
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:47,076
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

2103
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:50,285
- Can I take a photo with you?
- I enjoyed the food. Thank you.

2104
01:21:50,286 --> 01:21:51,385
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

2105
01:21:51,386 --> 01:21:53,316
- Thank you.
- It was good.

2106
01:21:54,686 --> 01:21:57,326
(He discovered a new taste of Korea today.)

2107
01:21:57,526 --> 01:21:59,996
I don't think I'm mature enough to eat skate yet.

2108
01:22:01,194 --> 01:22:02,664
(What dish did Eddie prepare today?)

2109
01:22:02,804 --> 01:22:03,934
I want to make...

2110
01:22:05,134 --> 01:22:07,303
("How is he going to do it?")

2111
01:22:07,304 --> 01:22:08,673
(I was surprised.)

2112
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:09,674
(What was your reaction when Eddie said he'd make this?)

2113
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,320
(At first, I thought he was going to make something more fancy for them.)

2114
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,344
(But...)

2115
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,474
(He's speechless.)

2116
01:22:14,844 --> 01:22:17,114
(Guest Greeting Project 3 for the haenyeos)

2117
01:22:17,514 --> 01:22:20,554
(Just trust me.)

2118
01:22:20,814 --> 01:22:22,624
(Of course, the chef knows what he's doing.)

2119
01:22:22,824 --> 01:22:24,053
(Blue crab)

2120
01:22:24,054 --> 01:22:25,093
(Mussel)

2121
01:22:25,094 --> 01:22:26,494
(Abalone)

2122
01:22:26,894 --> 01:22:29,624
(And nurungji?)

2123
01:22:30,064 --> 01:22:32,624
(What is this unpredictable dish made with special ingredients?)

2124
01:22:32,934 --> 01:22:35,664
(Even the haenyeos are surprised to see what this dish looks like.)

2125
01:22:36,064 --> 01:22:38,434
(Will they be able to win the haenyeos' hearts?)

2126
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,474
(Their night in Yeosu has deepened.)

2127
01:22:40,634 --> 01:22:45,614
(The campfire brings up old memories.)

2128
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:48,784
(I had wished you'd disappear.)

2129
01:22:49,314 --> 01:22:50,814
(Shocked)

2130
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:52,553
(Have two archenemies been reunited at Country Cook?)

2131
01:22:52,554 --> 01:22:54,254
(Laughing)

2132
01:22:55,224 --> 01:22:57,424
(That slap was charged with frustration from the past.)

2133
01:22:57,484 --> 01:22:59,054
(They exchange friendly slaps.)

2134
01:22:59,394 --> 01:23:01,223
(Current score: 1 to 1)

2135
01:23:01,224 --> 01:23:03,024
(What kind of ending awaits them?)

2136
01:23:03,194 --> 01:23:04,994
(The much-anticipated final ingredient)

2137
01:23:05,364 --> 01:23:07,364
(Leaf mustard)

2138
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:10,664
(They get to meet fresh leaf mustard in Yeosu.)

2139
01:23:11,264 --> 01:23:15,444
(What will they make with leaf mustard for their final meal?)

2140
01:23:15,644 --> 01:23:18,174
(Leaf mustard is great!)

2141
01:23:18,374 --> 01:23:20,874
(There are so many dishes that can be made with leaf mustard.)

2142
01:23:21,384 --> 01:23:24,064
(Leaf mustard is so delicious that it's good with just plain rice!)

2143
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:27,684
(The Country members' appetites are at an all-time high in Yeosu.)

2144
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,653
(Stay tuned to find out...)

2145
01:23:29,654 --> 01:23:31,047
(why the Country members fell in love with leaf mustard.)
