1
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,896
(Edward Lee's first cooking class in Korea is here.)

2
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:35,564
(The average age of the students is in the 70s.)

3
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:37,065
(What is this?)

4
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:39,065
(Grandpa starts out tough with a kick.)

5
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:43,805
(They brought pots and aprons from home.)

6
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:45,905
(They're ready with their manliness and cuteness.)

7
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:47,114
(Today's instructor, Edward Lee, 43 years of cooking experience, )

8
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,215
(The chef for White House banquets, Winner of "Iron Chef")

9
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:50,586
(1st thing to keep in mind: He can only teach in English.)

10
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:53,255
(Show... Me what?)

11
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:55,085
(I think you need to go a bit slower.)

12
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,985
(You're going too fast!)

13
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,585
(Flustered)

14
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,356
(2nd thing to keep in mind: He may rush when he's frazzled.)

15
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,095
(A super-fast cooking class?)

16
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,495
(All over the room, )

17
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:07,036
(complaints can be heard. This dough is not working.)

18
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,035
(Slow. Slowly.)

19
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,964
(Flustered)

20
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:11,965
(Cleaning up)

21
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,106
(Helping with the dough)

22
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:17,176
(A total mess)

23
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:18,806
(The Country members' first cooking class is coming soon!)

24
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:21,746
(Edward Lee's Country Cook)

25
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:26,045
(Morning has come again to Gangwon Province)

26
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,986
(Nature is just waking up and making lively sounds.)

27
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:34,125
(What will happen today?)

28
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:36,325
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, I'm hungry.

29
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,364
Would you like tadpole noodles?

30
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,365
Pardon?

31
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,595
Can you take this?

32
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:41,635
- Sure.
- Yes.

33
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:42,835
- This?
- Yes.

34
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:44,236
In 1, 2, 3.

35
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,004
(The millstone is really heavy, even for 2 men.)

36
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,876
I think we can do it here.

37
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:50,545
(Ms. Kwon will make breakfast for the Country members.)

38
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:51,906
- That's so heavy.
- Oh, that's heavy.

39
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,015
My mother-in-law brought this when she got married.

40
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:56,176
So it's more than 100 years old.

41
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:58,614
Do you want to try this?

42
00:01:58,615 --> 00:01:59,786
- Yes.
- Do you want to try this?

43
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,415
So what is this?

44
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:03,825
- Is this...
- Yes, you put it this way.

45
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,025
- Corn.
- Oh, corn.

46
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:08,425
(When he's curious, he tries it right away!)

47
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:10,265
There's glutinous rice, and there's non-glutinous rice.

48
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,524
Same for corn.

49
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:13,465
There is non-glutinous corn and glutinous corn.

50
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,194
(Non-glutinous corn: Compared to glutinous corn, )

51
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:16,765
(non-glutinous corn has bigger and more kernels, )

52
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,406
(but with low starch content, it's not very sticky.)

53
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,206
Back in the day, they used non-glutinous corn...

54
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:24,376
for tadpole noodles before the corn was ripe, so it was white.

55
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:27,515
It's food they used to eat when resources were scarce.

56
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:28,644
(A Gangwon Province dish, Tadpole noodles)

57
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,846
Do it with your left hand. Yes.

58
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,286
Add some water as you go.

59
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:36,055
(Tadpole noodles step 1: Grind corn with a millstone.)

60
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,025
It must be impossible to do this alone.

61
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:39,186
Stop. Okay.

62
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:40,396
- I'll add some.
- Okay.

63
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,424
You can't add too much.

64
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,525
But the shape...

65
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:44,724
That's how it comes out.

66
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,664
- But when you add too much...
- I see.

67
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,694
- The kernels are falling out.
- Right.

68
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:49,965
I get it.

69
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,734
- Slowly.
- Yes, slowly.

70
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:53,065
- A little bit at a time.
- About this much?

71
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,276
I got it.

72
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,075
- Is this too much too?
- No.

73
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:57,505
(Yo Han, slowly.)

74
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:58,575
A little...

75
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,375
That's good.

76
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:01,414
Okay.

77
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,315
- Add water.
- And water.

78
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,915
You seem to have done this before.

79
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,485
- Have you done this before?
- In my past life.

80
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,656
- Oh, you have?
- In his past life.

81
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,785
(I see.)

82
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:12,225
- Your past life...
- Like this?

83
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,495
- Look at how much is coming out.
- That's right.

84
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:15,626
(Let's focus on your current life.)

85
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:20,396
How does it feel?

86
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:21,995
I want to do pansori.

87
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,204
Give it a go.

88
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,234
- Arirang - Pansori.

89
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:26,776
- Is this right?
- Pansori?

90
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,675
(He's having so much fun that he can't help but hum.)

91
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:34,675
(What does a millstone mean to Edward Lee?)

92
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,074
- Your hand...
- Oh, my.

93
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:38,145
It's a funny thing when you do that.

94
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:41,156
In those times, when you wanted food,

95
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,984
it was, "Let's create a technique..."

96
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,925
"that can last for hundreds of years."

97
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:51,295
It was invented at a time when our ancestors...

98
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,866
really thought about these things.

99
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:58,105
It's very special to be able to touch those things.

100
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:00,406
There we go.

101
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:05,645
What should we do next?

102
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,716
We have to boil this in a pot now.

103
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:09,315
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

104
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,316
Sounds good.

105
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,414
I need someone strong to stir it for me.

106
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:14,115
- I'll do it.
- Have you seen this before?

107
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:15,415
- It's my 1st time.
- It's his 1st time.

108
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:17,125
Then shall we go outside?

109
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,924
- Yes.
- Yes. Let's go and give it a go.

110
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,996
Let's go.

111
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,125
(Making the fire first to boil the noodles)

112
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:23,395
The fire is catching really well.

113
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,966
(With Ms. Kwon's husband)

114
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:26,935
Oh, the smell of fire.

115
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:28,096
(Unlike last night, the fire is burning well.)

116
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:30,335
Should I put it in here?

117
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,435
(Tadpole noodles step 2: Make the corn dough.)

118
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:32,635
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes.

119
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,135
- Pour it in.
- Okay.

120
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:36,705
All of it?

121
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:41,944
(They only use water and the corn they ground in the millstone.)

122
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,646
I can really smell the corn.

123
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:45,786
You're right.

124
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,414
It's a smell I like.

125
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:48,815
(He couldn't hold back, so he has a taste.)

126
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:51,224
(Eating twins)

127
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,355
- Go up behind there...
- Okay.

128
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:54,855
And stir like this.

129
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:56,794
Like this.

130
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:59,225
You don't want it to stick.

131
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:01,434
- You have to keep stirring.
- Yes.

132
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,505
(When he sees something new, he has to try it himself.)

133
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,064
(Arirang)

134
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,076
(Arirang)

135
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,874
Should we sing together?

136
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,075
(The only addiction allowed in Jeongseon, Arirang)

137
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,104
(Arirang)

138
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:12,905
(Eddie and Yo Han sing soulfully.)

139
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:15,115
(Mumbling the lyrics)

140
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,845
Going over the hill

141
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:18,915
Makgeolli.

142
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,956
Should I bring some makgeolli? With kimchi.

143
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,424
(The fantastic duet song made them crave makgeolli.)

144
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,456
Okay.

145
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,396
Oh, it's getting really thick now.

146
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:30,624
- It's good now.
- Okay.

147
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,724
(The corn dough is almost done.)

148
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:32,725
That must be tasty.

149
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,165
(The corn dough is almost done.)

150
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,265
(Tadpole noodles step 3: Make the noodles...)

151
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,465
(after letting the dough sit for 30 minutes.)

152
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,665
Should I remove this? Is it this one?

153
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:44,646
It's like...

154
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:46,475
- soup.
- Yes.

155
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:51,446
I see. You're going to press it, and the noodles will come out.

156
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:53,045
I see.

157
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,956
You should try pressing it.

158
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,554
Ready?

159
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:58,325
(Pressing)

160
00:05:58,326 --> 00:05:59,555
That's so impressive.

161
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,096
- They really look like tadpoles.
- Oh, this is so fun.

162
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:03,725
This is so fun.

163
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:07,435
They really look like tadpoles.

164
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:10,266
- It turned out so well.
- Oh, my gosh.

165
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,165
Seriously.

166
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,706
Look at that.

167
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,335
- This is your first time, right?
- Yes.

168
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:17,576
You did so great. It's perfect.

169
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:19,545
- Again.
- Again.

170
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:22,576
Here. You try one. It's so...

171
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:25,645
- It's so much fun.
- Let's do it one more time.

172
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,114
- Just once.
- I'll do it.

173
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:29,055
(After Eddie, Yo Han gives it a go too.)

174
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:32,456
- Good.
- Okay.

175
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,095
You're too strong.

176
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,355
(A communication error. He's pressing even harder?)

177
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:38,064
(Long tadpole noodles)

178
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,125
They're normal noodles now.

179
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:41,595
They're all bunched up.

180
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:42,596
(What is this?)

181
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:45,265
- Right.
- They're all bunched up.

182
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:47,174
- Oh, my gosh.
- You made big chunks.

183
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,576
(What had to be noodles)

184
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,675
He kept saying, "Strong."

185
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,576
He kept telling me to use more strength.

186
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:55,576
(I did well, so it's okay.)

187
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,345
I had to stop, didn't I?

188
00:06:58,346 --> 00:06:59,845
(Tadpole noodles are done.)

189
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,516
(Yo Han's part has been erased.)

190
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:04,285
- Should we go in and cook now?
- Okay.

191
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:05,326
- Okay.
- Let's head in.

192
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,655
So if you look here...

193
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,525
(It's time to prepare breakfast.)

194
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:10,365
(Opening her treasure box)

195
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:13,165
- Thistle.
- Thistle.

196
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:15,495
Should I take that?

197
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:16,535
Here is deodeok.

198
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,064
- To use as a topping.
- What is this?

199
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,664
- Deodeok?
- Julienned deodeok.

200
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:21,505
- Not julienned. Thin slices.
- Thin slices.

201
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:22,975
- Thin slices of deodeok?
- Yes.

202
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:24,845
That's interesting. Thin slices of deodeok.

203
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,005
- I've never seen...
- I'll probably...

204
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:28,175
serve this mulkimchi...

205
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,515
I'm guessing you've never tried this before.

206
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,586
- Wild celery.
- She said this was wild celery.

207
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:34,354
- What is this here?
- Bracken.

208
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,355
Bracken.

209
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,854
- What is this? Oh, from earlier.
- Kiwiberry sprouts.

210
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,484
(She's bringing out many namuls you can't easily find in the city.)

211
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:39,485
Oh, my gosh.

212
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:42,256
- Every different kind of namul.
- There are so many.

213
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:47,295
(A Gangwon Province dish, Assorted namul)

214
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,794
- We'll use these...
- Okay.

215
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:50,364
- This...
- to make rice.

216
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,466
(Which namul did Ms. Kwon pick first?)

217
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:54,576
The other namuls have strong scents.

218
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,405
So you can't cook them in rice or soups.

219
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:58,205
But thistle...

220
00:07:58,206 --> 00:07:59,846
goes well with rice.

221
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,776
- Does someone want to season it?
- Yes.

222
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:04,516
Kyun can.

223
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:06,544
- Please give it a go.
- Okay.

224
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,554
- Thanks.
- We're making a lot.

225
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,054
(Putting on gloves looking serious)

226
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:11,755
- You should learn...
- It's on top.

227
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,385
- how it's truly done.
- Okay.

228
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,255
- With Ms. Kwon.
- I see.

229
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,326
Right.

230
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:18,465
For this, I use a mixture...

231
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,895
- perilla oil and sesame oil.
- A mixture. Okay.

232
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,165
I had the oils pressed and mixed.

233
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:23,735
(Nutty)

234
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,435
- Perilla oil and sesame oil.
- Yes.

235
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:28,275
- Okay.
- Salt.

236
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:29,276
- Salt.
- Yes.

237
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,544
- Season it?
- Season it.

238
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:31,575
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

239
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:32,906
(Confidently giving it a try!)

240
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:34,275
(Something seems off...)

241
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:36,276
I should teach you how to season namul.

242
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,185
Is it wrong?

243
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,385
With namul, just season it like this.

244
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,085
- Oh, okay.
- Yes.

245
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:43,414
- Quickly?
- Yes.

246
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:44,555
You have to be tough.

247
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:47,054
- You put more here.
- I see.

248
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:48,224
And try...

249
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:49,255
(Tasting it like a tough guy)

250
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:50,265
- I like it.
- You like it?

251
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,326
Yes.

252
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:54,966
(I want a bite too.)

253
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,665
The rice...

254
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,736
- Oh, that's tasty.
- The rice.

255
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,135
(Thistle rice recipe, 1. Add oil to the rice cooker.)

256
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:03,434
(2. Cover the bottom with namul. 3. Add soaked rice on top.)

257
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:05,574
Oh, so cooking oil goes on the bottom,

258
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,976
then you add the namul, and then you steam the rice.

259
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:10,915
Why are you putting the namul at the bottom?

260
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,915
To keep the rice from burning.

261
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:14,685
Like this.

262
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:16,455
(The tip is to add the rice on top of the thistle so it doesn't burn.)

263
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,054
The scent will really soak into the rice.

264
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:20,085
That makes it delicious.

265
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:22,094
And it'll be even more delicious if you add a lot of this.

266
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,625
(Lastly, a generous amount of her special perilla and sesame oil)

267
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:26,325
I've never seen this before. Using sesame oil...

268
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,664
- Adding it to rice?
- When you're making rice...

269
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:29,665
Right.

270
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:33,035
Is that common to put oil?

271
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,406
- No, it's not.
- No?

272
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:36,406
But in Korea, there's sotbap.

273
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,106
When we make sotbap, we use oil.

274
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,775
- Right.
- Pollack roe sotbap.

275
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:42,845
When we make things like that, we use oil.

276
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:44,886
(Pouring)

277
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,355
(Eddie's radar is on!)

278
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:50,085
You added a bit of water.

279
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,726
There's moisture in the namul.

280
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,525
- So we just need this much.
- I see.

281
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:56,526
(Korean food knowledge acquired)

282
00:09:57,126 --> 00:09:59,865
I've never seen that method of cooking rice before.

283
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,664
I kind of almost... I know not to doubt her,

284
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:05,064
but in my head, I was thinking,

285
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:06,405
"That can't cook."

286
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,636
"There's too little water that it's not going to cook."

287
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,745
(Half-doubting, half-curious)

288
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,776
(Eddie's first thistle rice is full of questions.)

289
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,214
Let's prepare some namul.

290
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,215
- Okay.
- Okay.

291
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,715
I have to taste all of this.

292
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:20,016
Here.

293
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:21,885
Should I add more?

294
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,214
- This is the strongest.
- Yes.

295
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:24,726
- This is bracken.
- Bracken.

296
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:26,085
I love bracken.

297
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,995
(Actually, Eddie...)

298
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,794
I cooked it in soy sauce before.

299
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:33,425
- We also...
- You marinated it before.

300
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,434
This is half-dried.

301
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,065
This is halibut you can eat raw.

302
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:39,766
(Pretending like nothing happened)

303
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:41,276
- Braised halibut?
- I see.

304
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:43,075
The braised halibut...

305
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,976
Did you already cook the radish?

306
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:47,345
There were so many different namuls.

307
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:50,415
Every single one has a very distinct flavor.

308
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:53,986
Some are nuttier. Some are brighter.

309
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:56,084
Some are deeper.

310
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:59,185
And then... She had "naegi?"

311
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:02,226
Which I don't think I've ever had before.

312
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:05,064
It tasted so light and bright,

313
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,136
but it had a very long sort of finish to it.

314
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:09,996
Have you tried this one? It's so good.

315
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,265
Oh, really? What is the name of it?

316
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,776
Is it shepherd's purse? I think it's shepherd's purse.

317
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:15,405
- It doesn't say.
- It's shepherd's purse.

318
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:16,606
It looks like shepherd's purse.

319
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:20,105
We season it or use it in doenjang stew.

320
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,544
(Shepherd's purse: A popular spring namul in Korea.)

321
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,074
(It has a bitter taste and a unique scent, )

322
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:24,214
(and it's full of vitamins.)

323
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:25,685
We season shepherd's purse with gochujang.

324
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:28,656
- Do you want to do it, Edward?
- Sure.

325
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:32,356
(Oh, yes! I'm going to season shepherd's purse.)

326
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:34,755
(The recipe is in his head.)

327
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:37,526
(Eddie will season it using his intuition.)

328
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:42,834
(Not holding back when seasoning, just as Master Kwon taught him)

329
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,266
- It smells good.
- Try it.

330
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:48,935
How is it?

331
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,135
- Good?
- Yes.

332
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,906
There's too much here.

333
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:53,506
I'll try some.

334
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:54,876
(How does it taste?)

335
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:56,476
- It tastes so good.
- I want a bite.

336
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:58,845
It is a bit salty.

337
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,256
- A little?
- It's good.

338
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,155
You need to make namul salty at first.

339
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,424
It becomes blander later.

340
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,525
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes.

341
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,125
- See? I know.
- It's because of the water.

342
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:09,355
- It comes out...
- Yes.

343
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:10,825
- I knew that.
- Oh, really?

344
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,794
- Of course.
- Are you sure?

345
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:13,795
Chef!

346
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:19,205
(Shepherd's purse namul prepared with Eddie's hands)

347
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:23,074
(The thistle rice is ready and steaming.)

348
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,376
Where did they put the rice paddles?

349
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:29,016
I think I saw rice paddles under here.

350
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,445
- Is this rice okay?
- Is it right?

351
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:35,016
Yes. The rice turned out well.

352
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,886
- Mix it.
- Oh, my.

353
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:47,565
The rice really smells so savory.

354
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:54,405
(The unique, fresh aroma of thistle gives thistle rice rich flavor.)

355
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,834
Dark soy sauce. Can you pass it to me?

356
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:57,905
(The youngsters are working hard too.)

357
00:12:57,906 --> 00:12:59,276
- Is this it?
- Yes, it is.

358
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,746
(The Country members are making namul with their personal touch.)

359
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,515
Ms. Kwon. I should flip this when it becomes...

360
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:05,684
- golden brown, right?
- Yes.

361
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,155
- Right now.
- Now?

362
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:10,626
(Finishing off with grilled deodeok becoming nice and brown)

363
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:15,594
(After adding their handmade dishes to the table, 1 by 1)

364
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,496
Oh, my gosh. Look at this table.

365
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,794
Enough. No, not "enough." There is so much.

366
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:22,435
(A full breakfast table, Saving it in Kyun's heart)

367
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:24,635
I feel very lucky.

368
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,766
(Appetizing thistle rice with its savory aroma)

369
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:29,205
(Namul side dishes with the energy of Gangwon Province)

370
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:33,345
(And tadpole noodles made in the traditional way)

371
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:37,045
(A table with Gangwon Province's nature and life)

372
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:39,246
Gosh, this looks so delicious.

373
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,214
Thank you so much.

374
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:42,855
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

375
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,185
How should we eat this?

376
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:46,285
- Which one?
- Should we just eat it?

377
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:47,995
No. We brought soy sauce.

378
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:49,095
- Which one?
- Should we just eat it?

379
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,564
(It's good on its own.)

380
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,665
- This. Yes, this soy sauce.
- This, right?

381
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,265
- A little bit?
- Yes.

382
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,565
(Special milk vetch soy sauce really enhances the thistle rice.)

383
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:01,335
- This looks delicious.
- A little bit more.

384
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:02,935
(You can already feel the savory and rich flavors.)

385
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:13,986
(Eating up)

386
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:21,424
When we finally tasted it, it was amazing.

387
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:25,225
The juice from the namul almost created a perfume.

388
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:29,965
And it went through all of the rice. Every little piece of rice...

389
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:32,935
had the perfume of the namul inside of it.

390
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,775
It was really fantastic. I could've eaten that bowl of rice...

391
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,205
by itself. It was so good.

392
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,175
Oh, that's good.

393
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,715
- I'm so happy.
- You're happy?

394
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,175
(Proud)

395
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:45,945
It was so savory and light.

396
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,856
The sauce that Ms. Kwon made.

397
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:50,656
When I mixed that in,

398
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,085
it was a very balanced flavor.

399
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,094
Will I be able to eat that again?

400
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,695
I think I'll come back to Jeongseon.

401
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,094
I brought this.

402
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:03,294
- What is that?
- It's Jeongseon leaf mustard.

403
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:04,365
(Jeongseon leaf mustard with soft and tender leaves)

404
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:05,834
- Leaf mustard?
- This type of leaf mustard...

405
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:07,505
isn't grown in other places. It's only in Jeongseon.

406
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,905
You can add this on top.

407
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,074
- Here? I see.
- Yes.

408
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,275
(Aromatic wild chive sauce and leaf mustard namul...)

409
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,406
(round out the simple flavor of tadpole noodles.)

410
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,575
Have it with the soy sauce.

411
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:15,945
This is wild chive sauce.

412
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:17,146
It's slightly salty.

413
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,054
(How do tadpole noodles taste...)

414
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,756
(with leaf mustard namul and wild chive sauce?)

415
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,036
Oh, this is good.

416
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:42,674
This is good.

417
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,976
You must be hungry right now.

418
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,545
This wild chive. When it's mixed with soy sauce...

419
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:50,684
It usually has spiciness at the end,

420
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:52,584
- but that goes away.
- The soy sauce is different.

421
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,616
It's so delicious.

422
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:54,954
It's so amusing.

423
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,615
- Isn't the texture unique?
- Yes.

424
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:57,825
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

425
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:00,795
Do you have this type of noodle in the US too?

426
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,095
- This?
- Yes.

427
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,496
No.

428
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:04,996
No?

429
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:06,226
You don't, right?

430
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,095
Have you had this before?

431
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:09,934
This is my first time having this.

432
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,664
- It's a first for me too.
- First time in my life.

433
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:13,536
It's a first for all of us.

434
00:16:14,276 --> 00:16:18,074
And the taste was so delicate and so light.

435
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:21,776
And I just had never tasted something like that before.

436
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:25,215
It was slippery and juicy,

437
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:29,955
but it also had the texture of soft noodles.

438
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:33,385
We should've put namul in two dishes. We were too busy.

439
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:34,525
(Someone becomes very quiet when food tastes good.)

440
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,756
This is delicious.

441
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:38,065
- I'm so happy.
- You're happy?

442
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:39,695
And this is our first meal of the day.

443
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:43,165
(She hasn't said anything for a while now.)

444
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:47,305
(If you ask why people only have one mouth, )

445
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:53,376
(I will say because it is a luxury to speak while eating deodeok.)

446
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:56,276
(You really eat so well.)

447
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,815
I should have the dish that Si A cooked too.

448
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:01,314
That's really good.

449
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:02,386
(Getting more excited at Foodie Si A's recommendation)

450
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:06,156
Isn't that good?

451
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:08,025
Isn't that good?

452
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,756
- It's so good. It's fascinating.
- This is so delicious, right?

453
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,165
It's so delicious. That surprised me.

454
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,996
- Hey, that's so delicious.
- Right?

455
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,804
The sauce is nice,

456
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:19,165
and you grilled it so well.

457
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,376
I made it with gochujang...

458
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:23,835
- and fruit extract.
- It's so delicious.

459
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:27,105
- I want to learn how to make...
- Yes?

460
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:28,415
The deodeok sauce.

461
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,445
Go to the kitchen later and ask for some.

462
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:31,515
Oh, really?

463
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,715
I really want to make this for my family.

464
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,515
For my grandma and grandpa.

465
00:17:35,516 --> 00:17:37,315
- Really?
- They like this.

466
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:39,324
It's even tastier because the deodeok is local.

467
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,696
(Gangwon Province deodeok has a strong aroma and flavor.)

468
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:44,395
Out of all of the grilled deodeok I've had,

469
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:45,996
this was the most delicious.

470
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,236
I think there were two reasons.

471
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,365
First, the deodeok was so nice.

472
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:53,805
It was nice deodeok with a sweetness and crunch.

473
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:56,176
The second was the sauce.

474
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,676
It was so delicious.

475
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:02,345
It really enhanced the savory flavor of the deodeok.

476
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,584
I couldn't stop eating it.

477
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,315
(She was touched by the delicious grilled deodeok.)

478
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,554
What is your favorite?

479
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,614
The rice.

480
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:11,925
- The rice?
- The rice? I see.

481
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,526
(A Sung's favorite: Savory thistle rice)

482
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:16,755
- This.
- The shepherd's purse?

483
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:17,824
It's so good.

484
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:20,665
- You made this, right?
- You made this, right, Eddie?

485
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,895
With the gochujang.

486
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,404
Shepherd's purse is tasty when seasoned with gochujang.

487
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:25,565
(Eddie's favorite, Shepherd's purse with a tangy, sweet taste of spring)

488
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:33,246
(Namul is so delicious that even Eddie from Kentucky loves it.)

489
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:35,416
If you eat like this,

490
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:36,775
- you don't need meat.
- Right.

491
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:38,345
- You're right.
- This is so delicious.

492
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,685
It fills your soul,

493
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:46,355
and it fills your satisfaction.

494
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:49,895
It was always on the table, but it was never my favorite.

495
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,725
To me, I love eating meat.

496
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:55,496
But it kind of makes me think, "Why do I eat meat?"

497
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,405
If we can have this every day,

498
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:00,305
there's no reason to eat meat at all.

499
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:05,905
Because you're getting the flavor of everything in that dish.

500
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,345
I can really eat like that every day...

501
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:10,986
and not eat meat.

502
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:16,786
(A Gangwon Province namul meal made him forget about meat.)

503
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:18,255
Gosh, this is good.

504
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,055
I made this because the potatoes were ripe.

505
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,996
Take a look. It's very chewy.

506
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:24,995
It already looks delicious.

507
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,726
(Excited)

508
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,394
(It tastes the best when you rip it with your hands.)

509
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:33,966
(Taking a bite of steamy potato pancake)

510
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,705
If you hadn't told me this was corn,

511
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:41,946
I would've thought that this was rice cake.

512
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,286
- It's potato.
- It's potato.

513
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,686
- You thought it was...
- But I thought it was...

514
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,815
- I'm all confused.
- Chef.

515
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:50,456
- Calm down.
- I'm confused.

516
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,655
Calm down. Please.

517
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,926
(Dad...)

518
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,225
(Who called me corn?)

519
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,266
I remember eating something like this...

520
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,265
- when I was young.
- Really?

521
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,735
But with sugar...

522
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,105
- Sprinkled on top?
- Yes.

523
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,375
What is that?

524
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,705
(What is that? Curious)

525
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:14,074
Are you talking about basi?

526
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:15,645
They have that in Chinese restaurants here.

527
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,145
With potato and sugar sprinkled on top...

528
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:21,286
It's kind of like mattang.

529
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:24,054
I remember something like this when I was a kid.

530
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,325
But it was Korean food.

531
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:27,696
- Oh, I'm so curious.
- Jeonbyeong?

532
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,654
- It is similar to jeonbyeong.
- Yes.

533
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:30,894
I have to ask my mother.

534
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,364
But I remember eating something...

535
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,795
I just have a feeling.

536
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:36,736
Wait. Isn't it...

537
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,006
- Isn't it? Right?
- That.

538
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,471
But it was Korean food.

539
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:42,999
Oh, I'm so curious.

540
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,040
Jeonbyeong?

541
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:45,769
- It is similar to jeonbyeong.
- Yes.

542
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,970
I have to ask my mother.

543
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:48,410
But I remember eating something...

544
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:49,980
I just have a feeling.

545
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,681
Wait. Isn't it hotteok?

546
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,151
- Isn't it hotteok? Right?
- Hotteok!

547
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:56,981
- It was hotteok.
- That's right.

548
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:01,120
- Seriously.
- That's right.

549
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,661
(We need to make a tonic to clear Eddie's mind.)

550
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:05,590
You should dip it in here.

551
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,731
It'll taste like hotteok.

552
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,999
(Potato pancake plus sugar equals hotteok?)

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,569
- Right? It's good, right?
- It's very accurate.

554
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,500
- This can't go wrong.
- This can't go wrong.

555
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:15,339
Oh, yes.

556
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,570
(Oh, that's what I'm talking about!)

557
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:18,141
Mom.

558
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:19,910
Mom.

559
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,510
(Age 52 is that age when you miss your mom a lot.)

560
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,710
- Seriously.
- Right.

561
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:27,151
(Ms. Kwon's cooking brought back memories for Eddie.)

562
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,850
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

563
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:34,960
Perfect.

564
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,059
(The Country members started the day with a perfect breakfast.)

565
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,089
It's over there, right, Si A?

566
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,360
Yes, over there.

567
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,961
Kyun. Have you heard of a senior citizen center?

568
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,631
It's where grandmas and grandpas go to hang out.

569
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,631
We're going to go there to cook today.

570
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,000
Let's not cook and play Go-Stop instead.

571
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,839
I'd love to. But we're filming a show.

572
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,410
(Kyun, we're filming.)

573
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:55,609
I'd love to play.

574
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,810
(Why are the Country members going to the senior center to cook?)

575
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,980
- Thank you for coming today.
- Thank you.

576
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:01,380
Since you're here,

577
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,250
you should teach us before you leave.

578
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:06,220
It's hard to find Western food here.

579
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,350
Since it's a countryside.

580
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:10,320
Since it's hard to find one, I want to learn how to cook one.

581
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,460
I'll do my best.

582
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,790
(Country members decided to teach them Western dishes.)

583
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,299
(Following the guest invitation project...)

584
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,760
(is Country members' first cooking class in Gangwon Province.)

585
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,370
(Walking proudly)

586
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,569
- Here we are.
- Our trailer.

587
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,741
(Country members have nothing to fear when they are together.)

588
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:23,941
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

589
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,610
(Let's do this.)

590
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,770
- Let's go.
- Great.

591
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:29,141
I feel nervous for some reason.

592
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,310
- Is it here?
- Yes.

593
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:33,509
Okay.

594
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,480
(Will Country members' first cooking class be a success?)

595
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:37,050
Here you go.

596
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,249
(Shall we start preparing...)

597
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,259
This is where...

598
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,420
(in earnest?)

599
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,661
we'll be cooking.

600
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,160
- Kyun.
- Yes?

601
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:48,830
- It's a karaoke machine.
- Karaoke.

602
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,329
- We can play Go-Stop...
- "Edward Lee's..."

603
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,901
- and everything else here.
- "cooking class."

604
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:54,500
Okay.

605
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,339
What are you going to start with?

606
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,009
(He can't hold himself back from playing darts.)

607
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,039
(What are you doing?)

608
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
- Okay.
- No playing.

609
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,680
I know. He's playing around already.

610
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,809
- Okay.
- No playing.

611
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,410
I know. He's playing around already.

612
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:06,711
Kyun, you should...

613
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:09,079
give each of us a mission.

614
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,491
Okay. We should set up the tables.

615
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:12,891
- Sure.
- Yes.

616
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,250
- First...
- Set up the tables.

617
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,060
- Like this?
- Yes.

618
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,289
- All right.
- Do we need anything...

619
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,360
from the trailer?

620
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,460
- We'll bring the ingredients...
- The ingredients.

621
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:21,901
From the trailer.

622
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,299
- Potatoes, cheese, - Potatoes, cheese,

623
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,930
- chestnuts, - flour,

624
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:26,970
- eggs, - eggs,

625
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,441
- pumpkin, - pumpkin,

626
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,770
- and chestnuts.
- and chestnuts.

627
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,339
- Lots of butter.
- Lots of it?

628
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,039
- Lots of it.
- Lots of butter. Okay.

629
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,510
Okay.

630
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,641
- Then let's go.
- Let's go.

631
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,810
Then...

632
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,609
(The trustworthy older guy...)

633
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,120
(and the reliable younger guy...)

634
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:47,320
(start setting up the tables indoors!)

635
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,661
Shall we open it?

636
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:52,130
(They are on their way to get the ingredients.)

637
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,760
Our reliable trailer.

638
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:56,060
- It's really reliable.
- Did you keep our food safely?

639
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:58,370
Eggs.

640
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,569
(Working hard)

641
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,000
- Today...
- A lot of people are coming.

642
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,971
- Let's take them all.
- Okay.

643
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,780
Pumpkin and olive oil.

644
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:10,680
Okay.

645
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:12,881
(Both hands full of ingredients)

646
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,421
(A Sung and Si A move quickly to get everything ready fast.)

647
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,850
(Opening wide)

648
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:20,320
Thank you.

649
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,221
(They work well together now.)

650
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,661
(Nicely-aligned cutlery)

651
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:27,431
Okay.

652
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:29,901
I'll go first.

653
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:35,971
(They prepare the ingredients quickly.)

654
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:40,570
(By the time they're done with the preparations, )

655
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,310
(Jeongseon's three sisters make an appearance.)

656
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,151
It's cold.

657
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,620
(They cautiously walk in with something in their hands.)

658
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,320
I shouldn't have asked them to do this yesterday.

659
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,420
(They are basic cooking appliances, )

660
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:56,260
(such as frying pans and cutting boards, from home.)

661
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:57,820
- Hello.
- Hello.

662
00:24:58,161 --> 00:24:59,161
Are they here already?

663
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:00,161
(Taking a peek)

664
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:01,161
- Hello.
- Hello.

665
00:25:01,162 --> 00:25:02,460
- Did you sleep well?
- Hello.

666
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,760
Do I sit there?

667
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:06,171
(Goodness, they prepared a lot.)

668
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:09,640
- Where should I sit?
- Sit wherever you like.

669
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,340
- Sit at any table.
- Yes.

670
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:14,170
(The other students of the cooking class, )

671
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:15,740
(Gangwon Province's mountain men)

672
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:17,109
What's this?

673
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,451
I have no idea.

674
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,779
- What's this?
- Is there something inside?

675
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,780
(He puts the trailer in its place with a kick.)

676
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:27,221
(Charismatic)

677
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,660
(Something feels foreboding.)

678
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,221
Gosh, it's cold.

679
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

680
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,960
Hello.

681
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:34,961
(Welcome, sirs.)

682
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:36,029
Welcome.

683
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,829
You brought a huge pot.

684
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,201
- Is it too big?
- No, it's just nice.

685
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,170
(Feeling nervous)

686
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:44,500
(Walking on eggshells)

687
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,910
(The three sisters and the mountain men...)

688
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:49,411
(all take their seats.)

689
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:52,881
Look, they brought nice aprons.

690
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,079
Look at that apron.

691
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
How cute.

692
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,190
(He may seem cold on the outside, )

693
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:03,360
(but he is an adorable man who looks great in a yellow apron.)

694
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,490
Okay. Are you ready?

695
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:06,789
- Yes.
- Yes.

696
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,891
Okay, let's start.

697
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,900
Everyone, thank you for coming.

698
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:13,671
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

699
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,671
Thank you for coming.

700
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,539
- Today, we'll make gnocchi.
- This...

701
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,441
Potato gnocchi.

702
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,710
(Yo Han is the main translator...)

703
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:22,711
Yes.

704
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:23,780
(and in charge of miscellaneous jobs.)

705
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,010
(A Sung is the gentlemen's assistant teacher.)

706
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,920
(Si A is the ladies' assistant teacher.)

707
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,080
Today, we'll make gnocchi.

708
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,621
Potato gnocchi pasta.

709
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,991
Today, we'll make potato gnocchi.

710
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,589
(Gno...)

711
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,731
(cchi?)

712
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,800
Potato noki?

713
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,971
- Gnocchi.
- Yoki, I see.

714
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,700
I might have seen it on TV once.

715
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,840
Or have I?

716
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,040
Ramyeon is the only dish I can cook.

717
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,540
I came here because a famous chef...

718
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,411
from overseas came to teach us how to cook.

719
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,520
Have you tried gnocchi before?

720
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,721
I've never cooked one at home.

721
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,990
This is a countryside,

722
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:11,020
so it's hard.

723
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:13,690
It's an Italian pasta...

724
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:17,701
but with potatoes, flour, and eggs in the mix.

725
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:19,371
We'll make a dough.

726
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,839
So I wanted to show them something new,

727
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,799
especially using their potatoes.

728
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,940
They're so used to eating their potatoes in one way.

729
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,540
I wanted to show them a new way to use their potatoes...

730
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,910
and just give them a different feel. A different flavor.

731
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:34,411
(Edward Lee wants them to try a new flavor with the potatoes.)

732
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,980
(Potato gnocchi class just for the seniors...)

733
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,420
(in Gangwon Province starts.)

734
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:41,020
Okay, let's start. Take a potato.

735
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:42,720
Take a potato.

736
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:43,721
You need to make it short.

737
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:45,891
Make a shallow cut.

738
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:48,029
Let's take the skin off.

739
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,559
Remove the skin.

740
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,570
(Potato gnocchi recipe 1: Remove the boiled potato skin.)

741
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:52,970
Remove the skin?

742
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,000
(That's easy!)

743
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:55,539
(These two are in a team.)

744
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,569
Do it first.

745
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,740
You must cook a lot.

746
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:00,039
(Her eyes are fixed on Eddie.)

747
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,171
(Just me?)

748
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:02,380
Yes, that's right.

749
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,109
Peel it and put it here.

750
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,550
Just remove the skin first.

751
00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:07,910
Where do I put the skin?

752
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:09,349
In the bowl in front of you.

753
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,750
(So far, making gnocchi isn't hard for the mountain men either.)

754
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,220
(She spots something.)

755
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:17,190
(Glancing again)

756
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:18,960
Look, he's peeling it with a knife.

757
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:19,991
(Laughing)

758
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:25,871
(Telling on her friend who is using a knife to peel a boiled potato)

759
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:29,769
- It's delicious.
- Is it?

760
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,800
Yes.

761
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:33,510
The potatoes were harvested by him.

762
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,871
Thank you.

763
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:38,141
Now, show us how pretty your peeled potato looks.

764
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,381
Yes.

765
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:41,549
Show me your potato.

766
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,920
(Shy)

767
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,080
(Show me what?)

768
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,550
(Does he mean the potato?)

769
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:49,121
- Cut it just a bit.
- Cut half.

770
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:51,759
Cut it into pieces.

771
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,789
Cut it into cubes.

772
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,760
(Potato gnocchi recipe 2: Cut the peeled potato into cubes.)

773
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,830
We're going to take our masher.

774
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:01,999
And we're going to mash it.

775
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,039
(Potato gnocchi recipe 3: Mash the cut potato.)

776
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,210
Tell them.

777
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,910
It's important to go fast.

778
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:09,711
You don't want the potato to cool down.

779
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,381
The potato has to stay warm.

780
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,451
You need to mash it when it's still warm.

781
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:15,779
Let's mash it quickly.

782
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,921
(The teacher demonstrates by mashing it fast.)

783
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,249
Mash it very fast.

784
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,590
(Enthusiastic students also start to mash it fast.)

785
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
Do it fast.

786
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:26,231
(Enthusiastic students also start to mash it fast.)

787
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,431
Okay, let's go.

788
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,201
Like this. Show them.

789
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,770
- Like this. Can you see?
- Like this.

790
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,140
Okay.

791
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:36,971
(It needs to be mashed finely like this!)

792
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,740
(Look at mine.)

793
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,911
That's good. That's how you do it.

794
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:42,411
Just like that.

795
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,941
The skin isn't coming off easily.

796
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,079
(Mashing, fast, Slicing, average speed, )

797
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,519
(Peeling, very slow)

798
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Let me help you.

799
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,750
- Thank you.
- No worries.

800
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,750
(Let me help you!)

801
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,691
(A Sung kindly helps the senior who is a bit slow.)

802
00:29:57,721 --> 00:29:59,260
Mash it fast.

803
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:00,961
(Surprised)

804
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:05,731
(Thanks to the assistant teachers, they finish mashing the potatoes.)

805
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,269
Next up is eggs.

806
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,170
Next, we'll add the eggs.

807
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:11,171
Look here.

808
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:12,711
One whole egg.

809
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,510
The other one, just the yolk.

810
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,241
One whole egg?

811
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,850
One whole egg and one egg yolk.

812
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,849
It requires some skill.

813
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,850
Okay.

814
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:25,491
Add just the yolk for the second egg.

815
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,490
- One whole egg and one yolk.
- One yolk.

816
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:28,590
Oh, no.

817
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,161
Oh, no.

818
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,759
(His pride splatters with the yolk.)

819
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,859
I prepared this...

820
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,000
- Thank you.
- just in case.

821
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,000
In case you have trouble separating just the yolk...

822
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:45,470
and it hurts your pride, I prepared more eggs in advance.

823
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:46,570
So don't feel pressured.

824
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,780
I got my yolk separated.

825
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,009
- You did it at once.
- Yes.

826
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,849
If the egg yolk doesn't separate...

827
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,150
(This senior who can only cook ramyeon...)

828
00:30:56,151 --> 00:30:58,690
(separates the yolk from the white smoothly.)

829
00:30:58,691 --> 00:30:59,691
Okay.

830
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,760
(Ms. Kwon Young Won does it perfectly too.)

831
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,090
This...

832
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Here, the yolk.

833
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,400
Onto the potato?

834
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,971
- We'll add flour now.
- Flour.

835
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,000
This is flour.

836
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:16,671
- One big scoop.
- One.

837
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:18,609
One big spoonful.

838
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,870
(Potato gnocchi recipe 5: Add 3 spoons of flour.)

839
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:21,840
Two, three.

840
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,540
Three spoons.

841
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:25,451
All right, now.

842
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:27,681
This is the most important part.

843
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,651
This is the most important part.

844
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,789
We're going to mix this.

845
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,749
Don't use your palms.

846
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,890
Just your fingers.

847
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:37,059
When you mix it, only use your fingers.

848
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,060
Very gently.

849
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:39,430
Don't use your palms.

850
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,560
- Just use your fingers.
- Just the fingers. Okay.

851
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,600
You must be very gentle.

852
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:44,859
Like you're seasoning namul.

853
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,700
As if you're seasoning vegetables...

854
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:49,740
or playing with clay.

855
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,901
(If it becomes sticky, you've successfully made the dough!)

856
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,540
- You're good at this.
- Am I?

857
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:56,840
You're doing so well.

858
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,610
(The two top students push ahead.)

859
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,981
- Darn it.
- Stop it.

860
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:04,651
(Flustered)

861
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,221
They all just stick to my hand.

862
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,421
It's too watery.

863
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:12,360
(It should become like this.)

864
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,391
Let me see.

865
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,460
(In the end, the teacher leaves his seat.)

866
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:16,461
Like this.

867
00:32:16,462 --> 00:32:19,370
If it's too soft, add more flour.

868
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,630
It's a bit watery now,

869
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,499
so let's add a bit more flour.

870
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,941
Shall we try it?

871
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:26,941
- Just a bit more flour.
- Okay.

872
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:29,610
You need a bit more flour.

873
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,881
- We need more flour.
- A bit more.

874
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,010
- That's enough.
- Me too.

875
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:35,481
Coming.

876
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:41,819
(And here's a man who fell into the swamp of dough.)

877
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,990
Is it too watery?

878
00:32:42,991 --> 00:32:44,290
- What?
- Is it watery?

879
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,431
It's all sticking to my hands.

880
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,431
(The savior arrives.)

881
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,871
I'll help you out a bit.

882
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:56,270
(He regains his smile.)

883
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,870
The remaining flour goes on the cutting board.

884
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:03,280
Pour the remaining flour on your cutting board.

885
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,110
- And then...
- Next...

886
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,380
(It's time to shape the gnocchi.)

887
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:12,050
(Make it as square as possible.)

888
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,951
Okay, now, I'm going to show you a trick.

889
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,191
- Look here.
- Ready?

890
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,790
- After you make a dough...
- One.

891
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,830
- Two.
- Two times.

892
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:22,599
Like that, and...

893
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
press it again.

894
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,731
(Press it down hard.)

895
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,640
(Pressing)

896
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,141
- Yes.
- That's right.

897
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,570
- Fold it to the side.
- Like this?

898
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:35,280
And now,

899
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,040
- cut it into three pieces.
- Next,

900
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,650
cut it into three pieces.

901
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
(Glancing)

902
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:42,779
Cut it into three pieces.

903
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,479
(He takes a quick glance and follows it immediately.)

904
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,620
- You're doing great.
- That's great.

905
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:47,890
That's awesome.

906
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,459
(Making gnocchi is the easiest.)

907
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,021
What was it just now?

908
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:54,259
Good job. Next, cut it into three pieces.

909
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,501
Cut it with a knife.

910
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,230
Are you ready for the next step?

911
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,169
They're still doing it.

912
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,339
You're going too fast.

913
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,799
- We're falling behind.
- We'll do it for 30 seconds.

914
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,000
Please hold on.

915
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,110
(Chef, you need to slow down. The students are complaining.)

916
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,770
- It's a bit fast, isn't it?
- Yes.

917
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:09,280
I'm sorry.

918
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,209
- And then take one.
- Hold on, Kyun.

919
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,780
Slow down.

920
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,950
- Okay.
- Okay. You're doing great so far.

921
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:18,620
- Good job. And...
- Take one...

922
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:21,121
put the two pieces aside.

923
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,260
It needs to harden.

924
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:27,960
- I'll put it aside.
- Okay.

925
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,859
I'll clean the cutting board.

926
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,959
(Cleaning up after the students)

927
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,730
We'll work on the pumpkin now.

928
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,670
She's doing... That's the best.

929
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,669
He says the lady in the middle is doing best.

930
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,509
Sir, would you like another plate?

931
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,311
Here you go.

932
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,550
Kyun, check the water.

933
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,650
Does everyone have a pumpkin?

934
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,351
Here, tell them.

935
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,819
Around this big.

936
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,491
They need to be even in size.

937
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:56,290
Can you see it?

938
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:57,491
Just like five pieces.

939
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,931
(Sighing)

940
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,630
This is way too hard.

941
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:04,900
I told him to go slowly.

942
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,630
He couldn't wait for them to taste it.

943
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:11,371
He seemed very excited.

944
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,110
- And then...
- Next.

945
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,680
- Gently...
- Wait.

946
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:16,880
Wait a bit.

947
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:21,010
I know how you feel.

948
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:25,650
Now, we'll knead the remaining third piece.

949
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,590
(Do what?)

950
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:32,730
Roll it thinly.

951
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,729
Keep rolling it until it becomes thin.

952
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,530
Keep rolling it.

953
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,630
Make it long.

954
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,940
- Keep rolling it.
- Like a snake.

955
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,569
(I see.)

956
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,710
(Thanks to Eddie and Yo Han's lesson...)

957
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,270
- Like a snake.
- Like a snake.

958
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,439
- Keep rolling it.
- Just keep rolling it.

959
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,910
Make it long like a snake.

960
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:54,009
(They successfully hunt 6 snakes.)

961
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,250
(Country members' cooking class is back on track.)

962
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:59,320
Okay, next up. Now, we're going to make gnocchi.

963
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:02,190
Cut it into equal-sized pieces.

964
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,891
(He is doing great. He can cook gnocchi on top of ramyeon now.)

965
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,530
You've made this before, haven't you?

966
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,700
- This? No.
- You're really good at it.

967
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:14,431
- I'm not.
- You're really good.

968
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,000
You're great with a knife.

969
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:19,340
You sure cook often.

970
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,271
You weren't lying when you said that.

971
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,379
(Compliments make grandpas dance.)

972
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,210
As they made potato gnocchi for the first time,

973
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,251
they had so much fun...

974
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,620
and were fascinated by it.

975
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,121
I personally found it very lovely.

976
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,690
You're doing great, ma'am.

977
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,991
The tip isn't pretty, so let's put it aside.

978
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,589
(Approaching)

979
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,959
Does it look strange?

980
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,201
Not at all. It's so pretty.

981
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,300
You look amazing today.

982
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,670
You're so beautiful.

983
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,340
I see, you're beautiful every day.

984
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,540
(How sweet of him.)

985
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,210
Next, we'll work on the pumpkin.

986
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:00,550
Just take your spoon.

987
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,979
Take a little piece.

988
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,080
Like this, take one scoop each, starting from the edge.

989
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:07,689
Put it down like how you did with the dough.

990
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,190
For the chestnuts, cut them in half.

991
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,260
Cut the chestnuts in half.

992
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:16,300
(This is easy.)

993
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,200
(Pumpkins and chestnuts are easily done.)

994
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:22,170
- It's easy if you use your hands.
- Okay.

995
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,241
Does everybody have this one ready?

996
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:28,709
(Put pumpkin, chestnuts, and butter, and you're ready for gnocchi!)

997
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,911
Okay. Ready?

998
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:32,040
- Let's keep going.
- Is everyone ready?

999
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,180
- Yes.
- Then we'll keep going.

1000
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:36,581
Let's check. Everybody's water should be boiling.

1001
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:38,420
Is everyone's water boiling?

1002
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,721
(Checking the temperature)

1003
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,820
And we're going to think about it.

1004
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,991
Once we start,

1005
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,890
it will be a mess.

1006
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,100
When we put this in, it will become a mess.

1007
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,330
(It will become a mess?)

1008
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:53,700
And when the gnocchi floats...

1009
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:55,371
When the gnocchi floats...

1010
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:57,241
We'll wait one minute.

1011
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:59,070
We'll wait one minute.

1012
00:37:59,471 --> 00:38:01,040
And we can take it out.

1013
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,680
- We can take it out.
- We'll take it out immediately.

1014
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:03,939
After taking it out, do I put it in here?

1015
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,209
(Do I put it in the frying pan after taking it out?)

1016
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,009
But you can't leave the gnocchi in the water for too long...

1017
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,221
or it's going to fall apart.

1018
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,880
You must be quick.

1019
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,890
Wait. Let us take deep breaths first.

1020
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,220
I think we were taking deep breaths for this.

1021
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:18,420
Hold it in your hand and get yourselves ready.

1022
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,229
(The seniors become serious too.)

1023
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,260
- Let's start now. Please focus.
- Are you ready?

1024
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,670
Hold your plate.

1025
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,670
Ma'am. Let's try.

1026
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,871
Hold your plate.

1027
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,540
- Open the lid.
- Ready?

1028
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,339
- Let's do it together.
- We'll all put it in together.

1029
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,771
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1030
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,480
Put it in.

1031
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:38,880
Put it in quickly.

1032
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:40,951
At once.

1033
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,220
Now, give it one stir with your spoon.

1034
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,491
Stir it once with your spoon so it doesn't stick to the pot.

1035
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,290
Stir it with your spoon.

1036
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,820
With a spoon.

1037
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:54,491
Stir it for one minute so it doesn't stick.

1038
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,161
It shouldn't get stuck.

1039
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:58,630
Is this cooked?

1040
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,900
I think this is cooked.

1041
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,541
(Put the frying pan with pumpkin, chestnuts, and butter on the stove!)

1042
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:09,310
Did the butter melt thoroughly?

1043
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:11,379
Use the sieve. Add them all at once.

1044
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,650
Take them out with a sieve and put them in at once.

1045
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,419
(What's important now?)

1046
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,049
(Being speedy!)

1047
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,650
(She shakes off the water.)

1048
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,960
Think of it as frying it with butter.

1049
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,189
You're doing so well.

1050
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,000
(Gnocchi has finally moved into the pan.)

1051
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:30,800
That looks great.

1052
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,600
It may seem a bit oily.

1053
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:36,200
- Yes, like this.
- But...

1054
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:37,240
(Cook it thoroughly so it doesn't get burned.)

1055
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,271
In a way, you deep-fry it.

1056
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,510
Look at him. He's so good.

1057
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:47,479
(I am Jeongseon Matfia!)

1058
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,509
(He's pretty good.)

1059
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,650
Copy him.

1060
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,621
I'll just do this.

1061
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,020
And right before we finish,

1062
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:57,060
one more time.

1063
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,629
- When everything is cooked well, - Salt.

1064
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,060
- you add salt.
- This...

1065
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:04,359
(Everyone, focus!)

1066
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,501
Make a cool pose while you do it.

1067
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,370
(Copying his friend)

1068
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,541
Add salt like this.

1069
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:12,140
Make a cool pose.

1070
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:14,009
(Look at me, I'm cool.)

1071
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,810
- That's good.
- That's it.

1072
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:17,680
You look so cool.

1073
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,940
Lift your arm higher.

1074
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,010
(A wrist snap for the gnocchi. Perfect.)

1075
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,851
(He's cooler than me!)

1076
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:25,750
Try this.

1077
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:26,851
Put your arm up high.

1078
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,521
- Beautiful.
- Nice.

1079
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,960
Last one.

1080
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,790
Crown daisy.

1081
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,600
(The final ingredient, crown daisy)

1082
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,660
Add it from above.

1083
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,230
We'll cook it together.

1084
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,330
And it's finished.

1085
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:44,300
(Add salt and crown daisy and stir-fry it, and it's done.)

1086
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:47,310
Crown daisy gets soggy quickly,

1087
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,509
so plate it after stir-frying it once.

1088
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,310
If your gnocchi is cooked, that is.

1089
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:52,550
(Crown daisy cooks fast, so plate it nicely and quickly!)

1090
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:54,750
That's right.

1091
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:58,080
(The seniors can do it without looking at him now.)

1092
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,420
Gosh, it's beautiful.

1093
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,390
(Is it really their first time? It looks surprisingly delicious.)

1094
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:06,330
- Okay, the final step.
- The final step.

1095
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,359
Cheese.

1096
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,890
Pick up the cheese.

1097
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:11,830
Add cheese as little or as much as you want.

1098
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:15,070
Add as much cheese as you like.

1099
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,170
I like a lot of cheese.

1100
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,641
(He adds a generous amount.)

1101
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:24,681
Sir, do you like cheese?

1102
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,779
- Do you like cheese?
- Yes, I like it.

1103
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,380
Then you can add a lot.

1104
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:32,351
(Gangwon Province's cheese lover adds a lot too.)

1105
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,090
(I just want a little.)

1106
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,520
(They add cheese as much as they like.)

1107
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:40,859
- She's professional.
- She's really good.

1108
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,891
The best.

1109
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:43,530
- My gosh.
- Here.

1110
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:45,331
You're a pro.

1111
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,971
They said I did it better than the chef.

1112
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:50,970
It makes me really happy.

1113
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:52,541
(Gnocchi, the perfect food she found after 70 years)

1114
00:41:52,871 --> 00:41:54,339
The chef went too fast,

1115
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,710
so catching up with him was tough.

1116
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:59,180
I give myself an 80 out of 100.

1117
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:00,510
(20 points is his will to improve.)

1118
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,980
It was the first in my entire life.

1119
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,721
I will forever remember this moment.

1120
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,391
I better try cooking it at home...

1121
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:09,661
for my wife.

1122
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,760
I didn't know this could be made with potatoes.

1123
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,129
It was a valuable class.

1124
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,200
I found it interesting and fun.

1125
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,630
(You're not the potato I knew.)

1126
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,740
(An unforgettable cooking class, Everyone's potato gnocchi)

1127
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:27,840
(What does the gnocchi taste like to the elders?)

1128
00:42:28,141 --> 00:42:29,280
What's that?

1129
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:31,411
Let's try it.

1130
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,911
- All right.
- Let's do it.

1131
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,250
Lastly,

1132
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:37,479
- taste what you have made.
- Okay.

1133
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,951
It's the most important moment.

1134
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:40,851
(A cute bite)

1135
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,089
(Eating like the chef)

1136
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,430
Shouldn't we share it?

1137
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,730
But, it's...

1138
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,000
Try it.

1139
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,701
(How does their first gnocchi taste?)

1140
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:54,900
(Curious)

1141
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,040
(Nervous)

1142
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,470
(Will they like it?)

1143
00:42:58,471 --> 00:43:01,370
(What do you think?)

1144
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,440
(Thinking)

1145
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,911
How is it?

1146
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:07,350
(Will the elders like...)

1147
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,351
(the Western-style gnocchi?)

1148
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:10,121
It's delicious.

1149
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,850
(Eating)

1150
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:14,020
It's delicious.

1151
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:16,259
(Smiling brightly)

1152
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,819
It's good.

1153
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,291
You should make it for your wife.

1154
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,690
Right?

1155
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:21,891
(I'll get brownie points from my wife.)

1156
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:23,530
May I try it?

1157
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,931
- It's good.
- It's delicious.

1158
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,201
It's good.

1159
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:30,670
- I want to taste it.
- It's so good.

1160
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,170
- May I try one?
- Go ahead.

1161
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:36,340
- We made it well.
- It's good.

1162
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,340
- It's so delicious.
- Because...

1163
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,251
the potatoes are high-quality,

1164
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,779
you can really taste the potatoes.

1165
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,991
(Gangwon province potatoes and their cooking skills are art.)

1166
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:48,890
(Gangwon Province potatoes are the best.)

1167
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:50,561
Really. The best one.

1168
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,089
Making this today was chaotic, wasn't it?

1169
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,090
Gosh, yes.

1170
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,701
- But they turned out great, right?
- Yes.

1171
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,959
The butter makes it much better.

1172
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,101
- Isn't it savory?
- Yes.

1173
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,500
- It's good, right?
- You cooked it well.

1174
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:06,641
It turned out great.

1175
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,280
Even though I made it, it turned out amazing.

1176
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,751
May I try it too?

1177
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,480
Thank you.

1178
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:17,920
- It's so good, chef.
- I agree.

1179
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:19,120
Isn't it good?

1180
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:20,190
(Amazed)

1181
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,360
(Eating)

1182
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,420
(Impressed)

1183
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,360
Isn't it quite simple to make?

1184
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:31,060
- After all, you know how to cook.
- It's simple...

1185
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:32,061
and good.

1186
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:35,069
I can make it at home, now that I know the recipe.

1187
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,640
Yes. Will you remember it?

1188
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:37,641
- Yes.
- Good.

1189
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:38,871
It's quite easy.

1190
00:44:38,872 --> 00:44:40,410
- I'll make sure to make it.
- Okay.

1191
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,440
Thank you.

1192
00:44:42,371 --> 00:44:45,040
(The first cooking class left everyone happy.)

1193
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:47,380
His daughter-in-law is a teacher.

1194
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,509
An English teacher.

1195
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,121
- So he must be good at this.
- Really?

1196
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,581
He's an English teacher.

1197
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:54,220
Can you tell us how the dish is in English?

1198
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:55,521
I can't speak English.

1199
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:59,490
I can't.

1200
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,030
(Everyone lived different lives, )

1201
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:04,399
(but they all came together with a delicious dish.)

1202
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,830
What's interesting is that...

1203
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:07,629
they never made gnocchi before.

1204
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,070
But they understand the flavor.

1205
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,741
They do it their own way.

1206
00:45:10,871 --> 00:45:13,241
And they all came out a little different.

1207
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:15,870
They were so happy to taste the food,

1208
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:17,740
and they thought it was delicious.

1209
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:19,110
Seeing them smile,

1210
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,010
and have a good time, and enjoy themselves.

1211
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,621
That's what it's all about.

1212
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,490
Everyone who came said it was spectacular.

1213
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,520
It was a first for them.

1214
00:45:27,521 --> 00:45:30,420
They were going to cook it for their daughter-in-law and children.

1215
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:31,919
Everyone loved it.

1216
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,130
My daughter-in-law is an English teacher.

1217
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:38,230
When she visits, I plan to show off my skills...

1218
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,400
in making a Western dish.

1219
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,030
It was a fun class.

1220
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,501
Even though I made it, it was still good.

1221
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,371
It was chewy and soft.

1222
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,379
I really enjoyed it. It was very good.

1223
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,879
(Chef Edward Lee is the best.)

1224
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,081
For following along so well in class,

1225
00:45:54,681 --> 00:45:55,710
thank you.

1226
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:57,451
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1227
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,320
Thank you.

1228
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,689
(The first cooking class in Jeongseon...)

1229
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,420
We enjoyed the class. Thank you.

1230
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:07,790
(wrapped up well with everyone feeling warm inside.)

1231
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,130
- Great work.
- Great work.

1232
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,931
(Soon)

1233
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,830
(After the eventful day in Jeongseon, )

1234
00:46:15,831 --> 00:46:18,440
(the Country members go through...)

1235
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,010
(Screaming)

1236
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,840
(Oh, no!)

1237
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,280
(In fear)

1238
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:25,710
(What's this? What's going on?)

1239
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:28,110
(Serious)

1240
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:32,820
(What happened to the Country members?)

1241
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,351
(1 hour ago)

1242
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,121
Have you fished in winter, Kyun?

1243
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:41,030
Only one time. It was ice fishing.

1244
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:42,660
- Do you know ice fishing?
- I do.

1245
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:45,201
- Because you like fishing, - Yes?

1246
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:48,300
Yo Han came up with a plan to go fishing.

1247
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,900
Fishing is fun.

1248
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,141
(Already excited)

1249
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,770
(For the famous fish lover Eddie, )

1250
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,979
(the Country members decided to go winter fishing.)

1251
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,110
(His daughter, Arden)

1252
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,380
None of you have fished in winter, right?

1253
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,751
- No.
- I've never fished before.

1254
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,121
Really?

1255
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,621
This will be my first time winter fishing.

1256
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:10,121
Let's give it a shot today.

1257
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,561
- Okay.
- We'll see what fish we can catch.

1258
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,161
Who...

1259
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:18,899
The biggest fish.

1260
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,000
- Who'll catch it?
- Yes.

1261
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:21,129
How about we make a bet?

1262
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,799
- On who'll catch the biggest fish?
- Yes.

1263
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,900
Yes.

1264
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,170
- Fishing without a bet is boring.
- True.

1265
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,510
(He's getting competitive.)

1266
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,840
What's the reward?

1267
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:33,050
How about this? The prize is Chef's special recipe.

1268
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:34,879
How about this?

1269
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,050
(Si A's bold suggestion)

1270
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,189
- Nice.
- Okay.

1271
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,260
- I'm in.
- Yes.

1272
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:45,760
I'm going to do my best.

1273
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,291
Same here.

1274
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,661
I was a fisherman in "The Book of Fish."

1275
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:51,400
I know about fish.

1276
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,471
(Either way, I'll come in 1st place.)

1277
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,900
(Who will be the winner of today's showdown?)

1278
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,741
(The emerald-colored sea unfolds before their eyes.)

1279
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,181
(The place that will offer the members another taste.)

1280
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,880
(Gangneung Port, Gangwon Province's fishing port)

1281
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,681
(The East Sea is a must for fishers fishing in winter!)

1282
00:48:11,451 --> 00:48:13,390
(Gangneung is especially known for cod fishing.)

1283
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,820
It's 2m long.

1284
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18,689
(Cod: Commonly caught along the East Sea in winter)

1285
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,530
(Known for its exceptionally light and clean taste)

1286
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,459
- All right. Shall we get off?
- Let's do it.

1287
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,630
(Will the members catch fish?)

1288
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,630
A Welsh Corgi.

1289
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:30,971
Hi.

1290
00:48:32,271 --> 00:48:33,410
- Hi, buddy.
- It's a puppy.

1291
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,270
- It's so cute.
- Hi.

1292
00:48:35,271 --> 00:48:37,980
- He's full of cuteness.
- Who are you?

1293
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:39,850
Come here. Give me a kiss.

1294
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:41,550
- He loves people.
- Give me a kiss.

1295
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:43,851
Give me a kiss.

1296
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,880
(Charging at her)

1297
00:48:46,521 --> 00:48:48,120
Goodness.

1298
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:49,121
(Both of them are cute.)

1299
00:48:49,122 --> 00:48:50,161
I want to keep it.

1300
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:53,129
(Loving her nonstop)

1301
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,291
Gosh, your hat.

1302
00:48:55,491 --> 00:48:56,530
How cute.

1303
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:59,000
Stop playing around. We have work to do.

1304
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:00,130
Okay. Let's go.

1305
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:01,971
We have fish to catch.

1306
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,170
(Catch a big one!)

1307
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:06,100
It's the sea.

1308
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:07,440
(They arrive at the battlefield.)

1309
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,780
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1310
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,380
It's nice.

1311
00:49:12,381 --> 00:49:14,510
Take a seat. We're sailing off.

1312
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,379
(The boat has left!)

1313
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,420
Let's go.

1314
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:24,190
Do you get seasick?

1315
00:49:24,621 --> 00:49:25,791
Do you, Yo Han?

1316
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,589
I'm okay. I barely get motion sickness.

1317
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,630
Is that so?

1318
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:31,331
(Then...)

1319
00:49:31,831 --> 00:49:34,070
- You do, don't you, A Sung?
- I'm a sailor.

1320
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:35,101
Really?

1321
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:36,840
- She has a yacht.
- I have a yacht license.

1322
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:38,400
- For real?
- Yes.

1323
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,570
(A Sung has a yacht license.)

1324
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,280
(Front Runner Number 1, Ko A Sung)

1325
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:47,780
I haven't felt this in a while.

1326
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,779
(The calmness of a sailor)

1327
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,621
I used to be a fisherman.

1328
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:54,291
But I've realized something.

1329
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,959
I think I like the motion sickness.

1330
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,661
I'm enjoying this feeling.

1331
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,701
(A master doesn't speak up.)

1332
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,500
(Will Eddie's special recipe be protected...)

1333
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:10,740
(or stolen?)

1334
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,840
All right, we've come to the spot.

1335
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,771
Please come to the bow of the boat.

1336
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,439
The waves are too rough.

1337
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,680
(The waves are rougher than expected.)

1338
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,780
Do people fish in these waves?

1339
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,911
- Of course.
- Gosh.

1340
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,150
I'll teach you how to fish first.

1341
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:25,520
- Lock the ring on top of the metal.
- Okay.

1342
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:27,419
- Lock it.
- Okay.

1343
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,990
What about the float?

1344
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,819
- And the bait. Do we not use one?
- This is the bait.

1345
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,820
- Really?
- Yes.

1346
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,820
It looks so cool.

1347
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,660
- The cod will see this metal...
- It won't be a hassle.

1348
00:50:34,661 --> 00:50:35,860
And bite the hook.

1349
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,860
- Let me give you a demonstration.
- Okay.

1350
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,729
If the fishing line stops going down,

1351
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:41,930
- it has reached the bottom.
- Okay.

1352
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:44,540
Once it's down, move the rod up and down.

1353
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,710
- Okay.
- Up and down.

1354
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:48,271
That's how you get the feel of the fish, right?

1355
00:50:49,741 --> 00:50:51,880
(Fishing has officially started.)

1356
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,110
(Who will catch the biggest fish?)

1357
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,621
(Candidate 1: A Sung, a yacht license holder)

1358
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,149
(Candidate 2: Eddie, Kentucky's fishing king)

1359
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:04,161
(Getting started with his face)

1360
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:07,230
(Candidate 3: Yo Han, the fishing king in a movie)

1361
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,491
(Candidate 4: Si A, a rookie fisher)

1362
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,300
Captain. Does it feel heavy when the fish bites the bait?

1363
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,570
Yes, it is.

1364
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,271
I think I've caught something.

1365
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,041
(Yo Han already felt something?)

1366
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,210
Hold on.

1367
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,241
Why?

1368
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,710
(Keeping in check)

1369
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:29,081
Hold on.

1370
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:32,021
My rod is bent right now.

1371
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,090
(Yo Han's rod is bending like a bow.)

1372
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:36,990
You got something?

1373
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:37,991
(Glancing)

1374
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,690
That's just the weight of the rod.

1375
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:43,400
The weight of the metal.

1376
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,061
So it has to feel heavier?

1377
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:47,899
(That was short-lived.)

1378
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,940
Over here! A hit!

1379
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,270
- What?
- Really?

1380
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:52,570
A hit! Okay!

1381
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:56,292
Over here! A hit!

1382
00:51:56,453 --> 00:51:57,663
- What?
- Really?

1383
00:51:57,763 --> 00:51:58,863
A hit! Okay!

1384
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:01,493
- A hit!
- Really?

1385
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:03,162
(It's Sailor A Sung!)

1386
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:04,163
This right here.

1387
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:07,332
A big one's coming!

1388
00:52:08,002 --> 00:52:09,033
Hang on.

1389
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:12,573
Slowly.

1390
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:14,243
She caught one.

1391
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:17,482
Slowly. You're going too fast.

1392
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:20,251
It's heavy.

1393
00:52:20,252 --> 00:52:21,882
(The fish on the line is heavy.)

1394
00:52:22,882 --> 00:52:24,252
(She actually caught one?)

1395
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:26,691
Slowly. You're almost there.

1396
00:52:26,692 --> 00:52:27,722
(What did A Sung catch?)

1397
00:52:27,723 --> 00:52:29,863
Stop.

1398
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:32,263
Okay. Release the line.

1399
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:34,393
Okay.

1400
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:36,062
It's big.

1401
00:52:37,732 --> 00:52:39,332
It's a big one.

1402
00:52:44,843 --> 00:52:47,842
(A Sung has successfully caught a cod!)

1403
00:52:47,843 --> 00:52:49,212
Cod!

1404
00:52:54,152 --> 00:52:57,582
(Current in 1st place with a cod around 50cm)

1405
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:00,993
My motion sickness is bad.

1406
00:53:02,953 --> 00:53:04,622
(Forget about the hit and whatnot.)

1407
00:53:04,623 --> 00:53:05,791
(Si A wants to go back to land.)

1408
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,993
If your motion sickness is too bad,

1409
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:10,002
- you can stay inside.
- Okay.

1410
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:12,731
(Will the rookie fisher Si A...)

1411
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,171
Gosh.

1412
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:15,172
(give up like this?)

1413
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:17,802
(Si A might end up like a cod.)

1414
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:20,542
(Swaying)

1415
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:26,283
(Suffering from motion sickness, and not from fishing cod)

1416
00:53:30,453 --> 00:53:34,222
(Si A has left the fishing showdown.)

1417
00:53:34,223 --> 00:53:35,223
(Currently in 1st place with a cod around 50cm)

1418
00:53:35,224 --> 00:53:37,623
(Eliminated due to motion sickness)

1419
00:53:38,123 --> 00:53:39,691
(Aiming for a bigger fish)

1420
00:53:39,692 --> 00:53:41,332
(Wrinkling his brows out of desperation)

1421
00:53:43,462 --> 00:53:44,962
Hold on.

1422
00:53:46,562 --> 00:53:48,901
(Maybe not?)

1423
00:53:48,902 --> 00:53:50,902
I think I've caught something.

1424
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:54,143
(You too, Yo Han?)

1425
00:53:54,513 --> 00:53:56,542
My rod is bent right now.

1426
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:01,482
(Is it a real cod this time?)

1427
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:04,053
You got something?

1428
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:06,151
No. Not yet.

1429
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:07,623
(Deluding himself of the sensation)

1430
00:54:08,522 --> 00:54:10,993
(I've got nowhere to back down to now.)

1431
00:54:12,062 --> 00:54:13,692
(20 minutes later)

1432
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:17,433
(Gangwon Province's winter sea is minus 8°C.)

1433
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:20,502
(Eddie is fighting alone against the Korean winter sea.)

1434
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:23,172
(30 minutes later)

1435
00:54:24,902 --> 00:54:27,643
I was a fisherman in a movie.

1436
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:31,981
When it comes to fishing, it's about who is more patient.

1437
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:32,982
(Fishing is a battle of patience.)

1438
00:54:36,183 --> 00:54:40,792
(I must win in the fight against me.)

1439
00:54:43,893 --> 00:54:47,263
(40 minutes later)

1440
00:54:49,393 --> 00:54:53,062
(The two men have yet to feel the thrill of fishing.)

1441
00:54:55,132 --> 00:54:58,572
(Their pride is on the line now.)

1442
00:54:58,573 --> 00:55:02,772
(Who will win this battle?)

1443
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:08,283
I think I've got something.

1444
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:09,453
Did you catch one?

1445
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:10,581
(He caught one?)

1446
00:55:10,582 --> 00:55:11,582
Really?

1447
00:55:12,553 --> 00:55:15,852
(Eddie winds up the fishing rod.)

1448
00:55:16,553 --> 00:55:19,263
(Yo Han is starting to become impatient.)

1449
00:55:20,462 --> 00:55:21,462
(Full of confidence)

1450
00:55:21,462 --> 00:55:22,462
Okay.

1451
00:55:23,163 --> 00:55:24,163
It's coming.

1452
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,363
It's coming.

1453
00:55:27,303 --> 00:55:28,331
Really?

1454
00:55:28,332 --> 00:55:29,902
(Something has been caught!)

1455
00:55:30,343 --> 00:55:32,302
- Really.
- Chef must've caught one.

1456
00:55:32,303 --> 00:55:34,211
- It's coming.
- He caught one.

1457
00:55:34,212 --> 00:55:35,212
Over here!

1458
00:55:36,013 --> 00:55:39,442
(The result of being patient is catching a cod.)

1459
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:41,113
Give me a net.

1460
00:55:41,114 --> 00:55:42,913
- It's a big one.
- Gosh.

1461
00:55:43,212 --> 00:55:44,552
- It's big.
- Over here.

1462
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:47,251
(It's huge even at a glance.)

1463
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:50,122
- Okay.
- Okay.

1464
00:55:50,123 --> 00:55:51,123
(A big catch)

1465
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:53,593
Nice!

1466
00:55:56,832 --> 00:55:58,662
Oh, my gosh. It's beautiful.

1467
00:55:58,663 --> 00:55:59,663
(Sulking)

1468
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:01,101
(The dignity of a fishing master)

1469
00:56:01,102 --> 00:56:02,232
(See this, Yo Han?)

1470
00:56:02,632 --> 00:56:04,743
(He caught a huge cod during his first Korean winter fishing.)

1471
00:56:05,473 --> 00:56:07,242
(Feeling jealous)

1472
00:56:07,243 --> 00:56:08,771
(Congratulations!)

1473
00:56:08,772 --> 00:56:09,812
Okay. Come on.

1474
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:15,151
From the bottom... All of a sudden, I felt it.

1475
00:56:15,152 --> 00:56:16,183
(It felt amazing.)

1476
00:56:16,852 --> 00:56:19,652
(It's much bigger than A Sung's, even at a glance.)

1477
00:56:20,393 --> 00:56:21,722
(Currently in 1st place with a cod around 1m)

1478
00:56:21,723 --> 00:56:22,952
(Currently in 2nd place with a cod around 50cm)

1479
00:56:22,953 --> 00:56:24,062
(Eliminated due to motion sickness)

1480
00:56:24,562 --> 00:56:26,593
(I'm the only one without a cod.)

1481
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:31,962
(However, Yo Han never gives up.)

1482
00:56:33,832 --> 00:56:35,473
(1 hour later)

1483
00:56:36,132 --> 00:56:38,203
(The fishing king hasn't given up on his dream.)

1484
00:56:38,573 --> 00:56:39,573
(At that moment)

1485
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:40,573
(Shouting)

1486
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:47,053
(A cod has finally come to me!)

1487
00:56:51,022 --> 00:56:54,053
It's been an hour. What will become of my hour-long patience?

1488
00:56:57,763 --> 00:56:59,723
It's heavy. What if it's a whale?

1489
00:57:03,232 --> 00:57:04,363
I caught one!

1490
00:57:04,732 --> 00:57:06,033
(It's quite small.)

1491
00:57:06,763 --> 00:57:08,402
(Why is this happening to me?)

1492
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:10,001
Strike a pose.

1493
00:57:10,002 --> 00:57:11,102
(It's cold. Let's go back.)

1494
00:57:11,672 --> 00:57:13,102
I've caught a Spanish mackerel.

1495
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:15,413
- Cod.
- A cod.

1496
00:57:16,312 --> 00:57:17,811
It's because of my motion sickness.

1497
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:18,812
(Blaming his motion sickness)

1498
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:22,513
(Eddie wins with an overwhelmingly big fish!)

1499
00:57:23,312 --> 00:57:24,782
I don't want to brag too much,

1500
00:57:24,783 --> 00:57:26,752
but I caught the biggest one.

1501
00:57:27,752 --> 00:57:29,352
Yo Han is a fisherman.

1502
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:32,222
I'm sorry, but he's also an actor.

1503
00:57:32,223 --> 00:57:33,362
He was playing a fisherman.

1504
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:34,593
I'm a real fisherman.

1505
00:57:35,593 --> 00:57:37,703
So that's what he said.

1506
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:40,631
As Korea is a country of courteous people,

1507
00:57:40,632 --> 00:57:43,072
I fished...

1508
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:44,542
while respecting the elders.

1509
00:57:44,772 --> 00:57:47,942
Even when I felt the fish pulling my rod, I waited.

1510
00:57:48,613 --> 00:57:49,913
I waited until Kyun caught one.

1511
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:53,282
To think he'd be happy.

1512
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:55,413
(I'm fine as long as Kyun is happy.)

1513
00:57:56,582 --> 00:57:59,683
(After the 3rd day which was choppy like the waves...)

1514
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:03,421
(The Country members returned to their house...)

1515
00:58:03,422 --> 00:58:05,093
(after the intense fishing battle.)

1516
00:58:06,123 --> 00:58:08,893
(A simple joy in life that will melt their cold bodies)

1517
00:58:09,863 --> 00:58:12,533
How many cups of coffee do we make?

1518
00:58:12,703 --> 00:58:14,232
- Let's make four.
- Okay.

1519
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:16,941
See?

1520
00:58:16,942 --> 00:58:17,942
(Spilling)

1521
00:58:17,942 --> 00:58:18,942
(Surprised)

1522
00:58:20,272 --> 00:58:23,242
- Okay.
- It was too...

1523
00:58:23,243 --> 00:58:24,482
The hot water got messy.

1524
00:58:24,882 --> 00:58:27,981
After fishing, pouring water over food is a must.

1525
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,783
(Laughing)

1526
00:58:29,982 --> 00:58:32,223
Spilling water is the norm. It's okay.

1527
00:58:42,493 --> 00:58:46,001
Everyone did a great job today.

1528
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:47,032
Coffee?

1529
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:48,033
(Cheers.)

1530
00:58:48,473 --> 00:58:50,172
(Is this the taste of winning?)

1531
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:51,873
(Drinking)

1532
00:58:52,502 --> 00:58:53,812
(Drinking)

1533
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:57,812
This is what you call K-coffee.

1534
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:04,783
Gosh, it's good.

1535
00:59:05,482 --> 00:59:06,522
It's warm.

1536
00:59:07,352 --> 00:59:09,093
This is perfect for the freezing winter.

1537
00:59:09,453 --> 00:59:11,163
- You're right.
- Nothing can beat this.

1538
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:13,933
(Drinking to the last drop)

1539
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:18,803
(Amazed)

1540
00:59:19,502 --> 00:59:21,602
It has a special taste.

1541
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:23,703
- I like it.
- Right.

1542
00:59:24,402 --> 00:59:25,843
(Thumbs-up)

1543
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:28,113
(After enjoying a cup of coffee)

1544
00:59:29,513 --> 00:59:31,041
(the house is quiet.)

1545
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:32,743
(Snoring)

1546
00:59:33,382 --> 00:59:34,512
(Cooking class, Winter fishing, )

1547
00:59:34,513 --> 00:59:35,782
(Namul, Millstone)

1548
00:59:35,783 --> 00:59:38,183
(Getting a good nap)

1549
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:42,493
(Recharging from the motion sickness and cold)

1550
00:59:42,953 --> 00:59:43,961
(1 lonely person)

1551
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:46,393
(They take a break in their own way.)

1552
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:53,163
(Remember? Eddie's Country Cook recipe appears after the sun sets.)

1553
00:59:57,172 --> 00:59:59,902
(When the calm moonlight shines upon the house, )

1554
01:00:00,643 --> 01:00:03,913
(Eddie's time begins.)

1555
01:00:06,183 --> 01:00:09,113
(The friendly-looking guy appears.)

1556
01:00:11,223 --> 01:00:13,021
(What shall we have for dinner?)

1557
01:00:13,022 --> 01:00:15,493
(Scratching)

1558
01:00:16,922 --> 01:00:20,533
(He picks out ingredients after scanning the fridge.)

1559
01:00:22,393 --> 01:00:24,101
(Eddie starts cooking for...)

1560
01:00:24,102 --> 01:00:26,433
(the Country members who must be tired.)

1561
01:00:27,902 --> 01:00:31,243
(The cheerful chopping sound makes the mouth water.)

1562
01:00:36,973 --> 01:00:40,413
(What's today's dish that will soothe the tiresome day?)

1563
01:00:41,312 --> 01:00:43,552
(A Sung is up.)

1564
01:00:43,553 --> 01:00:44,683
It's a hard day.

1565
01:00:45,582 --> 01:00:47,392
(Totally.)

1566
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,152
How about I make steak...

1567
01:00:49,593 --> 01:00:50,623
and you make ramyeon?

1568
01:00:50,763 --> 01:00:52,461
- Ramyeon?
- Yes. We'll make steak and ramyeon.

1569
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:55,131
It's really great. Sounds great.

1570
01:00:55,132 --> 01:00:56,292
(The simple dishes they can cook with confidence, steak and ramyeon)

1571
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:59,632
For dinner, I wanted to make steak.

1572
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:00,933
We had a rough day.

1573
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:02,973
So I thought, "Let's just make it easy."

1574
01:01:05,303 --> 01:01:08,413
(Country members' restorative meal, Steak and ramyeon)

1575
01:01:08,772 --> 01:01:11,783
(Which ramyeon should I make?)

1576
01:01:12,683 --> 01:01:15,212
(Which ingredient did A Sung choose to make ramyeon?)

1577
01:01:15,913 --> 01:01:18,453
- Gosh. This kimchi has ripened.
- Yes.

1578
01:01:18,723 --> 01:01:19,981
(The well-ripened young radish kimchi brought by Si A)

1579
01:01:19,982 --> 01:01:21,593
- Do you want to try it?
- Yes, please.

1580
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:23,652
(Shaking)

1581
01:01:26,022 --> 01:01:27,493
My hands are shaking.

1582
01:01:28,232 --> 01:01:30,363
(The aftermath of the rough fishing in the winter sea)

1583
01:01:32,462 --> 01:01:33,462
I feel bad.

1584
01:01:33,772 --> 01:01:36,203
Si A said it was her first time fishing.

1585
01:01:37,303 --> 01:01:38,303
She caught no fish.

1586
01:01:38,973 --> 01:01:40,942
She's never going to go fishing again.

1587
01:01:41,013 --> 01:01:42,113
Never again.

1588
01:01:42,672 --> 01:01:45,013
(Si A had a bad motion sickness the whole time.)

1589
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:46,743
- It's good.
- Yes.

1590
01:01:47,013 --> 01:01:49,712
She brought very nice kimchi.

1591
01:01:50,723 --> 01:01:54,452
Usually, I put the soup of kkakdugi, the radish kimchi,

1592
01:01:54,453 --> 01:01:56,152
in ramyeon.

1593
01:01:56,553 --> 01:01:59,692
Si A brought young radish kimchi,

1594
01:02:00,123 --> 01:02:03,493
so I thought it'd be nice to use it for ramyeon.

1595
01:02:03,593 --> 01:02:05,162
That was the ramyeon I was making.

1596
01:02:05,163 --> 01:02:07,373
(A Sung has chosen to make young radish kimchi ramyeon.)

1597
01:02:08,073 --> 01:02:09,573
(Smiling like a dad)

1598
01:02:11,573 --> 01:02:14,243
You're doing it fancily. Look at you.

1599
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:15,513
What are you making?

1600
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:16,541
- You know what?
- What?

1601
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:17,542
- You made me like this.
- Okay.

1602
01:02:18,382 --> 01:02:21,152
Ramyeon can become special too.

1603
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:24,623
After cooking next to you for some time,

1604
01:02:25,453 --> 01:02:27,352
ramyeon turns into something special.

1605
01:02:27,823 --> 01:02:29,522
- We'll see today.
- Yes.

1606
01:02:32,223 --> 01:02:33,932
(Yo Han is back from his walk.)

1607
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:34,933
Gosh.

1608
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:37,862
- Hello.
- Welcome back.

1609
01:02:37,863 --> 01:02:39,501
Do you need help? What should I do?

1610
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:40,772
Is there something I can do?

1611
01:02:41,402 --> 01:02:43,842
First, you can...

1612
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,202
Will you slice this really thinly?

1613
01:02:46,203 --> 01:02:47,343
- I'll try.
- Into cubes.

1614
01:02:47,772 --> 01:02:49,372
(Yo Han receives a mission.)

1615
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:52,042
(Chop the young radish kimchi.)

1616
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:56,852
(Yo Han's cutting skill is better than expected.)

1617
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:58,822
You're so good at chopping.

1618
01:02:58,823 --> 01:03:00,652
- No. Is it good enough?
- Yes.

1619
01:03:00,852 --> 01:03:02,922
(What? He's good at chopping.)

1620
01:03:03,152 --> 01:03:04,593
- For me, - Yes?

1621
01:03:04,863 --> 01:03:07,332
Cooking started as a hobby.

1622
01:03:07,433 --> 01:03:09,093
And then it turned into a job.

1623
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:11,702
Sometimes, when it becomes your job,

1624
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:14,401
- Yes?
- it can be burdening, boring,

1625
01:03:14,402 --> 01:03:16,171
- and stressful.
- Yes.

1626
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:18,973
But I still love cooking like this.

1627
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:21,372
- It's still my favorite thing.
- Okay.

1628
01:03:21,373 --> 01:03:23,172
Cooking for a restaurant is different.

1629
01:03:25,243 --> 01:03:26,513
I love cooking at home.

1630
01:03:26,613 --> 01:03:27,652
I see.

1631
01:03:28,953 --> 01:03:29,981
(It's a relaxing time for Eddie.)

1632
01:03:29,982 --> 01:03:31,053
What mushroom is that?

1633
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:33,053
These? King oyster mushrooms.

1634
01:03:33,323 --> 01:03:34,622
(Si A who has struggled all day due to motion sickness)

1635
01:03:34,623 --> 01:03:35,752
Aren't those button mushrooms?

1636
01:03:37,893 --> 01:03:39,692
Today, take it easy.

1637
01:03:40,123 --> 01:03:41,291
- Okay.
- We'll cook for you.

1638
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:43,191
No. I'm okay now.

1639
01:03:43,192 --> 01:03:44,232
No.

1640
01:03:44,832 --> 01:03:47,163
- Edward will cook steak.
- I want to help.

1641
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:50,033
- Goodness.
- We just need to cook ramyeon.

1642
01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:52,803
I don't want ramyeon as a meal. I want it as a dish.

1643
01:03:52,902 --> 01:03:54,643
- A ramyeon dish.
- It's ramyeon but a dish.

1644
01:03:54,913 --> 01:03:58,743
Then should we make two different ramyeons...

1645
01:03:58,843 --> 01:03:59,882
separately?

1646
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:04,623
- Two different ramyeons? Fancy.
- Yes. Should we make...

1647
01:04:04,723 --> 01:04:06,453
ramyeon with pollack roe, garlic, and scallions?

1648
01:04:06,482 --> 01:04:09,123
When you have ramyeon in Korea, how do you cook it?

1649
01:04:09,223 --> 01:04:11,291
We have various ways.

1650
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:13,123
It depends on your preference.

1651
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:15,593
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1652
01:04:16,593 --> 01:04:18,732
Chef, you look...

1653
01:04:19,402 --> 01:04:20,832
(Eddie looks haggard.)

1654
01:04:22,703 --> 01:04:23,703
Why? What happened?

1655
01:04:24,473 --> 01:04:25,473
It's nothing.

1656
01:04:25,803 --> 01:04:27,202
You don't look so well.

1657
01:04:27,203 --> 01:04:28,643
(Frank Si A)

1658
01:04:28,873 --> 01:04:30,573
Right now? Is it puffy?

1659
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:32,612
- I think it's because you're tired.
- Right. Because I'm tired.

1660
01:04:32,613 --> 01:04:35,712
Today, I'll make restorative ramyeon...

1661
01:04:36,482 --> 01:04:38,152
that will blow your fatigue away.

1662
01:04:39,352 --> 01:04:41,452
It'll be appeasing.

1663
01:04:41,453 --> 01:04:43,452
- Please look forward to it.
- That sounds delicious.

1664
01:04:43,453 --> 01:04:45,163
It's my first time making it, though.

1665
01:04:45,363 --> 01:04:47,832
But I'm bursting with ideas right now.

1666
01:04:48,533 --> 01:04:51,802
(A Sung starts to focus on cooking the ramyeon dish too.)

1667
01:04:51,803 --> 01:04:53,402
I'll do the dishes right away.

1668
01:04:53,502 --> 01:04:54,502
Okay.

1669
01:04:54,703 --> 01:04:56,732
It feels like we're more relaxed now.

1670
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:59,672
(Yo Han assists 3 chefs.)

1671
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:02,973
(By the way, do you hear something delicious?)

1672
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,612
(It's the sound of onions getting sauteed.)

1673
01:05:05,613 --> 01:05:07,882
- Are you caramelizing it?
- Yes. Onions.

1674
01:05:08,553 --> 01:05:10,283
- Do you like it?
- Yes. I love it.

1675
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:11,783
Oh, my gosh.

1676
01:05:11,784 --> 01:05:13,651
- It's for the steak.
- Slowly. Yes. With the steak.

1677
01:05:13,652 --> 01:05:16,652
- Yes.
- You have to do it slowly.

1678
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:18,622
And stir all the time.

1679
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,493
(Here's the recipe for onion garnish that requires Eddie's long effort!)

1680
01:05:21,533 --> 01:05:22,533
(Garnish:)

1681
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:24,331
(The food added for decoration to emphasize the shape and color...)

1682
01:05:24,332 --> 01:05:26,163
(of the main dish and to make it tastier.)

1683
01:05:28,073 --> 01:05:31,442
(First, sautee the onions until they turn brown over low heat.)

1684
01:05:33,703 --> 01:05:36,441
(A piece of butter)

1685
01:05:36,442 --> 01:05:38,842
(A drizzle of soy sauce)

1686
01:05:38,843 --> 01:05:41,981
(A spoonful of gochujang)

1687
01:05:41,982 --> 01:05:45,622
(A drizzle of vinegar)

1688
01:05:45,623 --> 01:05:48,192
(A little bit of salt)

1689
01:05:49,553 --> 01:05:51,962
(Then sautee them with care.)

1690
01:05:54,132 --> 01:05:57,632
(Lastly, add white wine to bring out the flavors.)

1691
01:06:03,132 --> 01:06:04,373
It looks like jeotgal.

1692
01:06:05,502 --> 01:06:06,572
(The first garnish)

1693
01:06:06,573 --> 01:06:08,812
(Caramelized onions that look like jeotgal)

1694
01:06:09,473 --> 01:06:11,783
(It looks good.)

1695
01:06:11,982 --> 01:06:13,182
(Do you want to see something that looks better?)

1696
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:14,283
Okay. Yes.

1697
01:06:14,882 --> 01:06:17,152
I'll show you my secret weapon.

1698
01:06:20,453 --> 01:06:24,062
He taught us such an unforgettable sauce.

1699
01:06:25,522 --> 01:06:28,433
(The secret ingredient that shocked everyone)

1700
01:06:30,132 --> 01:06:33,502
(Eddie's secret weapon: Pickled garlic)

1701
01:06:35,933 --> 01:06:40,142
(All you need are pickled garlic...)

1702
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:43,442
(and water.)

1703
01:06:46,642 --> 01:06:48,913
(Eddie grabs a hand blender.)

1704
01:06:49,883 --> 01:06:51,522
- Do you blend it?
- Yes.

1705
01:06:52,953 --> 01:06:54,293
- I want to see...
- Do you want me to hold it?

1706
01:06:54,392 --> 01:06:56,793
- Yes.
- this technique.

1707
01:07:01,262 --> 01:07:05,163
(Is he blending the pickled garlic with the hand blender?)

1708
01:07:06,203 --> 01:07:08,333
- I've never seen such a thing.
- Exactly.

1709
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:12,402
I always liked pickled garlic.

1710
01:07:12,972 --> 01:07:14,243
But blending it...

1711
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:17,312
is something I've never thought of before.

1712
01:07:19,543 --> 01:07:22,482
I thought, "He surely is a cooking genius."

1713
01:07:23,652 --> 01:07:24,652
Taste it.

1714
01:07:27,052 --> 01:07:28,052
(Savoring)

1715
01:07:29,552 --> 01:07:30,692
(Dilated pupils)

1716
01:07:32,022 --> 01:07:33,592
- Is it good?
- Goodness.

1717
01:07:34,432 --> 01:07:35,432
It's so good.

1718
01:07:36,232 --> 01:07:37,832
- It's so tasty.
- Seriously.

1719
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,032
(It's so magical that it weakens her knees.)

1720
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:41,002
- It's so tasty.
- It's so good.

1721
01:07:41,003 --> 01:07:43,572
When I go back to Seoul,

1722
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:45,302
and even when this show is over,

1723
01:07:45,673 --> 01:07:47,243
I'm going to make it again.

1724
01:07:48,342 --> 01:07:51,182
For anything I want flavors, I add this.

1725
01:07:51,743 --> 01:07:55,152
Like in risotto, I add a little bit of this.

1726
01:07:55,383 --> 01:07:58,221
- To add a tang?
- It can be used for everything.

1727
01:07:58,222 --> 01:07:59,652
It gives it that flavor.

1728
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,423
It's my favorite.

1729
01:08:02,892 --> 01:08:05,863
(When you add soy sauce to blended pickled garlic...)

1730
01:08:08,493 --> 01:08:13,503
(The second garnish: All-purpose pickled garlic sauce)

1731
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,172
(The third garnish:)

1732
01:08:19,173 --> 01:08:22,613
(Curry cauliflower with ramyeon)

1733
01:08:26,043 --> 01:08:28,552
(The 3 types of garnish for steak are ready.)

1734
01:08:29,812 --> 01:08:30,851
Perfect.

1735
01:08:30,852 --> 01:08:31,982
(Team Ramyeon can't lose!)

1736
01:08:32,222 --> 01:08:34,022
Why are you peeling garlic, Si A?

1737
01:08:34,522 --> 01:08:38,722
I want to make ramyeon with squid, pollack roe, and garlic.

1738
01:08:39,192 --> 01:08:41,663
When I was in Goseong, I watched the sea...

1739
01:08:41,892 --> 01:08:44,762
while eating squid ramyeon, and it was lovely.

1740
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:47,702
I thought it'd be nice for Chef to have that experience too.

1741
01:08:47,703 --> 01:08:50,033
That was why I went for it.

1742
01:08:50,772 --> 01:08:52,072
(Reinterpreting the taste from her memories)

1743
01:08:52,073 --> 01:08:55,012
(How will Si A's ramyeon with squid, pollack roe, and garlic taste?)

1744
01:08:55,442 --> 01:08:57,312
I'm going to make white ramyeon.

1745
01:08:57,442 --> 01:08:58,582
White ramyeon?

1746
01:08:58,583 --> 01:08:59,713
Yes. White ramyeon.

1747
01:08:59,812 --> 01:09:01,113
I've never heard that before.

1748
01:09:01,283 --> 01:09:03,482
It's a recipe I just came up with.

1749
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:05,352
So it might not taste good.

1750
01:09:06,283 --> 01:09:08,351
After sauteeing pollack roe and garlic,

1751
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:10,722
are you going to put them on ramyeon in the end?

1752
01:09:11,623 --> 01:09:13,191
- Not necessarily.
- Then how?

1753
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:14,362
- That sounds good, though.
- What?

1754
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:16,632
- It sounds good.
- You can caramelize it first.

1755
01:09:16,633 --> 01:09:17,801
Then add water.

1756
01:09:17,802 --> 01:09:19,332
- Cook ramyeon and finish it...
- It sounds good.

1757
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:20,463
With the pollack roe.

1758
01:09:20,562 --> 01:09:21,573
It sounds good.

1759
01:09:21,802 --> 01:09:23,602
- I sautee garlic first?
- Yes.

1760
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:24,703
It's a great idea.

1761
01:09:24,704 --> 01:09:25,772
Do you want me to sautee it?

1762
01:09:26,972 --> 01:09:29,271
- No, I'm good.
- I have nothing to do.

1763
01:09:29,272 --> 01:09:30,772
- Really? You can sautee it, then.
- Do you want me to take a break?

1764
01:09:31,383 --> 01:09:33,511
Well. Do you want to lie down?

1765
01:09:33,512 --> 01:09:34,551
(Appealing enthusiastically)

1766
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:37,953
In that case, sautee the garlic over low heat...

1767
01:09:38,722 --> 01:09:39,852
so it won't get burned.

1768
01:09:40,482 --> 01:09:43,721
(Garlic)

1769
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,462
(Peperoncino)

1770
01:09:45,463 --> 01:09:47,162
(Chicken stock)

1771
01:09:47,163 --> 01:09:49,292
We'll add some whole peppercorns to add aroma.

1772
01:09:49,293 --> 01:09:50,293
Okay.

1773
01:09:51,463 --> 01:09:53,333
(Whole peppercorns)

1774
01:09:54,062 --> 01:09:55,333
Gosh. You're adding your hand's flavor to it.

1775
01:09:56,772 --> 01:09:58,842
It feels about right.

1776
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:02,972
Should we sautee squid in it too?

1777
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:04,641
- I'll add it, then.
- Okay.

1778
01:10:04,642 --> 01:10:05,642
(He adds the main ingredient, squid.)

1779
01:10:06,283 --> 01:10:07,542
(Looking dangerous)

1780
01:10:07,543 --> 01:10:08,551
I'll do it.

1781
01:10:08,552 --> 01:10:09,811
- Thank you.
- For the...

1782
01:10:09,812 --> 01:10:12,152
(A kind brother who takes care of the younger sibling)

1783
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:13,923
Is this thick enough?

1784
01:10:14,692 --> 01:10:15,993
It's perfect.

1785
01:10:16,623 --> 01:10:17,823
I love it.

1786
01:10:18,323 --> 01:10:20,423
(After getting compliments, he chops it more cheerfully.)

1787
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:22,793
(These are scallions.)

1788
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:25,633
Did you learn to chop from somewhere?

1789
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:28,172
- Well, I'm old.
- You're good at it.

1790
01:10:28,173 --> 01:10:29,173
(Humble)

1791
01:10:30,472 --> 01:10:33,942
(We'll add the onions and cabbage too.)

1792
01:10:37,913 --> 01:10:41,613
(In addition, add pollack roe and butter.)

1793
01:10:44,253 --> 01:10:46,453
(Add fish sauce to amplify the seafood aroma!)

1794
01:10:47,793 --> 01:10:51,022
(Add salt to your preference.)

1795
01:10:51,522 --> 01:10:54,891
Chef, can you tell me what I should add?

1796
01:10:54,892 --> 01:10:57,663
(Checking Si A's ramyeon)

1797
01:10:59,863 --> 01:11:01,232
- How is it?
- Good.

1798
01:11:03,602 --> 01:11:05,673
(White ramyeon soup is simmering.)

1799
01:11:06,043 --> 01:11:08,173
(Si A's ramyeon will be ready once she puts in the noodles.)

1800
01:11:08,442 --> 01:11:09,442
(Bored)

1801
01:11:09,443 --> 01:11:10,842
(Yo Han's hands have nothing to do.)

1802
01:11:11,283 --> 01:11:13,141
- Will you try sauteeing this?
- Okay.

1803
01:11:13,142 --> 01:11:14,782
Just this without the chilis.

1804
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:15,783
(A Sung gave Yo Han a new mission.)

1805
01:11:15,783 --> 01:11:16,783
Just the radish.

1806
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:18,782
(Yo Han got a job again.)

1807
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,783
Hold on.

1808
01:11:21,953 --> 01:11:23,891
(Let's sautee the diced young radish kimchi.)

1809
01:11:23,892 --> 01:11:25,793
- I'll sautee it like you told me.
- Okay.

1810
01:11:26,923 --> 01:11:28,132
- I'll add a little bit of sugar.
- Okay.

1811
01:11:28,133 --> 01:11:29,133
(Adding sugar)

1812
01:11:30,692 --> 01:11:32,762
Let's see what you're doing. Okay.

1813
01:11:33,663 --> 01:11:36,333
(Adding sesame oil)

1814
01:11:37,802 --> 01:11:39,573
Gosh. You're doing great.

1815
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:42,642
You've sauteed some kimchi before, I see.

1816
01:11:43,373 --> 01:11:45,182
It already smells so good.

1817
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:47,641
- The smell of sauteed kimchi.
- Actually, when you sautee kimchi,

1818
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:48,953
it just can't go wrong.

1819
01:11:49,052 --> 01:11:50,213
- That's right.
- Yes.

1820
01:11:50,512 --> 01:11:53,181
(Adding the soup from young radish kimchi)

1821
01:11:53,182 --> 01:11:55,852
(Adding sauteed young radish kimchi)

1822
01:11:57,892 --> 01:12:00,163
(It's not a secret that they put in 2 packets of ramyeon seasoning.)

1823
01:12:00,923 --> 01:12:02,492
(Sipping)

1824
01:12:02,493 --> 01:12:03,493
How does it taste?

1825
01:12:04,562 --> 01:12:05,562
Gosh. It's spicy.

1826
01:12:05,932 --> 01:12:06,932
Is it?

1827
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:08,801
(Si A's radar is on.)

1828
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:09,802
I'll add more of it.

1829
01:12:10,102 --> 01:12:12,772
- What? What is it? Sprite?
- In case it's too spicy.

1830
01:12:13,142 --> 01:12:14,142
Thank you.

1831
01:12:16,673 --> 01:12:17,782
(The Country Sisters are sweet to each other again today.)

1832
01:12:17,783 --> 01:12:19,543
- Is it refreshing?
- It's tasty.

1833
01:12:21,613 --> 01:12:22,811
- Edward?
- Yes?

1834
01:12:22,812 --> 01:12:24,082
Would you try this one?

1835
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:25,221
(Requesting help from the main chef, Eddie)

1836
01:12:25,222 --> 01:12:28,152
Do you have any idea about what to add?

1837
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:32,322
- For the ramyeon broth?
- Yes.

1838
01:12:32,323 --> 01:12:33,622
- Yes. It's good.
- Good?

1839
01:12:33,623 --> 01:12:35,691
Yes. Maybe just cook it a little more.

1840
01:12:35,692 --> 01:12:37,431
- Okay.
- Yes. Make it more intense.

1841
01:12:37,432 --> 01:12:38,432
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1842
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:43,333
(The ramyeon broth is ready after getting advice from Eddie.)

1843
01:12:44,003 --> 01:12:45,102
Should I start cooking steak?

1844
01:12:45,472 --> 01:12:46,472
- Yes, please.
- Yes.

1845
01:12:46,473 --> 01:12:47,641
- If I do it, - I think it'd be okay.

1846
01:12:47,642 --> 01:12:48,841
It'll take five minutes to finish.

1847
01:12:48,842 --> 01:12:49,912
- Okay.
- I think we're good.

1848
01:12:49,913 --> 01:12:51,582
- We're almost done too.
- I've got five minutes left too.

1849
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:52,713
Okay. Perfect.

1850
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:54,613
- You can start.
- Okay.

1851
01:12:54,883 --> 01:12:57,753
(Edward's specialty, steak)

1852
01:12:58,482 --> 01:13:00,583
(We get to see it before our eyes!)

1853
01:13:06,262 --> 01:13:09,692
(Seasoning the meat before cooking is the key to meat dishes.)

1854
01:13:11,802 --> 01:13:17,002
(Observing directly)

1855
01:13:17,003 --> 01:13:19,402
Sugar?

1856
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:22,971
(My mistake.)

1857
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:25,812
- What should I do?
- Actually, I like it even better.

1858
01:13:26,812 --> 01:13:27,882
Should I wash it?

1859
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:30,052
(Let's wash it quickly.)

1860
01:13:30,713 --> 01:13:32,221
I love it sweet too.

1861
01:13:32,222 --> 01:13:34,692
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

1862
01:13:35,392 --> 01:13:37,091
It's because of the seasickness.

1863
01:13:37,092 --> 01:13:40,123
Motion sickness can really mess people up.

1864
01:13:42,892 --> 01:13:45,901
I thought, "That's how creative he is."

1865
01:13:45,902 --> 01:13:46,902
"Sugar?"

1866
01:13:48,972 --> 01:13:50,003
What do you want me to do?

1867
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:51,841
- Me?
- Can I help you with anything?

1868
01:13:51,842 --> 01:13:54,742
- Well, I'm good.
- Are you good?

1869
01:13:54,743 --> 01:13:56,613
- You're all ready?
- I'm waiting to meet the time.

1870
01:13:56,913 --> 01:13:57,913
Good.

1871
01:13:58,182 --> 01:13:59,713
(Salt)

1872
01:14:00,512 --> 01:14:02,953
(Pepper)

1873
01:14:05,552 --> 01:14:06,822
Here's the steak.

1874
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:10,022
(Here comes the steak.)

1875
01:14:12,392 --> 01:14:14,533
(Focused)

1876
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:19,731
Is it okay to cook steak a bit rare?

1877
01:14:19,732 --> 01:14:21,301
- Yes. I love it.
- It doesn't matter to me.

1878
01:14:21,302 --> 01:14:22,302
I love to have it rare.

1879
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:25,902
It won't be too rare but a little bit.

1880
01:14:30,243 --> 01:14:34,613
(Depending on how much you cook it, its taste and texture change.)

1881
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:45,022
(Eddie's steak looks perfectly cooked.)

1882
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:51,163
(What is Eddie putting on it?)

1883
01:14:53,633 --> 01:14:55,703
Gosh. This is it.

1884
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,243
- Gosh. This must be...
- Nice.

1885
01:14:58,743 --> 01:15:01,442
(A generous amount of the pickled garlic sauce)

1886
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:07,682
(Let's watch Eddie's cooking for a while.)

1887
01:15:13,022 --> 01:15:17,852
(It's exciting to imagine the feast of flavors in your mouth.)

1888
01:15:35,942 --> 01:15:39,682
(Korean beef steak with Eddie's 3 special garnishes)

1889
01:15:40,142 --> 01:15:43,613
I've never cooked ramyeon with so much care in my life.

1890
01:15:44,012 --> 01:15:46,623
(The newbie chefs' ramyeon dishes are about to be done too.)

1891
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,352
(As for A Sung's ramyeon, )

1892
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:52,862
(the spicy and red broth looks amazing.)

1893
01:15:52,863 --> 01:15:55,963
(The noodles that absorbed Yo Han's effort and care)

1894
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:03,302
(A Sung's "Hey, It's Young Radish Kimchi Ramyeon")

1895
01:16:04,302 --> 01:16:07,003
(In contrast, Si A's ramyeon...)

1896
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:12,312
(is refreshing with the seafood in the white broth.)

1897
01:16:16,253 --> 01:16:19,982
(Si A's ramyeon with squid, pollack roe, and garlic)

1898
01:16:20,883 --> 01:16:24,052
(Should we set the table now?)

1899
01:16:24,522 --> 01:16:26,521
Okay. Steak is ready.

1900
01:16:26,522 --> 01:16:27,562
Yes!

1901
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:32,002
(Finally, it's dinnertime!)

1902
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:33,003
Let's eat, Kyun.

1903
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,073
I can't believe that this is onion.

1904
01:16:39,503 --> 01:16:40,503
(Gulping)

1905
01:16:40,743 --> 01:16:42,073
(Gulping)

1906
01:16:43,613 --> 01:16:46,942
(Eddie's juicy Korean beef steak)

1907
01:16:48,352 --> 01:16:50,812
(It's tender steak covered in the aroma of the pickled garlic.)

1908
01:16:53,423 --> 01:16:55,521
(A tasty dish after another!)

1909
01:16:55,522 --> 01:16:59,323
(Garnish that will add flavors to the meat)

1910
01:17:00,963 --> 01:17:04,533
(Just like side dishes, 3 garnishes go perfectly well with the steak.)

1911
01:17:07,262 --> 01:17:10,173
(A Sung and Si A's ramyeon dishes will reduce the greasiness.)

1912
01:17:12,043 --> 01:17:15,073
(It's fun to choose between the red broth and the white broth.)

1913
01:17:20,613 --> 01:17:23,783
(A meal with steak and Korean food, Rice, side dish, and soup)

1914
01:17:24,213 --> 01:17:25,453
- Thank you.
- Thanks for the food.

1915
01:17:25,923 --> 01:17:27,651
I'll show you one thing.

1916
01:17:27,652 --> 01:17:29,792
- You can have... Try the steak.
- Yes.

1917
01:17:29,793 --> 01:17:32,462
If you want, add a little bit of the onion.

1918
01:17:32,463 --> 01:17:33,521
Onion? Okay.

1919
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:35,191
Try it without it first.

1920
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,062
Also, if you want, you can dip it a little bit.

1921
01:17:37,493 --> 01:17:39,333
Gosh. It'll be great with the dip.

1922
01:17:39,533 --> 01:17:41,832
It's an unbelievable way to get protein.

1923
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:42,833
(Trust me and try it.)

1924
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:46,902
(Why don't we try it as Eddie recommends?)

1925
01:17:50,312 --> 01:17:51,312
Thank you.

1926
01:17:52,413 --> 01:17:53,783
- It's so good.
- Is it good?

1927
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,052
(It's amazingly good.)

1928
01:17:56,352 --> 01:18:00,883
(It's right up the Country members' alley.)

1929
01:18:01,823 --> 01:18:02,892
It's really good.

1930
01:18:03,222 --> 01:18:04,453
Gosh. It's really good.

1931
01:18:04,823 --> 01:18:08,163
- I'm about to cry.
- How can it be so tender?

1932
01:18:08,692 --> 01:18:10,033
The tenderness of the steak...

1933
01:18:10,762 --> 01:18:13,033
was mixed with the stickiness of the caramelized onions...

1934
01:18:13,932 --> 01:18:16,872
to create a harmony in my mouth, which I loved.

1935
01:18:16,873 --> 01:18:18,032
(A feast of flavors in her mouth)

1936
01:18:18,033 --> 01:18:19,043
It's so good.

1937
01:18:21,003 --> 01:18:23,472
Actually, I was so sad.

1938
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:24,883
Because I wanted more.

1939
01:18:26,213 --> 01:18:27,312
It was that good.

1940
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:32,423
(Yo Han takes a belated bite.)

1941
01:18:34,283 --> 01:18:35,293
(Amazed)

1942
01:18:35,923 --> 01:18:36,923
It's so good.

1943
01:18:37,022 --> 01:18:38,022
Thank you.

1944
01:18:38,022 --> 01:18:39,022
(It's so good that he wants to thank him.)

1945
01:18:39,392 --> 01:18:41,493
I'm totally recovered from the fatigue of the day.

1946
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:42,592
Thank you.

1947
01:18:42,633 --> 01:18:44,691
Gosh. It's so good.

1948
01:18:44,692 --> 01:18:46,533
(The Country members' reaction makes Eddie happy.)

1949
01:18:47,163 --> 01:18:50,272
This has the pickled garlic in it.

1950
01:18:50,772 --> 01:18:53,401
You creamed it and added a little bit of soy sauce to finish.

1951
01:18:53,402 --> 01:18:54,402
Just a touch. Yes.

1952
01:18:57,373 --> 01:18:59,812
(How can it taste like this?)

1953
01:19:00,142 --> 01:19:02,113
When you cook, you always...

1954
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,222
have to have one secret ingredient.

1955
01:19:05,623 --> 01:19:07,323
- I see.
- Okay.

1956
01:19:08,222 --> 01:19:10,391
I think it's a great idea...

1957
01:19:10,392 --> 01:19:12,163
to keep one thing a secret.

1958
01:19:18,633 --> 01:19:21,472
When I had it with the pickled garlic sauce,

1959
01:19:22,003 --> 01:19:24,072
the steak tasted so refreshing.

1960
01:19:24,073 --> 01:19:25,703
It was because of the garlic.

1961
01:19:26,472 --> 01:19:28,743
The Korean-style pickle...

1962
01:19:29,373 --> 01:19:31,713
came into my mouth with the meat, and it was really good.

1963
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:36,651
I'll try ramyeon number one.

1964
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:37,753
(It's time to try the ramyeon dishes now.)

1965
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:39,521
Oh, dear.

1966
01:19:39,522 --> 01:19:40,852
(Eddie tries A Sung's ramyeon dish first.)

1967
01:19:42,753 --> 01:19:46,222
(How is the young radish kimchi ramyeon made by A Sung?)

1968
01:19:48,293 --> 01:19:49,332
(Slurping)

1969
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:51,163
- Can I try it?
- Yes. Please help yourself.

1970
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:54,261
(Heart pounding)

1971
01:19:54,262 --> 01:19:56,401
This is truly a ramyeon dish.

1972
01:19:56,402 --> 01:19:57,402
You're right.

1973
01:19:58,503 --> 01:19:59,841
It's like comfort food.

1974
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,142
- It's so good.
- Yes.

1975
01:20:02,812 --> 01:20:06,341
Kyun, when you're sick, you have Neoguri.

1976
01:20:06,342 --> 01:20:07,342
That's right.

1977
01:20:07,842 --> 01:20:10,113
- Really?
- Yes. I like it.

1978
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:12,051
- Thank you.
- It's very good.

1979
01:20:12,052 --> 01:20:13,052
(It suits ramyeon-loving Eddie's palate perfectly.)

1980
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:15,552
Why is it so good?

1981
01:20:15,652 --> 01:20:17,152
- Really?
- It's really good.

1982
01:20:18,123 --> 01:20:19,722
(I'm glad to hear that.)

1983
01:20:20,192 --> 01:20:21,322
I'll try Si A's ramyeon first.

1984
01:20:21,323 --> 01:20:22,333
It's a bit...

1985
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:24,332
(It's time to try Si A's ramyeon dish now!)

1986
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:25,532
(How will ramyeon with squid, pollack roe, and garlic...)

1987
01:20:25,533 --> 01:20:26,703
(that Si A cooked with her gut feeling taste?)

1988
01:20:27,003 --> 01:20:29,771
It might taste better with kimchi.

1989
01:20:29,772 --> 01:20:31,573
- I won't rely on kimchi.
- Okay.

1990
01:20:31,772 --> 01:20:34,202
(Yo Han fills his mouth with the noodles.)

1991
01:20:34,203 --> 01:20:35,213
I'll have some too.

1992
01:20:36,342 --> 01:20:39,142
(Eddie takes a bite too.)

1993
01:20:40,243 --> 01:20:44,312
The name of this ramyeon is "Winter fishing."

1994
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:45,883
I could taste the sea.

1995
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:47,083
(Ramyeon that's full of seafood tastes)

1996
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:52,862
It tastes like winter fishing.

1997
01:20:52,863 --> 01:20:55,793
(The remarkable taste flavored by the sea)

1998
01:20:56,133 --> 01:20:58,562
This one has layers of flavor.

1999
01:20:58,902 --> 01:21:00,533
- Yes.
- It's complicated.

2000
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:02,833
- I like it.
- Is it delicious?

2001
01:21:02,932 --> 01:21:03,972
It's very delicious.

2002
01:21:04,703 --> 01:21:06,972
- I really mean it.
- I'm glad to hear that.

2003
01:21:07,373 --> 01:21:08,412
- It's so good.
- Let's clink glasses.

2004
01:21:08,413 --> 01:21:09,413
Okay.

2005
01:21:09,414 --> 01:21:10,743
Everyone, you worked hard.

2006
01:21:11,043 --> 01:21:13,112
- Cheers.
- You worked really hard.

2007
01:21:13,113 --> 01:21:14,642
You really did.

2008
01:21:17,113 --> 01:21:19,852
(The Country members got very close on their trip in Gangwon Province.)

2009
01:21:20,383 --> 01:21:22,051
When time passes,

2010
01:21:22,052 --> 01:21:24,022
this moment will become an unforgettable memory.

2011
01:21:24,253 --> 01:21:25,721
- Don't forget it, Kyun.
- Okay.

2012
01:21:25,722 --> 01:21:27,423
(Eddie makes another memory in Korea.)

2013
01:21:28,062 --> 01:21:29,833
I love this part.

2014
01:21:29,892 --> 01:21:31,392
- Radish leaves?
- Really?

2015
01:21:31,963 --> 01:21:33,862
- How would you say this?
- What is it called?

2016
01:21:33,863 --> 01:21:35,672
- Radish leaves.
- Radish leaves?

2017
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:38,003
Radish leaves? I didn't know.

2018
01:21:38,573 --> 01:21:40,972
In Korea, radish leaves are dried.

2019
01:21:41,173 --> 01:21:43,613
They're called dried radish greens. Right?

2020
01:21:44,342 --> 01:21:46,043
- They're dried radish greens.
- Aren't those different?

2021
01:21:46,543 --> 01:21:48,182
When radish leaves are dried, they become dried radish greens.

2022
01:21:49,253 --> 01:21:51,182
- I'll look it up.
- It doesn't matter.

2023
01:21:51,652 --> 01:21:53,052
Is she telling a lie?

2024
01:21:53,123 --> 01:21:54,123
No.

2025
01:21:54,124 --> 01:21:55,622
Yo Han made me doubt myself.

2026
01:21:55,623 --> 01:21:56,953
That's not good information.

2027
01:21:57,623 --> 01:21:59,922
This is going on air. You have to give accurate information.

2028
01:21:59,923 --> 01:22:01,261
Look at this.

2029
01:22:01,262 --> 01:22:02,932
(I was right!)

2030
01:22:04,493 --> 01:22:05,562
(Grunting)

2031
01:22:10,102 --> 01:22:11,673
- Are you throwing up?
- Are you okay?

2032
01:22:13,543 --> 01:22:14,543
Are you feeling nauseous?

2033
01:22:16,413 --> 01:22:17,873
I'm choking up.

2034
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:21,913
I think you still have motion sickness.

2035
01:22:23,682 --> 01:22:24,682
Right.

2036
01:22:24,683 --> 01:22:25,922
(They're done with their food in no time.)

2037
01:22:25,923 --> 01:22:29,253
Currently, we have three cameras.

2038
01:22:29,522 --> 01:22:30,721
Kyun, can you pick one?

2039
01:22:30,722 --> 01:22:32,391
I'll go up to that camera and give a bite.

2040
01:22:32,392 --> 01:22:33,392
(That's a good idea.)

2041
01:22:33,393 --> 01:22:35,332
- Okay.
- That one? Okay.

2042
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:36,761
(Eddie picked Camera Number 1.)

2043
01:22:36,762 --> 01:22:37,892
(The last piece of steak)

2044
01:22:38,192 --> 01:22:39,532
- I'll dip it in this.
- Take this too.

2045
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:41,003
I'll put some on it.

2046
01:22:41,163 --> 01:22:43,002
We prepared it with love.

2047
01:22:43,003 --> 01:22:44,402
It's made by Kyun.

2048
01:22:45,272 --> 01:22:47,342
(Which crew member will get to taste Eddie's steak?)

2049
01:22:47,703 --> 01:22:49,242
You thought I was going this way,

2050
01:22:49,243 --> 01:22:50,311
but I'm going that way.

2051
01:22:50,312 --> 01:22:52,342
Here you go.

2052
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:53,783
Open up.

2053
01:22:54,482 --> 01:22:57,182
- Open up.
- Here.

2054
01:22:57,213 --> 01:22:58,213
What's going on?

2055
01:22:59,352 --> 01:23:01,222
(Joking)

2056
01:23:01,892 --> 01:23:03,922
- Weren't you giving it to someone?
- What?

2057
01:23:03,923 --> 01:23:05,323
Weren't you giving it to someone?

2058
01:23:05,423 --> 01:23:07,922
I thought you were going to give it to the cameraman.

2059
01:23:07,923 --> 01:23:10,132
I thought that you didn't like people.

2060
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:11,163
(The director is over here.)

2061
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:14,262
- He's been standing there.
- He gave it to the camera.

2062
01:23:14,633 --> 01:23:16,332
I was touched.

2063
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:18,073
- I thought, "That's so nice." - What I did was...

2064
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:20,502
I did exactly what you told me to.

2065
01:23:20,503 --> 01:23:21,543
(Yo Han is mischievous until the end.)

2066
01:23:21,842 --> 01:23:24,073
(The camera that Eddie picked)

2067
01:23:24,442 --> 01:23:28,551
(There's no one behind the camera.)

2068
01:23:28,552 --> 01:23:30,352
(The only place where there is someone)

2069
01:23:30,713 --> 01:23:32,422
I didn't understand while doing it.

2070
01:23:32,423 --> 01:23:34,423
"Why did he choose that camera?"

2071
01:23:34,623 --> 01:23:35,852
I was puzzled.

2072
01:23:36,253 --> 01:23:39,091
(Yo Han is mischievous.)

2073
01:23:39,092 --> 01:23:41,191
Why don't we pick someone this time?

2074
01:23:41,192 --> 01:23:43,132
- Let's pick someone.
- Over there?

2075
01:23:43,133 --> 01:23:45,761
- Please taste it.
- And tell us what you think.

2076
01:23:45,762 --> 01:23:48,203
You have to tell us what you think. Come into the frame.

2077
01:23:48,302 --> 01:23:49,432
Stop hiding.

2078
01:23:50,173 --> 01:23:51,872
A Sung, pull him out.

2079
01:23:51,873 --> 01:23:53,442
(They're curious about the cameraman's opinion.)

2080
01:23:54,703 --> 01:23:55,713
All right.

2081
01:23:55,913 --> 01:23:58,271
Tell us how it tastes while facing that camera.

2082
01:23:58,272 --> 01:24:01,012
Stand right here.

2083
01:24:01,213 --> 01:24:03,651
Look at the camera. Put your hands down.

2084
01:24:03,652 --> 01:24:04,652
(Blurred)

2085
01:24:04,653 --> 01:24:05,721
Go ahead and tell us.

2086
01:24:05,722 --> 01:24:07,721
Your face will be blurred anyway.

2087
01:24:07,722 --> 01:24:08,993
It tastes fantastic.

2088
01:24:11,652 --> 01:24:12,992
(Going back to work)

2089
01:24:12,993 --> 01:24:13,993
Gosh.

2090
01:24:14,463 --> 01:24:16,362
- I ate so well.
- Thank you for the food, Kyun.

2091
01:24:16,363 --> 01:24:17,732
(Thanks to Yo Han, their last night in Gangwon is fun.)

2092
01:24:18,363 --> 01:24:21,062
How was it today?

2093
01:24:21,302 --> 01:24:25,243
Every day, I learn a little bit more about Korean food.

2094
01:24:26,902 --> 01:24:28,673
This is very important to me.

2095
01:24:29,213 --> 01:24:31,011
You know, we're just starting this journey.

2096
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:33,511
And I'm starting to learn about the taste of cooking by hand.

2097
01:24:33,512 --> 01:24:38,213
I'm learning the different ways of cuisine in the countryside.

2098
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:42,851
It's really important that with every single person I meet,

2099
01:24:42,852 --> 01:24:45,091
we talk about it. We talk about...

2100
01:24:45,092 --> 01:24:47,722
how they're making this. What's the taste of cooking by hand?

2101
01:24:47,892 --> 01:24:49,392
How do you make flavor?

2102
01:24:49,932 --> 01:24:54,262
I take every piece of advice and every piece of wisdom...

2103
01:24:54,633 --> 01:24:58,802
that I get. I put it in the back of my brain.

2104
01:24:58,873 --> 01:25:01,202
Hopefully, by the end of this journey,

2105
01:25:01,203 --> 01:25:05,213
I'll have a better understanding of the taste of cooking by hand.

2106
01:25:06,812 --> 01:25:08,482
I look forward to the remaining journey.

2107
01:25:09,713 --> 01:25:12,682
"Will it go well?" I can answer right away.

2108
01:25:13,482 --> 01:25:16,993
(As long as it's with the Country members)

2109
01:25:17,652 --> 01:25:19,493
We'll end the journey on a good note.

2110
01:25:22,892 --> 01:25:24,032
Coffee and ice cream.

2111
01:25:24,033 --> 01:25:25,162
(Their night in Gangwon Province hasn't ended yet.)

2112
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:26,332
Make affogato.

2113
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:28,402
- It's melting now.
- Right. There we go.

2114
01:25:29,373 --> 01:25:30,472
Thank you.

2115
01:25:31,232 --> 01:25:33,342
After ending the shoot...

2116
01:25:33,772 --> 01:25:35,742
on a good note...

2117
01:25:35,743 --> 01:25:38,073
- When we visit you in the US...
- That's right.

2118
01:25:38,642 --> 01:25:40,113
I wasn't done talking.

2119
01:25:41,283 --> 01:25:44,213
Kyun, you're so...

2120
01:25:44,913 --> 01:25:46,923
I wasn't done asking my question.

2121
01:25:47,982 --> 01:25:51,322
Kyun, this is your technique during the shoot.

2122
01:25:51,323 --> 01:25:52,592
You say, "That's right" to everything.

2123
01:25:54,092 --> 01:25:55,792
Even though I'm not done talking, you say, "That's right."

2124
01:25:55,793 --> 01:25:56,863
(You're disappointing me.)

2125
01:25:57,932 --> 01:26:02,133
(A Sung finds it hilarious.)

2126
01:26:04,272 --> 01:26:06,673
Please cook for us when we go to the US.

2127
01:26:07,102 --> 01:26:09,141
When you come to Korea, you can come to my place...

2128
01:26:09,142 --> 01:26:11,173
and make yourself at home.

2129
01:26:12,142 --> 01:26:13,912
(A Sung and Si A are about to pass out because of the two men.)

2130
01:26:13,913 --> 01:26:15,012
Goodness.

2131
01:26:16,182 --> 01:26:18,681
- Thank you for the food.
- I'm about to throw up.

2132
01:26:18,682 --> 01:26:20,182
- Kyun, get some rest.
- Okay.

2133
01:26:21,052 --> 01:26:23,123
(Good night, everyone.)

2134
01:26:23,256 --> 01:26:24,286
(Come and greet me.)

2135
01:26:24,985 --> 01:26:27,155
(Where old traditions live and breathe, Andong)

2136
01:26:27,685 --> 01:26:28,926
- Hi.
- Gosh.

2137
01:26:29,595 --> 01:26:31,626
(Special guests on their trip in Andong, Eddie's family)

2138
01:26:32,065 --> 01:26:34,265
(Help yourself, darling.)

2139
01:26:35,126 --> 01:26:37,835
(His sweetness hits the limit, a real dad's moment)

2140
01:26:37,836 --> 01:26:39,235
(I'll teach you how to cook.)

2141
01:26:39,666 --> 01:26:41,105
(Eddie's flirting recipe for his wife)

2142
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,305
(So did you teach me?)

2143
01:26:43,775 --> 01:26:45,746
(Flustered)

2144
01:26:46,105 --> 01:26:48,445
(Do you like mom's food better or my food better?)

2145
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:49,844
(Firm)

2146
01:26:49,845 --> 01:26:51,746
(Diane Lee's Country Cook?)

2147
01:26:51,876 --> 01:26:53,445
(An unexpected ordeal for Eddie)

2148
01:26:54,086 --> 01:26:55,715
(He's always...)

2149
01:26:55,716 --> 01:26:56,985
(Hilarious complaints by Diane)

2150
01:26:57,216 --> 01:26:58,985
(Edward Lee's real side is revealed in detail.)

2151
01:27:00,326 --> 01:27:03,426
(Eddie and Yo Han prepare special food for the family.)

2152
01:27:03,796 --> 01:27:05,825
(The brothers will take care of tonight's dinner.)

2153
01:27:05,826 --> 01:27:07,495
(The Kentucky man's special chicken dish...)

2154
01:27:07,496 --> 01:27:08,735
(and refreshing strawberry hotteok)

2155
01:27:09,136 --> 01:27:12,105
(Eddie's even cooking to keep the chicken moist)

2156
01:27:12,265 --> 01:27:14,666
(Yo Han's refreshing lemon zest to make hotteok more flavorful)

2157
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:16,376
(But wait...)

2158
01:27:16,836 --> 01:27:18,375
(What did you do?)

2159
01:27:18,376 --> 01:27:20,505
(Lemon zest made by Yo Han)

2160
01:27:20,506 --> 01:27:22,116
(Or lemon juice?)

2161
01:27:23,076 --> 01:27:24,076
(Eating)

2162
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:25,616
(Why are you eating it?)

2163
01:27:26,315 --> 01:27:27,315
(Eating)

2164
01:27:27,815 --> 01:27:28,855
(Eating)

2165
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:30,386
(Eddie is betrayed by Yo Han.)

2166
01:27:31,216 --> 01:27:32,425
(Yo Han, go and take a break.)

2167
01:27:32,426 --> 01:27:33,684
No. Come on.

2168
01:27:33,685 --> 01:27:35,086
(Will Country Cook brothers finish cooking safely?)

2169
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:36,694
(Inviting Guests Project 2)

2170
01:27:36,695 --> 01:27:39,495
(Scary grandpas from the head family appear.)

2171
01:27:39,496 --> 01:27:41,366
(Is Edward Lee famous?)

2172
01:27:42,935 --> 01:27:45,165
(With various ingredients in Andong, )

2173
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:47,366
(serve them food that will captivate them.)

2174
01:27:47,565 --> 01:27:48,974
(Gosh, I'm hungry.)

2175
01:27:48,975 --> 01:27:50,876
(Won't our food be cold?)

2176
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:54,506
(Eddie's food made from the heart to satisfy the extraordinary palate)

2177
01:27:54,975 --> 01:27:57,815
(The best-looking and impressive dishes are made.)

2178
01:27:58,416 --> 01:28:00,886
(It was very nerve-racking for me.)

2179
01:28:01,815 --> 01:28:03,256
(By the way...)

2180
01:28:03,685 --> 01:28:04,685
(Nervous)

2181
01:28:04,686 --> 01:28:06,185
(Will he captivate the palate of the head family elderly?)
