(How is Chef Lee at home normally?)

10
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:57,215
(Well...)

11
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:58,915
(Very bad.)

12
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,945
(Her story of love changes into a story of complaints?)

13
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:04,255

(The first dessert on Country Cook)

00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:16,665
(Their eyes open wide as soon as they have a bite.)

19
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:18,241
(It's so addictive that she's about to eat the plate.)

20
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:19,494
I really want to sell this.

21
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:20,804
(Christmas Eddie-tion, The fantastic transformation...)

22
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:22,405

(A Sung and Si A are struggling to wake up.)

26
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:37,684
(Morning stretches)

27
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:39,015
Good morning.

28
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:44,155
(Meanwhile, Eddie is taking an early morning walk.)

29
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:48,894
(A lonely-looking man...)

30
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:51,795
(on a quiet country road)

31
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:56,205
(He walks for a while without saying anything.)

32
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:01,074
(The man is curious...)

33
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:04,314
(even about the earthen jars on the street...)

34
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:06,945
(and the unfamiliar grass.)

35
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:08,245
(Grass)

36
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:09,745
(Grass)

37
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:11,255
(Grass)

38
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:16,255
(He made a pretty nice bouquet of grass.)

39
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:19,265
(The reason lonely man Eddie made a bouquet of grass...)

40
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,415
(is the two women he loves. Wife Dianne and daughter Arden)

41
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:24,895
I picked a flower arrangement for you.

42
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:26,235
Those are beautiful.

43
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:28,104
(Smiling wide)

44
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,405
- Fabulous.
- I know.

45
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,534
I knew you'd like it. That's why I made sure to pick them.

46
00:02:31,535 --> 00:02:32,605
Did you?

47
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,545
(Romantic guy Eddie is back at the lodging.)

48
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:38,745
(He places them into the vase for the Country members to see too.)

49
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,145
(Eddie's way of filling every day with love.)

50
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:47,585
(Then Si A comes out to the living room.)

51
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,255
Good morning.

52
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,324
Good morning. How are you?

53
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:53,224
Good morning.

54
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,325
I'm good.

55
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:56,094
- Chef.
- Yes?

56
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:57,834
(A Sung is here too. The Country members have gathered.)

57
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:00,035
For today's breakfast...

58
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,764
Since Gangwon Province is famous for potatoes...

59
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,765
Right.

60
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,604
I'm thinking of going to a restaurant...

61
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:07,751
famous for their potato ongshimi, which means potato ball soup.

62
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,504
- Okay.
- Let's try it.

63
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,045
- That sounds good.
- Let's go later.

64
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,145
- We have to eat a lot in one day.
- Right.

65
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:16,015
So let's go in the morning...

66
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:18,415
- and at least just get a taste.
- Okay.

67
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:22,225
I tend to keep a list of foods I enjoyed...

68
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:24,395
in different places.

69
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,795
For example, for Jeju Island...

70
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,215
"Seogwipo, a restaurant with very reasonable prices."

71
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,534
"This place has tasty food, but it's in a mountainous area."

72
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:33,735
Like this.

73
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,935
People often ask me, so I send my lists to them.

74
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,435
I want to go to a potato ball soup restaurant...

75
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:41,875
because I ate...

76
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,715
very savory potato ball soup made with sesame seeds.

77
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:47,075
That texture...

78
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,585
How can I put it? It was so chewy.

79
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,814
It was so chewy.

80
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,725
They were handmade, unlike the ones sold in stores.

81
00:03:57,595 --> 00:03:59,624
(The finale of their Gangwon Province trip)

82
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,025
(Potato ball soup)

83
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:03,225
Shall we go?

84
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:05,466
(Shall we eat potato ball soup, Foodie Si A's favorite?)

85
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:12,734
(A Sung is in the car.)

86
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,844
(Si A is in the car too.)

87
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:17,005
There we go.

88
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:21,415
Hello.

89
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:23,005
- Hello.
- Where would you like to go?

90
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:24,815
Where would I like to go?

91
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:27,255
Potato ball soup.

92
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:30,054
(Starting the day with laughter thanks to communication king Eddie)

93
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:31,055
(Proud)

94
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:32,554
- Is this right?
- Yes.

95
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:33,555
Okay.

96
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:35,794
- Okay.
- Your seat belt.

97
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:37,971
(Things are already feeling good. Let's go to eat potato ball soup!)

98
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:39,064
I like driving.

99
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:41,705
(Edward Lee, I like driving.)

100
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,034
(The quiet and peaceful scenery of the countryside in the morning)

101
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,945
I like that there are no cars. It's very quiet.

102
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:55,115
Have you eaten potato ball soup?

103
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:56,815
I have never.

104
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:59,484
I think you'll like it.

105
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,554
- Why?
- Because...

106
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,455
it's really unique and new.

107
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:04,955
(New and unique?)

108
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,425
Are the potato balls...

109
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,995
grilled?

110
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,434
- Grilled?
- Yes.

111
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,265
- It's kind of like gnocchi.
- I see.

112
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:15,665
But it's much chewier than gnocchi.

113
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,434
(Chewier than gnocchi?)

114
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:21,874
Is there a spicy version of the potato ball soup?

115
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:22,905
Or...

116
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:25,044
- I don't think so.
- I see.

117
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:26,075
Okay.

118
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:29,745
According to my research,

119
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,055
"ongshimi" means bird egg.

120
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,385
Bird egg.

121
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:35,184
- Because it's round.
- It looks like a bird egg.

122
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,895
This is a Gangwon dialect.

123
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:39,495
It's a local expression.

124
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:41,495
(Oh, thank you!)

125
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:43,895
(Proud, That was a perfect explanation.)

126
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:47,265
The lady from yesterday, the buckwheat lady...

127
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,265
Because of her strong dialect,

128
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:51,534
I couldn't understand at all...

129
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:52,975
- at first.
- Oh, really?

130
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,204
She spoke so fast.

131
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:56,244
Like this.

132
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,944
(Talking about dialects reminded him of the buckwheat master.)

133
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,015
You're right.

134
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:00,415
How much?

135
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,914
(Trying to cook and interpret her dialect)

136
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:03,521
(Eddie had a hard time because of her dialect.)

137
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,985
(Dialect attack 1, Just do it.)

138
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:07,335
(Dialect attack 2, You’re so stingy.)

139
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,355
Now I'm nervous.

140
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,695
(This is hard. Crying)

141
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,525
(He had a hard time with the dialect at first.)

142
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:16,465
But...

143
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:19,565
little by little, I can hear it.

144
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,835
At first, I couldn't understand a word.

145
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:25,405
(Dialects are so hard.)

146
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,304
- Turn left.
- Right there?

147
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,305
Right here.

148
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,305
(While talking about their time in Gangwon Province)

149
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,274
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

150
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:33,551
(They're already almost near the potato ball soup restaurant.)

151
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:34,885
It's a hidden place.

152
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:36,585
It really is hidden.

153
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:39,615
It smells like an old city.

154
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,385
Yes.

155
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:45,054
This must be a very old wall.

156
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,224
This is a very Korean-style wall.

157
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:48,325
Totally.

158
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,725
- I love it.
- You can feel the history.

159
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,065
- "Ongshim." - Right.

160
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:55,204
- I came here before.
- Really?

161
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,404
- Really? When?
- About ten years ago.

162
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:58,434
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

163
00:06:58,435 --> 00:06:59,634
(A Sung also came to this famous...)

164
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,355
(potato ball soup restaurant 10 years ago.)

165
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,144
This is it?

166
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:05,865
(How will the potato ball soup here taste?)

167
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:09,144
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

168
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:10,184
- Hello.
- This is hard for me.

169
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:11,285
Welcome.

170
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,015
- There are tables.
- Let's get one of the tables.

171
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,125
(An old and friendly house...)

172
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,865
(surrounded by an old stone wall)

173
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:26,134
(For 40 years, they've been loved by customers...)

174
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:29,565
(with their consistent taste and look.)

175
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,604
My mother-in-law was the 1st owner, and I'm the 2nd.

176
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:34,104
(My mother-in-law was the 1st owner, and I'm the 2nd.)

177
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:36,185
Our customers tell us that it still tastes the same.

178
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,244
That it's still that same taste.

179
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:41,915
That the taste hasn't changed from the past.

180
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:45,315
We use the best, freshest potatoes...

181
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,124
from Gangwon Province.

182
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,255
Ones with high starch content.

183
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:55,125
That's why the potato balls taste extra good and chewy.

184
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:59,865
We grind the potatoes,

185
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:03,834
wash them, and then roll them into balls.

186
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,805
(We have to roll the potato balls.)

187
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:07,335
Our secret?

188
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:10,174
There's no special secret.

189
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,915
It's just care.

190
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:15,945
The personal touch that I learned from Mother.

191
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:18,215
That's all. There's nothing special.

192
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:21,785
Okay.

193
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:22,885
(Eddie is here.)

194
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:25,924
- Are these the potato balls?
- I'm making potato balls now.

195
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:26,955
I see.

196
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,265
(The owner was making potato balls by hand.)

197
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,365
(Curious)

198
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:34,705
(The new chefs' eyes light up too!)

199
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:36,965
(Naturally drawn to the personal touch)

200
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:38,605
Do you want to try making some?

201
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:40,575
- Could we?
- Yes, if you'd like to.

202
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,704
- The kitchen is this way. Yes.
- Here?

203
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:44,505
- You can wash your hands there.
- Thank you.

204
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:47,144
(The Country members are ready to make potato balls.)

205
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:49,084
You can sit here and make them.

206
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:50,614
- Okay.
- Here you go.

207
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,854
You've never seen potato balls before, right?

208
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:53,855
That's right.

209
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,625
(The dough made with ground potato)

210
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,055
(Pull some off with your fingers.)

211
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,725
(Divide it into bite-sized pieces.)

212
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,865
(Roll them on your palms.)

213
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:08,405
(White and round potato balls are ready.)

214
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:11,735
We roll them into balls like this.

215
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:13,225
- This is mine.
- Like this.

216
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,445
Yes, like that. About that big.

217
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,975
- Like this.
- I really...

218
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:18,474
can't feel any flour.

219
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,574
This is all potato.

220
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:21,785
I see.

221
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,814
(It's Day 4 of their trip! Eddie looks quite experienced now.)

222
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,954
My mother ran the restaurant, and now we are.

223
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:27,855
- Like this?
- Yes, like that.

224
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:30,124
- This is mine.
- Like that.

225
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,195
You're good.

226
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,654
Yes, you're good.

227
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,224
(Compliments make Eddie happy.)

228
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,464
- Seriously...
- We need to work hard.

229
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:37,525
- Yours are so pretty.
- Yes.

230
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,565
We need to work hard.

231
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:45,175
Chefs really are different.

232
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:47,005
I'll work here.

233
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,144
It's an honor for us.

234
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,921
(Eddie dreams of being the owner's favorite student.)

235
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:53,214
How many years has it been?

236
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:55,515
We've been open for 45 years.

237
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:59,315
This is a very old house.

238
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:02,154
(While chatting, )

239
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,584
(they made a mountain of potato balls.)

240
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:06,094
"All-potato ongshimi."

241
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,265
Ongshimi only has potato balls in it.

242
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:09,794
Ongshimi kalguksu...

243
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:11,465
has both kalguksu and potato balls in it.

244
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:14,265
It's mostly kalguksu with a few potato balls.

245
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:17,204
Potato songpyeon is a cake, a potato cake.

246
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,275
What's songpyeon?

247
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:21,244
Songpyeon is a rice cake we eat for Chuseok.

248
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,245
- Right.
- Rice cake.

249
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,004
Inside are red beans.

250
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:25,215
- Red beans?
- Yes.

251
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:27,444
Let's do one of everything.

252
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,084
- Yes.
- One of each.

253
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:31,054
- We want to try a variety.
- Okay.

254
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:32,255
- Thank you.
- No problem.

255
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:34,255
Here?

256
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:36,685
(Eddie and A Sung take their seats after ordering.)

257
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:38,785
Have you ever seen something like this?

258
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,555
Yes, it's so fun.

259
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:43,095
What do some of these say?

260
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:45,095
"Yeppi and Ddolddol..."

261
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:48,335
It's like a guest book to record who was here.

262
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:51,304
(A summer vacation in sunny Gangneung)

263
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:55,344
(The wall is full of memories recorded by the customers.)

264
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:57,204
(We finally got in after coming here 3 times.)

265
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:58,774
- There are some on the ceiling too.
- I know.

266
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:01,045
(We came all the way from Haenam!)

267
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:02,984
Look. Somebody made a heart.

268
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,114
(Gangneung)

269
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:05,355
Somebody loves somebody.

270
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:08,855
Usually, they do this.

271
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,525
What did they say? Forty years?

272
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,855
- She said 45.
- It's been 45 years, so...

273
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,625
you were not alive.

274
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,465
- It's older than me.
- I was seven.

275
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,664
In 1979.

276
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:24,974
- In 1979.
- In 1979.

277
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,304
Were you born in 1979?

278
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,344
In 1972.

279
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:29,445
- In 1972?
- Yes.

280
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,004
(A mysterious smile)

281
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:32,914
My mom was born in 1971.

282
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:33,945
Oh, really?

283
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:35,584
(Embarrassed)

284
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,584
I'm your mother's age.

285
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:39,585
(I'm almost the same age as Si A's mother.)

286
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,255
(While the Country members chat on, )

287
00:11:42,955 --> 00:11:45,494
(the potato balls are becoming nice and chewy...)

288
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,295
(in the deep but refreshing broth.)

289
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:51,665
(Finishing off with some toppings to add a savory flavor)

290
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:56,265
(Potato ball soup and side dishes for a morning in Gangwon Province)

291
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:59,035
(Your potato ball soup is here.)

292
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:01,574
Enjoy.

293
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,005
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

294
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,044
- Let's see.
- What do you think?

295
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:06,815
- Isn't that pretty?
- Yes.

296
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,015
Okay. Here.

297
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:10,415
Thank you.

298
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:13,585
This looks so delicious.

299
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:17,185
It's funny because the broth is very thick.

300
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:19,325
That's the special thing with ongshimi.

301
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:20,894
- It has some density.
- Yes.

302
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:22,341
(The broth is thick and creamy because of the potato starch.)

303
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:24,065
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

304
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:29,235
(Eddie tastes the warm broth first.)

305
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:30,405
It's so tasty.

306
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:31,974
(Curious about his reaction)

307
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:34,875
That cold feeling totally went away.

308
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,014
- All of it.
- Right.

309
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,135
(The warm and creamy broth melts their whole bodies.)

310
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:42,045
(Blowing air)

311
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,585
(Time to try the potato ball, the star of today's breakfast)

312
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,484
(He can't help but smile.)

313
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:49,925
Oh, this is tasty.

314
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:54,125
- It's chewy.
- The potato balls are so delicious.

315
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:58,265
How would you say this in Korean?

316
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:00,595
- Chewy? "Jjondeuk hada." - Yes.

317
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,464
- "Jjondeuk hada." - "Jjondeuk hada."

318
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,504
"Jjondeuk hada."

319
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:04,604
(The ongshimi is extra special because they made it themselves.)

320
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:06,034
"Jjondeuk hada."

321
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,775
(Chewy!)

322
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:11,045
It sticks to my teeth.

323
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,315
- Aren't they like rice cakes?
- Rice cakes, yes.

324
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:18,114
The texture is chewy but soft at the same time.

325
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:19,185
You're right.

326
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:24,025
(It's bouncy and chewy at first, then savoriness fills your mouth.)

327
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:27,824
- It's so chewy.
- Yes.

328
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:30,925
(After eating a potato ball)

329
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,265
This is so delicious.

330
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,164
(Getting a piece of kimchi too, the perfect match for ongshimi)

331
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:37,005
(Foodie Si A)

332
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:40,634
(I found the best kimchi ever.)

333
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:41,674
- Isn't it good?
- This is good.

334
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,645
It's refreshing and tangy.

335
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:46,814
And it's really crunchy.

336
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:47,844
(Made with Gangwon napa cabbage known for its crunchiness)

337
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,014
Gangwon Province seems to have really good kimchi...

338
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,495
because they have good napa cabbages.

339
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:52,884
It's been fermented well.

340
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:55,825
(Following Foodie Si A, Eddie tries a bite of kimchi too.)

341
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:57,855
- Is it good?
- It is.

342
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:02,224
(A perfect combination of chewy potato balls and crunchy kimchi)

343
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:03,295
It's so good.

344
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:09,065
Because of the different sizes,

345
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,604
- the textures in the mouth...
- The textures...

346
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,535
feel different.

347
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:16,675
Each potato ball...

348
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:19,975
tastes different.

349
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:21,515
Because this is handmade.

350
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:24,284
What do you think they used...

351
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:25,915
to make this broth?

352
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,584
I can't really tell.

353
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:29,684
(Eddie, a chef who has cooked for White House banquets, )

354
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:30,755
(turns on his taste buds.)

355
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,055
I don't think so.

356
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:34,425
Maybe anchovies.

357
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:35,525
Oh, seaweed?

358
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:37,865
- Seaweed?
- Yes.

359
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:40,264
It kind of tastes like that. And kind of...

360
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:41,965
(It doesn't seem like seaweed.)

361
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:45,304
(A Sung)

362
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:48,405
(I really don't think it's seaweed.)

363
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:50,444
(I definitely tasted seaweed...)

364
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:51,645
(Reading their faces)

365
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,875
Or maybe I'm just tasting the seaweed here.

366
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:58,085
(There is quite a lot of dried laver.)

367
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,984
Because you ate the dried laver.

368
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:01,985
(Eddie's taste buds got a bit confused.)

369
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:03,785
Because you ate the dried laver.

370
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:07,235
(My taste buds are asleep because it's early in the morning.)

371
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:12,165
(Bursting into laughter)

372
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:14,465
Hold on. One more time.

373
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:17,405
Green onion?

374
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:20,755
You ate green onion, didn't you?

375
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,445
One more time.

376
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:26,745
- Sesame seeds.
- Sesame seeds.

377
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:31,185
(Please come back, Eddie's taste buds.)

378
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,984
I'm a professional chef.

379
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:34,585
(Embarrassed)

380
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,224
I'm crying.

381
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:39,554
(Eddie always makes Si A laugh.)

382
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:41,965
(Eddie always makes Si A cry.)

383
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:45,735
(It's funnier the more I think about it.)

384
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:53,405
(Eddie cries sometimes too.)

385
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:57,044
(Your potato songpyeon is here.)

386
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:58,574
- Oh, my. Thank you.
- Potato songpyeon.

387
00:15:58,575 --> 00:15:59,945
- I see.
- Thank you.

388
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:02,244
What do you use to make the broth?

389
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,685
What do you think?

390
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:05,554
Seaweed.

391
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:06,755
(I can't give up on it.)

392
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:09,154
Because he ate some of the dried laver.

393
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:11,055
Then he said, "I think they used seaweed."

394
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:14,494
I think Chef Lee should know.

395
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,625
I don't know Korean ingredients.

396
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:19,335
(The joking around stops here.)

397
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:22,765
- Anchovies?
- Yes, we use lots of anchovies.

398
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:26,175
Other places use lots of beef bones.

399
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,005
But we don't use beef bone broth. We keep that refreshing flavor.

400
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,004
I think that's why the customers like it.

401
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:33,575
(The broth recipe they've kept for 45 years)

402
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:35,884
- Oh, can we also ask...
- The people who come here.

403
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:37,645
Is this... So...

404
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:39,955
These look like dumplings.

405
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:41,925
- They do, right?
- Right.

406
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:46,154
Is the skin made of potatoes?

407
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,695
- Yes.
- It's 100 percent potato.

408
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,795
(They're not dumplings. Potato songpyeon)

409
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:57,805
(The potato songpyeons are so clear that you can see the inside.)

410
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:00,305
Do you use a powder or...

411
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:03,074
When you grind up potatoes, there's that starch powder.

412
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,244
- Yes, the starch.
- We dry that...

413
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:06,575
and make songpyeon.

414
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:11,515
Back in the day,

415
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:15,355
they'd make songpyeon with rotten potatoes.

416
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:16,554
They didn't want to waste...

417
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:18,084
- the rotten potatoes.
- Exactly.

418
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:20,755
Back in the day, people were poor and didn't have much to eat.

419
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:23,594
There are many potatoes in Gangwon Province,

420
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:25,664
so they used potatoes...

421
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:28,134
- to make their meals.
- Because they were poor.

422
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:31,004
My mother told me that that was why...

423
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:33,174
people made ongshimi a lot.

424
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,874
But because of that,

425
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,314
they could develop this tasty dish.

426
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:39,744
- Yes.
- Because they were poor.

427
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:40,875
- Yes.
- Right.

428
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:42,815
It's a folksy dish.

429
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,044
I love that.

430
00:17:44,045 --> 00:17:46,054
Hearing that story...

431
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:47,884
makes this taste even better.

432
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,485
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

433
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,155
So what was her name?

434
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:53,995
Kim Soon Ja.

435
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:55,624
- Kim Soon Ja.
- Yes.

436
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,964
My mother is Soon Ja too.

437
00:17:56,965 --> 00:18:00,365
Her picture is there, Soon Ja.

438
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,034
(The 1st owner of the restaurant, Kim Soon Ja)

439
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:04,434
My mother is Lee Soon Ja.

440
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:05,975
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

441
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:08,205
Their names are the same.

442
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,675
That's funny.

443
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:12,344
So, Soon Ja's Ongshimi.

444
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:13,521
(He'll remember "Soon Ja's Ongshimi" forever.)

445
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:14,714
Thank you for the explanation.

446
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:17,045
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

447
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:22,284
Knowing the story lets you enjoy the food even more.

448
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:23,455
- Right?
- Yes.

449
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:25,025
This was Soon Ja's.

450
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:26,495
- Soon Ja.
- Same name.

451
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:30,165
(How do Soon Ja's potato songpyeons taste?)

452
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,105
(Chewy)

453
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:40,205
(Si A takes a bite too.)

454
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,205
(Oh, my.)

455
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:43,875
Is it good?

456
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,175
This is totally...

457
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:47,645
a dessert.

458
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:49,584
- Yes, is this dessert?
- It's sweet.

459
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:51,815
Because it's a cake...

460
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:55,154
When you eat this, then that, it's like sweet, then salty.

461
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:56,485
You can keep eating.

462
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,185
Right?

463
00:18:58,186 --> 00:19:00,055
This is very unique.

464
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,195
That's really good.

465
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:06,635
I think what's interesting about Korean food...

466
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:09,664
is that a lot of it was invented...

467
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:13,175
or transformed at a time when Korea was poor.

468
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:15,275
People had to be very resourceful.

469
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,404
And so, you didn't throw away anything.

470
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:21,475
Just hearing the story of the potatoes and how,

471
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:25,215
as they were going bad, instead of throwing them away,

472
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:27,155
you would make a new dish out of it.

473
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:31,325
And from something like that came...

474
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:34,895
this new delicious thing that we now celebrate.

475
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:38,294
I think that is also the essence of Korean food.

476
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,034
That we don't throw anything away.

477
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:43,535
Things that other people might not look at as desirable.

478
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,975
We can turn that into something very delicious.

479
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:50,281
- Should we write something too?
- Okay, what do you want to write?

480
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:51,875
Well... Country Cook?

481
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:55,545
- "Keon." - "Keo."

482
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:56,815
"Keon."

483
00:19:57,315 --> 00:19:59,714
You can make mistakes. "Chu Ri."

484
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,215
- Oh, nice.
- "Kook."

485
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:02,385
"Kook."

486
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:04,994
(Countree Cook was heer?)

487
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,925
- Nice. Okay.
- I can fix it.

488
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:16,865
- Nice.
- Cool.

489
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:19,434
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

490
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,934
- We'll be back.
- Thank you.

491
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,505
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

492
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,705
Oh, is it snowing?

493
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:26,574
Oh, it's snowing.

494
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:27,844
(The snow is here to see the Country members off...)

495
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:30,344
(after their last breakfast in Gangwon Province.)

496
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,685
- It's snowing.
- It's snowing.

497
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,525
In America,

498
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:38,345
people like to catch snowflakes in their mouths.

499
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:40,624
(Shall we taste Korean snow?)

500
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,724
I got one.

501
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:42,825
Eating snow.

502
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,335
- I ate some.
- Yes.

503
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,465
- Dessert.
- It's dessert.

504
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,804
It's okay to eat it here.

505
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:51,705
Because Gangwon Province is free of pollution.

506
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:54,905
Come here!

507
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,515
(Andong)

508
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:00,875
(The three Country members volunteered to be guides.)

509
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:03,115
(A Sung chose to be the guide for Andong!)

510
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:06,455
(Why did you pick Andong?)

511
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:09,825
(A Sung's first domestic trip was to Andong.)

512
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:14,095
Despite it being my first time, it felt so friendly.

513
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:15,825
And there was so much tasty food.

514
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:20,194
I felt that it was a city where you could experience...

515
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,005
traditional culture.

516
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:26,035
(The second destination, Andong)

517
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:27,775
It's a new experience for me.

518
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:30,304
- Two bows.
- Like this?

519
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,445
Yes, like that.

520
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:34,175
Wait. Hold on.

521
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,744
(Feeling Andong's culture with his body...)

522
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:38,815
(and tasting Andong's culture with his mouth)

523
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:44,385
(His special Eddie-tion isn't over!)

524
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:45,954
(For the elders of Andong, )

525
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:49,065
(Guest Greeting Project 2)

526
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:54,995
(Andong's ingredients get reborn under Eddie's hands.)

527
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:02,575
(Eddie's dishes have upgraded even more.)

528
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:06,275
(Will it be worth the wait?)

529
00:22:06,945 --> 00:22:13,015
(Will Eddie's magic work in Andong too?)

530
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,911
(The second destination)

531
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:22,776
(They head to Andong!)

532
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:26,606
- Was it a good restaurant?
- Yes.

533
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,845
- That's a relief.
- They had a wall.

534
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:30,346
It was very good.

535
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,846
(The Gangwon Province guide feels satisfied.)

536
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,216
It was great in Gangwon Province, right?

537
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,456
Right.

538
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,386
- It was great fun.
- It was great fun.

539
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:41,425
But are we going to...

540
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,095
- Andong now?
- Andong.

541
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,296
- Andong.
- Right.

542
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:46,525
I already made reservations for us...

543
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:48,196
- to the places we will visit.
- Really?

544
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:50,465
- Yes.
- You got things prepared.

545
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:51,565
(Let's start our trip to Andong in earnest.)

546
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,566
Yes.

547
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:55,875
- The rooms we will be staying at.
- Right.

548
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,935
- You can look forward to them.
- Great.

549
00:22:57,936 --> 00:22:59,576
There's a strawberry farm.

550
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:00,876
We can have jjimdak.

551
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:04,276
We can go and taste everything.

552
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,485
(Foodie Si A is happy.)

553
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,556
Andong is known for its jjimdak?

554
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,585
- Jjimdak.
- Right. It's famous.

555
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,185
- Strawberries.
- Strawberries are famous here too.

556
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,626
What else? Anything else?

557
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:16,955
There are a lot of filming sites.

558
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:18,796
A lot of filming is done in Andong.

559
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,495
Do you know "Mr. Sunshine?"

560
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:23,065
- Yes. I watched a little bit of it.
- You did?

561
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:25,266
There's a filming site for "Mr. Sunshine."

562
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:27,866
People visit that place on tour.

563
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:31,705
(The one engaged to the female main character of "Mr. Sunshine")

564
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:33,466
(Yo Han passionately acted as Kim Hee Sung.)

565
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:38,686
(A masterpiece that attracted many fans in Korea and abroad)

566
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:42,016
"Mr. Sunshine" was my favorite.

567
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,886
(Proud Yo Han)

568
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,255
Who are we going to meet?

569
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:49,826
Earlier, I heard...

570
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,766
that there was going to be a surprise guest.

571
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,126
Right. There's a surprise guest today.

572
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,496
- A surprise guest?
- Yes.

573
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:58,306
Is there anything you've heard?

574
00:23:58,736 --> 00:23:59,736
(It looks like he knows something.)

575
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,236
A Christmas guest.

576
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:03,575
- Really?
- A Christmas guest?

577
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,136
Is Santa Claus coming?

578
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:06,906
To Andong?

579
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:09,216
Will we each be getting gifts from him?

580
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:11,946
Did you believe in Santa?

581
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:13,386
- Me?
- Yes.

582
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,145
Santa isn't real?

583
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:16,885
So when you were young... Oh, so...

584
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,026
(He got him good.)

585
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:21,226
What do you mean by that?

586
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,855
So Santa Claus...

587
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:24,895
Right.

588
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,295
(Young viewers, please close your eyes and ears for a while.)

589
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:28,526
Santa isn't real?

590
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:30,395
- He's real.
- He's real.

591
00:24:30,396 --> 00:24:33,606
Right. I still get gifts from Santa.

592
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,236
- Really?
- I believe in Santa.

593
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,436
Of course.

594
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,706
Oh, right. Take a look at them.

595
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:43,445
Santa is there.

596
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:44,816
(Eddie's surprise gift)

597
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:48,886
(Rudolf Si A)

598
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:52,325
(Rudolf Si A checks her appearance.)

599
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,326
Merry Christmas!

600
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:54,956
Merry Christmas!

601
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,226
- It's great, isn't it?
- Yes.

602
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:01,466
Drive well!

603
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:02,966
Drive well!

604
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:04,766
It's so cute!

605
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:08,906
- Let's go to Andong.
- Let's go to Andong.

606
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:10,376
It's so cute.

607
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:15,816
(Let's really get to Andong!)

608
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,115
All right. We're here.

609
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:20,785
(We have arrived at Andong.)

610
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:21,786
(Amazed)

611
00:25:22,116 --> 00:25:23,586
It's so pretty.

612
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,386
Gosh, it's pretty.

613
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:29,426
Look at that.

614
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:33,696
(They pass the vast Nakdong River, the lifeline of Yeongnam.)

615
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:42,236
It's pretty.

616
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:44,776
Look at that.

617
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:48,545
This is where we will be staying.

618
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,576
- Really?
- Yes.

619
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:54,386
(Today's special rooms!)

620
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,385
(Andong's traditional Hanok stay...)

621
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:00,625
(where you can enjoy Korea's beauty)

622
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:01,956
- Let's go.
- Right.

623
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:05,565
(Andong guide A Sung's gift for Eddie and the surprise guest)

624
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,425
(We even have a pink tree.)

625
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:09,866
(Andong guide A Sung's gift for Eddie and the surprise guest)

626
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,406
This is beautiful!

627
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:19,105
I think the trees will look amazing as the seasons change.

628
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:20,375
(The hanok where you can enjoy various seasonal views)

629
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:22,716
It will feel different in the summer, right?

630
00:26:23,576 --> 00:26:25,785
The entire village...

631
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:28,416
was so beautifully architected.

632
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:33,326
I could see the way people lived a long time ago.

633
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:37,256
It's beautiful.

634
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,066
These are original hanoks.

635
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,295
(As they walk while being mesmerized by the scenery...)

636
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:42,436
It's fascinating.

637
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:45,665
This is the place where we will stay today.

638
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,835
(They arrive at today's lodging.)

639
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:48,466
(I must take a picture of this.)

640
00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:51,475
Gosh, I went through so much.

641
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,622
(Andong's hanok lodging that the Country members fell for)

642
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,245
The name of this place is House of Gye Nam?

643
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,745
Yes. House of Gye Nam.

644
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:58,322
(How will it feel to stay the night here?)

645
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:00,085
We have to choose our rooms.

646
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,086
Okay.

647
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,886
Do you know what "Jang Yu Yu Seo" is?

648
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:04,116
No.

649
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:06,486
I explained this to you.

650
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:07,925
- The eldest first.
- Right.

651
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,495
- The eldest goes first.
- You choose...

652
00:27:09,496 --> 00:27:10,595
- first.
- In age order.

653
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,026
- Where are the rooms?
- Take a look.

654
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:15,025
- Okay.
- Take a look at them...

655
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:16,266
and choose your room.

656
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:18,635
I'll pick the warmest room.

657
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:22,006
(The best room for Eddie, the warmest room)

658
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:27,506
I like this room!

659
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:30,416
- Do you like this room?
- Yes.

660
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:32,516
What is this?

661
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:34,646
It's a little desk.

662
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:37,615
- What is that?
- It's so cute!

663
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:38,955
(Which item did Eddie find on the desk?)

664
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:40,185
My gosh.

665
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:41,425
- It's gonggi!
- It's gonggi.

666
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,696
- Gonggi?
- It's like a Korean board game.

667
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:44,895
It's a type of game.

668
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,095
(Korea's representative traditional folk game, gonggi)

669
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:47,725
- I'll teach you later.
- That is the cutest.

670
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:48,996
It's so cute.

671
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:54,005
You can write your recipes here.

672
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,036
Right.

673
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,376
(Eddie seems to be finding something.)

674
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:01,646
Then at night,

675
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:04,575
when I need to use the restroom,

676
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:06,845
- where do I go?
- There's the chamber pot.

677
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:09,056
It's the Korean traditional toilet.

678
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:12,115
- Korean traditional toilet?
- What?

679
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:13,855
- You can use that.
- It's a plate?

680
00:28:13,856 --> 00:28:15,155
It's called the chamber pot.

681
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:17,126
- A bowl?
- It's something like a crock...

682
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,165
and you can sit on it.

683
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,926
- It's bigger than a plate.
- Okay.

684
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:22,835
It's around this big.

685
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,465
(Things already feel special in the hanok.)

686
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:25,906
Shall we get settled into our rooms?

687
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:28,766
Let's meet up later after resting in our rooms.

688
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:30,875
- Okay.
- Get some rest, Yo Han.

689
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,976
You went through so much to drive us here.

690
00:28:34,706 --> 00:28:37,415
Should we unpack our things and get some rest here?

691
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,246
Sure. That sounds good.

692
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,756
One more.

693
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:44,485
That's great.

694
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:45,685
(Photos are the only things that last from trips.)

695
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:47,385
- It's so pretty.
- I'll take a picture for you too.

696
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:48,386
- Me?
- Yes.

697
00:28:48,387 --> 00:28:49,625
What should I do?

698
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:51,626
- Get under the covers.
- Under the covers? Okay.

699
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,526
"The woman under the covers."

700
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:56,766
Here I go.

701
00:28:57,466 --> 00:28:59,335
The photos look great here.

702
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,805
- A woman living in this house.
- You look so cute!

703
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,675
(A Sung and Si A make more and more memories.)

704
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,976
You really look like a baby.

705
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,415
(What are the Country brothers up to?)

706
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:14,416
You look so cute.

707
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:15,546
- Did I look okay?
- Yes.

708
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:18,755
- Are there no blankets?
- Sorry?

709
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:19,756
Blankets.

710
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:21,655
Oh, right.

711
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,626
- This is the blanket.
- This?

712
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,996
- Then...
- You can go under this.

713
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:27,965
There's another one?

714
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,036
Okay.

715
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,365
Go under the blanket.

716
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:31,665
(The tough guy wants to be under the blanket.)

717
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,236
You should go under this.

718
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,636
Okay.

719
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,276
It's cold, right?

720
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:37,676
It is.

721
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:39,546
Did you catch a cold?

722
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:40,746
No.

723
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,245
(One line to summarize the break of the brothers)

724
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:46,716
(It's dangerous outside the covers.)

725
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:48,545
Let's get some rest.

726
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:51,255
(Let's get some rest.)

727
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,256
It feels comfortable.

728
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,457
- It feels comfortable?
- Yes.

729
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:58,055
How does the kitchen look here?

730
00:29:58,056 --> 00:29:59,126
I'm curious too.

731
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,426
- Shall we take a look?
- Sounds good.

732
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:08,465
(While coming out to see the structure of the hanok...)

733
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:09,976
The view is so pretty too.

734
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,476
(The two get surprised.)

735
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,776
- Hi!
- My gosh.

736
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,446
(Who are these two women?)

737
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:18,646
Hi!

738
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:20,586
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

739
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,855
(Eddie's wife and daughter make a surprise visit to Andong!)

740
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:24,655
- Hi.
- It's very nice to meet you.

741
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,885
Long time no see!

742
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:27,755
It's nice to see you again.

743
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:29,325
- Hi.
- Hi.

744
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:30,655
- Hi.
- How have you been?

745
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,725
- How have you been?
- How have you been?

746
00:30:32,726 --> 00:30:33,826
- Hello.
- Hi.

747
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:37,136
You should enter first, Lady.

748
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:40,436
- Lady! Welcome!
- Watch your steps.

749
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,176
Our guests are here!

750
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:45,176
Everyone!

751
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:47,245
Our guests are here!

752
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,416
- What?
- They're here!

753
00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:52,316
(The brothers get up.)

754
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,646
(I must greet them in the Korean way.)

755
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,016
My gosh.

756
00:30:58,516 --> 00:31:00,526
- Hello.
- Hello.

757
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:01,825
It's great to see you.

758
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:02,926
Hello.

759
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:05,526
I missed you.

760
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:07,195
Come here!

761
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:09,295
- Come here! I missed you.
- How are you doing?

762
00:31:09,296 --> 00:31:10,695
I missed you so much.

763
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:12,336
(Why did he invite his family to Andong?)

764
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:14,605
(The 2nd video meeting for Country Cook)

765
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,236
(The first appearance of Arden)

766
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:18,605
Hello. This is my daughter.

767
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:20,722
(Arden made a surprise appearance during the video meeting.)

768
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,006
So cute!

769
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:24,375
Me? I'm the cute one, right?

770
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:25,575
(Joking)

771
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:28,216
- Yes. You're cute, Edward.
- Me. I'm the cute one.

772
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:32,385
My daughter doesn't know Korea at all.

773
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:34,985
I know a little bit, but she doesn't know Korea.

774
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:37,326
My thing is to introduce to her...

775
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:40,225
Hey, Arden. Are you ready?

776
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:42,735
"This is part of your heritage."

777
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:46,336
(Eddie wanted to teach his daughter about her roots in Korea.)

778
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:53,646
(Before traveling, they found the time to tour around Seoul.)

779
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:57,946
(Eddie and Arden went through the charms of Korea together.)

780
00:31:58,146 --> 00:31:59,516
Your grandmother.

781
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:01,415
Your great-grandmother lived here.

782
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,116
Your great-great-grandmother lived here.

783
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:07,985
That's important. To me, that's the most important thing...

784
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:09,596
that I want to tell my daughter.

785
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,425
(Eddie invited his family to Andong to show them...)

786
00:32:12,426 --> 00:32:14,096
(the greater charms of Korea.)

787
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,135
It's so cold outside. Let's go inside the room.

788
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,265
- And...
- Let's go.

789
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:19,765
- it's a little warm inside.
- This is incredible.

790
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:21,466
- Really.
- Right.

791
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:22,936
- I love this.
- Come inside.

792
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:25,505
There are many rooms inside. Come.

793
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:27,446
- So you just walk over? Okay.
- Right.

794
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,375
- Sit on the floor.
- This is amazing.

795
00:32:30,376 --> 00:32:31,615
Come sit next to me.

796
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,186
The heater is right there, Arden. So sit next to here.

797
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:36,585
This is the bedroom.

798
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:37,756
- Right.
- Bedroom.

799
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:42,495
But also, this is the place where we gather and talk.

800
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,465
In the past, when people came inside after being outside,

801
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,725
they put their hands in here.

802
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:50,136
Like this.

803
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:51,335
(Smart ondol life)

804
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,136
- You can do this.
- You know how to do it.

805
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:56,476
- The blanket? The heated floor?
- Yes. The heated floor.

806
00:32:56,636 --> 00:32:58,335
- Are you cold? You're cold.
- Yes.

807
00:32:58,336 --> 00:33:00,106
Do you have a thicker coat?

808
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,476
- We have many layers.
- Okay.

809
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:03,845
- Lots of layers.
- I didn't realize...

810
00:33:03,846 --> 00:33:04,915
it was going to be so cold.

811
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,162
(Eddie is always worried about his daughter.)

812
00:33:06,186 --> 00:33:07,346
You're a dad.

813
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:10,485
- You're not a chef.
- It's our first time seeing this.

814
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:13,026
- The sight of a K-Dad.
- Right.

815
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,025
I change all of a sudden, right?

816
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,126
- Yes.
- Yes.

817
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,565
Arden, do you like strawberries?

818
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,296
- Yes.
- Oh, really?

819
00:33:21,796 --> 00:33:23,496
We're going to get some strawberries.

820
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:25,665
So we're going to pick strawberries.

821
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,736
Okay.

822
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:29,136
Andong is famous for its strawberries.

823
00:33:29,206 --> 00:33:31,035
Can you say, "ddalgi?"

824
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:32,136
- Ddalgi.
- Yes.

825
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:34,405
Your pronunciation is pretty good!

826
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:35,606
That's "strawberry" in Korean.

827
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,815
Are you ready to go and see them?

828
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,745
- Okay. All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

829
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:42,286
- Yes.
- Let's go!

830
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:45,926
(Shall we go and pick Andong's famous strawberries?)

831
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:53,096
Isn't it beautiful? Look at all the houses.

832
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:57,336
So in the old days, this would be a rich person's house.

833
00:33:57,596 --> 00:33:59,166
This is really...

834
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:02,105
So that was considered a fancy house.

835
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,976
(The scenery feels more meaningful with his family with him.)

836
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:07,675
- Let's go.
- Let's get in the car.

837
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:09,836
(Eddie's family starts the tour in Andong in earnest.)

838
00:34:12,646 --> 00:34:14,416
Oh, he's driving. That's right.

839
00:34:14,816 --> 00:34:16,385
I keep forgetting he's driving.

840
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:17,685
(Yo Han went to pick up Eddie in Episode 1.)

841
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:19,662
(Yo Han is in charge of the important task yet again today.)

842
00:34:19,686 --> 00:34:21,185
Everyone, put on your seat belts.

843
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,466
(Drive us safely, Uncle Yo Han.)

844
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:23,626
Here I go.

845
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:29,865
(Andong's scenery catches Dianne's attention.)

846
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:33,766
Look at this trail that goes along the water's edge.

847
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,036
It's just woven in there. It's a really...

848
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,536
pretty bridge.

849
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,046
You could go for a long hike.

850
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:43,245
Gosh, look at that!

851
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:45,246
(Scenery of the past and present, Wolyeong Bridge)

852
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:48,486
(It's so pretty.)

853
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:51,756
(His heart and body are facing toward his family.)

854
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:55,655
We'll be eating after picking the strawberries, right?

855
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:56,756
Yes.

856
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:58,625
- You're hungry, right?
- Yes.

857
00:34:58,626 --> 00:34:59,842
It's around time for you to feel hungry.

858
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:01,696
Right. I'm starving. Strawberries?

859
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,095
They're all mine.

860
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:05,036
I won't pick them. I'll just eat them up.

861
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,305
My basket will be empty.

862
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:09,536
My stomach will be filled with strawberries instead.

863
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:11,575
It's not about helping them pick the strawberries.

864
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,946
It's just about eating them.

865
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,645
"We'll eat them for you."

866
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,146
(We'll eat the strawberries for you.)

867
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:19,385
I heard about your pickup line.

868
00:35:19,386 --> 00:35:20,445
(Yo Han is interested in Eddie's love story with his wife.)

869
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:22,006
You mentioned it during your interview.

870
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:24,216
- Which one?
- During your interview.

871
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:27,356
"I will teach you how to make all kinds of dishes."

872
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:31,996
(That was what I said.)

873
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:33,825
(He told Dianne that he would teach her every dish.)

874
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:35,295
What a true man.

875
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,996
A true man.

876
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:39,605
When we first met, I said that...

877
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:40,905
I would teach you how to cook.

878
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:44,336
That's how I first got to date you by promising you.

879
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,576
Yes. Did you teach me?

880
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:52,016
(Romance crashing down)

881
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:56,456
(They are unbelievable.)

882
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:58,316
(I'm just joking.)

883
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:02,056
My whole life, there are only women.

884
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:05,426
My wife, daughter, and grandmother.

885
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:08,526
(Of course, we know.)

886
00:36:08,826 --> 00:36:10,736
(You did well to go past this one.)

887
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:11,966
Love you.

888
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:18,436
Does your wife cook too?

889
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:21,546
- Yes. She's a wonderful chef.
- Right.

890
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:23,575
Then...

891
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:26,445
Do you like Mom's food better or my food better?

892
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:27,545
Mom's.

893
00:36:27,546 --> 00:36:29,085
(Choice made without hesitating for even 1 second)

894
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,355
She just said...

895
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:31,655
(Not even Dad can beat Mom's food.)

896
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,256
She just said she likes your cooking better than mine.

897
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:38,195
That means I have done my job.

898
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,066
- No.
- No?

899
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,695
(Arden is firm about it.)

900
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:42,936
(That's my girl.)

901
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,296
Gosh, that was hilarious.

902
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:47,865
I want to try Dianne's food.

903
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:49,976
- That was shocking.
- Right.

904
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:53,706
I'll quit the show and you can take over from now on.

905
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:56,275
- Dianne's Country Cook?
- Go back to Seoul?

906
00:36:56,276 --> 00:36:57,616
Dianne's Country Cook.

907
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,376
Change the face in the trailer.

908
00:37:00,146 --> 00:37:02,016
Edward the Country Dishwasher.

909
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:05,656
(Cheer up, Eddie.)

910
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:07,686
(Later)

911
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,526
(We must make a special dinner.)

912
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:15,996
(Chef Eddie's pride is on the line.)

913
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:19,705
(Christmas dishes of the two men for Arden)

914
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:20,805
- Try that?
- Give it a try?

915
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,365
(With Yo Han's support)

916
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,436
(It's so good.)

917
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:26,076
(Special recipes to capture Arden's taste)

918
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:28,706
(Even the secret sauce found in Andong will be used!)

919
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:33,316
(The important moment)

920
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:34,616
(The killer punch)

921
00:37:35,946 --> 00:37:42,026
(Will the two men be able to satisfy Arden's taste?)

922
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:43,760
Is that it?

923
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,921
- The greenhouses over there?
- Right.

924
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,930
There it is.

925
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,731
- It's back there.
- "Strawberry" is written.

926
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,631
So these are all strawberries here?

927
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:54,800
This is amazing.

928
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:56,501
- Right.
- It's a true farm.

929
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:03,441
(The fully ripe Andong strawberries are waiting for you.)

930
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:07,811
(The red strawberries in season that make your mouth water)

931
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,350
(First ingredient for the special dinner, )

932
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:12,421
(Andong strawberry)

933
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,551
All right. We're here.

934
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:16,191
Strawberries!

935
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:17,921
I'm hungry.

936
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:19,620
Let's go.

937
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,031
Even the sign is cute.

938
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:24,001
What?

939
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:26,700
The height is controlled automatically.

940
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:28,100
- Goodness.
- Look at this.

941
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:29,101
My gosh.

942
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:31,000
It feels like I'm being treated specially.

943
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,640
- That's so nice.
- It's so comfortable.

944
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:34,541
It's so comfortable.

945
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:37,810
Let's get in!

946
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:40,351
- Let's go see some strawberries!
- Let's go!

947
00:38:40,581 --> 00:38:42,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

948
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:43,580
- Welcome.
- Hello.

949
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:44,820
It's great to see you.

950
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:46,551
(Choi Hwa Yeon, strawberry farm owner)

951
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:48,321
Arden, here's the strawberry. Right here.

952
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:50,291
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

953
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:53,361
- Did you pick all the strawberries?
- Yes.

954
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:56,190
- That's amazing.
- Hello.

955
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:57,230
It's great to see you.

956
00:38:57,231 --> 00:39:00,931
(A great amount of fresh strawberries)

957
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:03,370
May we try them?

958
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:05,670
Yes. I will serve you...

959
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:07,511
- delicious strawberries.
- Right.

960
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:10,881
- Gosh, they are so big.
- Right.

961
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,610
Give them a try.

962
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,380
(Andong strawberry looks delicious and bright.)

963
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:15,511
Thank you.

964
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,650
It will be great to have just one of them.

965
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:19,890
- I'll choose a nice one for you.
- Thank you.

966
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,021
I'll have the one you choose for me.

967
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:24,321
Oh, my gosh.

968
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,030
It's like candy.

969
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,391
- It's like candy?
- Yes. It's so sweet.

970
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,000
(Arden tries the Andong strawberry as well.)

971
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,001
(She speaks with her eyes.)

972
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:36,371
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

973
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,001
I'm going to eat the big one.

974
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:40,641
This one for me.

975
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:44,810
Since Korean strawberries...

976
00:39:44,811 --> 00:39:48,051
are delicious, guests from all over the world,

977
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:50,580
- including the US, - It's amazing.

978
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:53,550
Come to experience strawberry picking.

979
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:54,590
(A confident thumbs up)

980
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,021
It deserves a thumbs-up, right?

981
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:57,751
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's too sweet.

982
00:39:57,791 --> 00:39:59,660
- And the scent is strong.
- Right?

983
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:00,860
- But...
- Yes?

984
00:40:00,861 --> 00:40:03,260
- strawberries in the US...
- Yes?

985
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:05,731
- aren't sweet.
- No, right?

986
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:07,931
- How are these...
- Yes?

987
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,430
- so sweet?
- Why are they sweet?

988
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:10,540
- Sweet?
- Yes.

989
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,071
We have good sunlight...

990
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,671
and water.

991
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,141
The sun is up all day long...

992
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:21,310
from 7am to 6pm.

993
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:23,010
Due to the big daily temperature range,

994
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:24,180
it's impossible for Andong strawberries...

995
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:25,181
not to be delicious.

996
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,620
And the sizes are huge.

997
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:29,701
(Fragrant and sweet, Andong's specialty, strawberry)

998
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:33,260
(She's totally in love with strawberries.)

999
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:35,030
- I've never had this.
- I know.

1000
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,001
It's the most delicious strawberry.

1001
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,631
Arden. How does the strawberry taste?

1002
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,171
- It's very sweet.
- Sweet.

1003
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:45,601
- Sweeter than American ones?
- Yes, definitely.

1004
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:50,611
In America, the tiny strawberries are flavorful.

1005
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:52,911
So you have to get wild strawberries.

1006
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:54,681
The smaller, the better.

1007
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:56,551
But this one, yes.

1008
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:57,850
(The bigger...)

1009
00:40:57,851 --> 00:40:59,050
The bigger ones are good.

1010
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:01,350
(The bigger the tastier Andong strawberries are.)

1011
00:41:01,351 --> 00:41:03,490
We'll pick a lot of strawberries today.

1012
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:05,690
So may we eat a lot? It's just too good.

1013
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:06,891
- It is, right?
- I want more.

1014
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:11,131
(Time to officially devour the strawberries)

1015
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:13,030
(Amazed)

1016
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:14,031
Take one each.

1017
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:17,070
You could put a straw in there and just suck up the juice. Right?

1018
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:18,271
It's juicy.

1019
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:21,911
(Dianne is also addicted to Andong strawberries.)

1020
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,610
(Despite knowing they should stop)

1021
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,411
- Just one more?
- Go ahead.

1022
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,311
- It's so good.
- How many is that?

1023
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:31,620
- Oh, my.
- How many is that?

1024
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:33,080
- Three? Four?
- No.

1025
00:41:33,081 --> 00:41:34,550
Only 3 or 4.

1026
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:36,451
(A sweet lie by Foodie Si A)

1027
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:38,821
(They're cute.)

1028
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:40,790
Shall we head inside now?

1029
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,161
- I'll lead the way.
- Okay.

1030
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,170
(For a special dinner)

1031
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,230
Strawberries.

1032
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:50,941
(Arrived at today's ingredient supplier)

1033
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,570
These are strawberries.

1034
00:41:54,571 --> 00:41:56,641
- Beautiful.
- The strawberries are growing here.

1035
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:58,180
Look.

1036
00:41:58,181 --> 00:41:59,661
(Welcome to Andong strawberry field.)

1037
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:01,980
Since you're here to pick strawberries,

1038
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:03,921
I'll teach you how to do it.

1039
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,451
Take a basket each.

1040
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:09,451
- It's small.
- Yes.

1041
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,861
Let me teach you how to pick the strawberries.

1042
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:14,630
- See how the strawberries are?
- Yes.

1043
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,361
Put your hand inside and snap it off.

1044
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,401
It's easy.

1045
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,401
With that, it's goodbye to the strawberry.

1046
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,270
You have to say that every time.

1047
00:42:22,271 --> 00:42:23,541
Bye, strawberry.

1048
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,900
Okay.

1049
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:25,970
- Try it.
- Thank you.

1050
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:27,010
Thank you.

1051
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,971
Ask me if you need any help.

1052
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:30,881
- Competing?
- Okay. Let's start.

1053
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,681
Bye, strawberry.

1054
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:34,281
I picked one.

1055
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:35,380
(Find the best strawberry for the special dinner.)

1056
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,681
You'll be going into my stomach now.

1057
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:40,551
Bye, strawberry.

1058
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:42,390
Bye, strawberry.

1059
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:43,720
(Endlessly saying bye to the strawberries)

1060
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:44,891
Bye, strawberry.

1061
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,861
- Here's one.
- Look how many you have.

1062
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,160
Look.

1063
00:42:50,161 --> 00:42:51,961
Look at how many strawberries I picked.

1064
00:42:52,301 --> 00:42:53,530
I'm a strawberry master.

1065
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:54,831
- You are one.
- Yes.

1066
00:42:56,131 --> 00:42:57,611
- "Ddalgi" for strawberry.
- "Ddagi."

1067
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,801
There's an "L" at the end. "Ddalgi."

1068
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:01,840
(A Sung's strawberry)

1069
00:43:01,841 --> 00:43:03,541
(Find the most vibrant strawberry!)

1070
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:06,041
I can pick without looking at them.

1071
00:43:06,411 --> 00:43:07,481
I can look elsewhere.

1072
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:11,081
This one is red.

1073
00:43:11,581 --> 00:43:12,721
It looks ripe.

1074
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,791
Ma'am. I think I'm good at it.

1075
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,390
(After 26 years of being an actress, )

1076
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:22,260
(she has found another talent.)

1077
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:23,530
Bye, strawberry.

1078
00:43:23,531 --> 00:43:25,331
(A Sung is good at it.)

1079
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:26,800
- Pick one.
- Arden.

1080
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:28,070
I see a big one right there.

1081
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,270
(Find strawberries for Arden.)

1082
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:31,341
Arden. Say, "Bye, strawberry."

1083
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,471
Bye, strawberry.

1084
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:35,711
Perfect. Say it out loud.

1085
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:38,541
- Bye, strawberry.
- Bye, strawberry.

1086
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:40,411
Bye, strawberry.

1087
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:42,550
Keep going.

1088
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:45,350
(Who will find the better strawberries?)

1089
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:46,851
This is a good one. I got a good one.

1090
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:48,491
I got the best one.

1091
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:50,890
I'm finding some really beautiful ones.

1092
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:52,390
(After picking a pretty strawberry)

1093
00:43:52,391 --> 00:43:53,630
- Arden, look at this.
- Over there.

1094
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,261
Arden, look at this one. Look at that.

1095
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:57,260
That's the perfect one.

1096
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:58,760
- This is perfect.
- No, look at this one.

1097
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,130
(Look at my strawberry.)

1098
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:01,530
- Mine's better.
- No, mine.

1099
00:44:01,531 --> 00:44:02,970
- Mine's redder.
- Mine's better.

1100
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:04,201
- Mine's redder.
- No.

1101
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:06,770
(Arden is used to it.)

1102
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:09,741
Chef. I have an idea for the drinks we should have together.

1103
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:11,241
How about a strawberry latte?

1104
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:12,710
- Strawberry latte?
- Strawberry latte?

1105
00:44:12,711 --> 00:44:13,711
- I'll try making it.
- Okay.

1106
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:14,912
You make the strawberry latte.

1107
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:17,097
- Let's have it with hotteok.
- But do you know what's weird?

1108
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,881
I'm eating strawberries.

1109
00:44:19,081 --> 00:44:21,151
I know it's dessert.

1110
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:23,051
But I want to eat...

1111
00:44:23,891 --> 00:44:25,291
strawberries with pork belly.

1112
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:27,630
Strawberry PB? Strawberry with pork belly?

1113
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,691
What do you think? Is it weird?

1114
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:32,277
I don't think strawberry with pork belly is a good idea.

1115
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:33,431
- What?
- It's wrong.

1116
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:35,500
- No?
- It's bad.

1117
00:44:35,501 --> 00:44:36,501
- You think so?
- Yes.

1118
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:39,041
We can make chimichurri with strawberries.

1119
00:44:39,341 --> 00:44:41,140
- Like puree?
- Lemon,

1120
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:43,110
pepper, strawberry, and salt.

1121
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:45,010
- Or like a salsa.
- What do you think?

1122
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:47,011
- Strawberry salsa?
- Strawberry salsa.

1123
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,380
- I like the idea.
- Right?

1124
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:49,410
It sounds good.

1125
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:50,420
- No.
- No?

1126
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,981
(Arden is objective about her dad.)

1127
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,421
I think we're about done. Shall we go back?

1128
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,191
- Yes.
- Okay. Let's go.

1129
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:58,991
Let's go.

1130
00:45:00,021 --> 00:45:01,161
Okay. Ready, Arden?

1131
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:03,460
Throw it up in the air.

1132
00:45:03,461 --> 00:45:04,630
(Ready for what?)

1133
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:07,001
(To have fun!)

1134
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,701
(Falling down)

1135
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:14,540
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my gosh.

1136
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,140
(Clusmy Eddie caused a big mess.)

1137
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:17,181
Oh, my gosh.

1138
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:18,640
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

1139
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:19,810
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

1140
00:45:19,811 --> 00:45:21,411
- Oh, no.
- What happened?

1141
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:22,680
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

1142
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:23,721
I'm okay.

1143
00:45:24,081 --> 00:45:25,780
- I'm okay.
- My goodness.

1144
00:45:25,781 --> 00:45:27,181
- He's fine.
- You broke something.

1145
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:28,650
Why would you throw it at me?

1146
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:30,131
You have to throw it high in the air.

1147
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,260
What do you mean?

1148
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:33,291
It's okay.

1149
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:34,890
- Forget about the strawberry.
- The strawberry is dead.

1150
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:36,651
- We're fine as long as Edward is.
- Eat it.

1151
00:45:37,331 --> 00:45:38,831
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1152
00:45:39,101 --> 00:45:40,431
We'll pretend it never happened.

1153
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,430
And you wore white pants.

1154
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:43,500
(His white pants are also dead.)

1155
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:44,501
Edward.

1156
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:46,400
You don't know how to catch, Dad.

1157
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:47,641
You were like a breakdancer.

1158
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:50,541
Literally, break dancing.

1159
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:53,241
- She threw it quite low.
- See?

1160
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:55,080
- Now he agrees with me.
- But...

1161
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:58,081
- What?
- you had to give up quickly.

1162
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:01,450
Because you did this...

1163
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:02,490
(Is Eddie blessed with the variety show deity?)

1164
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:04,090
This is not your fault.

1165
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:06,451
(An unexpected entertainment with strawberries on the side)

1166
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,130
Arden, when you were little, remember...

1167
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:14,330
when Dad would... If you fell down and were hurt,

1168
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:16,200
like skinned your knee or something,

1169
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:18,971
Dad would also fall down on purpose...

1170
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:20,470
- to cheer you up.
- That's right.

1171
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:21,831
And then you would start laughing.

1172
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:24,140
Just like now. You're laughing because he fell down.

1173
00:46:24,141 --> 00:46:25,141
Yes.

1174
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:28,751
(Dad Lee Kyun's big plan to make his daughter laugh)

1175
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:31,121
(And he sacrificed his white pants.)

1176
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:34,751
I hope that when my daughter grows older,

1177
00:46:35,051 --> 00:46:38,421
I will still be her father, but we will also be best friends.

1178
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:43,900
(Right now, he's not Chef Edward Lee...)

1179
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:47,531
(but Arden's friend and Dad Lee Kyun.)

1180
00:46:49,301 --> 00:46:50,941
- Are these for us?
- Yes.

1181
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:53,071
- We take what we picked, right?
- Yes.

1182
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:54,941
It's so pretty.

1183
00:46:55,371 --> 00:46:58,180
Strawberry flowers mean love and respect.

1184
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:01,251
So she put the flower in the box.

1185
00:47:01,311 --> 00:47:02,950
- That's beautiful.
- Yes.

1186
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:05,151
- This is what you've done.
- Thank you.

1187
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:07,151
Here's yours.

1188
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:09,250
- Thank you.
- We'll enjoy it.

1189
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:11,321
- Bye.
- Thank you.

1190
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,190
We've got strawberries.

1191
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:15,691
(The end of strawberry picking)

1192
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:19,231
(The Country members head to the next place as A Sung planned.)

1193
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:21,671
- Now I'm hungry.
- Yes.

1194
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,370
- Do you want more strawberries?
- Sure.

1195
00:47:25,371 --> 00:47:26,401
Yes?

1196
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,341
It's a secret.

1197
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:30,281
One more?

1198
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:32,311
A Sung. One more?

1199
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:35,410
(Trading strawberries behind Eddie's back)

1200
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:36,651
Dianne. One more?

1201
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,521
- No thank you.
- Okay.

1202
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:42,591
(A strawberry mouth guard)

1203
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,221
(Eating in secret makes it taste better.)

1204
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:49,561
(Korean strawberries are good.)

1205
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:50,901
Maybe.

1206
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:52,531
So?

1207
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,600
(He's clueless.)

1208
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:57,041
In English, we say, "I'm hungry."

1209
00:47:57,201 --> 00:47:59,741
When you're too hungry and angry,

1210
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:02,070
- we say "hangry." - Hangry.

1211
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:03,881
I'm getting hangry.

1212
00:48:04,441 --> 00:48:05,441
Hangry.

1213
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:09,251
(Very awkward)

1214
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:12,750
(We're not busted, are we?)

1215
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:14,490
(A Sung's Timeline of Day 1 in Andong)

1216
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,461
(Devour Andong jjimdak at 2:30pm)

1217
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,690
(The second ingredient for the special dinner, Andong jjimdak)

1218
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:22,691
A Sung.

1219
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,900
This place is famous for Andong jjimdak, right?

1220
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,661
- It's really famous.
- I'm getting excited.

1221
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:29,101
It's from the 1980s.

1222
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:30,901
The 1980s?

1223
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:32,400
(I wouldn't prepare a typical restaurant.)

1224
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:35,141
As Andong is known for jjimdak,

1225
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:38,241
I wanted to introduce the original jjimdak.

1226
00:48:40,081 --> 00:48:41,550
(The traditional taste A Sung...)

1227
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,191
(wants the Country members to experience)

1228
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:44,950
They say I'm the living proof.

1229
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:47,390
From the very beginning and the bottom until now.

1230
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,767
(The Jjimdak Alley's native, Lim Myung Ja)

1231
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,020
I joined the market in the early 1980s...

1232
00:48:51,021 --> 00:48:53,631
by selling raw chicken I caught.

1233
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:56,791
At first, whole fried chickens were sold.

1234
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,700
There were several universities in Andong...

1235
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:00,901
and a big army unit.

1236
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:02,931
On weekends,

1237
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:05,500
parents, brothers, and sisters...

1238
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:07,671
came to visit.

1239
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:09,870
But there wasn't much to eat.

1240
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:11,010
One whole fried chicken.

1241
00:49:11,011 --> 00:49:12,911
But once it's fried, there's not much to eat.

1242
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,211
"Can't you make the portion bigger..."

1243
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:17,520
"with just one chicken?"

1244
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,690
With that, glass noodles, vegetables,

1245
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,621
potatoes, and such were added.

1246
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:24,860
That resulted in the generous portion...

1247
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,360
of Andong jjimdak.

1248
00:49:26,361 --> 00:49:28,601
(Jjimdak was born thanks to the Andong merchant's love.)

1249
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:30,360
(It started at Andong Gu Market, )

1250
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:31,861
(which has a history of 100 years.)

1251
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:34,870
(Jjimdak specialty stores, each with unique flavors, )

1252
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:35,931
(started opening.)

1253
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:39,040
(Jjimdak has become Andong's specialty for over 40 years.)

1254
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,440
- This is also a jjimdak place.
- Yes.

1255
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:42,540
Here's another one. And over there, as well.

1256
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:46,441
Arden. Every one of these shops serves the same food.

1257
00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:47,881
Jjimdak.

1258
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:50,681
But they all do it a little bit differently.

1259
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,851
Oh, my gosh. It smells good.

1260
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,351
Now we're hungry.

1261
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:57,590
- I'm hangry.
- Hangry.

1262
00:49:57,591 --> 00:49:58,760
I'm hangry.

1263
00:49:58,761 --> 00:49:59,991
Hangry.

1264
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:02,790
This is where we'll dine.

1265
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,237
(A Sung stops in front of a restaurant.)

1266
00:50:04,261 --> 00:50:06,460
Welcome. Have some jjimdak.

1267
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,331
Hi.

1268
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:10,000
Have some jjimdak.

1269
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:12,201
- Okay. Looks good.
- Welcome.

1270
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:13,441
Welcome.

1271
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:14,870
(A simple yet warm space with traces of time)

1272
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:16,571
Hi.

1273
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:18,610
- Hi.
- Hi.

1274
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:21,310
We're a party of six.

1275
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,751
- Take this table.
- Okay.

1276
00:50:23,011 --> 00:50:24,720
You sit here. I'll sit here.

1277
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:25,721
No, I'll sit here.

1278
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:27,250
You sit next to your best friend.

1279
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:29,421
Okay. Hi, buddy.

1280
00:50:33,461 --> 00:50:34,761
Is there a restroom here?

1281
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,630
- If you step outside, - Okay.

1282
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:37,631
There's one in front.

1283
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:39,830
Do we want to give this to everybody?

1284
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:41,230
- Should we pass it along?
- Yes, please.

1285
00:50:41,231 --> 00:50:42,231
Yes?

1286
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:44,170
What's the appropriate way to do it?

1287
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:46,101
First, you have to put a tissue down.

1288
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:49,571
- So tissue down.
- Tissue down. Chopsticks.

1289
00:50:49,871 --> 00:50:52,211
Chopsticks and spoons are okay.

1290
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:55,311
The spoon should be on the left side.

1291
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:58,750
- Spoon should be on the left.
- Spoon on the left.

1292
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:00,621
- Spoon on the left.
- Chopsticks.

1293
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:03,590
And then, turn the tissue into a diamond shape.

1294
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:04,660
- Yes.
- Okay.

1295
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,091
The shape doesn't matter, but...

1296
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,590
- Look, Edward.
- What?

1297
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:09,090
- I learned something.
- What happened?

1298
00:51:09,091 --> 00:51:10,731
The Korean table manners.

1299
00:51:11,561 --> 00:51:13,231
(The husband is pleased.)

1300
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,070
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1301
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:17,511
(The basic table is set with water.)

1302
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:19,641
(What is Arden doing alone?)

1303
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:21,870
(Pouring the water into cups)

1304
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,311
What a sweet girl.

1305
00:51:23,741 --> 00:51:24,741
She can start her social life.

1306
00:51:24,742 --> 00:51:28,180
She's well-versed in Korean culture.

1307
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:29,181
Okay.

1308
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,221
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1309
00:51:32,951 --> 00:51:34,221
(Good job, sweetie.)

1310
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,751
(This is nothing.)

1311
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:39,790
- We'd like to order.
- Okay. Go ahead.

1312
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:40,960
We're a party of six.

1313
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:42,961
If it's 6 people, how about 2 mediums?

1314
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,531
- Two mediums? Okay.
- Good.

1315
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:46,100
- All right.
- I'll make it good.

1316
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:47,101
Okay.

1317
00:51:47,101 --> 00:51:48,101
(Ordered Andong jjimdak)

1318
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:52,241
Arden. Try to eat the chicken.

1319
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:55,110
- If you can't, let me know. Okay?
- All right.

1320
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,581
But try and eat as much of it as you can.

1321
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:01,610
(What does that mean?)

1322
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:03,411
(Can she not eat chicken?)

1323
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:05,480
(Eddie has been worried since earlier.)

1324
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:07,651
To Korean people, "not spicy" means...

1325
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:10,591
a little bit of chili pepper.

1326
00:52:11,591 --> 00:52:15,531
But in America, "not spicy" means no chili pepper at all.

1327
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:18,560
My daughter is so sensitive that she can't eat it.

1328
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:20,670
She loves Korean food.

1329
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,501
She just can't have anything spicy.

1330
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:25,271
But again, it can't be spicy.

1331
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:29,810
We can choose the flavor.

1332
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:32,410
They have mild, medium, and spicy.

1333
00:52:32,411 --> 00:52:34,210
But even the mild one has a bit...

1334
00:52:34,211 --> 00:52:36,110
- of spiciness. She can't have it.
- I see.

1335
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,550
Okay. I'll go and ask her.

1336
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:38,621
I'll do it.

1337
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:41,221
(After realizing what's going on, A Sung walks outside.)

1338
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:42,590
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

1339
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:45,261
One of our party is a daughter.

1340
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,261
But she can't handle anything spicy.

1341
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:48,990
Please make it the least spicy.

1342
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:50,291
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1343
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:52,361
(She's making it not spicy.)

1344
00:52:53,231 --> 00:52:54,871
- Can she make it?
- Two mild.

1345
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:57,501
Two mild.

1346
00:52:58,171 --> 00:52:59,671
I eat spicy.

1347
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:01,411
- Really?
- She likes spicy.

1348
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:03,941
(Dianne likes spicy food?)

1349
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,111
(Si A gets up this time.)

1350
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:07,781
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1351
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:09,681
Ma'am.

1352
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:10,981
- Can we...
- Yes?

1353
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:13,351
Get 1 mild and 1 medium?

1354
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:16,321
Is it okay?

1355
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:18,621
(Why does she look so chill?)

1356
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:21,931
(Hold on. It's too early to be surprised.)

1357
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:25,061
(After cooking the chicken and potatoes first, )

1358
00:53:25,961 --> 00:53:27,901
(she makes the secret seasoning on the spot.)

1359
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:30,841
(Adding in ginseng that's probably new to everyone)

1360
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:34,411
(This is the jjimdak seasoning with 47 years of history.)

1361
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:39,341
(Boiling it down so that the ingredients become flavorful)

1362
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:42,411
(Adjusting the spiciness with red chili)

1363
00:53:43,581 --> 00:53:45,451
(Vegetables and glass noodles are a must.)

1364
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:52,921
(The most famous dish of Andong, Andong jjimdak)

1365
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,591
Where should I put the mild?

1366
00:53:56,831 --> 00:53:58,530
- Over here.
- Please place the mild here.

1367
00:53:58,531 --> 00:53:59,860
(For Arden who can't handle spicy food)

1368
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,971
Oh, gosh.

1369
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:03,401
That looks delicious.

1370
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,341
It looks good.

1371
00:54:05,901 --> 00:54:08,341
(The medium spicy jjimdak with red chili has arrived.)

1372
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:09,941
That one's mine.

1373
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:15,781
(Andong jjimdak, sweet but with a kick near the end, is complete.)

1374
00:54:19,421 --> 00:54:22,020
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1375
00:54:22,021 --> 00:54:23,961
Is the noodles underneath? Is it glass noodles?

1376
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:25,760
- It's sweet potato noodles.
- Basically, yes.

1377
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:26,821
Sweet potato noodles.

1378
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:28,291
It looks delicious.

1379
00:54:28,991 --> 00:54:30,861
Arden, that's basically japchae.

1380
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:32,260
- You know what Grandma makes?
- Yes.

1381
00:54:32,261 --> 00:54:33,971
But in a different way.

1382
00:54:37,101 --> 00:54:38,971
- How is it?
- It's really good.

1383
00:54:39,341 --> 00:54:40,840
You can taste the ingredients.

1384
00:54:40,841 --> 00:54:41,910
It's delicious.

1385
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,870
(The glass noodles are hard with chopsticks.)

1386
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:45,711
- You can taste the ginseng.
- Right?

1387
00:54:46,641 --> 00:54:48,851
(The dad takes a generous amount of glass noodles.)

1388
00:54:49,511 --> 00:54:50,611
(Si A takes this much.)

1389
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,741
(A lonely battle with a strand of glass noodles)

1390
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,090
(She's very skilled.)

1391
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:55,721
(Mom Dianne is focused on the jjimdak.)

1392
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,821
(Whatever. Let's use my fingers.)

1393
00:55:00,491 --> 00:55:03,861
(I hope it suits Arden's taste.)

1394
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,631
Arden. It says Mangwon Market.

1395
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:09,700
- Tricolor jeon.
- Okay.

1396
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:11,847
(Eddie works hard to make Arden try various Korean dishes.)

1397
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,240
- For you.
- No, for you.

1398
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:14,587
(But Korean dishes are foreign to her.)

1399
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:18,080
- Please. You must try one.
- No.

1400
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,581
- One time.
- No.

1401
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:23,210
You are Korean. All Koreans must eat tteokbokki.

1402
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:24,221
(An internal dilemma)

1403
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,621
(Will Arden get used to the taste of Korean dishes?)

1404
00:55:28,121 --> 00:55:29,320
This is hot.

1405
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:30,420
- I don't think so.
- Thank you.

1406
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:31,421
Would you like some?

1407
00:55:31,422 --> 00:55:32,860
Arden. It's the noodles.

1408
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:33,961
(Arden is ready to eat.)

1409
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:35,991
(Finally, Arden is trying.)

1410
00:55:37,091 --> 00:55:39,001
(She starts off with glass noodles!)

1411
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,571
(I hope she likes it.)

1412
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,800
(After, she eats a whole chicken piece.)

1413
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,870
Could you put a little chicken on her plate?

1414
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:48,811
She actually grabbed some of these.

1415
00:55:49,871 --> 00:55:51,841
(Don't worry.)

1416
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:55,411
(Devouring the well-seasoned carrot)

1417
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:57,881
Arden. What do you think?

1418
00:55:58,651 --> 00:55:59,781
It tastes good.

1419
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:02,041
(A Sung's choice of jjimdak was right.)

1420
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:04,297
(It's now Dianne's turn to try the jjimdak.)

1421
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:05,560
With jjimdak.

1422
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:07,201
- I didn't cook rice.
- One soju, please.

1423
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,831
(Glancing)

1424
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:13,100
Yes, I'll eat that.

1425
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:16,100
(She's taking some sauce into the big bowl.)

1426
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:17,101
Si A.

1427
00:56:17,271 --> 00:56:19,101
(Something looks wrong.)

1428
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:23,570
- Thank you.
- Ma'am. Three rice, please.

1429
00:56:23,571 --> 00:56:24,581
- Three rice?
- Yes.

1430
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,011
So do you put the... What's this for?

1431
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:30,351
That's for the bone.

1432
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:32,691
- It's just for the bone?
- Yes, for the bone.

1433
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:33,981
That's okay.

1434
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,821
I should've let you know.

1435
00:56:35,921 --> 00:56:37,150
(Eddie also bursts into laughter.)

1436
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:38,161
It's okay.

1437
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:40,930
You should've told her...

1438
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,591
and not just focus on eating.

1439
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:43,831
Oh, no.

1440
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:47,471
My wife likes to eat big.

1441
00:56:48,971 --> 00:56:49,971
A big appetite.

1442
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:50,971
(He's slow-witted.)

1443
00:56:52,171 --> 00:56:53,571
But this is very small.

1444
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,411
Bon appetit.

1445
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:06,951
(Dianne likes Korean food, but it's her first jjimdak ever.)

1446
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:10,521
(What do you think?)

1447
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:15,161
(Slurping)

1448
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:16,660
- The kick.
- Right?

1449
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:18,231
It has a really great flavor.

1450
00:57:18,661 --> 00:57:20,401
I love how it's very rich.

1451
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:21,731
It is.

1452
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,331
And comforting, you know?

1453
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:24,800
This is excellent.

1454
00:57:24,801 --> 00:57:27,082
(Andong jjimdak has captivated Arden and Dianne's taste.)

1455
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:30,111
(Eddie enjoys the food at ease now.)

1456
00:57:31,511 --> 00:57:33,941
(The chewy glass noodles are another star of jjimdak.)

1457
00:57:36,181 --> 00:57:38,251
(Slurping)

1458
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:42,121
(Competing slurping down the noodles)

1459
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:47,861
(Yo Han has the meat and the glass noodles together.)

1460
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:51,001
(Chicken tastes better when the fingers get involved.)

1461
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:53,330
It's good.

1462
00:57:53,331 --> 00:57:54,730
This alone is more than enough.

1463
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:55,871
- I agree.
- Right?

1464
00:57:59,201 --> 00:58:01,771
(One well-cooked potato)

1465
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:03,610
(Eating)

1466
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:04,611
I like it.

1467
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:09,351
(Dianne has fallen in love with the charms of jjimdak.)

1468
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:12,021
(She was hooked on the taste for a while.)

1469
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:13,851
It's really warming.

1470
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:16,090
Yes, it's warming. It's a warming food.

1471
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:17,661
I'm starting to sweat a little bit.

1472
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:20,520
It was very delicious.

1473
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:24,361
It was familiar. It had a galbijjim kind of flavor to it.

1474
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:27,031
It was very unique and really strong.

1475
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:31,840
- The taste of ginseng.
- You can taste the ginseng.

1476
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,401
It does taste of ginseng.

1477
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:35,241
Doesn't it taste healthy, Kyun?

1478
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:39,211
Eating it on a cold day is warming up my body.

1479
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:41,580
I like it.

1480
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:42,851
(Eddie likes jjimdak.)

1481
00:58:43,581 --> 00:58:44,781
What do you think? Is it okay?

1482
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,751
Yes, it's okay.

1483
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,791
(The Country members are silent once again.)

1484
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,961
(While everyone is enjoying jjimdak, )

1485
00:58:53,461 --> 00:58:55,160
(Arden is self-conscious.)

1486
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:56,360
It's a bit spicy.

1487
00:58:56,361 --> 00:58:57,661
- It is, right?
- Is it?

1488
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,101
Is it spicy?

1489
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:00,361
(Worried)

1490
00:59:02,871 --> 00:59:03,930
How is it?

1491
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:04,941
(What do we do?)

1492
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:07,071
- It tastes good.
- The flavors...

1493
00:59:07,171 --> 00:59:09,270
(A Sung suddenly gets up.)

1494
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:11,111
You want some Coke or Sprite?

1495
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,581
Sure.

1496
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:13,581
(It's spicy.)

1497
00:59:13,582 --> 00:59:14,681
(Where is A Sung going?)

1498
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,551
(Is this not the place?)

1499
00:59:20,881 --> 00:59:22,451
(Let's run for now.)

1500
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:25,161
(She looks around for a while.)

1501
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:28,391
- Hi, ma'am.
- Welcome.

1502
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,200
Can I get some dumplings to go?

1503
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:32,201
Of course.

1504
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:35,430
Someone can't handle spicy food.

1505
00:59:35,431 --> 00:59:36,431
Is that so?

1506
00:59:36,601 --> 00:59:37,941
What did you do today?

1507
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:41,310
Today, we dressed up in hanbok.

1508
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,111
- Did you go to the Korean market?
- Yes.

1509
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,181
My favorite was the vegan dumplings.

1510
00:59:48,611 --> 00:59:51,550
- Vegan dumplings?
- Yes. Vegetable dumplings.

1511
00:59:51,551 --> 00:59:52,881
Vegetable dumplings.

1512
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,191
Please give me one packet of meat dumplings.

1513
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,390
I'll give you one of each.

1514
00:59:58,391 --> 00:59:59,391
- Okay.
- Yes.

1515
00:59:59,392 --> 01:00:01,272
(She orders one packet of warm meat dumplings.)

1516
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:03,030
(She gladly pays for them.)

1517
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:04,801
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1518
01:00:05,161 --> 01:00:06,961
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

1519
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,071
(Running again)

1520
01:00:10,201 --> 01:00:12,771
(I'll give the dumplings to her while they are still hot.)

1521
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:17,441
Arden, I got you some dumplings.

1522
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:18,880
- For you.
- Yes.

1523
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,141
So sweet.

1524
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:21,980
Gosh, thank you.

1525
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:25,151
- Do you like meat dumplings?
- Yes.

1526
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:28,620
Here.

1527
01:00:28,621 --> 01:00:30,491
- Thank you.
- My goodness.

1528
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:33,221
It's not spicy at all.

1529
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:36,030
You're too nice. Thank you.

1530
01:00:36,031 --> 01:00:37,191
- So sweet.
- Sweetheart.

1531
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:39,260
Thank you.

1532
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:40,330
(Edward and Dianne express their sincere gratitude.)

1533
01:00:40,331 --> 01:00:42,500
I used to be like that when I was a child.

1534
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:43,531
- Really?
- Yes.

1535
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:45,841
I resonated with her.

1536
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:48,240
When did you start eating spicy food?

1537
01:00:48,241 --> 01:00:49,241
I still can't eat them.

1538
01:00:49,241 --> 01:00:50,241
You can't?

1539
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:53,710
- This I can eat.
- Is this... I see.

1540
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:55,911
(Thanks to A Sung, Arden gets to have tasty dumplings.)

1541
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:58,220
(I'm glad she's eating well.)

1542
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,457
Si A, can you handle spicy food?

1543
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:01,091
- Yes. I love it.
- Me too.

1544
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:02,551
The spicier, the better.

1545
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:06,991
When I was a little boy about 7 or 8 years old,

1546
01:01:07,361 --> 01:01:09,131
my favorite food was bibim naengmyeon.

1547
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:10,860
- Bibim naengmyeon?
- Bibim naengmyeon.

1548
01:01:10,861 --> 01:01:12,630
- I had it so spicy.
- When you were seven?

1549
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,261
I was 7 or 8 years old. I loved it.

1550
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:16,431
I still love bibim naengmyeon.

1551
01:01:16,831 --> 01:01:18,271
So, what is this one?

1552
01:01:18,871 --> 01:01:20,100
(Red chili)

1553
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:21,111
Is this spicy?

1554
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:23,011
I think it is.

1555
01:01:23,441 --> 01:01:25,201
(Verifying his pride in handling spicy food)

1556
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:27,641
- Nice.
- Is it all right?

1557
01:01:28,111 --> 01:01:29,680
I think it plays a big part.

1558
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:31,121
- The chili? Right.
- The red chili.

1559
01:01:32,051 --> 01:01:33,850
The red chili makes it refreshing.

1560
01:01:33,851 --> 01:01:36,291
It's subtly spicy while adding umami.

1561
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:40,720
(Taking another piece of the red chili while he's at it)

1562
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:42,891
You know how to eat jjimdak.

1563
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:45,431
- Well.
- He eats it very well.

1564
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,442
(One man has fallen in love with the flavors of jjimdak.)

1565
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,631
(Should we take a moment to watch Edward eat?)

1566
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:52,171
I love it.

1567
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:54,331
(Automatically returning the bone)

1568
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:56,411
(Slurping)

1569
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:58,981
Potato.

1570
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:00,142
(Trying the potato this time)

1571
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:03,851
(Satisfied)

1572
01:02:04,051 --> 01:02:07,281
The more you have it, the tastier it gets.

1573
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,120
(They understand what he means.)

1574
01:02:10,121 --> 01:02:12,791
Is it rare for you to eat this?

1575
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:14,691
You don't get this very often, right?

1576
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:16,890
Yes. Actually, it depends on the people.

1577
01:02:16,891 --> 01:02:19,260
In my case, it's rare to have it.

1578
01:02:19,261 --> 01:02:22,001
Our family doesn't eat jjimdak at all.

1579
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,831
This is my third time.

1580
01:02:24,171 --> 01:02:26,501
- Really? In your whole life?
- In my whole life. Yes.

1581
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,701
But not from now on.

1582
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:31,071
I'm going to have it every day because it's so tasty.

1583
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:34,010
If I have jjimdak two more times, then we're even.

1584
01:02:34,011 --> 01:02:35,150
- We're the same.
- Yes, we are.

1585
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,951
(Why does she feel like she's been defeated?)

1586
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:39,751
I'm going to eat jjimdak every day until we're even.

1587
01:02:40,521 --> 01:02:42,081
But I'm going to have it every day too.

1588
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:44,220
I know why it's good now.

1589
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:45,420
(The mind game of the two proud foodies)

1590
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:46,890
By the way, I'm certain of one thing.

1591
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:50,661
When the food is good, we are both busy.

1592
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,531
(The foodies' mirror match: 1 versus 1)

1593
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,700
This is not spicy. It's all right, isn't it?

1594
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:57,941
Gosh, it's good.

1595
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:01,211
(While a close match of the century between two foodies is on...)

1596
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:03,471
The glass noodles were really tasty.

1597
01:03:03,771 --> 01:03:05,940
But they were almost gone before I knew it.

1598
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:08,341
(During the foodies' match, the glass noodles went missing.)

1599
01:03:09,381 --> 01:03:11,380
(Suspect 1: Edward Lee who eats very well)

1600
01:03:11,381 --> 01:03:14,180
(Suspect 2: Lee Kyun who eats super well)

1601
01:03:14,181 --> 01:03:16,390
(Suspect 3: Arden's dad who eats especially well)

1602
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:18,721
And the perp was sitting next to me on my right.

1603
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,490
(The glass-noodle assassin has been arrested.)

1604
01:03:21,491 --> 01:03:22,491
Like this...

1605
01:03:22,492 --> 01:03:25,231
I thought it was very satisfying for him.

1606
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:29,870
The eating speed is different.

1607
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:31,517
(The amount of the remaining jjimdak looks very different.)

1608
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,070
You said you tried japchae before.

1609
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:35,071
Yes.

1610
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:38,841
How do these glass noodles differ from the ones in japchae?

1611
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:43,010
Honestly, I'm not a fan of japchae.

1612
01:03:43,011 --> 01:03:44,081
Really?

1613
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:46,020
(A shocking confession from the glass-noodle assassin)

1614
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:48,191
It's because japchae is a bit bland.

1615
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:52,561
When they cook glass noodles like this with jjimdak,

1616
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:53,861
it's very flavorful.

1617
01:03:56,031 --> 01:03:57,591
This is how I want to eat japchae.

1618
01:03:58,761 --> 01:04:00,461
It has lots of sauce.

1619
01:04:00,831 --> 01:04:02,170
It's almost like japchae soup.

1620
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,200
(The sweet and salty broth is absorbed in the glass noodles.)

1621
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:04,401
Yes. It's japchae soup.

1622
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:07,001
Is it all right?

1623
01:04:07,002 --> 01:04:08,587
(Dianne is obsessed with glass noodles too.)

1624
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,511
(The dumplings are tasty too.)

1625
01:04:10,871 --> 01:04:11,881
Can I have a dumpling?

1626
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,441
Why do you steal your daughter's food?

1627
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,080
I bought them for your daughter.

1628
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:18,081
They look good.

1629
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:20,321
They look good.

1630
01:04:22,421 --> 01:04:24,191
(Eddie stands up suddenly.)

1631
01:04:24,491 --> 01:04:26,160
(Where is he going?)

1632
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:28,161
Arden, I want you to look over there.

1633
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:30,930
Do you see how they have the TV thing over there?

1634
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:32,801
They're very famous and was on TV.

1635
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:35,071
(Why is Eddie introducing the place all of a sudden?)

1636
01:04:36,231 --> 01:04:38,771
(His hand is faster than the eyes.)

1637
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:40,601
TV commercials.

1638
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:42,681
I grabbed one of her dumplings.

1639
01:04:43,941 --> 01:04:46,840
Sir, why do you steal from your daughter?

1640
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,210
He stole a dumpling.

1641
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:49,211
(He got me.)

1642
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,081
He grabbed one while talking to her.

1643
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:54,421
My goodness. This is good.

1644
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,151
Slow down.

1645
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:59,860
- So, do we mix it now?
- Sure.

1646
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:00,960
Is that okay?

1647
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:02,330
Is it fried rice or bibimbap?

1648
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,991
- Bibimbap.
- It's more like bibimbap.

1649
01:05:06,231 --> 01:05:07,931
(He gives a ladleful to Yo Han first.)

1650
01:05:08,201 --> 01:05:09,730
Thank you.

1651
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:10,807
(He gives a ladleful on A Sung's plate too.)

1652
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:11,871
Give me a lot.

1653
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:14,740
(To Si A, who is still hungry, )

1654
01:05:14,741 --> 01:05:15,741
(he gives a big ladleful of it.)

1655
01:05:15,741 --> 01:05:16,741
Thank you.

1656
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,011
(Lastly, for Eddie himself...)

1657
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,521
I have a big appetite.

1658
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,561
(Savoring)

1659
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:34,460
Okay. That's good.

1660
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:35,661
(As expected, it's good.)

1661
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:42,601
(The jjimdak bibimbap is almost gone now.)

1662
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:44,640
Do you think I should make this at home?

1663
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:45,701
Yes, I love this.

1664
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:47,071
- Okay.
- I think this is...

1665
01:05:47,571 --> 01:05:49,970
one of my favorite Korean dishes right now.

1666
01:05:49,971 --> 01:05:50,971
- Really?
- Yes.

1667
01:05:50,972 --> 01:05:51,980
- Good.
- Goodness.

1668
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,441
You like this better than jokbal?

1669
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:55,881
- Pig feet?
- Yes.

1670
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:58,620
(From today, her number 1 Korean dish is jjimdak.)

1671
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,450
As for the jjimdak sauce,

1672
01:06:00,451 --> 01:06:04,291
I can tell it has a lot of time put into it.

1673
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:08,161
To me, being able to have some of the jjimdak sauce means...

1674
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:11,900
I can create something with deep flavors using that sauce.

1675
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,801
Because it was not a very typical flavor.

1676
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:18,241
I keep thinking about the flavor.

1677
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:21,301
- It was so good.
- Was it? Was it all right?

1678
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,840
- Gosh, it was lovely.
- It was great.

1679
01:06:23,841 --> 01:06:28,610
Ma'am, is it possible to buy a little bit of the sauce?

1680
01:06:28,611 --> 01:06:29,780
(What is she saying?)

1681
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,480
We don't sell our sauce.

1682
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:34,120
We've never given it to anyone.

1683
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:35,321
(It's going to be difficult.)

1684
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:38,290
But we'll give it to you as a special occasion.

1685
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,860
- Please.
- Just a little bit is fine.

1686
01:06:39,861 --> 01:06:41,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1687
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:43,191
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1688
01:06:43,861 --> 01:06:46,531
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

1689
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:48,531
This is the sauce.

1690
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:50,501
I put the red chili, just in case.

1691
01:06:50,601 --> 01:06:52,500
- The red chili.
- I put the spicy chili in the bag.

1692
01:06:52,501 --> 01:06:54,170
- Thank you.
- If you want it spicy,

1693
01:06:54,171 --> 01:06:55,270
add the chili.

1694
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:56,840
Don't put it in if one can't have spicy food.

1695
01:06:56,841 --> 01:06:58,180
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

1696
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,181
- Okay.
- Bye.

1697
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:00,510
- Bye.
- Thanks for the food.

1698
01:07:00,511 --> 01:07:02,350
- Let's go. Thanks for the food.
- Bye.

1699
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1700
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:05,020
- We'll come again.
- Thanks for the food, ma'am.

1701
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,051
- Yes. Thanks for the food.
- Thank you.

1702
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,491
Oh, my gosh.

1703
01:07:09,251 --> 01:07:10,350
(Andong jjimdak)

1704
01:07:10,351 --> 01:07:12,821
I'm still hungry.

1705
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:16,961
Let's try another jjimdak.

1706
01:07:17,931 --> 01:07:19,060
- That sounds good.
- No.

1707
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:20,600
- Should we try this one?
- It's not a good idea.

1708
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:22,200
You have to finish it, though.

1709
01:07:22,201 --> 01:07:23,530
Just follow me.

1710
01:07:23,531 --> 01:07:25,341
(When you're in Andong, just follow me.)

1711
01:07:25,701 --> 01:07:27,001
- This way.
- Let's go.

1712
01:07:28,341 --> 01:07:29,540
Let's go back.

1713
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:31,610
(Leaving behind the memories with tasty jjimdak, )

1714
01:07:31,611 --> 01:07:33,711
(they head back to the lodging.)

1715
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:39,380
(A sweet break time has come to the Country members...)

1716
01:07:39,381 --> 01:07:41,451
(after a pleasant meal.)

1717
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,351
I'm tired.

1718
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:45,761
(Dozing off)

1719
01:07:46,821 --> 01:07:47,821
(Dozing off)

1720
01:07:48,561 --> 01:07:51,090
(Getting drowsy and fuzzy)

1721
01:07:51,091 --> 01:07:53,560
Feeling warm and cold repetitively makes you sleepy.

1722
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:54,641
- Sleepy.
- Yes, of course.

1723
01:07:54,931 --> 01:07:57,370
- We're very sleepy now.
- Me too.

1724
01:07:57,371 --> 01:07:58,617
(It's the perfect time to take a nap.)

1725
01:07:58,641 --> 01:07:59,771
Merry Christmas.

1726
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:02,771
It's Santa.

1727
01:08:03,571 --> 01:08:06,541
(Eddie comes with Santa.)

1728
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:08,911
Merry Christmas, everybody.

1729
01:08:09,511 --> 01:08:11,551
Merry Christmas, everybody.

1730
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:14,451
So cute.

1731
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:16,020
What are you guys doing?

1732
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:17,667
(Arden can't take her eyes off of the cute Santa doll.)

1733
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:19,021
The materials on the wall.

1734
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:21,891
What did you learn?

1735
01:08:23,491 --> 01:08:25,660
(Shy)

1736
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:26,661
You speak.

1737
01:08:26,662 --> 01:08:28,771
- Arden.
- You tell him.

1738
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:33,001
What did you learn today?

1739
01:08:33,201 --> 01:08:35,241
(They're all cute.)

1740
01:08:35,671 --> 01:08:38,180
You're my best friend.

1741
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:40,840
Gosh, thank you.

1742
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:42,111
(We are best friends for life.)

1743
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,251
Sorry.

1744
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,051
Now that his daughter and wife are here,

1745
01:08:46,151 --> 01:08:50,691
I can see that he has become more adorable and mischievous.

1746
01:08:50,921 --> 01:08:52,991
More than anything, the look on his face...

1747
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:57,060
His face has been lifted up.

1748
01:08:57,061 --> 01:08:59,401
The corners of his mouth are lifted because he's happy.

1749
01:08:59,661 --> 01:09:04,001
He was kind and sweet as a chef,

1750
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:08,410
but he also showed a different kind of kindness and sweetness.

1751
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:10,651
(Dad Edward is infinitely sweet to his daughter, Arden.)

1752
01:09:11,011 --> 01:09:14,881
If you want dinner, I have to start cooking soon.

1753
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:16,281
Are they cooking with you?

1754
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:17,451
Only the men are cooking.

1755
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:18,751
Only the men?

1756
01:09:18,851 --> 01:09:20,180
- Are you working with me?
- Only the men?

1757
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:21,181
Okay.

1758
01:09:21,182 --> 01:09:22,990
Kyun, should you and I get going, then?

1759
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,251
- Yes.
- Will I be helpful?

1760
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,690
Please.

1761
01:09:25,691 --> 01:09:26,720
- Seriously.
- Because he doesn't want...

1762
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:28,491
- Yes.
- Look at my eyes. Are you sure?

1763
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:30,391
Yes. I trust you.

1764
01:09:31,061 --> 01:09:33,401
Okay. We'll see you at dinnertime.

1765
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:34,560
- Sure.
- Okay.

1766
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:36,730
- All right. See you. Thank you.
- All right.

1767
01:09:36,731 --> 01:09:38,470
- See you soon.
- Thank you. See you soon.

1768
01:09:38,471 --> 01:09:39,540
- Thank you, guys.
- Good luck.

1769
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:41,270
- See you soon.
- If you need help,

1770
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:42,570
- you can call us at any time.
- Okay.

1771
01:09:42,571 --> 01:09:43,611
- Okay.
- Yes.

1772
01:09:44,111 --> 01:09:46,111
Men belong to the kitchen.

1773
01:09:46,381 --> 01:09:47,541
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

1774
01:09:48,181 --> 01:09:50,711
- Kyun. Be careful.
- Be careful.

1775
01:09:51,581 --> 01:09:52,581
Please.

1776
01:09:52,582 --> 01:09:53,927
(The two men are off to a rocky start.)

1777
01:09:53,951 --> 01:09:55,690
My gosh. It's so loud.

1778
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:56,921
(Can we trust the guys?)

1779
01:09:59,121 --> 01:10:00,920
- Have you been and seen it?
- Yes.

1780
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:02,890
- So? Was it all right?
- Yes. He has a lot.

1781
01:10:02,891 --> 01:10:04,611
(The 4 women's dinner is on 2 men's hands.)

1782
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:08,470
Okay. The weather is beautiful.

1783
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:10,331
What should I do?

1784
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:12,200
The same thing. Help me chop vegetables.

1785
01:10:12,201 --> 01:10:13,201
Okay.

1786
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:16,671
Okay. This will be fun. We have two hours...

1787
01:10:17,241 --> 01:10:19,411
to make dinner for six people.

1788
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:22,480
- So... Possible.
- It's possible.

1789
01:10:22,481 --> 01:10:23,481
Yes. It's possible.

1790
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:24,651
(Positive power)

1791
01:10:25,281 --> 01:10:27,950
(Arden has become close to the Santa doll quickly.)

1792
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:29,151
It's adorable.

1793
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,351
Let's try to do it.

1794
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:35,891
(Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way)

1795
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:39,931
(But I'm still the best dancer here.)

1796
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:41,731
Do you have Christmas songs?

1797
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,401
- In Korea?
- Korean Christmas songs?

1798
01:10:44,471 --> 01:10:47,470
We have... You better not pout

1799
01:10:47,471 --> 01:10:49,141
(That song is...)

1800
01:10:50,571 --> 01:10:52,740
- That's not a Korean song.
- You better not cry

1801
01:10:52,741 --> 01:10:54,211
It's not a Korean song. My gosh.

1802
01:10:54,411 --> 01:10:55,681
- That's not it.
- No.

1803
01:10:56,411 --> 01:10:58,081
(I'm sure you haven't heard of it.)

1804
01:10:58,181 --> 01:11:00,220
(Wait, no. It's "Silent Night.")

1805
01:11:00,221 --> 01:11:01,321
Come on.

1806
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:03,191
What do we have?

1807
01:11:03,721 --> 01:11:04,890
This is the first stage.

1808
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:06,590
(In case Arden is bored, A Sung teaches her the game of gonggi.)

1809
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:08,161
One ball.

1810
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,161
Just grab one and a time.

1811
01:11:11,491 --> 01:11:12,931
- Do you want to try it?
- Sure.

1812
01:11:14,861 --> 01:11:16,030
(You should learn it if you want to survive in "Squid Game.")

1813
01:11:16,031 --> 01:11:17,300
That was very close.

1814
01:11:17,301 --> 01:11:18,341
You're doing great.

1815
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:20,571
(Succesful)

1816
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:21,770
(Participant 457, Arden, survives!)

1817
01:11:21,771 --> 01:11:24,171
- You made it.
- You made it.

1818
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:27,141
- Arden got it.
- You got it.

1819
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:28,980
- My gosh.
- My goodness.

1820
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:30,080
(We hope this trip to Korea will be a good memory for Arden.)

1821
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:31,081
I closed my eyes.

1822
01:11:31,082 --> 01:11:32,481
- Really?
- I closed my eyes.

1823
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:33,581
Let's see.

1824
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:36,150
- It worked.
- It worked.

1825
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:38,231
(A Sung and Si A have become Arden's first friends.)

1826
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:41,991
(We've become close enough that we can lie around comfortably.)

1827
01:11:43,531 --> 01:11:45,531
- It's so cozy.
- It's a good angle for me.

1828
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:48,500
I heard you have a Korean name. What is it?

1829
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:50,270
- It's Na Mi.
- Na Mi?

1830
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,240
- Na Mi.
- Lee Na Mi.

1831
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,241
(Arden's Korean name, Lee Na Mi)

1832
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:54,341
Na Mi.

1833
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:58,010
- Na Mi. Our dear Na Mi.
- Na Mi.

1834
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:00,240
- The name suits you well.
- Yes.

1835
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:02,151
- That's cute.
- Na Mi is a cute name...

1836
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,381
in Korea.

1837
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:08,621
Have you visited Korea with your father before?

1838
01:12:08,721 --> 01:12:11,921
- Once when I was 18 months old.
- When you were 18 months old.

1839
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:13,490
So you cannot remember that,

1840
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:14,621
- right?
- I don't remember.

1841
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:16,630
Do you have a picture you took in Korea?

1842
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:17,961
I don't think so.

1843
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:19,631
Yes, I have it.

1844
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:22,300
- She has it.
- I have all the pictures.

1845
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:24,371
- That's really good.
- So many pictures.

1846
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:25,541
Do you want to see one?

1847
01:12:25,871 --> 01:12:27,601
- Please.
- Yes, please.

1848
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:29,070
- You have it now?
- When she was 18 months old.

1849
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:30,711
- On your phone?
- It's on my phone. Yes.

1850
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:34,411
There she is. She's just starting to walk.

1851
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:37,211
My goodness.

1852
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,580
Gosh, so adorable.

1853
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:42,551
How adorable. My goodness.

1854
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:45,161
I found it. It was 2014.

1855
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:46,491
It was 2014.

1856
01:12:46,691 --> 01:12:49,231
How cute. You're cute.

1857
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:52,430
- So...
- Edward. He's younger.

1858
01:12:52,431 --> 01:12:54,331
He was also younger ten years ago.

1859
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:56,701
Everyone looks a little different.

1860
01:12:57,531 --> 01:13:00,101
- Na Mi, you're much bigger.
- Na Mi.

1861
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:03,340
- How adorable. So cute.
- So cute.

1862
01:13:03,341 --> 01:13:04,611
What do you think...

1863
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:09,881
What's good if your father is a chef?

1864
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:16,051
I think... He makes really good food when he's at home.

1865
01:13:16,151 --> 01:13:19,091
That's so sweet. I'm jealous.

1866
01:13:19,961 --> 01:13:23,131
What do you think is the best dish he has made you?

1867
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,130
My favorite dish is probably his black bean noodles, jjajangmyeon.

1868
01:13:27,131 --> 01:13:29,471
- Black bean noodles.
- Black bean noodles.

1869
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:32,670
With beef or seafood?

1870
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,201
- Beef.
- Beef.

1871
01:13:34,301 --> 01:13:35,371
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

1872
01:13:36,141 --> 01:13:37,311
It must be great.

1873
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:39,840
- I'm hungry now.
- I know.

1874
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:42,481
(Eddie's jjajangmyeon they'd like to have one day)

1875
01:13:42,711 --> 01:13:43,711
All right.

1876
01:13:44,781 --> 01:13:46,021
- So...
- Let's see.

1877
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:47,681
- Onions.
- Okay.

1878
01:13:47,682 --> 01:13:49,051
- So...
- I'll wash them.

1879
01:13:49,151 --> 01:13:50,151
Okay.

1880
01:13:51,151 --> 01:13:52,161
Thank you.

1881
01:13:53,391 --> 01:13:55,530
(Yo Han is today's chief assistant.)

1882
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,391
Maybe you can start here.

1883
01:13:58,061 --> 01:14:00,231
- Basically, for everything, - Yes.

1884
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:01,931
I'm going to cut like this.

1885
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:05,030
- I get it.
- This big.

1886
01:14:05,031 --> 01:14:07,271
- Yes.
- Please chop carrots and onions.

1887
01:14:07,871 --> 01:14:09,370
All into the same-sized pieces, Kyun?

1888
01:14:09,371 --> 01:14:11,441
Yes. I think that works the best.

1889
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:14,181
(Thinking)

1890
01:14:15,981 --> 01:14:19,681
(Being careful even when choosing a pan)

1891
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:24,751
Perfect. I'm going to use that.

1892
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:28,960
(In Eddie's busy mind, )

1893
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:30,931
(he's picturing today's menus.)

1894
01:14:31,861 --> 01:14:36,231
(Which dish will Edward present today?)

1895
01:14:37,201 --> 01:14:38,800
During the Christmas time in America,

1896
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:42,240
we usually make something impressive.

1897
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:46,010
Something like whole turkey, whole duck,

1898
01:14:46,011 --> 01:14:47,211
or whole chicken.

1899
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:50,080
So we wanted to do that with chicken.

1900
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:53,351
Obviously, my daughter doesn't eat spicy food.

1901
01:14:53,681 --> 01:14:55,921
So I had to make two versions.

1902
01:14:57,351 --> 01:15:00,561
I decided to make one version that was spicy...

1903
01:15:00,661 --> 01:15:02,531
and one version that wasn't spicy.

1904
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:06,360
(Eddie's special chicken dish for Christmas)

1905
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:08,100
(Spicy chicken)

1906
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:10,171
(Non-spicy chicken)

1907
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:12,070
(And one more!)

1908
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:13,601
And then, for desserts,

1909
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:17,141
I was really inspired by Andong's strawberries.

1910
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:22,181
To me, it's probably the best strawberries I've ever had.

1911
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:24,311
My goodness.

1912
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:28,481
So, I wanted to do something with it. Something special.

1913
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:30,791
We're going to make strawberry hotteok.

1914
01:15:31,891 --> 01:15:34,391
(Andong's sweet strawberries transform into something new.)

1915
01:15:34,491 --> 01:15:36,560
(Adding sweetness to sweetness?)

1916
01:15:36,561 --> 01:15:38,701
(It's a flavor that hasn't existed before.)

1917
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:42,870
(When you take a big bite, )

1918
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,671
(it'll open anyone's eyes.)

1919
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:47,741
(I want to sell it.)

1920
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:51,171
(Breaking News: Eddie opens a hotteok shop in Insa-dong.)

1921
01:15:51,441 --> 01:15:52,780
(We'll show...)

1922
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,911
(Andong strawberry hotteok's special Eddie-tion)

1923
01:15:56,581 --> 01:15:58,050
(Christmas special Eddie-tion)

1924
01:15:58,051 --> 01:16:00,571
(Spicy and non-spicy chickens and snowflake strawberry hotteok)

1925
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:05,660
- I'm going to make quick hotteok.
- Hotteok.

1926
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:07,567
(Is he going to make the hotteok dough himself?)

1927
01:16:07,591 --> 01:16:08,591
Flour.

1928
01:16:09,561 --> 01:16:11,390
(Strawberry hotteok recipe 1:2 cups of flour)

1929
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,560
Rice flour.

1930
01:16:12,561 --> 01:16:13,900
(Two cups of rice flour)

1931
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:17,531
(Add 2 teaspoons of yeast.)

1932
01:16:18,471 --> 01:16:20,141
- It's the dough for hotteok.
- Yes.

1933
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:22,770
I'm just going to go slowly.

1934
01:16:22,771 --> 01:16:24,410
(Strawberry hotteok recipe 2: Add the water...)

1935
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:26,811
(with sugar and cooking oil to the mixture and knead.)

1936
01:16:27,481 --> 01:16:30,811
(Knead with your hand while adjusting the consistency.)

1937
01:16:31,881 --> 01:16:34,781
(Glutinous hotteok dough is ready.)

1938
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,591
What do we do after putting the plastic wrap?

1939
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:40,861
We place it in a warm place.

1940
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,430
- In an hour, - An hour.

1941
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:46,361
The dough will rise.

1942
01:16:46,861 --> 01:16:48,501
- Then it's ready.
- Will it rise?

1943
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:50,301
Then it becomes hotteok.

1944
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:54,101
Next mission.

1945
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:57,011
(Eddie casually grabs ginkgo nuts.)

1946
01:16:57,611 --> 01:17:01,541
(Actually, it's Eddie's first time to cook with ginkgo nuts.)

1947
01:17:02,011 --> 01:17:04,581
"Eunhaeng" is how you say ginkgo nuts in Korean.

1948
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:09,221
I wanted to use that as well and to give it...

1949
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:11,621
a very Korean feel to it.

1950
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,390
(However)

1951
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:17,030
How are we supposed to peel this?

1952
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:18,090
(The reality is different from the ideal.)

1953
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:20,501
- Usually, we eat the peel too.
- Really?

1954
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:22,901
Why is it so soft?

1955
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:24,601
(Tasting)

1956
01:17:25,201 --> 01:17:26,201
Is it all right?

1957
01:17:26,741 --> 01:17:28,871
It doesn't taste good.

1958
01:17:29,741 --> 01:17:32,411
It can't be good because we're supposed to fry it in oil.

1959
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:34,311
That's the original way.

1960
01:17:35,211 --> 01:17:36,211
Let's do that.

1961
01:17:36,212 --> 01:17:38,881
(If Yo Han says so, let's stir-fry them.)

1962
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,361
Gosh, it smells good. It's peeling a little bit too.

1963
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:48,191
- We can eat the peel now.
- Yes. Okay.

1964
01:17:49,061 --> 01:17:50,191
(Sniffing)

1965
01:17:50,861 --> 01:17:51,891
Now, let's taste it.

1966
01:17:52,331 --> 01:17:54,061
(Tasting it again)

1967
01:17:54,131 --> 01:17:55,600
- It's good.
- It's good, right?

1968
01:17:55,601 --> 01:17:56,601
Yes.

1969
01:17:57,901 --> 01:17:59,901
Yes. Good.

1970
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:04,111
(How will ginkgo nuts be used?)

1971
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:08,041
Next is chicken.

1972
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,511
We're going to find... Here we go.

1973
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:12,521
In here,

1974
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:15,520
- get the zest. Do you know how?
- Do I squeeze it?

1975
01:18:15,521 --> 01:18:17,521
Just like this.

1976
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:20,321
(Just grind the outer peel.)

1977
01:18:20,891 --> 01:18:22,960
(Lemon zest: Thinly ground outer yellow peel...)

1978
01:18:22,961 --> 01:18:25,230
(to be used as a spice.)

1979
01:18:25,231 --> 01:18:27,261
Be careful. Don't scrape your finger.

1980
01:18:27,631 --> 01:18:28,831
Yes. Okay.

1981
01:18:29,431 --> 01:18:31,231
(This is a piece of cake.)

1982
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:33,701
(Zesting)

1983
01:18:34,271 --> 01:18:35,771
Do I zest only one lemon?

1984
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:37,010
This is how I do it, right?

1985
01:18:37,011 --> 01:18:38,647
- Zest 2 lemons, please.
- Zest 2 lemons.

1986
01:18:38,671 --> 01:18:39,681
So, with this...

1987
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:42,881
(While Yo Han is zesting lemons, )

1988
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:46,581
(Eddie stir-fries the vegetables for stuffing and garnishing.)

1989
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:50,021
(Adding salt)

1990
01:18:50,121 --> 01:18:52,161
(Adding pepper)

1991
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,690
(When he stir-fries the vegetables again...)

1992
01:18:54,691 --> 01:18:56,651
(that are simply seasoned with salt and pepper, )

1993
01:18:58,161 --> 01:18:59,600
(the stir-fried vegetables with crunchy texture are ready.)

1994
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,661
Good. And then, now,

1995
01:19:03,431 --> 01:19:04,431
I'll mix them together.

1996
01:19:04,901 --> 01:19:06,541
(Adding Eddie's new friend, ginkgo nuts!)

1997
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:09,641
(He mixes them well with fabulous snaps.)

1998
01:19:10,471 --> 01:19:13,081
(Super fancy)

1999
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:14,481
(Amazed)

2000
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:22,421
(The ginkgo nuts and vegetables are ready.)

2001
01:19:24,951 --> 01:19:25,961
Let me see.

2002
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:28,591
But wait.

2003
01:19:28,961 --> 01:19:31,531
- You kept grinding... Goodness.
- This...

2004
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:34,661
(Eddie's legs buckled. What happened to the lemons?)

2005
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:36,201
What did you do?

2006
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,030
- It's...
- This is...

2007
01:19:38,031 --> 01:19:40,247
(The murder site of a lemon by Yo Han who doesn't know how to cook)

2008
01:19:40,271 --> 01:19:42,811
- Could you explain...
- Just the yellow part.

2009
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,910
- And so...
- Not the inner skin?

2010
01:19:44,911 --> 01:19:46,380
Grate it once.

2011
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:49,280
Keep changing the side after grating it once.

2012
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:51,380
You should have explained it to me.

2013
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:52,581
I thought you knew.

2014
01:19:52,651 --> 01:19:54,921
(Laughing)

2015
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:57,251
So only the outer peel, not the inner peel?

2016
01:19:58,451 --> 01:19:59,790
(Giggling)

2017
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,291
- Is it okay?
- It's okay.

2018
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,291
- Only the peel?
- Yes, only the peel.

2019
01:20:04,361 --> 01:20:05,531
This isn't easy.

2020
01:20:05,731 --> 01:20:06,901
That's why you're doing it.

2021
01:20:08,301 --> 01:20:09,431
Thank you.

2022
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:11,831
(He still works hard.)

2023
01:20:12,671 --> 01:20:15,070
He didn't explain...

2024
01:20:15,071 --> 01:20:16,841
how to zest a lemon.

2025
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:20,141
So I was a little confused.

2026
01:20:20,711 --> 01:20:21,841
Either way,

2027
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:23,880
I must obey the chef.

2028
01:20:23,881 --> 01:20:26,151
(In the kitchen, the chef's words are the law.)

2029
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:29,221
We're going to take the neck off of this.

2030
01:20:29,351 --> 01:20:30,390
Okay, are you ready?

2031
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:31,391
Goodness.

2032
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:32,491
(You startled me.)

2033
01:20:32,621 --> 01:20:34,261
(Rated R chicken video)

2034
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:36,091
(Trembling)

2035
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:38,561
(Making spicy and non-spicy chickens is in full swing.)

2036
01:20:39,761 --> 01:20:40,800
One.

2037
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,061
(One more thud)

2038
01:20:42,701 --> 01:20:43,830
(Looking like a real man)

2039
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:45,070
(Let's concentrate.)

2040
01:20:45,071 --> 01:20:48,841
Then we're going to stuff the inside with the vegetables.

2041
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:50,811
(He's putting the vegetables inside.)

2042
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:54,311
(Filling up the chicken with stir-fried vegetables)

2043
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:59,781
(Sealing it thoroughly with toothpicks)

2044
01:21:00,951 --> 01:21:02,150
(Angry forearm muscles)

2045
01:21:02,151 --> 01:21:03,921
Do it gently like this.

2046
01:21:04,091 --> 01:21:05,190
(He's moving quite skillfully.)

2047
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:06,220
That's good.

2048
01:21:06,221 --> 01:21:07,990
(He finishes making lemon zest quickly.)

2049
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:11,261
Then what I'm going to do is add some oil.

2050
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:13,401
Add oil.

2051
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:14,930
And salt.

2052
01:21:14,931 --> 01:21:16,447
(Add olive oil and salt to the lemon zest to make lemon oil.)

2053
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:19,301
Mix them with a spoon.

2054
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:21,400
Now, I'm going to show you a trick.

2055
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:22,810
That's fascinating.

2056
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:24,511
- This much?
- Yes, perfect.

2057
01:21:24,941 --> 01:21:25,941
Next...

2058
01:21:26,711 --> 01:21:28,341
Take this oil.

2059
01:21:28,511 --> 01:21:30,251
- Apply it?
- Apply it.

2060
01:21:30,481 --> 01:21:31,751
Apply it.

2061
01:21:32,451 --> 01:21:34,280
Inside and outside.

2062
01:21:34,281 --> 01:21:35,381
All over here.

2063
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,051
Massage it.

2064
01:21:37,821 --> 01:21:39,420
- Apply a lot on it?
- Yes.

2065
01:21:39,421 --> 01:21:41,781
(Apply lemon oil on the inside and outside of the chicken.)

2066
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:45,191
- I think the massage is done.
- Okay.

2067
01:21:45,561 --> 01:21:46,801
Beautiful.

2068
01:21:47,631 --> 01:21:50,031
Next is chicken.

2069
01:21:51,071 --> 01:21:53,700
Now, I'm going to add more olive oil.

2070
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:55,061
(For spicy and non-spicy chickens)

2071
01:21:55,741 --> 01:21:57,811
- Do you just pan-fry it?
- Yes.

2072
01:21:59,411 --> 01:22:00,481
So,

2073
01:22:01,241 --> 01:22:04,511
I'm going to start with the breasts down.

2074
01:22:05,081 --> 01:22:08,021
Are you saying on the side of the breasts?

2075
01:22:08,081 --> 01:22:12,291
(Grill the chicken breasts first.)

2076
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:13,521
Beautiful.

2077
01:22:14,121 --> 01:22:15,161
That's good.

2078
01:22:16,161 --> 01:22:19,661
When it turns brown, we'll flip it.

2079
01:22:19,931 --> 01:22:21,561
And little more...

2080
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:26,801
(Salt is a must.)

2081
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:30,411
(Chickens are getting cooked with a delicious sound.)

2082
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:32,911
(When Eddie does it, Yo Han follows.)

2083
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:36,511
(Even without speaking, they work perfectly as a team.)

2084
01:22:37,281 --> 01:22:38,551
I think it's ready.

2085
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:40,751
Oh, yes.

2086
01:22:41,421 --> 01:22:42,451
Perfect.

2087
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:44,391
How about this one?

2088
01:22:45,021 --> 01:22:46,190
Here.

2089
01:22:46,191 --> 01:22:50,231
(When the skin on the breast turns brown, flip it over.)

2090
01:22:50,361 --> 01:22:51,591
Oh, this.

2091
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:58,331
(Time to add stir-fried vegetables to the chicken!)

2092
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:03,071
You add them at the end and pan-fry them together?

2093
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:07,581
Then we have chicken broth.

2094
01:23:10,881 --> 01:23:13,220
(Add chicken, salt, stir-fried vegetables, and broth to the pan.)

2095
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:16,120
(Close the lid and cook for 30 minutes over low heat.)

2096
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:18,150
About 30 minutes?

2097
01:23:18,151 --> 01:23:19,461
- Thirty minutes?
- Yes.

2098
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,661
I'm going to put it very low.

2099
01:23:24,461 --> 01:23:26,601
Okay, let's get rid of all this.

2100
01:23:26,731 --> 01:23:29,001
Let's wipe the counter.

2101
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:30,771
We'll go and get ready.

2102
01:23:31,201 --> 01:23:33,671
(Meanwhile, what's going on in the room with ondol?)

2103
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:35,871
I want to have a baby earlier,

2104
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:38,270
but I'm not sure that I can marry...

2105
01:23:38,271 --> 01:23:39,981
or have a baby.

2106
01:23:40,681 --> 01:23:43,651
Yes, you have to find the right person first.

2107
01:23:43,711 --> 01:23:46,550
First of all, you want to have the right person.

2108
01:23:46,551 --> 01:23:48,581
Is there any tip to find...

2109
01:23:48,821 --> 01:23:50,621
- the right person?
- The right man.

2110
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:53,560
- Please.
- Yes.

2111
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:56,060
- You know what?
- Please let us know.

2112
01:23:56,061 --> 01:23:57,791
I just think...

2113
01:23:58,191 --> 01:24:01,661
Because we dated for so long. That was a good...

2114
01:24:01,761 --> 01:24:03,800
If you have time to do that,

2115
01:24:03,801 --> 01:24:05,870
that's a good thing to do.

2116
01:24:05,871 --> 01:24:09,371
It's like when you have that best friend.

2117
01:24:09,471 --> 01:24:11,911
Did you imagine before that you'd marry...

2118
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:14,310
a Korean guy?

2119
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:16,881
- That's a good question.
- That's a good question.

2120
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:18,511
No.

2121
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:22,451
I didn't set out to marry a Korean guy.

2122
01:24:22,651 --> 01:24:25,891
I traveled for maybe...

2123
01:24:26,591 --> 01:24:29,990
I don't know, ten solid years all over the world.

2124
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:31,991
- My gosh.
- And...

2125
01:24:32,131 --> 01:24:36,871
I decided that there were many interesting people.

2126
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:40,741
There was no reason to just look for an American guy.

2127
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:45,170
As soon as I got that idea in my head,

2128
01:24:45,171 --> 01:24:47,440
not too long after, I met Edward.

2129
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:48,580
(This drama is so fun.)

2130
01:24:48,581 --> 01:24:50,810
And I was like, "Okay."

2131
01:24:50,811 --> 01:24:53,420
This was the universe talking to me.

2132
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,350
Oh, it's so fateful.

2133
01:24:55,351 --> 01:24:57,621
- It really was.
- Nice.

2134
01:24:57,821 --> 01:24:59,290
- It really was.
- It's so romantic.

2135
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:01,190
Yes.

2136
01:25:01,191 --> 01:25:03,891
This guy is super special.

2137
01:25:04,861 --> 01:25:09,200
When I met him, I was very... I like to say smitten.

2138
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:11,870
Smitten? You fell in love at first sight?

2139
01:25:11,871 --> 01:25:13,871
Yes, I was like,

2140
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:18,441
"What? This is not like anybody I've ever met in my life."

2141
01:25:18,811 --> 01:25:20,740
He's a very special human being.

2142
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,861
(They were attracted to each other like it was fate.)

2143
01:25:22,911 --> 01:25:26,381
(They swore to stay with each other all their lives.)

2144
01:25:26,981 --> 01:25:30,191
And there she is, this beautiful, miracle child.

2145
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:32,711
- Every child is a miracle, right?
- A miracle child.

2146
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:37,431
So we were very lucky.

2147
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:42,031
(The three are a precious family and friends.)

2148
01:25:42,231 --> 01:25:43,431
(Jealous)

2149
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:45,500
(I'm so jealous.)

2150
01:25:45,501 --> 01:25:48,340
- Smart.
- You're younger than Edward?

2151
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:49,771
I'm older than Edward.

2152
01:25:49,971 --> 01:25:52,271
- Really?
- She's older than him.

2153
01:25:52,441 --> 01:25:53,510
Yes.

2154
01:25:53,511 --> 01:25:56,151
Do you think he's still a child?

2155
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:58,110
- Yes.
- Really?

2156
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,250
- He really is.
- Like every man.

2157
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:02,151
(Interested)

2158
01:26:02,591 --> 01:26:06,261
How is Edward usually in the house?

2159
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:08,190
(Thinking)

2160
01:26:08,191 --> 01:26:09,531
He's very bad.

2161
01:26:10,361 --> 01:26:12,130
He's very bad very often.

2162
01:26:12,131 --> 01:26:14,901
There's always something that he's up to.

2163
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:18,131
You have to stay on your toes.

2164
01:26:18,571 --> 01:26:19,670
(Suddenly, it changes from romance to a thriller.)

2165
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:20,970
How is he going to win?

2166
01:26:20,971 --> 01:26:24,670
Yes, he was probably reluctant.

2167
01:26:24,671 --> 01:26:26,511
We both were.

2168
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:28,180
We worked so much.

2169
01:26:28,181 --> 01:26:29,780
- I heard that...
- We actually worked very hard...

2170
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:31,680
- you were busy.
- on our careers.

2171
01:26:31,681 --> 01:26:33,281
(Extremely focused)

2172
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:37,091
(What will the world of an American, realistic couple be like?)

2173
01:26:37,408 --> 01:26:39,208
(Arden, Eddie was...)

2174
01:26:39,379 --> 01:26:40,439
(Dad was...)

2175
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,049
(Eddie's surprising charm told by his family?)

2176
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:44,759
(Did you fall in love with her?)

2177
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:46,379
(Should I tell them?)

2178
01:26:46,579 --> 01:26:47,649
Are you flustered?

2179
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:49,865
(The full version of Eddie's love story is coming soon.)

2180
01:26:49,889 --> 01:26:51,189
(And...)

2181
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,819
(Special Christmas Eddie-tion for the family is coming.)

2182
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:56,789
It's like Gangwon Province-style.

2183
01:26:57,289 --> 01:26:58,329
Goodness.

2184
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:00,799
(Yo Han is salivating.)

2185
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:06,339
(Dinner dishes that look insanely good)

2186
01:27:07,169 --> 01:27:08,169
(Humming)

2187
01:27:09,609 --> 01:27:11,739
(The special taste that will open their eyes wide)

2188
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:13,209
(I want to sell it.)

2189
01:27:13,579 --> 01:27:15,585
(The chef's Christmas Eddie-tion will be revealed.)

2190
01:27:15,609 --> 01:27:17,555
(The second Guest Greeting Project on Country Cook)

2191
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:20,419
(Grim Reaper-like old men from the head families arrive.)

2192
01:27:20,549 --> 01:27:24,049
(The extreme Confucianists come to get Eddie.)

2193
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:25,918
(This is quite important.)

2194
01:27:25,919 --> 01:27:27,259
(It will be difficult, )

2195
01:27:27,489 --> 01:27:28,689
(but I'll do it alone.)

2196
01:27:28,919 --> 01:27:30,329
(You'll treat the guests alone?)

2197
01:27:30,529 --> 01:27:31,829
(The chef is on his own.)

2198
01:27:32,259 --> 01:27:33,828
(Inspired by ingredients at the head family's dining table)

2199
01:27:33,829 --> 01:27:35,535
(For the elderly men who are hard to please, )

2200
01:27:35,559 --> 01:27:37,899
(he'll serve a special fine dining experience.)

2201
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:41,339
(An incredible appearance at the peak of delicacies)

2202
01:27:41,599 --> 01:27:43,969
(This looks like...)

2203
01:27:44,169 --> 01:27:45,609
(By the way, this is...)

2204
01:27:46,109 --> 01:27:48,585
(Will he captivate the palate of the elderly from the head families?)

2205
01:27:48,609 --> 01:27:50,509
(They're preparing to serve other guests.)

2206
01:27:50,749 --> 01:27:53,379
(We'll do it like "Culinary Class Wars.")

2207
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:55,800
(That's how the cooking war began. "Culinary Class Wars")

2208
01:27:55,989 --> 01:27:58,819
(Country members are making food for Eddie.)

2209
01:27:59,459 --> 01:28:01,379
(They become chefs instead of being assistants.)

2210
01:28:01,419 --> 01:28:04,059
(It's about time that we served him food.)

2211
01:28:07,229 --> 01:28:08,229
(Full of smiles)

2212
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:09,768
It tastes like...

2213
01:28:09,769 --> 01:28:11,498
(As soon as you eat it)

2214
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:13,168
(Eating)

2215
01:28:13,169 --> 01:28:14,499
(You're marveled by it.)

2216
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:17,109
(What kind of food will the Country members make?)

2217
