1
00:00:32,504 --> 00:00:35,244
(The second evening in Yeosu)

2
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,473
(Darkness has already fallen on the Country House.)

3
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:39,713
Since they're coming at 7:15pm, I should hurry up...

4
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:40,714
and help Chef cook.

5
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:42,913
Okay.

6
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:43,953
(There's no time to rest!)

7
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:45,483
- What is all of this?
- We're going to make...

8
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:47,154
a meat and seafood broth.

9
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:48,284
Innards.

10
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:49,754
Oh, we have innards too.

11
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:54,194
(The Country Family met Yeosu haenyeos in episode 8.)

12
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:58,014
(This is all money. How could we eat this ourselves?)

13
00:00:58,294 --> 00:01:01,055
(We pick them with our own hands, but we don't eat a single abalone.)

14
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,474
(The haenyeos couldn't eat the precious abalones easily.)

15
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:06,473
(So we prepared...)

16
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:09,874
(an abalone party for the haenyeos.)

17
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:12,313
(The Country Family's 3rd Guest Greeting Project)

18
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:14,144
(Please make something yummy.)

19
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:17,113
Abalone.

20
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:19,314
Are the abalones marinated?

21
00:01:19,654 --> 00:01:21,854
Let's... Can you find the white kimchi?

22
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:25,024
(Here is the white kimchi.)

23
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,123
Chef. Should I wash all of the spinach?

24
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:29,563
- Yes.
- Okay.

25
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:31,634
Are we using any other vegetables?

26
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,793
Chef, I'll give the blue crabs a quick rinse.

27
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:34,804
Okay.

28
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:37,434
(Washing the blue crabs)

29
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,833
(Organizing the vegetables)

30
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:42,514
(Each of the members are doing their part to prep the ingredients.)

31
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:44,774
Should I...

32
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:47,444
Later when people... Hey, you should do this.

33
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:49,084
Should I chop the onions?

34
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:50,953
- Do we have another cutting board?
- A cutting board?

35
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:52,313
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

36
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,184
Give it to me. I need to chop these.

37
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:55,853
(Jung Nam finally has a task thanks to Yo Han.)

38
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:57,153
You don't have enough space, right?

39
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:59,424
- How should I chop these?
- Hold on.

40
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:00,594
Do you want to do it?

41
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:02,693
- No, you should do it.
- Have you done this before?

42
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:04,164
I have many times.

43
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:07,564
(Very careful)

44
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:10,164
Oh, this is really hard.

45
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:12,734
(What are they cooking today?)

46
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,404
Kyun, what are you going to cook for them today?

47
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:17,243
I want to make abalone porridge.

48
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:18,443
- Abalone porridge.
- Yes.

49
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:20,374
(Abalone porridge?)

50
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,243
At first, I thought, "Abalone porridge?"

51
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,583
I was a bit surprised.

52
00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:25,013
Because I thought abalone porridge...

53
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:28,854
wasn't really an interesting fusion dish.

54
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:30,354
I was a bit disappointed.

55
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:34,164
I thought he would serve them something a bit more fancy.

56
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:37,564
Something fancy using abalone.

57
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:41,863
I wanted to make something simple...

58
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:43,404
to highlight the seafood,

59
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:45,504
but also something unique.

60
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,214
(Porridge is the most common dish that is associated with abalone.)

61
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:52,374
(Can he turn normal abalone porridge into something special?)

62
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:55,183
Okay.

63
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:56,720
(Eddie is preparing the broth, the main part of porridge.)

64
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,704
- It should be in there.
- In the biggest drawer.

65
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,823
- Crab, vegetables.
- It's different.

66
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:06,224
He's making a broth with crabs and vegetables.

67
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:11,034
(Adding the whole abalones, including the innards.)

68
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:12,764
(Chopping)

69
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,304
(Chef Eddie's skilled knife skills)

70
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,104
(This is a true master.)

71
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,874
(Look at this amazing broth.)

72
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:22,073
Yes, I kind of used... For this dish,

73
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:24,414
it was really important to make the fish stock.

74
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,824
Because that's where all of the flavors come from. The rice...

75
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,383
(Looking around)

76
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:32,884
Is there a large pan?

77
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,923
- A large pan...
- Let's see.

78
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,083
- Yes, perfect. Just put it there.
- I found one.

79
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,970
(What is the next step for Eddie's abalone porridge?)

80
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:40,553
Yes, turn it up high.

81
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,593
(Cooking the mussels that will go into the porridge)

82
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:42,594
A little bit.

83
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:43,994
Yes.

84
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:45,563
(And today's main ingredient)

85
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:47,904
(Slicing the abalone)

86
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:50,634
I know that, for me,

87
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,104
abalone is so special.

88
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,174
- Oh, abalone?
- Yes.

89
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:58,244
And we got these when they were alive.

90
00:03:58,574 --> 00:03:59,614
You're right.

91
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:02,814
This is going to be hard. Let me know if you can do this.

92
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:06,814
- Thinly? Super thinly?
- Really super thin.

93
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:11,224
- Do you want to try that?
- Sure.

94
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:13,694
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay.

95
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:15,593
(Slicing)

96
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:18,664
(Slicing it as thinly as possible as Eddie advised)

97
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:23,464
Chef, you're going to add these raw thin slices on top...

98
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,673
so only the outside gets slightly cooked by the heat, right?

99
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,504
- Yes, just put them on top.
- Okay.

100
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:30,004
The reason she keeps asking questions...

101
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:32,313
is to remember the recipe for later.

102
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,413
She wants to make it later.

103
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:35,143
I'm going to make this...

104
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,344
for people when I get back to Seoul.

105
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:42,624
(Slicing away with the desire to get the recipe)

106
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,423
Oh, my gosh. Professional.

107
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:47,053
Take me to Washington.

108
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,494
(Laughing)

109
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:52,434
(The precious abalones from the haenyeos are ready to go.)

110
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:56,564
We have really great teamwork after working together many times.

111
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:58,974
We feel like a team, Chef.

112
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:01,744
- Nice.
- I've never done this before.

113
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,243
Seriously. It's my first time.

114
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:05,374
You're doing great.

115
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:07,014
It's my first time.

116
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,414
Mr. Lee.

117
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:11,313
- Mr. Lee. Please take a look.
- Yes.

118
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:12,813
- Yes, perfect.
- More?

119
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,084
- Perfect?
- Yes.

120
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:16,254
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

121
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:18,693
(Feeling great)

122
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,974
(Do I have a knack for cooking?)

123
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:22,794
Hey, he told me it was perfect.

124
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:24,163
(Praise me, please.)

125
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:25,494
He is nice about most things.

126
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:27,263
He even says perfect?

127
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,763
- You need to chop green onions too.
- Okay, I'll chop them.

128
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:31,333
Okay.

129
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,050
(Eddie's praise makes Jung Nam happily chop green onions.)

130
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:35,004
- Yes.
- How many green onions?

131
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:36,703
Like half of that.

132
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,174
Half?

133
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:40,274
And this too. Don't forget this one.

134
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:41,744
Okay.

135
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:44,084
- What long? Like 1cm?
- Yes.

136
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:46,584
- Very small.
- Very small? Okay.

137
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:48,784
Very small. Okay.

138
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:53,354
(I am Passionate Jung Nam.)

139
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,564
(Hard-working student Jung Nam)

140
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,534
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes.

141
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,934
- Oh, that's nice.
- Oh, that's nice.

142
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:02,903
- He only responds to you, Kyun.
- Good.

143
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,533
You're really good at chopping.

144
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:06,273
- First time. I'll do it.
- Okay.

145
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:07,404
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

146
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:10,473
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

147
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:11,714
- Thanks to...
- Right.

148
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:15,043
(The mussels already look tasty.)

149
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:16,384
(I’m all done!)

150
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,883
Oh, okay. Look at this.

151
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:21,923
(Showing off the well-cooked mussels)

152
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,584
That's valuable water.

153
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:27,154
Oh, he's using all of that to make the broth.

154
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:29,263
(This broth for abalone porridge...)

155
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,164
(has the deep flavors of the Yeosu ocean.)

156
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:32,693
And then, this one...

157
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:33,694
(What about the rest of the mussels?)

158
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,033
Oh, that smells nice. The mussels smell great.

159
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,714
(He'll use the mussels without the shell!)

160
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:39,603
(The two of us will do the rest.)

161
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:42,204
(Jung Nam is chopping peppers. Yo Han is removing mussel shells.)

162
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:45,144
(Extremely focused)

163
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,144
(There's a mountain of mussels.)

164
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,184
You're good.

165
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:49,384
See? Perfect.

166
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:51,213
This is so hot.

167
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:52,954
I feel like my fingerprints will be erased.

168
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:55,484
What will we do with this now?

169
00:06:55,654 --> 00:06:57,254
I'm going to put it in the porridge.

170
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,793
- Oh, in the porridge.
- Everything goes in the porridge.

171
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,224
- Yes.
- After boiling them.

172
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,193
(He'll add a chewy texture...)

173
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:04,963
(with the in-season mussels.)

174
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:05,964
That's good, right?

175
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,193
(Shall we prepare other ingredients that will go in the porridge?)

176
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,064
How much white kimchi should I chop?

177
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:11,474
Just do this. Like...

178
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,304
Okay.

179
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:15,444
(Order received.)

180
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:19,714
(Time to prepare the other ingredients)

181
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,443
(Si A is chopping the white kimchi as Eddie told her to.)

182
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,253
Like this, Chef? Is this enough kimchi?

183
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:26,954
- Perfect.
- Okay.

184
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,683
(The next ingredient is pollack roe.)

185
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,353
- Maybe bigger.
- Oh, bigger?

186
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:32,854
- Yes, nice and big.
- Okay.

187
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,694
(Chopping pollack roe that will add a salty taste)

188
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,033
Perfect.

189
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:41,034
(Praising herself)

190
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:42,803
(It's time for me to step in.)

191
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:44,950
(Eddie will personally prepare the rest of the ingredients.)

192
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,034
(Sesame oil)

193
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:47,944
(Chopped onions)

194
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:49,904
(Mushrooms)

195
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:51,374
(Minced garlic)

196
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:52,674
(Zucchini)

197
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,314
(Salt)

198
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:57,043
(Become tasty!)

199
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,454
(Sauteing the ingredients until they're nice and golden)

200
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:03,924
(Setting the cooked vegetables aside)

201
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:07,394
(The sauteed vegetables for the porridge are ready.)

202
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:13,464
(They already prepared 12 different ingredients!)

203
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,864
It's fancy, so I'm going to use... Look at what I made.

204
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:18,250
(What is the secret ingredient in Eddie's abalone porridge?)

205
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,373
- Nurungji.
- Oh, nurungji.

206
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,403
Nurungji!

207
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:22,243
- Oh, that must be delicious.
- Nurungji instead of rice.

208
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:24,773
- Oh, nurungji abalone porridge.
- Nurungji abalone porridge.

209
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:25,814
Oh, my.

210
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:29,684
(Nurungji porridge made with crab and seafood broth)

211
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:32,883
I wanted to make it with nurungji to give it that extra...

212
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:35,424
roasted flavor to it.

213
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:37,153
When you can layer flavors...

214
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:39,093
and use lots of fresh seafood,

215
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:43,564
it gives you a really powerful, layered foundation.

216
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:47,333
(Nurungji abalone porridge with Eddie's special kick)

217
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,603
I really shouldn't have doubted him.

218
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:51,203
I should just do as he says...

219
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:53,833
and eat what he gives me. I went with that attitude.

220
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:54,844
(Eyes of trust and faith)

221
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:56,604
How many nurungji?

222
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,613
Oh, everything.

223
00:08:58,614 --> 00:08:59,913
- Everything?
- All of it?

224
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,283
- Let's add everything.
- Okay.

225
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:02,683
I love it.

226
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:04,013
(Breaking the crunchy nurungji into bite-sized pieces)

227
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:05,213
About this big?

228
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,513
- This should be good.
- Really?

229
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:07,514
(A mountain of nurungji in the pot)

230
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:08,524
Okay.

231
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:10,254
Oh, my.

232
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:13,154
(Pouring the seafood broth on top of the nurungji!)

233
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:17,494
The rice has a roasted flavor, but it's pretty bland.

234
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:19,463
So it's really important to make a good stock...

235
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:23,304
and to use that as your flavoring foundation.

236
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:29,203
- Use this spoon for this.
- Okay.

237
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:31,174
- So they don't get mixed? Okay.
- Yes.

238
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:33,443
- I think the ladies will like this.
- Yes.

239
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:34,643
(A familiar but special flavor for the haenyeo ladies!)

240
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:35,844
That looks so nice.

241
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:37,213
Is this barley tea?

242
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:38,554
- Yes, barley tea.
- Awesome.

243
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:42,824
(A barley tea bag!)

244
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:47,293
When I think of nurungji, I think of barley tea.

245
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,294
I see.

246
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:51,493
Whenever I think of porridge, I think of barley tea.

247
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:52,863
Because in the old days,

248
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:55,904
she used to mix it with barley tea to soften the porridge.

249
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,104
(Adding his grandma's secret into the nurungji)

250
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:03,774
(Yo Han and Jung Nam are setting the table in the living room.)

251
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,243
- Okay.
- You can't set it like that.

252
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:08,164
You can't set it like that. Make it look pretty.

253
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:09,514
- Okay.
- Okay?

254
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,153
- Like this?
- Make it pretty.

255
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,554
Put the spoon on the right.

256
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:16,383
We need to make them feel really special.

257
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:17,384
- Like this?
- Okay.

258
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:19,493
- We have to knock.
- We have to knock here?

259
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,994
Yes, we have to knock.

260
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:22,664
- Let's see.
- Knock, knock.

261
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:24,224
(Knock, knock)

262
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:25,964
Can we come in?

263
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,433
Why aren't they answering?

264
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:30,464
(Peeking in)

265
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:32,804
(Knock, knock)

266
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:34,843
- They're here. Let's go.
- Oh, they're here.

267
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:35,844
They're here?

268
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:37,813
- Hello.
- Hello.

269
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:39,073
- Hello!
- Hello.

270
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:40,074
Hello.

271
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,113
- Hello.
- This is so nice.

272
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:42,183
- He's on TV.
- Hello.

273
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,284
- You're right.
- Yes.

274
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:45,083
- Oh, we haven't met yet.
- Hello.

275
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:46,753
I was here because I just got here today.

276
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:47,784
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

277
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:50,053
- Hi!
- Hi!

278
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:51,423
- Oh, my. Who is this?
- Hello.

279
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,124
You act and cook?

280
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,324
Of course. Oh, I missed you!

281
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:59,464
(We should finish up quickly.)

282
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,333
We're meeting for the first time, I think.

283
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,463
Because I wasn't on the boat.

284
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:03,533
We didn't meet you two.

285
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:04,703
- You're right.
- Yes.

286
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:06,533
I'm Shin Si A.

287
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:07,733
- Hello.
- Hello.

288
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,803
Nice to meet you.

289
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:11,113
- I'm Bae Jung Nam.
- I've seen you on TV.

290
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:12,514
- I saw you a lot on TV.
- Yes.

291
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,643
- You have a dog.
- Yes, I do.

292
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:16,204
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your help.

293
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:17,853
I should drink some water.

294
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:19,614
Yes, please have some water.

295
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:21,754
(In the kitchen, they're finishing up the dishes.)

296
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:23,924
- No seafood in here?
- No seafood.

297
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:25,624
- In?
- Yes.

298
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,624
Do this one. I'll take care of this one.

299
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:33,994
(Savory vegetables sauteed with sesame oil)

300
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,533
(Pepper)

301
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:37,903
(Spinach)

302
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:39,274
(And mussels!)

303
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:44,474
(Mixing them all together)

304
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:48,184
- Ready?
- Yes.

305
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,053
(This will be plenty for everyone!)

306
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:56,124
I think you've started making big portions after coming here.

307
00:11:57,054 --> 00:11:58,224
He really has.

308
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:00,854
(This isn't it!)

309
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:04,294
(Eddie flattens the porridge in the plate.)

310
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:07,133
Okay.

311
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:10,104
(That was to add the toppings!)

312
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:13,104
- Oh, that's how he's using that.
- The white kimchi.

313
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,904
He places them on it.

314
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,143
(Adding a generous amount of abalone!)

315
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,174
Oh, my.

316
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:21,914
(Add pollack roe and scallions, and it's done!)

317
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:29,284
It's a very rich and heavy rice on the bottom...

318
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:31,623
and lighter seafood on top.

319
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:34,194
That contrast in flavors and textures...

320
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,094
will hopefully work nicely.

321
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:39,793
That's so pretty.

322
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,874
(Full of the Yeosu ocean, Nurungji Abalone Porridge)

323
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,674
(And the side dishes made by the haenyeos)

324
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:46,773
(A heartwarming meal made with admiration and gratitude)

325
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,304
Okay, the meal is ready.

326
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,443
It's here.

327
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,143
- It's here.
- Oh, my.

328
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,213
What is this?

329
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:55,113
- What is this?
- What is this?

330
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:56,713
- What did you put in this?
- Chef will come...

331
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:58,413
- and explain it to you.
- Oh, okay.

332
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:00,253
- Hello.
- Hello.

333
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:01,883
- Hello.
- Welcome.

334
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:03,284
Thank you for all of this.

335
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:05,054
What is the name of this dish?

336
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:06,854
I really appreciated you all...

337
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:11,563
for catching abalones for us today…

338
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:14,434
and for showing us a good time.

339
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:16,334
So I prepared nurungji abalone porridge.

340
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:17,634
Please enjoy.

341
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:18,833
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

342
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,533
Thank you for this, Chef Lee.

343
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:21,743
- Can we eat this?
- Thank you.

344
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:23,103
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

345
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:24,403
- Oh, scoop it like this?
- Yes.

346
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,843
Let's serve it up for them.

347
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:27,143
I can just use my spoon.

348
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:28,513
Okay, that also works too.

349
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:30,714
This porridge must be easy on the stomach.

350
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:34,844
(Eddie's special abalone porridge with lots of nice ingredients)

351
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,623
- Why?
- This must be tasty.

352
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:38,024
It's nice and salty.

353
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:39,693
(Shall I have a bite?)

354
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,124
There's spinach.

355
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:42,924
There's mushroom too.

356
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,363
(Taking a big spoonful...)

357
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:47,464
(with all of the toppings too)

358
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:49,604
Let's see how this tastes.

359
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,064
The seafood broth.

360
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,134
It's so tasty.

361
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,774
It must be so good.

362
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:55,504
This looks delicious.

363
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:57,543
Have some too, Chef.

364
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:59,013
- I will.
- The pollack roe too.

365
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,520
- The pollack roe.
- Oh, the pollack roe.

366
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:02,424
- Oh, this is delicious!
- There's spinach too.

367
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:03,583
- This is good.
- Right?

368
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:04,613
There's mushroom too.

369
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:05,713
This is delicious, Chef.

370
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:06,783
- You like it?
- I do.

371
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,383
(You like it?)

372
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:09,624
This is delicious.

373
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:12,154
(Oh, I'm relieved.)

374
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,653
We need to eat a lot so we don't have any regrets.

375
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:14,663
Of course.

376
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,464
I won't forget this.

377
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,863
We have too much of this.

378
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:20,034
You have to eat it all, okay?

379
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,734
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my.

380
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,734
- It's nice and spicy.
- It's delicious, Chef.

381
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:27,604
It's really delicious.

382
00:14:28,374 --> 00:14:31,274
Once in a while, I taste this spicy pepper.

383
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:32,943
- It's nice and spicy.
- Right? Isn't it nice?

384
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:33,944
It's delicious.

385
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,144
I chopped those peppers.

386
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:36,984
You did a good job.

387
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,453
(Our haenyeo ladies eat away without a word.)

388
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:39,813
The town is very pretty.

389
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:41,230
(The abalone I caught is very delicious.)

390
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,824
I'm growing attached.

391
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:45,094
(They're all eating so well.)

392
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:46,424
Let's see.

393
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,023
(Jung Nam, who worked hard, tries the abalone porridge too.)

394
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:49,024
(Oh, my!)

395
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:51,094
Once in a while, I taste this spicy pepper.

396
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:53,393
This is nice.

397
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:54,533
(Eddie's cooking always exceeds everyone's expectations.)

398
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:55,534
(Oh, my!)

399
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:57,433
- The texture...
- This is delicious.

400
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:58,733
The texture is so nice.

401
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:00,803
This is really great.

402
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:01,804
All of these ingredients...

403
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:03,485
- came straight from the ocean.
- Exactly.

404
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:06,244
That is so nice. This is such a precious meal.

405
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:07,974
Thank you all.

406
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:10,583
(The haenyeo ladies, the Country Family, and Jung Nam...)

407
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,553
(all fell in love with this nurungji abalone porridge.)

408
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:16,324
There were these layers of deep flavor.

409
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:19,793
We used a broth made with blue crabs.

410
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:23,024
And we added a creamy sauce.

411
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:27,194
And lastly, the clean flavor from the peppers.

412
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:31,804
It tastes like fine dining.

413
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:35,644
As soon as it entered my body, it warmed me up.

414
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,814
It tasted healthy. Like a restorative meal.

415
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:40,574
It was beautiful.

416
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:44,953
He said he felt really bad when he saw...

417
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:46,613
the haenyeo ladies working in the cold.

418
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:51,354
I think he wanted to warm up...

419
00:15:51,454 --> 00:15:54,654
their tired and cold bodies.

420
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:57,394
Porridge is the best thing for that.

421
00:15:58,964 --> 00:16:00,633
(Highly satisfied)

422
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:01,663
- The texture...
- This is delicious.

423
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:03,164
The texture is so nice.

424
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,524
This will really give me strength.

425
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:09,104
(Strength)

426
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,174
No, not this.

427
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:13,073
Wait, hold on.

428
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:14,113
Is it okay?

429
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:15,114
- Yes.
- It's okay.

430
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:16,114
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

431
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,114
- Really?
- It's the best.

432
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,284
- Yes.
- Really.

433
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:19,854
It's really delicious.

434
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,254
When else could we eat food like this?

435
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:25,293
Oh, we've really made it.

436
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:27,424
We could never cook like this at home.

437
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,794
- Thank you.
- He doesn't understand.

438
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:33,094
He does. He can understand.

439
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:35,564
(Laughing)

440
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,063
I understand.

441
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,774
- He said he understood.
- I see.

442
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:41,880
He has a harder time understanding what I'm saying.

443
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:44,224
- He can understand you.
- The Gyeongsang Province accent.

444
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:45,544
Oh, this is delicious!

445
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,413
(Thank you, ladies.)

446
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:49,444
This is great.

447
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,814
You catch abalone every day.

448
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:55,454
How long has it been since you last ate one?

449
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:58,124
Us? More than a year, probably.

450
00:16:58,324 --> 00:16:59,324
Really?

451
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:00,853
It's been more than a year since you've eaten abalone?

452
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,293
- They have to sell them.
- We have to sell them,

453
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:03,663
- so we don't ever eat them.
- We can't.

454
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:05,263
- We can't at all.
- We don't even think about it.

455
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:07,093
It's hard this time of year.

456
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,633
- Even if we catch a lot, - We can't.

457
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,204
There's the shipowner,

458
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:13,174
so if we want to eat some, we need to purchase it.

459
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:15,843
I thought you could eat abalone every day...

460
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:17,103
since you caught them.

461
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,373
If we eat everything we catch,

462
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:19,544
what about the shipowners?

463
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,413
We can't eat any.

464
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,543
(Abalone is a precious food even for haenyeos.)

465
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:24,243
I should eat more.

466
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,413
This is too much.

467
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:27,514
You have to eat everything, okay?

468
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:29,354
I have to go this way.

469
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:31,724
- Have some.
- You have to go to work?

470
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:34,524
- No, I'm going to eat from here.
- She's going to eat from here.

471
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:37,163
- Oh, I was so surprised.
- From the bowl with more food.

472
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:39,244
(These ladies are so funny and have good appetites.)

473
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:41,264
- Next time, - Yes.

474
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,663
- let's do it together.
- Okay.

475
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:45,973
And afterward, let's cook together.

476
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,003
- Cook together.
- Yes.

477
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,543
- When it's warm.
- Yes.

478
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:52,073
He said he tried it before,

479
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:53,843
and he was able to dive for exactly ten seconds.

480
00:17:53,844 --> 00:17:55,613
(He was able to dive for exactly ten seconds.)

481
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:57,814
Oh, diving?

482
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:00,284
(That was a secret.)

483
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:03,953
Usually, I'd feel too full when getting to bed,

484
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:06,053
- but this is easy on my stomach.
- You're right.

485
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:07,454
With the spinach and all.

486
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,593
I'm sure your stomach will feel good.

487
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,954
(Eddie chose what to cook based on their age and schedule.)

488
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:16,104
I'm glad you could eat...

489
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,133
- a healthy meal.
- Thank you.

490
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:19,403
Because we ate this, we'll be healthy...

491
00:18:19,404 --> 00:18:20,974
and never get sick starting tomorrow.

492
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:28,783
I just hope I can be this active...

493
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:30,744
and still working at their age.

494
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:34,253
So hopefully, I can make something...

495
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:36,983
that is familiar to them but also unique.

496
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:40,193
They seemed to like it. They were eating more bowls of it.

497
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:43,294
That's always a good sign if they keep eating more.

498
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:45,693
I felt happy...

499
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:48,263
because they were enjoying themselves, talking,

500
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:50,664
smiling, and enjoying good food.

501
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,174
Thank you for the great meal.

502
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,303
- That was delicious.
- Thank you.

503
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:55,744
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

504
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:57,203
- Please be happy.
- Thank you.

505
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,204
- Be healthy.
- I wish you lots of wealth.

506
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,243
- Lots of wealth.
- Thank you.

507
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:01,173
I wish you lots of wealth, our actors.

508
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,283
Oh, thank you so much.

509
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:03,483
I don't need to be rich.

510
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:04,883
Why? You should be rich too.

511
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:06,014
Please be healthy.

512
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:08,284
- I'm going to miss you.
- Me too.

513
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:10,423
Goodbye.

514
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:12,693
- Goodbye.
- I was so happy to meet you.

515
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:13,824
Goodbye.

516
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:15,293
Goodbye.

517
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:17,193
Wait. Please tell me your address.

518
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,194
Oh, gosh.

519
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:20,934
- It's okay.
- I know of something very tasty.

520
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,433
You don't need to send chocolate.

521
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:24,133
No, I really want to.

522
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,303
It's okay.

523
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:27,203
I'll send you a year-end gift too.

524
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:28,604
Yeosu-si, Gubong-gil.

525
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,203
Yeosu-si,

526
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:31,250
- Gubong-gil.
- Gubong-gil.

527
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:33,144
(She got her haenyeo friend's address!)

528
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:35,343
(A Sung sent her lots of snacks after the shoot.)

529
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:36,614
Thank you.

530
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:40,653
- Thank you so much.
- I'll come out in my socks.

531
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:42,883
You don't need to come out.

532
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:43,923
In your socks.

533
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:44,924
- It's okay.
- Get home safely.

534
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:45,993
Please be healthy.

535
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:47,023
You have to come back.

536
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:48,793
- Okay.
- Let's meet again.

537
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:50,493
It was such a happy day.

538
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:52,193
- Bye!
- Bye.

539
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:55,033
- I love you all too.
- Bye!

540
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:56,433
Bye, my sisters!

541
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:58,773
- Thank you.
- Get back safely, my brother.

542
00:19:58,774 --> 00:19:59,834
Bye.

543
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,703
- Be happy, my sisters.
- Okay.

544
00:20:01,704 --> 00:20:02,774
(Funny ladies)

545
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,904
- Get back safely.
- Okay.

546
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,844
Oh, that was nice. Thank you for the meal.

547
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,313
- That feels so nice.
- That really warmed my heart.

548
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:10,843
I was going to say that.

549
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,414
That feels so nice.

550
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:14,114
It's cold. Let's hurry inside.

551
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:16,753
Today was great too.

552
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:18,453
For just 25 minutes,

553
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:19,494
that was great.

554
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:22,264
(The final ingredient)

555
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:24,564
(Leaf mustard)

556
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:27,834
(Yeosu leaf mustard)

557
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:32,674
(What last dish will they cook with leaf mustard?)

558
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:35,474
(Oh, my leaf mustard.)

559
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:38,074
(A full range of leaf mustard dishes)

560
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:41,314
(The best pairing with rice is here.)

561
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:44,844
(The Country Family really ate away in Yeosu.)

562
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:48,254
(Are you curious about the charms of leaf mustard?)

563
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:51,183
(After the fun dinner with the haenyeos)

564
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,293
Yo Han. Let's sit by the fire outside...

565
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,923
- and have a drink.
- Okay.

566
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:56,593
Let's have a beer and make a fire.

567
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:57,624
I'll do it.

568
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:00,763
(The Country Family and Jung Nam didn't want to waste this night.)

569
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:01,904
I'm so excited.

570
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:03,604
Let's just sit by the fire a bit.

571
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,774
(They'll have some drinks in the yard tonight.)

572
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:08,004
Oh, this is nice.

573
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:11,004
(Where are Eddie and A Sung?)

574
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:14,444
(We'll head to bed first.)

575
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,514
(Today, the three of them will enjoy a quiet time by the fire.)

576
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:21,754
You're good at that, Yo Han.

577
00:21:22,554 --> 00:21:23,554
(He's an experienced fire starter. Refer to episode 2 in Jeongseon.)

578
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:25,723
- Do you not need paper?
- I need paper.

579
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:27,594
- What? You need paper?
- Paper?

580
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,763
(With a few skillful movements by Yo Han, )

581
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:34,333
(the firewood starts burning in the flames.)

582
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,703
Should I bring some beer?

583
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,364
- There's some beer there.
- I see.

584
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:39,204
Oh, this is nice.

585
00:21:40,074 --> 00:21:41,104
Yo Han.

586
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:43,073
- Yo Han.
- Yes, Jung Nam?

587
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:44,203
This is nice.

588
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:45,914
Have a beer.

589
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,543
- Cheers.
- This is nice.

590
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,090
(A cold can of beer to complete their romantic trip)

591
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:53,214
There are so many stars in the sky.

592
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,053
(Enjoying time by the fire in Yeosu under the sky full of stars)

593
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:58,224
We can see the stars so well because the air is clean.

594
00:21:58,454 --> 00:21:59,854
Those are all stars.

595
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:03,564
That's so pretty.

596
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,334
Oh, this is nice.

597
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:07,934
You should pop your collar.

598
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:09,704
- What?
- Your neck must be cold.

599
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,873
- Your neck.
- I'll do it on my own.

600
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,873
- It's folded down.
- I can take care of my neck.

601
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,933
(Sweet Jung Nam doesn't want Yo Han to be cold.)

602
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,373
This is brotherly love.

603
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:17,703
(Hey, this is true brotherly love!)

604
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,674
Do you two meet up often?

605
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:22,114
- No, we don't.
- We don't.

606
00:22:22,484 --> 00:22:25,043
We have a very formal relationship.

607
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,814
But if you ever meet up...

608
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:29,324
We eat food and have a drink.

609
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:30,554
Nothing much.

610
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:31,584
Have you been well?

611
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:33,923
- I was so surprised.
- Right.

612
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:34,954
(Great teamwork)

613
00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:36,923
How did you two become close?

614
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:39,364
Oh, you became close after "Mr. Sunshine," right?

615
00:22:39,494 --> 00:22:41,564
That was 2017, right, Yo Han?

616
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,703
Yes, 2017.

617
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:44,363
So 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,

618
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,473
- and...
- Around 2016 or 2017.

619
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:46,474
- Seven years?
- It's been eight years.

620
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:47,980
You've known each other for eight years.

621
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:50,374
Actually, back...

622
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,344
in Cyworld days,

623
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:54,813
I really liked Jung Nam's fashion.

624
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:56,484
Oh, stop it.

625
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,884
(He's actually happy.)

626
00:22:58,984 --> 00:22:59,984
(Jung Nam's heyday)

627
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:02,684
I really liked Jung Nam.

628
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,123
When I was young.

629
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:06,530
(Yo Han was Jung Nam's fan even before they met for the drama.)

630
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:08,453
We met for "Mr. Sunshine."

631
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,623
I'm the type...

632
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,934
to be very serious on set.

633
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:16,364
But I had so many retakes because I kept laughing.

634
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:18,333
I really said I couldn't act.

635
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:20,133
So we were shooting a scene together,

636
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:22,403
and he kept bursting into laughter whenever he saw me.

637
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:23,543
I was being serious.

638
00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:25,773
I needed so many retakes. Probably like 40.

639
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:27,173
- You? Then?
- Yes.

640
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,273
Other people said he wasn't funny,

641
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,214
but I found him insanely funny.

642
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:32,214
I'm seriously not lying.

643
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:35,554
I actually wanted him to be gone.

644
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:38,694
I actually wanted him to be gone.

645
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:40,993
- Why did you find him so funny?
- I was nervous.

646
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:43,364
Well... You know...

647
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:45,464
There were some random things. For example,

648
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:49,564
a bomb had just gone off near him.

649
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:51,303
It's already funny.

650
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,904
He should look really messed up.

651
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:57,004
But he left this one strand of pride.

652
00:23:58,474 --> 00:23:59,744
Oh, there's a picture of that.

653
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:04,284
"Oh, he's ruining my career."

654
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:05,954
"It's over now."

655
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:07,653
(Here is the problematic bomb scene.)

656
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,924
(Getting into it)

657
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:10,984
(Twirling his hair)

658
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:14,294
(I shouldn't laugh.)

659
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:16,023
You were doing fine.

660
00:24:16,024 --> 00:24:17,593
I was against it.

661
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:19,064
(His dangling pride)

662
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,094
(I should just close my eyes.)

663
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:23,333
(The king of fashion wanted to protect his pride.)

664
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,903
He kept filming the scene with that strand of pride.

665
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:27,904
I thought, "Oh, Jung Nam."

666
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:31,403
Either I had to leave the show, or he had to.

667
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,444
Time really flies.

668
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:34,873
Time goes by so fast.

669
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,713
We've always stayed in touch.

670
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:37,784
That's so cool.

671
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:42,023
(They met through the drama.)

672
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:45,324
(And now they're best friends.)

673
00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:48,893
Out of all of the younger friends I met while working,

674
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:51,693
I'm closest to Yo Han.

675
00:24:51,694 --> 00:24:53,364
- I see.
- You know, with work...

676
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:55,934
You know, on set...

677
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,804
Even after many movies, dramas, and variety shows,

678
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:01,273
you only stay in touch with very few people.

679
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:02,474
You're right.

680
00:25:02,574 --> 00:25:05,874
Back in the day, I thought I'd become close with everyone.

681
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:08,613
But it was hard to do that even with one person on set.

682
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:10,544
- You're right.
- Right? It doesn't happen.

683
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:12,113
Right.

684
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:13,954
Stop it! The sparks are flying toward her.

685
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:15,683
Let's switch seats.

686
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:17,253
- Come here.
- Yo Han is trying to kill me.

687
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:19,134
- Then the sparks will go that way.
- I'm okay.

688
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:20,854
I'm okay.

689
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:22,804
What were we talking about?

690
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:26,033
That you thought you'd get close with everyone you met...

691
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:27,834
- on all of your movies and shows...
- Right.

692
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:30,334
- I was listening.
- You're right.

693
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:33,574
When I was young, I really wanted a lot of friends.

694
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:36,044
I wanted to be friends with everyone and be nice to everyone.

695
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:39,444
But now, I think, "Why do I have to do that?"

696
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:43,113
I couldn't find my true happiness.

697
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:44,144
Right.

698
00:25:44,384 --> 00:25:47,584
(Everyone experiences this feeling at least once in life.)

699
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:50,723
I wanted to be close to everyone...

700
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:51,994
and take care of everyone.

701
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,854
I did all of that, but they didn't care about me.

702
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,524
- Right.
- So,

703
00:25:56,694 --> 00:25:59,463
I was being too much to them.

704
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:01,894
I wasn't that important to them, and I was doing too much.

705
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:05,374
You know, we were outcasts since we were young.

706
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:08,474
I've never been an outcast.

707
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:10,504
I've never been an outcast.

708
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:13,374
Why are you bringing me into this?

709
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,343
I always had a bright and promising future.

710
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:17,783
- Let's be in this together.
- Okay.

711
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,414
- Just say you were.
- Okay.

712
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:20,883
- I was an outcast.
- This punk.

713
00:26:20,884 --> 00:26:22,553
- I was really an outcast.
- This is so funny.

714
00:26:22,554 --> 00:26:24,083
When I say that,

715
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,824
- you should just agree.
- Okay.

716
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,454
Yo Han has gotten really big.

717
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:30,194
This is nice.

718
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:31,844
Chances like this don't come by often.

719
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,434
(The night gets deeper like their friendship.)

720
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:36,804
Let's go in.

721
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,534
Where is the gonggi set?

722
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:40,404
Is the gonggi set here?

723
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,504
Who has it?

724
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:43,874
(You want to play gonggi?)

725
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:48,144
(This afternoon, Jung Nam and Si A had a gonggi battle.)

726
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:52,053
(And they found out...)

727
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:56,224
(that Jung Nam was the master of gonggi.)

728
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,384
Don't do it.

729
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,024
Wait. I need to prepare myself.

730
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:03,723
Let's play gonggi, and this is the penalty.

731
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,924
(Rookie Yo Han walked into this with his own two feet.)

732
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:09,533
(He bravely called out the master of gonggi.)

733
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:10,603
I have to get a feel for it.

734
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:12,334
Don't practice, you punk.

735
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,573
I'm getting really competitive.

736
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:15,574
(Worried for some reason)

737
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,844
Jung Nam. For this game,

738
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,113
what should we bet on?

739
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:20,943
A flick on the forehead or a slap on the wrist?

740
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:23,043
Okay. Let's do 15 years.

741
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:24,083
- Up to 15 years?
- Yes.

742
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:25,143
Up to 15 years, and the penalty is a slap.

743
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,953
(Get up to 15 years first! The penalty is a slap.)

744
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:27,954
Nice.

745
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:29,484
Up to 15 years, and the penalty is a slap.

746
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,724
(This is a dangerous game.)

747
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:32,894
(In a moment)

748
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:35,524
(A crazy gonggi game)

749
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:38,564
(Who got the slap on their face?)

750
00:27:38,964 --> 00:27:42,164
(A game of gonggi with a slap on the line)

751
00:27:43,234 --> 00:27:44,754
- Let's do 10 years.
- Okay, 10 years.

752
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:46,304
Okay, ten years.

753
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:48,503
- No bad feelings, right?
- No bad feelings.

754
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:50,180
- Until the end, right?
- After you get slapped,

755
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:52,914
you have to keep smiling for exactly 30 seconds.

756
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,643
Okay. Let's do it. Rock-paper-scissors.

757
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:57,683
- First, second, third.
- If you don't play, you lose.

758
00:27:57,684 --> 00:27:58,684
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

759
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:01,384
(Yo Han wins.)

760
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:03,353
How should we do this? You just have to be first?

761
00:28:03,354 --> 00:28:04,384
Exactly.

762
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:05,654
Go ahead.

763
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:09,724
(Holding his toe)

764
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:11,994
I always do better when I hold my big toe.

765
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,093
Really? That's a thing?

766
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:15,504
I really have to hold it tightly.

767
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:18,463
(Is the big toe trick working?)

768
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:19,903
(Yo Han is very consistent.)

769
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:21,104
Oh, two.

770
00:28:22,374 --> 00:28:24,774
- What are you doing?
- You're so good, Yo Han.

771
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:29,213
When did you practice so much? You did, didn't you?

772
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:30,343
I'm holding it so tightly.

773
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:32,483
- Just keep going.
- I'm controlling myself.

774
00:28:32,484 --> 00:28:33,554
Hurry up.

775
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:34,954
What?

776
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:39,054
(He already got to Level 5 kkeokgi.)

777
00:28:39,194 --> 00:28:41,854
- No piano?
- No piano.

778
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,394
Hurry up.

779
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:45,294
Hurry up.

780
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,163
Oh, gosh.

781
00:28:47,164 --> 00:28:48,493
(He got 2 years, feeling a bit disappointed.)

782
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,034
- Two years.
- Two years.

783
00:28:50,204 --> 00:28:51,463
Oh, what's with this punk?

784
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,674
Yo Han. You're too good.

785
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:54,973
(Is he a hidden gonggi master?)

786
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:56,504
It's because I'm holding my toe.

787
00:28:57,504 --> 00:28:59,714
Then let go of your toe. I want to see what happens.

788
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:01,444
I'll mess up if I let go of my toe.

789
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:06,414
(His big toe is the source of his skill.)

790
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:11,424
(He already got 3 more years.)

791
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:12,793
- Oh, my.
- This is a bit...

792
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,624
Darn it. Two years again.

793
00:29:14,894 --> 00:29:15,993
He's crazy.

794
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,234
(Yo Han currently has 7 years.)

795
00:29:17,264 --> 00:29:18,523
(Feeling worried and anxious, he hasn't even touched the gonggi.)

796
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,164
(A bad word)

797
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,634
(The attack of the rookie?)

798
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:24,704
What's going on?

799
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:26,133
(Dropping)

800
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:28,094
(Yo Han missed a gonggi stone on Year 7 Level 4.)

801
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:30,574
(I knew it.)

802
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:32,544
- How many years did you get?
- Seven.

803
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:36,484
(If he doesn't catch up in one go, he'll lose!)

804
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:39,914
You're not holding your toe.

805
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:43,574
Instead of holding his toe, his hands are doing something weird.

806
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,424
It's like he's holding an egg.

807
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:49,163
- An egg.
- Am I doing this?

808
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,263
You keep...

809
00:29:50,264 --> 00:29:52,533
(This is just the start of Jung Nam's gonggi!)

810
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:54,233
Touch it. Hold your toe.

811
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:55,474
(Showing off his gonggi skills)

812
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,934
Why are you trembling? Toss it up.

813
00:29:58,364 --> 00:29:59,534
- Four years, okay?
- Okay.

814
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:01,834
The slap.

815
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:03,973
(Getting anxious)

816
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:05,204
He's being annoying.

817
00:30:05,644 --> 00:30:07,173
But Jung Nam is good at it.

818
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,574
I lost twice.

819
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,713
- That's seven.
- Seven.

820
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:15,054
(He ties with Yo Han after playing kkeokgi twice.)

821
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:16,924
You're quite excited, Jung Nam.

822
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:21,024
(He's fully focused even when disturbed.)

823
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,664
(Don't tell me he'll end it in one go.)

824
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:25,563
(He's already in Level 4.)

825
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:27,394
I have no idea how this will end.

826
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:29,704
Hold on. Stop for a minute.

827
00:30:30,104 --> 00:30:31,934
Hold on. Stop for a minute.

828
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:34,834
Hold on. Stop for a minute.

829
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,103
(Catch the 3 stones and Jung Nam will win.)

830
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,843
(Please.)

831
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:39,844
(Absorbed)

832
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,514
(The last kkeokgi to decide the winner)

833
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:44,557
Hold on. Stop for a minute.

834
00:30:44,757 --> 00:30:46,726
(Catch the 3 stones and Jung Nam will win.)

835
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:48,496
(Please.)

836
00:30:48,497 --> 00:30:49,536
(Absorbed)

837
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:51,137
(The last kkeokgi to decide the winner)

838
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:54,136
Yes! Yo Han!

839
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:55,367
(See? I'm Bae Jung Nam.)

840
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:59,107
(I'm doomed.)

841
00:30:59,677 --> 00:31:02,177
(Slapping Yo Han without hesitation)

842
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:03,747
(A grave humiliation)

843
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,146
Let's go. Please.

844
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:09,357
(The afterglow of victory lasts for a while.)

845
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:12,087
- Really.
- Jung Nam.

846
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:14,326
- That was a nerve-racking game.
- Right now...

847
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:15,857
Si A. Wasn't that a historical moment?

848
00:31:16,397 --> 00:31:18,627
Jung Nam was dying to slap me.

849
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:19,927
As soon as it ended...

850
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:22,367
Gosh.

851
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,697
That was fun.

852
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:24,796
(The two are really close.)

853
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:25,837
I had fun.

854
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:31,277
(It's already the third morning in Yeosu.)

855
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,147
(Wake up.)

856
00:31:35,747 --> 00:31:38,267
(What are the Country Family and Jung Nam doing early morning?)

857
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,857
(A mysterious man is lying on the sofa.)

858
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:48,957
(Giving off an air as if you shouldn't touch him recklessly)

859
00:31:51,697 --> 00:31:52,697
(A Sung spots him.)

860
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:56,297
(A Sung carefully approaches him.)

861
00:31:57,597 --> 00:31:58,597
(Moving)

862
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:01,137
(Frozen)

863
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:03,437
(Giving up right away)

864
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:06,527
(She runs away to the kitchen without checking who it is.)

865
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:09,007
(But really, who are you?)

866
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:12,947
(What A Sung looks for in the kitchen first...)

867
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:15,487
(is morning coffee.)

868
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:17,917
(Clattering)

869
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:20,857
(Nervous)

870
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:24,097
(Mission: Make coffee without making any noise)

871
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:26,967
(That was close.)

872
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:29,996
(This time, she needs to get a pot out.)

873
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:30,997
(Clattering)

874
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:32,637
(Panicking)

875
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:36,837
(Thankfully, he's not moving at all.)

876
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:39,376
(Did he not hear it?)

877
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:41,577
(She carefully turns the stove on.)

878
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:44,547
(A Sung begins to make coffee.)

879
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,947
(A Sung's routine that starts the day on a happy note)

880
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,827
(The aroma of the morning coffee fills the kitchen.)

881
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:55,626
(Yo Han returns after the interview.)

882
00:32:55,627 --> 00:32:56,627
(He discovers him.)

883
00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:59,367
(Why is he sleeping there?)

884
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:01,097
Yo Han.

885
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,137
I think we can wake him up.

886
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:07,537
(A wireless microphone?)

887
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:09,937
(Yo Han goes up to the man on the sofa.)

888
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:12,307
Hey, wake up.

889
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:13,906
(He's become a drill sergeant.)

890
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:15,147
Wake up, over.

891
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:16,976
Do you know what time it is?

892
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:18,077
(Put that away.)

893
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:19,517
The game has begun.

894
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:20,917
(The bystanders have gathered.)

895
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:21,917
All right.

896
00:33:22,787 --> 00:33:23,787
Bae Jung Nam.

897
00:33:24,117 --> 00:33:25,616
Stop it, Yo Han.

898
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:26,626
(Laughing)

899
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:28,227
Jung Nam. It's time to wake up.

900
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:29,597
Go wash up.

901
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,327
It can wait. We have to cook breakfast.

902
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:33,666
You do it.

903
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,667
(How bothersome.)

904
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:37,037
We promised to cook together. Get up already.

905
00:33:37,597 --> 00:33:39,467
How long were you two drinking last night?

906
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,206
- Yo Han went to bed early.
- I see.

907
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:43,437
As for me, I don't know when I stopped drinking.

908
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:47,307
(When yesterday's shoot ended)

909
00:33:48,147 --> 00:33:50,247
(Yo Han and Jung Nam drank more.)

910
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,047
(Even after Yo Han left)

911
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:55,087
Here.

912
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:58,087
(The lonely and thirsty soul, Jung Nam drank alone.)

913
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:00,027
Wake up. Hurry.

914
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:01,957
My head hurts.

915
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:05,097
Jung Nam. Here's some morning coffee.

916
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:06,266
Thank you.

917
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:07,696
It's freshly made hand-drip coffee.

918
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:09,166
- Is it hand-drip coffee?
- Yes.

919
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,136
I get coffee as soon as I wake up.

920
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:12,236
(The morning coffee wakes Jung Nam up.)

921
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:13,267
I'm tearing up.

922
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,006
- Eggs.
- Goodness.

923
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,007
(Yo Han and Si A are preparing ingredients for breakfast.)

924
00:34:17,007 --> 00:34:18,007
Green onions.

925
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:19,946
(Eggs)

926
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:21,206
(Green onions)

927
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:22,947
(Kimchi)

928
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:25,446
(What's for today's breakfast?)

929
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,417
When I had to go back to Seoul for work,

930
00:34:27,787 --> 00:34:29,187
A Sung and Si A...

931
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,657
made breakfast a few times.

932
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:34,487
I always wanted to make breakfast for them.

933
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:38,457
The menu is kimchi fried rice and egg soup.

934
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:41,926
(Yo Han's Breakfast:)

935
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:43,497
(Kimchi Fried Rice and Egg Soup)

936
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:46,136
I'm happy that we have it.

937
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:47,607
(Si A takes out something.)

938
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:49,376
I'm starving.

939
00:34:49,377 --> 00:34:51,407
Can I grill some pork belly?

940
00:34:51,577 --> 00:34:52,577
Go ahead.

941
00:34:53,147 --> 00:34:54,447
- But for real?
- Yes.

942
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:57,317
Either way, Yo Han won't be cooking right now.

943
00:34:58,177 --> 00:34:59,977
Add a lot of butter to the kimchi fried rice.

944
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:01,387
- Yes, it's a must.
- Great.

945
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,656
Please stir-fry the kimchi really well.

946
00:35:04,657 --> 00:35:05,657
Understood.

947
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:08,557
(First, Yo Han preps the ingredients.)

948
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,726
(Step 1: Chop up the green onions.)

949
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:13,827
(Focused)

950
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:16,637
Should I dice the sausages?

951
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,437
Yes, please.

952
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,837
(A Sung slices the sausages.)

953
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:25,377
I will grill a piece of pork belly for fun, okay?

954
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:26,846
- Okay.
- "Pork belly for fun?"

955
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:29,347
You're not using the stove right now.

956
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:31,977
I want to grease up my mouth.

957
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:37,687
(Humming at the thought of morning pork belly)

958
00:35:37,817 --> 00:35:40,757
(Didn't you say one piece?)

959
00:35:41,427 --> 00:35:44,257
Consider it a simple appetizer...

960
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:46,766
- as you're cooking.
- What was it?

961
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:48,426
Pork belly...

962
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:49,566
- Yes.
- as an appetizer?

963
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,166
- Really?
- Like to open your mouth.

964
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,866
- It's to open up your mouth.
- Dig in.

965
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,466
It's like my coffee.

966
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,337
Yes, exactly. It's like your coffee.

967
00:35:56,507 --> 00:35:57,707
That's right.

968
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:00,277
You're the first to eat pork belly...

969
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:02,547
as an appetizer in the morning.

970
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:04,616
Thanks to Si A,

971
00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:05,917
we'll have a hearty breakfast.

972
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:08,317
(Just trust me.)

973
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:12,887
(The pork belly is cooking well anyway.)

974
00:36:13,987 --> 00:36:14,987
What?

975
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:17,657
(Yo Han is prepping the kimchi.)

976
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:22,527
(Step 2: Cut the kimchi into bite-sized pieces.)

977
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:25,237
(She didn't see that, did she?)

978
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:28,237
(I didn't see a thing.)

979
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:30,877
(Yo Han is ripping the kimchi, not cutting it.)

980
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:33,546
(Yo Han's cooking skills are not perfect.)

981
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:35,147
- Nice.
- I bet it'll be good.

982
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:38,177
Kimchi fried rice is my favorite.

983
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:39,587
- Really?
- Is that so?

984
00:36:41,087 --> 00:36:44,717
(Yo Han believes that the end justifies the means.)

985
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:49,697
- I'll put the kimchi back in.
- Okay. Thank you.

986
00:36:50,557 --> 00:36:52,297
(He's done prepping the ingredients.)

987
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,226
(After oiling up the pan, )

988
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:56,897
(he adds the green onions.)

989
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,137
(Yo Han stir-fries the green onions first.)

990
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,137
(Next is to add kimchi.)

991
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:05,007
Yesterday.

992
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:06,076
(Risky)

993
00:37:06,077 --> 00:37:07,707
Yo Han got slapped.

994
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:09,277
Really?

995
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:12,647
(Why is he making things hard?)

996
00:37:13,787 --> 00:37:16,687
(Isn't there an easy method?)

997
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:20,087
(Si A is already digging in.)

998
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:22,797
(This time, he puts the sausages in.)

999
00:37:24,197 --> 00:37:26,767
(Using the edge of his hand)

1000
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:30,067
(Something looks awkward.)

1001
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:33,107
(Next is oyster sauce.)

1002
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:43,447
(Step 3: You can pretend to add some oyster sauce.)

1003
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:45,816
Was this yours?

1004
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:46,947
(Yo Han?)

1005
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,816
(It's time to add the rice.)

1006
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:50,857
Turn the heat down.

1007
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,587
(A Sung and Si A pick up his uneasiness.)

1008
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:59,057
Oh, no.

1009
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:01,667
What a waste of butter.

1010
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,767
(A Sung cuts the butter up for him.)

1011
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:07,806
(Marking him with a tight defense)

1012
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,007
- Like this?
- It looks good.

1013
00:38:09,407 --> 00:38:12,076
(Will Yo Han's kimchi fried rice be okay?)

1014
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:13,946
I need to cook egg soup at the same time.

1015
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:15,447
- Should we make it?
- We'll make it.

1016
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:16,577
Okay.

1017
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:18,776
- I'm sorry. Help me out a little.
- Sure.

1018
00:38:18,777 --> 00:38:20,286
Boil the water in a pot first.

1019
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:21,686
- After I boil it?
- Yes, boil it first.

1020
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:23,257
It smells wild in here.

1021
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:26,087
Really. Why does it smell so good?

1022
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:27,687
What?

1023
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:29,257
What should I do?

1024
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:31,456
Can you give it a taste, Jung Nam?

1025
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:32,457
A taste?

1026
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:33,996
I'm objective.

1027
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:35,467
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

1028
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:37,797
- For real.
- Yes.

1029
00:38:38,497 --> 00:38:41,206
(How does Yo Han's imperfect kimchi fried rice taste?)

1030
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:42,267
Is it too bland?

1031
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:45,407
- Is it too bland?
- It's really bland.

1032
00:38:45,577 --> 00:38:46,746
- What?
- It's bland.

1033
00:38:46,747 --> 00:38:47,776
Can I try?

1034
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:49,747
- Is it bland?
- I wish it was a little saltier.

1035
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:51,616
It's tasty. But...

1036
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:52,986
- Just a tiny bit more.
- Does it need more?

1037
00:38:52,987 --> 00:38:54,487
- Right?
- Yes.

1038
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:56,587
Can you season it for me?

1039
00:38:56,957 --> 00:38:59,116
The water is boiling. Okay.

1040
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,187
Oyster sauce.

1041
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:02,527
(Jung Nam picks out the missing oyster sauce.)

1042
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:04,856
(Here's the oyster sauce I almost added.)

1043
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:07,127
It just needs a little. Is it oyster sauce?

1044
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:08,867
That's enough.

1045
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:12,296
All done. It's perfect, isn't it?

1046
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:13,606
(Successfully saved the kimchi fried rice)

1047
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:15,636
- What next?
- With oyster sauce, it's perfect.

1048
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:17,377
Take it out.

1049
00:39:21,147 --> 00:39:24,017
(Yo Han's kimchi fried rice is done after many ups and downs.)

1050
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:27,647
(Next is kimchi fried rice's bestie, egg soup.)

1051
00:39:29,187 --> 00:39:31,587
(Adding the green onions into the boiling water first)

1052
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:35,457
(Pour the egg into the pot in circular motions.)

1053
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:38,727
(After seasoning it with salt and sesame oil, )

1054
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:43,267
(Si A's simple egg soup is complete.)

1055
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:46,307
(Eddie returns just in time after the interview.)

1056
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:48,606
- Yo Han.
- Did you not open it yet?

1057
00:39:48,607 --> 00:39:49,637
Hello.

1058
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,176
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1059
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:52,436
What's going on? Oh, my goodness.

1060
00:39:52,437 --> 00:39:54,847
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1061
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:57,677
Oh, my goodness. Everybody is a chef now.

1062
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:00,487
- For you.
- Thank you.

1063
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:02,346
Let's go.

1064
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:04,387
(Let's go eat breakfast now that everyone is here.)

1065
00:40:04,787 --> 00:40:06,657
(Enjoy.)

1066
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:09,187
- Please dig in.
- Dig in.

1067
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:11,827
Do I start with kimchi fried rice or what?

1068
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:13,096
Kimchi fried rice.

1069
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:14,777
(Starting with Yo Han's kimchi fried rice)

1070
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:16,667
(Impressed)

1071
00:40:16,837 --> 00:40:17,997
It's good.

1072
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,107
The kimchi fried rice. You're good at cooking.

1073
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:22,207
(Tapping)

1074
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,377
(Praising the kimchi fried rice)

1075
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,076
- It's really good.
- Is it?

1076
00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:27,477
- I like it.
- That's a relief.

1077
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:29,747
The egg soup is delicious.

1078
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:32,247
You know, I'm good at this.

1079
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:33,987
He helped me a lot.

1080
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:35,487
(Amazed)

1081
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:37,557
That's really good.

1082
00:40:37,757 --> 00:40:40,127
- What?
- Si A made it.

1083
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:43,226
The combination of these two is great.

1084
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:45,856
- It's not bad.
- It's always been the best.

1085
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:49,097
(The perfect combination of spicy kimchi fried rice and soft egg soup)

1086
00:40:51,737 --> 00:40:53,817
I'm not really a breakfast person, but this is good.

1087
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,777
(Having another bowl of kimchi fried rice)

1088
00:40:57,177 --> 00:40:59,007
It's because Yo Han made it.

1089
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,876
(This is why people cook.)

1090
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,176
Gosh, this...

1091
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:06,016
Waking up alone is a bit sad,

1092
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:07,646
but having breakfast together is nice.

1093
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,386
- Right, when you wake up.
- When I wake up.

1094
00:41:09,387 --> 00:41:10,657
The rice has to be good.

1095
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:12,386
(Glancing)

1096
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,586
The last is...

1097
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:15,386
(Scooping more quietly)

1098
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:16,997
Why are you eating so much?

1099
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:19,426
(A Sung spots him getting more food.)

1100
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:20,726
He should eat a lot.

1101
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:21,927
(He's hurt.)

1102
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:24,496
He's not the type to eat a lot.

1103
00:41:24,497 --> 00:41:26,196
I never eat breakfast.

1104
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:28,607
But now, I'm hungry all the time.

1105
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,107
(Korean cuisine sits well with me.)

1106
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:34,477
The chef has had a big appetite since the marinated crab.

1107
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:36,877
I'm so fat.

1108
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:40,187
He's slowly gaining weight.

1109
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,516
By the way, this is nice.

1110
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:45,357
- Having breakfast together.
- I agree.

1111
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:47,427
Do you want to play gonggi?

1112
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:49,587
(Gonggi?)

1113
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:51,126
Are you confident?

1114
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:53,467
(Yo Han is reminded of last night's nightmare.)

1115
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:59,567
(His pride was trampled on.)

1116
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:03,037
Didn't he slap me really hard?

1117
00:42:03,177 --> 00:42:04,276
- No, I didn't.
- So...

1118
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:05,536
Jung Nam hit him right away.

1119
00:42:05,537 --> 00:42:07,506
- It wasn't in 1, 2, and 3.
- He didn't count.

1120
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:09,147
He slapped him right away.

1121
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:11,747
Jung Nam didn't even pull his elbow back.

1122
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:13,817
Right? He slapped Yo Han's face up.

1123
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,317
It was nice, you know? I had fun.

1124
00:42:17,387 --> 00:42:19,057
(It sounds fun.)

1125
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,157
If we play gonggi...

1126
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:22,787
You're sleepy, right?

1127
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:24,956
- Kind of.
- I'll put you back to sleep.

1128
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:25,957
For real?

1129
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:28,867
(Winning both games, Bae Jung Nam is the best in gonggi.)

1130
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:31,537
(Losing 1 game, Byun Yo Han knows no fear.)

1131
00:42:32,037 --> 00:42:34,367
(Is there going to be another match?)

1132
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:37,677
(A revenge match between Jung Nam and Yo Han)

1133
00:42:38,507 --> 00:42:40,077
Is it a revenge match?

1134
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:44,017
(The air in the stadium is heavy.)

1135
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,717
(The embodiment of revenge, Byun Yo Han)

1136
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:49,186
(The strongest, Bae Jung Nam)

1137
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:50,657
Why are you so good at it?

1138
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:52,917
(The audience and decoy, Edward Lee)

1139
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:54,186
- Who's after?
- Okay.

1140
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:55,187
(The judge, Ko A Sung)

1141
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,226
(Good luck, Yo Han.)

1142
00:42:57,227 --> 00:42:58,707
(Passed out before the revenge match)

1143
00:42:58,757 --> 00:43:00,426
Are you taking it up? Are you confident?

1144
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:02,396
The one who gets five years first gets to slap the other.

1145
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:05,136
- Okay. Five years?
- Yes.

1146
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:06,296
- I'll go first.
- No, rock-paper-scissors.

1147
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:07,706
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1148
00:43:07,707 --> 00:43:09,837
(Yo Han lost.)

1149
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:12,377
(Yo Han gets off on the wrong foot.)

1150
00:43:12,577 --> 00:43:14,307
- Five years?
- Yes.

1151
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:15,977
Here I go.

1152
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:20,617
Two, three.

1153
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,957
(Chewing on his nails out of anxiousness)

1154
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,686
Are you happy?

1155
00:43:27,687 --> 00:43:28,986
Will there be a revenge match?

1156
00:43:28,987 --> 00:43:30,757
(Don't act up before me again.)

1157
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:38,537
(Jung Nam easily passes Level 3.)

1158
00:43:39,097 --> 00:43:41,837
(The laughter of the man who senses his victory)

1159
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:43,506
(Anxious and bitter)

1160
00:43:43,507 --> 00:43:44,713
(The laughter of the man who senses his defeat)

1161
00:43:44,737 --> 00:43:46,307
(Simply laughing because it's funny)

1162
00:43:47,147 --> 00:43:48,747
(He already passed Level 4.)

1163
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:51,047
(The slap is drawing near.)

1164
00:43:51,517 --> 00:43:53,447
(I'm doomed.)

1165
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:56,047
Rub your cheeks beforehand.

1166
00:43:56,457 --> 00:43:58,417
(It was fun, Yo Han.)

1167
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,256
Are you happy, Jung Nam?

1168
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:01,257
Yo Han.

1169
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:03,697
(Of course.)

1170
00:44:03,757 --> 00:44:05,256
Yo Han.

1171
00:44:05,257 --> 00:44:06,696
(If Jung Nam succeeds, )

1172
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:07,967
(Yo Han will get slapped.)

1173
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:09,967
- Goodness.
- The last one.

1174
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,137
Why are you trembling?

1175
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:12,967
Move your finger.

1176
00:44:13,437 --> 00:44:14,466
Stop trembling so much.

1177
00:44:14,467 --> 00:44:15,537
(Falling down)

1178
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:17,877
(Yo Han successfully gets in his way.)

1179
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:20,847
Two years. I got two years, okay?

1180
00:44:21,677 --> 00:44:24,277
(At this rate, I'll get slapped.)

1181
00:44:24,877 --> 00:44:26,247
Who's behind you?

1182
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:28,317
(What are you on about?)

1183
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:29,647
What's with your toes?

1184
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:31,517
Relax.

1185
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:33,927
- What?
- Relax.

1186
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:34,957
Why?

1187
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:36,597
- Two years.
- You touched it.

1188
00:44:37,227 --> 00:44:38,326
- Two years.
- You touched it.

1189
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:39,726
I didn't. Stop messing around.

1190
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:41,767
- I didn't. Stop it.
- No, you did.

1191
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:43,026
- Don't do it.
- No.

1192
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:44,573
- You touched it for real.
- Did you see it?

1193
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:46,267
- You touched it.
- I didn't.

1194
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:47,736
- Keep your dignity.
- I saw it.

1195
00:44:47,737 --> 00:44:49,166
- Seriously, you touched it.
- No.

1196
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:50,336
- I didn't.
- You did.

1197
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:52,736
- VCR.
- VCR can wait...

1198
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:53,817
until the episode is aired.

1199
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:56,517
(These men are hilarious.)

1200
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:58,116
(Jung Nam lost his turn in a dubious way.)

1201
00:44:58,117 --> 00:44:59,147
Okay.

1202
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:02,217
I will get all five right away.

1203
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:04,056
I definitely will.

1204
00:45:04,057 --> 00:45:05,216
(I'll end you right away, Bae Jung Nam.)

1205
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:06,217
Okay.

1206
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:08,987
Two. Next is Level Three.

1207
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:11,597
(Struggling)

1208
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:13,827
Don't get all three.

1209
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:16,777
(The two men have bet everything on this one match.)

1210
00:45:17,997 --> 00:45:19,497
- Now...
- What?

1211
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,907
(The tables have turned.)

1212
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:25,907
Yo Han. Don't.

1213
00:45:28,047 --> 00:45:29,777
(Drooling from the sweetness of victory)

1214
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:35,247
(I'll end you, Bae Jung Nam.)

1215
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:39,587
(The gonggi stones have been thrown.)

1216
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:41,687
Don't.

1217
00:45:45,697 --> 00:45:48,067
(He missed his chance to win due to a mistake.)

1218
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:53,437
(A change in fate)

1219
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,707
(Laughing)

1220
00:45:55,807 --> 00:45:58,937
(The world of gonggi is full of twists.)

1221
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,577
You got scared, right?

1222
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:03,147
No, if I'm being honest.

1223
00:46:04,117 --> 00:46:06,247
(You see, Yo Han, I'm...)

1224
00:46:07,387 --> 00:46:08,387
Nice.

1225
00:46:08,388 --> 00:46:10,087
- Nice.
- No.

1226
00:46:10,117 --> 00:46:11,156
Nice.

1227
00:46:11,157 --> 00:46:13,856
(Jung Nam attacks like a beast.)

1228
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:14,957
Take them down.

1229
00:46:15,287 --> 00:46:16,527
Get up.

1230
00:46:17,197 --> 00:46:18,557
Give me your cheek.

1231
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:21,727
(A culture shock)

1232
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:24,497
- Give me your cheek.
- Cut me some slack.

1233
00:46:25,237 --> 00:46:27,907
- I'll be gentle.
- No.

1234
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:29,507
(Slapping)

1235
00:46:29,508 --> 00:46:30,707
(A slap of punishment)

1236
00:46:32,137 --> 00:46:34,107
(A sad version of "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance")

1237
00:46:36,077 --> 00:46:37,177
Let's stop.

1238
00:46:38,147 --> 00:46:40,987
- Let's stop. That was fun.
- It was a beautiful match.

1239
00:46:41,117 --> 00:46:43,556
Let's have one last match.

1240
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:44,657
- Gonggi?
- Yes.

1241
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:46,827
- One last match.
- Really?

1242
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:48,987
- Come here.
- No, let's stop.

1243
00:46:49,157 --> 00:46:50,297
I'm not playing.

1244
00:46:50,597 --> 00:46:51,696
Three years? Rock-paper-scissors.

1245
00:46:51,697 --> 00:46:53,497
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1246
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:55,426
(The two men's gonggi match...)

1247
00:46:55,427 --> 00:46:56,987
You know I'm highly competitive, right?

1248
00:46:57,697 --> 00:47:00,307
(continued until Yo Han got his revenge.)

1249
00:47:04,177 --> 00:47:05,807
(Are you having fun, Yo Han?)

1250
00:47:05,877 --> 00:47:06,946
The end.

1251
00:47:06,947 --> 00:47:08,147
(I'm a bit scared now.)

1252
00:47:08,507 --> 00:47:09,946
Yo Han got his revenge.

1253
00:47:09,947 --> 00:47:10,976
I lost.

1254
00:47:10,977 --> 00:47:12,097
Let's do another five years.

1255
00:47:12,717 --> 00:47:14,547
Let's do another five years. One last match.

1256
00:47:14,587 --> 00:47:15,786
Rock-paper-scissors.

1257
00:47:15,787 --> 00:47:17,063
(Revenge calls for a bigger revenge.)

1258
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,157
Jung Nam is very competitive.

1259
00:47:19,217 --> 00:47:21,286
- This is acceptable.
- Are you kidding me? It's okay.

1260
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:23,426
- You can do it.
- It's how you do it.

1261
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:24,826
Yes. Is it acceptable in Busan?

1262
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:26,597
(It's time to leave.)

1263
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:28,796
Let's go.

1264
00:47:28,797 --> 00:47:29,797
Okay.

1265
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,497
(Si A is up from her nap.)

1266
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:34,067
That was a good nap.

1267
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:35,837
Did you win?

1268
00:47:36,037 --> 00:47:37,136
I didn't play.

1269
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:39,006
But it was a brutal match.

1270
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,506
- Did he get slapped?
- Yes.

1271
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:41,507
Who?

1272
00:47:41,577 --> 00:47:42,677
Both of them.

1273
00:47:44,117 --> 00:47:47,917
(Let's go have lunch now.)

1274
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:49,817
Let's go.

1275
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:52,717
What nice weather.

1276
00:47:54,257 --> 00:47:55,527
I'll drive.

1277
00:47:56,587 --> 00:47:58,157
No, Yo Han. I'll drive today.

1278
00:47:58,927 --> 00:48:00,896
Cool your cheek with this.

1279
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:03,266
- No, but really.
- It's not that bad.

1280
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:04,837
- Right here.
- Seriously.

1281
00:48:05,267 --> 00:48:06,336
It's not that bad.

1282
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:07,406
(It's noisy. Quiet down.)

1283
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:08,407
Get in.

1284
00:48:08,807 --> 00:48:10,247
Go for another match if you want to.

1285
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,676
(Let's stop, Jung Nam.)

1286
00:48:12,677 --> 00:48:14,877
I'm driving now. Everyone is buckled up, right?

1287
00:48:16,047 --> 00:48:18,977
(Heading to Country Cook's last travel destination)

1288
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,247
(Bye.)

1289
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:24,317
(A perfect day to travel with the warm sunlight and breeze)

1290
00:48:30,127 --> 00:48:32,296
Chef. Do you have a song you want to listen to?

1291
00:48:32,297 --> 00:48:34,066
Yo Han will play it for you.

1292
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:35,867
- Anything is fine.
- Anything?

1293
00:48:35,897 --> 00:48:37,797
We're in Yeosu, so "Yeosu Night Sea," no?

1294
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:39,497
Sounds good.

1295
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:42,867
(Music is a must when traveling.)

1296
00:48:43,237 --> 00:48:44,406
(Listening to the song)

1297
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:45,877
I love it.

1298
00:48:47,077 --> 00:48:49,346
Listening to music in the car is nice.

1299
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:51,027
- It is.
- It has a good resonance, right?

1300
00:48:51,477 --> 00:48:53,916
The resonance heals your soul.

1301
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:54,947
I agree.

1302
00:48:56,587 --> 00:48:58,357
It sounds like we're in a concert.

1303
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:00,086
- You're right.
- Yes, it feels like a concert.

1304
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:02,227
(I agree.)

1305
00:49:03,327 --> 00:49:05,696
It's so nice to listen to good music and travel.

1306
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:06,697
Yes.

1307
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:09,966
The night sea of Yeosu.

1308
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:12,197
(The night sea of Yeosu...)

1309
00:49:12,837 --> 00:49:14,036
We spent a night there.

1310
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,466
(What are you doing, Yo Han?)

1311
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:18,637
We got a story at 10:56am.

1312
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:21,877
Your voice is too rich.

1313
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:24,677
It's too rich for a 10am radio.

1314
00:49:25,577 --> 00:49:28,087
"Too Sweet" by Hozier.

1315
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:30,557
We'll come back after his song.

1316
00:49:31,857 --> 00:49:33,216
(Feeling proud of himself)

1317
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:34,803
(Yo Han's playlist, "Too Sweet" by Hozier)

1318
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:36,627
(It's right up her alley.)

1319
00:49:36,897 --> 00:49:38,797
(He has good taste in music.)

1320
00:49:39,527 --> 00:49:41,397
- We're ten minutes away.
- Yes.

1321
00:49:42,197 --> 00:49:43,567
Can you still drive?

1322
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,297
No, swap with me.

1323
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:47,037
Now?

1324
00:49:47,038 --> 00:49:48,807
(Joking)

1325
00:49:49,337 --> 00:49:51,553
(Being soft on the inside, he swaps with her as a driver.)

1326
00:49:51,577 --> 00:49:52,937
Since we're in Yeosu,

1327
00:49:53,307 --> 00:49:55,506
we should try leaf mustard kimchi.

1328
00:49:55,507 --> 00:49:56,507
Yes.

1329
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:57,517
(Leaf mustard kimchi)

1330
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:01,147
(The snack cart they visited on the first day in Yeosu)

1331
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:05,817
(Yeosu's leaf mustard kimchi was served as a side dish!)

1332
00:50:06,257 --> 00:50:07,257
Kimchi...

1333
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:09,887
(Leaf mustard kimchi left a strong first impression.)

1334
00:50:10,397 --> 00:50:11,596
(The final food Yo Han prepared...)

1335
00:50:11,597 --> 00:50:12,996
(is Yeosu's leaf mustard kimchi.)

1336
00:50:12,997 --> 00:50:14,497
Since we're in Dolsan, Yeosu,

1337
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:17,267
we must taste their leaf mustard kimchi.

1338
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,367
I'm curious about how leaf mustard kimchi is made...

1339
00:50:20,637 --> 00:50:23,237
and how it's harvested.

1340
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:25,377
Eddie was curious too.

1341
00:50:25,907 --> 00:50:28,346
So I got in contact with a leaf mustard farm.

1342
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:29,776
(He secured a leaf mustard farm!)

1343
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:30,876
Oh, my leaf mustard.

1344
00:50:30,877 --> 00:50:32,177
(Look forward to it.)

1345
00:50:33,017 --> 00:50:35,216
We're heading to Dolsan.

1346
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:36,217
- Yes.
- Yes.

1347
00:50:36,218 --> 00:50:38,956
"Dol" in the name doesn't refer to "rock."

1348
00:50:38,957 --> 00:50:40,426
Then?

1349
00:50:40,427 --> 00:50:43,496
The Chinese characters for "mountain," "big,"

1350
00:50:43,497 --> 00:50:44,756
and "eight..."

1351
00:50:44,757 --> 00:50:45,996
come together and form the word "dol."

1352
00:50:45,997 --> 00:50:47,196
(The three characters form "dol" mean "suddenly.")

1353
00:50:47,197 --> 00:50:49,896
It's called "Dolsan" because there are eight mountains...

1354
00:50:49,897 --> 00:50:51,397
next to each other.

1355
00:50:52,537 --> 00:50:55,337
(Stop here. Why is leaf mustard in Dolsan famous?)

1356
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:57,636
(Dolsan's leaf mustard grows in the sea breeze...)

1357
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,107
(along rich soil and warm weather.)

1358
00:51:00,507 --> 00:51:03,917
(Sharp spiciness and soft texture)

1359
00:51:04,247 --> 00:51:05,876
(Dolsan's leaf mustard is loved for its unique fragrance...)

1360
00:51:05,877 --> 00:51:07,786
(that is different from conventional leaf mustard.)

1361
00:51:07,787 --> 00:51:09,846
(The end of useful leaf mustard knowledge)

1362
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:10,856
- I see.
- I see.

1363
00:51:10,857 --> 00:51:11,857
I get it.

1364
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:14,027
That's why they call it "Dolsal leaf mustard kimchi."

1365
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:15,717
All the shops sell leaf mustard kimchi.

1366
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:17,557
You're right.

1367
00:51:17,558 --> 00:51:18,696
(Leaf mustard kimchi signboards are everywhere.)

1368
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:20,896
Whenever you go to a place that's famous for something,

1369
00:51:20,897 --> 00:51:23,467
you always pass by a road like this.

1370
00:51:23,797 --> 00:51:25,896
(Glancing)

1371
00:51:25,897 --> 00:51:27,337
His neck is bent all the way.

1372
00:51:27,507 --> 00:51:28,567
My goodness.

1373
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:30,337
He's completely knocked out.

1374
00:51:30,707 --> 00:51:32,106
(Eddie is fast asleep.)

1375
00:51:32,107 --> 00:51:34,747
He normally doesn't sleep like this.

1376
00:51:35,507 --> 00:51:37,647
(Until now, Eddie...)

1377
00:51:38,117 --> 00:51:40,053
(He starts bombing them with questions when he gets in the car.)

1378
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:42,486
(About food...)

1379
00:51:42,487 --> 00:51:45,557
(and about the scenery)

1380
00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:48,557
(Teasing Yo Han is a plus.)

1381
00:51:49,387 --> 00:51:52,527
(He never stopped talking.)

1382
00:51:52,997 --> 00:51:56,597
Since we're nearing the end, he's gotten comfortable around us.

1383
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:58,896
- He's so cute.
- How adorable.

1384
00:51:58,897 --> 00:51:59,967
He's driving me nuts.

1385
00:52:01,737 --> 00:52:03,006
(Their destination is as close as their relationship!)

1386
00:52:03,007 --> 00:52:04,106
- Here it is.
- It's here, right?

1387
00:52:04,107 --> 00:52:05,136
- Yes, it's here.
- Are we there?

1388
00:52:05,137 --> 00:52:06,137
We are.

1389
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:07,976
- Beautiful.
- Let's get out here.

1390
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:09,006
(They arrive at the destination.)

1391
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:10,047
Good job.

1392
00:52:10,177 --> 00:52:11,616
- Good job.
- Nice.

1393
00:52:11,617 --> 00:52:13,377
It's so strong here.

1394
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:15,647
It's the sea.

1395
00:52:16,187 --> 00:52:17,257
How pretty.

1396
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:21,557
It's so pretty.

1397
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:23,386
I really like how the light shines.

1398
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:25,026
- Me too.
- The light reflected on the sea...

1399
00:52:25,027 --> 00:52:26,057
is so pretty.

1400
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:28,527
- The sun glitter?
- Yes. I love it.

1401
00:52:31,997 --> 00:52:33,137
I just saw something.

1402
00:52:33,537 --> 00:52:34,537
What did you see?

1403
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:36,167
Something just came out.

1404
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:37,876
There must be fish.

1405
00:52:37,877 --> 00:52:38,977
She just threw a stone.

1406
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:40,747
I see.

1407
00:52:41,147 --> 00:52:42,507
She just threw a stone.

1408
00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:46,446
(Si A is the culprit.)

1409
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:48,317
(Eddie falls for Si A's prank.)

1410
00:52:49,217 --> 00:52:51,256
(Should I throw one too?)

1411
00:52:51,257 --> 00:52:53,987
- Amazing.
- It's pretty.

1412
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:56,327
(Go far, stone!)

1413
00:52:56,857 --> 00:52:58,027
- My goodness!
- Chef!

1414
00:52:58,797 --> 00:53:00,157
(Very surprised)

1415
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:02,127
- Chef!
- Chef.

1416
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:04,266
You scared me.

1417
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,536
Please be careful.

1418
00:53:06,537 --> 00:53:08,206
He is like a child left alone by the water.

1419
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:09,267
Goodbye.

1420
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:10,976
Why did you...

1421
00:53:10,977 --> 00:53:13,036
(As they fool around and walk along the coast...)

1422
00:53:13,037 --> 00:53:14,147
No.

1423
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:16,177
There it is.

1424
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:17,947
All the way until there?

1425
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:19,877
Is this leaf mustard?

1426
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,716
They look so healthy.

1427
00:53:21,717 --> 00:53:23,586
- Really...
- This is leaf mustard.

1428
00:53:23,587 --> 00:53:25,187
- Yes.
- It looks great.

1429
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,987
(Yeosu's prestigious ingredient, Dolsan's leaf mustard)

1430
00:53:29,057 --> 00:53:30,286
(Around 6,600m²...)

1431
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:32,157
(of leaf mustard field by the sea)

1432
00:53:33,397 --> 00:53:36,027
(Some are being grown in the greenhouse too.)

1433
00:53:36,697 --> 00:53:38,196
(The person who has looked after the leaf mustard field alone...)

1434
00:53:38,197 --> 00:53:39,667
(for 30 years)

1435
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,506
(Park Chun Hwa, 76 years old)

1436
00:53:42,507 --> 00:53:45,877
Farming is just like parenting. You must take good care of them,

1437
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:48,576
water them, use pesticides,

1438
00:53:48,577 --> 00:53:52,176
and check if anything is not right.

1439
00:53:52,177 --> 00:53:55,187
They say crops grow listening to the footsteps...

1440
00:53:55,517 --> 00:53:57,056
of the owner.

1441
00:53:57,057 --> 00:54:00,487
The more often you check on them, the better the harvest in the end.

1442
00:54:01,057 --> 00:54:03,827
(She has dedicated her whole life to leaf mustard.)

1443
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:08,667
(She makes every dish with leaf mustard.)

1444
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:13,367
(The master of leaf mustard dishes)

1445
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:18,107
(What inspiration will Eddie get from her leaf mustard?)

1446
00:54:18,307 --> 00:54:21,106
- Hello.
- Hello.

1447
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:23,147
Join us. Knives are over there.

1448
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,216
- Knives?
- Wear this.

1449
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:25,416
- Gloves are over there too.
- Okay.

1450
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:27,186
- Shall we join right away?
- Hello.

1451
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:28,986
- Do we start immediately?
- Yes, right away.

1452
00:54:28,987 --> 00:54:30,656
- Where are you from?
- From Seoul.

1453
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:31,657
- Are you from Seoul?
- Yes.

1454
00:54:31,658 --> 00:54:33,017
Right away, start working.

1455
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,356
- Can you show me how to do it?
- Yes.

1456
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:37,326
- Hold it like this.
- Yes.

1457
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:39,496
- Do you see the small leaves?
- Yes.

1458
00:54:39,497 --> 00:54:41,426
- Push them aside.
- Yes.

1459
00:54:41,427 --> 00:54:43,627
- Cut it like this.
- Just like that?

1460
00:54:43,737 --> 00:54:45,196
It must be neat.

1461
00:54:45,197 --> 00:54:46,267
I understand.

1462
00:54:46,397 --> 00:54:47,406
Like this.

1463
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:49,213
(Eddie is learning how to harvest leaf mustard too.)

1464
00:54:49,237 --> 00:54:50,537
So only the inside.

1465
00:54:51,237 --> 00:54:52,237
Yes.

1466
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:53,307
- It's so big.
- Yes.

1467
00:54:53,477 --> 00:54:54,507
- Okay.
- Like this.

1468
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:56,277
I heard...

1469
00:54:56,607 --> 00:54:59,016
that the owner of this field was here.

1470
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:00,017
Who is it?

1471
00:55:00,018 --> 00:55:01,586
Her. It's her field.

1472
00:55:01,587 --> 00:55:03,016
I'm the owner of the field.

1473
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:04,517
She is my sister-in-law.

1474
00:55:04,787 --> 00:55:06,987
- She is my husband's sister.
- Are you guys family?

1475
00:55:07,357 --> 00:55:08,956
What's your name?

1476
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:09,957
Lim Geum Rye.

1477
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:10,957
- Geum Rye?
- Yes.

1478
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:12,333
- Your name is Lim Geum Rye?
- Yes.

1479
00:55:12,357 --> 00:55:14,396
Your nickname was "king" when you were young, right?

1480
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:15,566
It is even now.

1481
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:16,967
- Even now?
- Yes.

1482
00:55:20,937 --> 00:55:22,737
- Madam, does leaf mustard...
- Yes.

1483
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:24,177
Have a season?

1484
00:55:24,307 --> 00:55:26,536
After it lives through winter,

1485
00:55:26,537 --> 00:55:29,106
it gets ready to bloom flowers in spring.

1486
00:55:29,107 --> 00:55:31,216
That's when it's most delicious.

1487
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:33,887
Actually, it's a winter vegetable.

1488
00:55:34,117 --> 00:55:37,287
But now, we have greenhouses.

1489
00:55:37,457 --> 00:55:38,986
So we can have leaf mustard all year round.

1490
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:40,163
(They're harvested in greenhouses in summer.)

1491
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:41,886
Do you just keep harvesting them when they grow?

1492
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:45,157
Yes. If it becomes this big, it needs to be harvested.

1493
00:55:45,397 --> 00:55:47,697
You harvest 2 to 3 times from 1 field.

1494
00:55:47,997 --> 00:55:49,027
Leaf mustard.

1495
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:51,637
My goodness.

1496
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,497
It's so big.

1497
00:55:54,007 --> 00:55:55,137
It's big.

1498
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:57,576
- Was leaf mustard this big?
- I know, right?

1499
00:55:57,577 --> 00:55:58,907
I never realized when I ate one.

1500
00:55:59,577 --> 00:56:01,347
It's so firm.

1501
00:56:01,407 --> 00:56:02,646
- Right?
- Yes.

1502
00:56:02,647 --> 00:56:04,823
(Both the weather and their feelings are as good as the leaf mustard.)

1503
00:56:04,847 --> 00:56:07,586
(The leaf mustard harvesting is smooth sailing.)

1504
00:56:07,587 --> 00:56:09,686
- Right?
- Look at this.

1505
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:10,717
(Crunch)

1506
00:56:11,157 --> 00:56:12,816
(What's that sound?)

1507
00:56:12,817 --> 00:56:15,157
(While everyone is busy harvesting leaf mustard, )

1508
00:56:15,487 --> 00:56:18,026
(Eddie becomes curious.)

1509
00:56:18,027 --> 00:56:19,027
It's Lim Geum Rye.

1510
00:56:19,028 --> 00:56:20,397
- Gosh, it's good.
- Is it nice?

1511
00:56:20,597 --> 00:56:22,327
It's like celery, you know?

1512
00:56:22,497 --> 00:56:24,166
- Is it like celery?
- Yes.

1513
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:25,737
(Shall I try it too?)

1514
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:28,307
(Raw leaf mustard brothers)

1515
00:56:28,607 --> 00:56:29,736
(It's charming.)

1516
00:56:29,737 --> 00:56:30,976
- It's juicy.
- Yes.

1517
00:56:30,977 --> 00:56:32,837
- It does taste a bit like celery.
- Yes.

1518
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:35,776
- It has a pungent taste.
- Yes.

1519
00:56:35,777 --> 00:56:38,346
Raw leaf mustard tastes good with pork belly.

1520
00:56:38,347 --> 00:56:39,977
- As a wrap?
- Yes.

1521
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:41,816
Wouldn't that be spicy though?

1522
00:56:41,817 --> 00:56:42,817
It's spicy.

1523
00:56:43,017 --> 00:56:45,017
So you use this for wraps.

1524
00:56:45,387 --> 00:56:46,456
Yes, you can make wraps.

1525
00:56:46,457 --> 00:56:47,686
- Yes.
- And also for kimchi.

1526
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:48,786
- What else?
- Let's see.

1527
00:56:48,787 --> 00:56:50,356
I make pickles with it.

1528
00:56:50,357 --> 00:56:51,456
- I see.
- Pickle.

1529
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:53,696
I make mulkimchi with it too.

1530
00:56:53,697 --> 00:56:55,367
Mulkimchi?

1531
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:58,167
(Eddie is in love with Dolsan's leaf mustard.)

1532
00:56:58,437 --> 00:57:00,607
(Eddie's leaf mustard ASMR starts like that.)

1533
00:57:01,937 --> 00:57:04,107
(Crunch)

1534
00:57:04,907 --> 00:57:07,777
(Falling for Dolsan's leaf mustard)

1535
00:57:08,547 --> 00:57:11,417
(In a trance)

1536
00:57:12,147 --> 00:57:17,286
(Eddie eats more than he harvests.)

1537
00:57:17,287 --> 00:57:19,087
That's right.

1538
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:23,727
I don't know. For some reason, the one I had in Korea...

1539
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:26,997
was so pungent. It punches you in the face.

1540
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:28,966
A lot of flavors.

1541
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:30,797
But also, very clean and bright.

1542
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:33,907
It has a really green, beautiful flavor to it.

1543
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:36,636
(We're dating starting today.)

1544
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:40,437
(Leaf mustard, I'll keep you in my heart.)

1545
00:57:40,747 --> 00:57:42,676
The weather is amazing today.

1546
00:57:42,677 --> 00:57:43,876
- It's warm.
- The weather is nice.

1547
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,917
Yes.

1548
00:57:45,477 --> 00:57:49,447
(They work long hours under the refreshing weather.)

1549
00:57:50,757 --> 00:57:53,287
(Knocked out by firm leaf mustard)

1550
00:57:54,227 --> 00:57:56,886
(Working in the field is rough even when you're sitting down.)

1551
00:57:56,887 --> 00:57:58,956
(Still, they work hard.)

1552
00:57:58,957 --> 00:57:59,997
This is huge.

1553
00:58:00,057 --> 00:58:01,597
(It's tough but fun.)

1554
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:04,967
(Jung Nam has never been quieter since he joined the show.)

1555
00:58:05,497 --> 00:58:07,867
(Leaf mustard is being piled up.)

1556
00:58:08,437 --> 00:58:09,437
(One more coming.)

1557
00:58:11,177 --> 00:58:12,177
(One more coming.)

1558
00:58:14,277 --> 00:58:15,277
(More coming.)

1559
00:58:16,177 --> 00:58:19,077
Stop now. We can't even take that much back.

1560
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:20,986
Pile them up nicely.

1561
00:58:20,987 --> 00:58:23,717
(It's time to transport the harvested leaf mustard!)

1562
00:58:24,587 --> 00:58:26,116
Pile them up nicely.

1563
00:58:26,117 --> 00:58:28,426
Nicely, okay.

1564
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:29,456
(Obedient Country members)

1565
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:31,327
- Or you might get scolded.
- Nicely.

1566
00:58:32,397 --> 00:58:33,757
We got a lot.

1567
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:35,696
There's a lot.

1568
00:58:35,697 --> 00:58:36,873
(Eddie is piling them up nicely too.)

1569
00:58:36,897 --> 00:58:39,297
I told you to pile it up nicely,

1570
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:41,736
- but you didn't.
- He did it.

1571
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:44,007
- What me?
- Don't blame others.

1572
00:58:45,007 --> 00:58:46,507
You should say you did it.

1573
00:58:47,777 --> 00:58:49,906
(Madam is on Yo Han's side.)

1574
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:53,046
Can you teach me how to cook using leaf mustard?

1575
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:54,117
Okay.

1576
00:58:54,287 --> 00:58:57,817
I don't think of leaf mustard as being Korean.

1577
00:58:58,157 --> 00:59:01,426
Because leaf mustard is used in so many different cuisines...

1578
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:04,927
from Southern food to Indian food.

1579
00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:09,126
And yet, it's something I really haven't had in Korea very often.

1580
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:12,467
So I'm just very curious to see how...

1581
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:15,937
leaf mustard will turn into Korean food.

1582
00:59:17,237 --> 00:59:19,477
(To be revealed shortly)

1583
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,976
I don't know. Is it good?

1584
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:24,417
(It's so good.)

1585
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:29,886
(An assortment of leaf mustard dishes...)

1586
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:33,317
(that makes them exclaim continuously)

1587
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:36,957
(The finale of the Yeosu trip, an assorted meal of leaf mustard)

1588
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:39,357
(Just trust me.)

1589
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:42,026
- Okay.
- That's not it.

1590
00:59:42,027 --> 00:59:43,726
- Let's go.
- Don't do that.

1591
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:44,767
Walk faster.

1592
00:59:45,097 --> 00:59:46,266
Check if anything falls off.

1593
00:59:46,267 --> 00:59:47,736
- You did this.
- Walk faster.

1594
00:59:47,737 --> 00:59:48,837
Follow him.

1595
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:50,936
How is he so good at pulling this?

1596
00:59:50,937 --> 00:59:52,836
You must pull it like him,

1597
00:59:52,837 --> 00:59:53,876
- not backward.
- Is that how you do it?

1598
00:59:53,877 --> 00:59:55,276
- Backward or forward, - Do it like this.

1599
00:59:55,277 --> 00:59:56,506
- do however you like.
- Like this.

1600
00:59:56,507 --> 00:59:57,716
Show me.

1601
00:59:57,717 --> 00:59:59,847
Forget about that. I'll just pull.

1602
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:02,447
You're doing great, Yo Han.

1603
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:04,317
Good job.

1604
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:05,817
You pull it now.

1605
01:00:06,317 --> 01:00:07,926
My back hurts. You do it.

1606
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:09,926
- Darn it.
- People will criticize you later...

1607
01:00:09,927 --> 01:00:11,403
for making me do it when I'm older than you.

1608
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:13,357
- I'll pull.
- It's okay.

1609
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:15,667
- If you're exhausted...
- I'm fine.

1610
01:00:15,997 --> 01:00:17,037
We're almost there anyway.

1611
01:00:17,637 --> 01:00:18,637
Forget it.

1612
01:00:20,067 --> 01:00:21,867
The mountains are so pretty.

1613
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:26,206
Because the fall leaves have colored the mountains.

1614
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:27,207
Yes.

1615
01:00:27,747 --> 01:00:28,876
They're so pretty.

1616
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:31,416
(As they pass the alley where you can see the Yeosu sea...)

1617
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:33,847
- I like this country vibe.
- I like it too.

1618
01:00:34,987 --> 01:00:37,086
- Is this the house?
- Yes, that's the one.

1619
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:38,807
- I had a feeling it was this house.
- Yes.

1620
01:00:39,917 --> 01:00:40,927
Let's go.

1621
01:00:41,357 --> 01:00:44,126
I have stuff to do. I'll get going.

1622
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:46,457
- You're leaving now?
- Yes, I need to go.

1623
01:00:47,157 --> 01:00:49,896
Madam. See you again.

1624
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,166
Goodbye.

1625
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:52,537
(She doesn't even look back once.)

1626
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:54,207
(Fascinated)

1627
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:55,807
(A cozy countryside house)

1628
01:00:56,707 --> 01:00:57,707
I like this house.

1629
01:00:58,177 --> 01:01:00,107
Me too. It's a typical countryside house.

1630
01:01:00,307 --> 01:01:01,777
It's beautiful here.

1631
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:04,846
Gosh, it's bright in here.

1632
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:05,976
(Park Chun Hwa lived here for 50 years.)

1633
01:01:05,977 --> 01:01:08,716
It has a very nice atmosphere.

1634
01:01:08,717 --> 01:01:11,517
(The yard has traces of old age.)

1635
01:01:12,287 --> 01:01:14,826
(A cozy countryside house that makes you nostalgic)

1636
01:01:14,827 --> 01:01:16,026
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

1637
01:01:16,027 --> 01:01:17,356
- Yes.
- Take this.

1638
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:18,357
Okay.

1639
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:19,756
Put it there.

1640
01:01:19,757 --> 01:01:20,967
Look at the leaf mustard.

1641
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:24,637
(Lifting it up without hesitation!)

1642
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:27,906
(I want to cook quickly.)

1643
01:01:27,907 --> 01:01:29,267
(They keep the rest in the yard.)

1644
01:01:30,337 --> 01:01:34,147
(They're busy.)

1645
01:01:35,247 --> 01:01:37,407
(Is everything ready?)

1646
01:01:39,017 --> 01:01:42,746
(The ingredients are placed on the table one by one.)

1647
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:45,357
This is for mulkimchi and seasoned leaf mustard.

1648
01:01:45,457 --> 01:01:47,557
Dried leaf mustard soup and buchimgae.

1649
01:01:48,357 --> 01:01:49,456
That's a lot.

1650
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:51,357
(Park Chun Hwa's generous leaf mustard dishes)

1651
01:01:51,597 --> 01:01:53,057
Shall we start with kimchi?

1652
01:01:53,257 --> 01:01:54,266
- Okay.
- Okay.

1653
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:55,297
(Yes, madam!)

1654
01:01:55,397 --> 01:01:56,827
(Let's start quickly.)

1655
01:01:57,267 --> 01:01:59,297
I don't wear gloves when making kimchi.

1656
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:02,037
(Just trust me and follow me.)

1657
01:02:02,107 --> 01:02:03,336
Do this.

1658
01:02:03,337 --> 01:02:04,537
(Mission 1: Grind the radish!)

1659
01:02:07,337 --> 01:02:09,647
(Yo Han is in charge of grinding the radish.)

1660
01:02:09,907 --> 01:02:12,277
- Peel this.
- Do you have a knife?

1661
01:02:12,477 --> 01:02:13,877
Is this knife too big?

1662
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:16,616
You don't cut the scallion, do you?

1663
01:02:16,617 --> 01:02:17,886
We have to.

1664
01:02:17,887 --> 01:02:19,316
- I'll cut it, then.
- Okay.

1665
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:20,317
(Si A is in charge of cutting the scallion.)

1666
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:23,026
What else, madam? I'm free to take on a task.

1667
01:02:23,027 --> 01:02:25,327
- Are you?
- Yes. What should I do?

1668
01:02:25,757 --> 01:02:27,866
- There's the scissors. Cut that.
- Okay.

1669
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:29,696
- This is chili powder.
- Okay.

1670
01:02:29,697 --> 01:02:32,367
(Madam's smooth command)

1671
01:02:32,897 --> 01:02:35,407
(Leaf mustard master is watching you.)

1672
01:02:35,507 --> 01:02:37,166
(Cutting)

1673
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:39,507
(Showing off their cooking skills they've learned so far)

1674
01:02:40,077 --> 01:02:41,606
(This is...)

1675
01:02:41,607 --> 01:02:43,077
(a piece of cake.)

1676
01:02:43,777 --> 01:02:45,777
(Working very fast)

1677
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:48,116
- Done.
- Here you go.

1678
01:02:48,117 --> 01:02:49,593
(They finish preparing the ingredients.)

1679
01:02:49,617 --> 01:02:52,657
First, we need to make the sauce. Pass me that.

1680
01:02:52,857 --> 01:02:53,857
Grind this.

1681
01:02:53,858 --> 01:02:55,257
(How much do I need?)

1682
01:02:55,727 --> 01:02:56,757
Grind all of that.

1683
01:02:57,427 --> 01:02:58,957
This is minced garlic.

1684
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:00,327
This is ginger.

1685
01:03:00,627 --> 01:03:02,626
- Also ground.
- It's ground ginger.

1686
01:03:02,627 --> 01:03:04,296
(There's no need to measure.)

1687
01:03:04,297 --> 01:03:05,297
That one.

1688
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:07,067
(As expected of an expert.)

1689
01:03:07,237 --> 01:03:08,536
Scallions.

1690
01:03:08,537 --> 01:03:09,666
(Recipe 1: Add cut scallions and minced garlic and ginger, )

1691
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:10,936
(and then add glutinous rice paste for fast fermentation.)

1692
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:12,976
- Glutinous rice paste.
- You use glutinous rice.

1693
01:03:12,977 --> 01:03:13,977
Yes.

1694
01:03:14,347 --> 01:03:15,976
- Do I put the whole thing in?
- Yes, the whole thing.

1695
01:03:15,977 --> 01:03:17,177
(Just put the whole thing in.)

1696
01:03:17,817 --> 01:03:19,076
(Recipe 2: Add chili powder, plum concentrate, and fish sauce.)

1697
01:03:19,077 --> 01:03:20,946
- Plum concentrate.
- I love it.

1698
01:03:20,947 --> 01:03:22,787
- Fish sauce.
- Fish sauce.

1699
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:26,187
I add ground radish to make leaf mustard kimchi.

1700
01:03:26,487 --> 01:03:29,087
I don't use a machine to grind it to keep the refreshing flavor.

1701
01:03:29,827 --> 01:03:32,356
Last time, they only added pear,

1702
01:03:32,357 --> 01:03:34,727
but it tastes better with both pear and radish.

1703
01:03:36,327 --> 01:03:39,537
(Recipe 3: Add ground pear and radish and mix them.)

1704
01:03:39,597 --> 01:03:41,566
- It looks good.
- This is really delicious.

1705
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,213
(Spicy leaf mustard kimchi sauce is ready.)

1706
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,076
Did you learn how to make leaf mustard kimchi...

1707
01:03:45,077 --> 01:03:46,907
from your mother-in-law?

1708
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:48,976
No. I just came up with it.

1709
01:03:48,977 --> 01:03:53,017
My mother-in-law's generation didn't cook much using leaf mustard.

1710
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:54,486
They didn't use leaf mustard as an ingredient.

1711
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:56,986
So you tried it yourself and found out...

1712
01:03:56,987 --> 01:03:58,957
- what worked well with what.
- That's right.

1713
01:03:59,117 --> 01:04:01,386
I grew the ingredients myself. Chili too.

1714
01:04:01,387 --> 01:04:02,387
- Chili too?
- Chili too?

1715
01:04:02,388 --> 01:04:04,897
Chili, garlic, and ginger. I grew them all.

1716
01:04:05,957 --> 01:04:07,926
She uses her bare hands...

1717
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:08,927
- Yes, bare hands.
- to give it her personal touch.

1718
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,097
- I don't use gloves.
- I'm sure it's different.

1719
01:04:11,537 --> 01:04:12,567
Your personal touch.

1720
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:14,807
(How good will it taste?)

1721
01:04:15,337 --> 01:04:18,637
There's nothing much. Just mix it like this.

1722
01:04:19,977 --> 01:04:22,706
We end up making kimchi in winter.

1723
01:04:22,707 --> 01:04:24,147
(Spicy leaf mustard pickled in salt)

1724
01:04:25,147 --> 01:04:26,816
I can already smell it.

1725
01:04:26,817 --> 01:04:27,817
(She applies sauce on the leaf mustard thoroughly.)

1726
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:28,947
It looks delicious.

1727
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:33,616
Leaf mustard kimchi requires a lot of effort.

1728
01:04:33,617 --> 01:04:36,627
(Dolsan's leaf mustard is covered in delicious-looking red sauce.)

1729
01:04:39,957 --> 01:04:41,717
- This is the last one.
- Okay. Put it here.

1730
01:04:41,767 --> 01:04:42,767
Okay.

1731
01:04:42,768 --> 01:04:44,226
(Park Chun Hwa's spicy leaf mustard kimchi)

1732
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:45,236
- I can eat it right away, right?
- Here.

1733
01:04:45,237 --> 01:04:46,866
Cut this with scissors.

1734
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:48,137
- Okay.
- And taste it.

1735
01:04:48,367 --> 01:04:49,936
- I'll cut it.
- It's delicious.

1736
01:04:49,937 --> 01:04:51,206
Use this.

1737
01:04:51,207 --> 01:04:52,487
- It's delicious, madam.
- Okay.

1738
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:56,706
(The American guy tries freshly made leaf mustard kimchi.)

1739
01:04:56,707 --> 01:04:58,816
I didn't use it in case anyone had an allergy.

1740
01:04:58,817 --> 01:04:59,947
- That's why...
- I see.

1741
01:05:00,617 --> 01:05:02,086
Now, it...

1742
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:04,387
- It's not too strong.
- The umami.

1743
01:05:05,087 --> 01:05:06,617
I'm craving rice.

1744
01:05:07,087 --> 01:05:08,827
(It's nice to see you eat well.)

1745
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:12,256
The flavor was so unique.

1746
01:05:12,257 --> 01:05:13,727
I've never had kimchi like that.

1747
01:05:14,197 --> 01:05:17,566
I also realized there were two flavors in there.

1748
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:20,136
The leaf part at the end had one kind of flavor.

1749
01:05:20,137 --> 01:05:23,607
And the other, the stem, had a different flavor.

1750
01:05:23,907 --> 01:05:26,937
It's really fun to eat it. When you have it,

1751
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:29,446
it starts with one flavor, and it...

1752
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:32,277
evolves into a different flavor when you finish eating it.

1753
01:05:33,717 --> 01:05:36,417
Aged kimchi is old cabbage kimchi.

1754
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:39,186
- Is there aged kimchi for this?
- There is.

1755
01:05:39,187 --> 01:05:41,586
You can age leaf mustard kimchi too, right?

1756
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:42,587
- Yes.
- Make it ripe.

1757
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:44,227
- It's more delicious that way.
- Right.

1758
01:05:44,427 --> 01:05:45,897
Age it a bit.

1759
01:05:46,197 --> 01:05:48,966
The older it gets, the better it tastes.

1760
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:50,727
(Leaf mustard tastes better with age.)

1761
01:05:51,097 --> 01:05:52,796
- This is dried leaf mustard, right?
- Try it.

1762
01:05:52,797 --> 01:05:54,366
- Dried leaf mustard soup.
- For the soup.

1763
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,467
How do you make it?

1764
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:59,937
- Add doenjang and mix them.
- I can't eat one by one.

1765
01:06:00,277 --> 01:06:01,507
How much doenjang?

1766
01:06:02,247 --> 01:06:03,307
Add a lot.

1767
01:06:04,677 --> 01:06:06,116
(Flustered)

1768
01:06:06,117 --> 01:06:07,746
- Half? What should I do?
- What?

1769
01:06:07,747 --> 01:06:08,747
Just half? Or...

1770
01:06:09,387 --> 01:06:10,686
(What half?)

1771
01:06:10,687 --> 01:06:13,216
There are so many people, so you can use the whole thing.

1772
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:14,356
No, we're the only ones eating.

1773
01:06:14,357 --> 01:06:15,757
- Just us?
- Yes.

1774
01:06:15,957 --> 01:06:17,526
(We're the only ones eating?)

1775
01:06:17,527 --> 01:06:18,527
What about them?

1776
01:06:18,597 --> 01:06:21,026
(Crowded)

1777
01:06:21,027 --> 01:06:22,967
(I have so many guests though!)

1778
01:06:23,427 --> 01:06:24,667
Can't they eat too?

1779
01:06:24,767 --> 01:06:26,096
Because of the filming,

1780
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:28,336
- They can eat, but...
- they can't eat now.

1781
01:06:28,337 --> 01:06:31,277
- We have to film first.
- Then make a little first.

1782
01:06:31,607 --> 01:06:34,777
- Then I'll add half first.
- Okay.

1783
01:06:35,277 --> 01:06:36,877
- Chef, would you like to do it?
- Okay.

1784
01:06:37,817 --> 01:06:39,847
(I've waited for this moment.)

1785
01:06:40,717 --> 01:06:42,677
(He learned from the seasoned vegetables master.)

1786
01:06:43,087 --> 01:06:44,917
(Roughly handling vegetables)

1787
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,116
(Seasoned vegetables...)

1788
01:06:47,117 --> 01:06:49,457
(must be mixed roughly.)

1789
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:51,757
- I'll scoop it for you.
- Okay.

1790
01:06:52,457 --> 01:06:54,096
We need the right amount of seasoning.

1791
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,897
(Adding doenjang to blanched leaf mustard)

1792
01:06:56,027 --> 01:06:57,497
Let's start with this much first.

1793
01:06:59,267 --> 01:07:02,707
(Mixing them roughly without hesitation!)

1794
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,013
(He puts one in his mouth to check the seasoning.)

1795
01:07:06,037 --> 01:07:07,406
- It's too salty.
- Is it?

1796
01:07:07,407 --> 01:07:08,577
- It's salty.
- Let me try.

1797
01:07:10,547 --> 01:07:11,816
- It's salty.
- Yes.

1798
01:07:11,817 --> 01:07:13,747
- But if you boil it with water, - Yes.

1799
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:14,887
It'll be fine.

1800
01:07:15,717 --> 01:07:17,517
(She knows how to cook!)

1801
01:07:18,017 --> 01:07:20,217
(Adding doenjang-mixed leaf mustard into boiling water)

1802
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,556
(Not leaving behind a single bit of the sauce)

1803
01:07:22,557 --> 01:07:24,526
- Yes.
- Put the big-eyed herring in.

1804
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:25,873
(Under the leaf mustard master's command...)

1805
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:27,997
(Dried big-eyed herring for refreshing soup base)

1806
01:07:28,227 --> 01:07:29,827
Chop some green chili peppers.

1807
01:07:30,697 --> 01:07:33,096
Keep boiling it to make it tasty.

1808
01:07:33,097 --> 01:07:35,067
(Facing a crisis again)

1809
01:07:36,307 --> 01:07:38,206
It must be boiled for a long time to become tasty.

1810
01:07:38,207 --> 01:07:39,536
- Okay.
- Keep boiling.

1811
01:07:39,537 --> 01:07:40,976
- Mix it. Yes.
- Okay.

1812
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:43,947
(They boil dried leaf mustard soup for a long time.)

1813
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:45,553
Did you add perilla seed powder?

1814
01:07:45,577 --> 01:07:47,147
- All? Or...
- All.

1815
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:48,987
Add everything at the end.

1816
01:07:49,087 --> 01:07:50,416
- The whole thing?
- Yes.

1817
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:51,656
- I'm shocked.
- Just a bit.

1818
01:07:51,657 --> 01:07:52,916
- Half?
- Add half.

1819
01:07:52,917 --> 01:07:54,017
(Timid)

1820
01:07:54,357 --> 01:07:55,926
(Checking the master's expression as he adds perilla seeds)

1821
01:07:55,927 --> 01:07:57,257
- More?
- Add more.

1822
01:07:58,527 --> 01:08:00,496
(Add a lot of perilla seed powder and boil it some more.)

1823
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:01,767
- Is this enough?
- Yes.

1824
01:08:03,097 --> 01:08:06,067
(Savory dried leaf mustard soup is complete.)

1825
01:08:06,937 --> 01:08:08,607
Are you going to make mulkimchi now?

1826
01:08:08,907 --> 01:08:10,937
- Mulkimchi.
- Shall we make it here?

1827
01:08:12,477 --> 01:08:15,147
(The third dish, Leaf Mustard Mulkimchi)

1828
01:08:16,647 --> 01:08:19,447
(As soon as she mentions mulkimchi, )

1829
01:08:20,717 --> 01:08:23,947
(the leaf mustard master starts scooping up something.)

1830
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:26,816
(What is that?)

1831
01:08:26,817 --> 01:08:28,457
- Pass me that.
- Okay.

1832
01:08:29,087 --> 01:08:30,357
Mulkimchi.

1833
01:08:31,027 --> 01:08:33,356
- This is mulkimchi.
- Let's see.

1834
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:34,357
(Her secret leaf mustard kimchi recipe!)

1835
01:08:34,358 --> 01:08:36,467
- Is that the sauce?
- They're green chili peppers.

1836
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:38,036
- Green chili peppers.
- They're green chili peppers.

1837
01:08:38,037 --> 01:08:40,936
I added garlic and ginger to the sauce.

1838
01:08:40,937 --> 01:08:43,577
(What is Park Chun Hwa's secret to the leaf mustard kimchi sauce?)

1839
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,706
(Leaf mustard mulkimchi sauce recipe 1:)

1840
01:08:45,707 --> 01:08:49,347
(Grind radish, pear, and green chili peppers in a blender.)

1841
01:08:55,187 --> 01:08:56,446
(Leaf mustard mulkimchi sauce recipe 2:)

1842
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,856
(To the mixture, add minced garlic, )

1843
01:08:58,857 --> 01:09:01,257
(minced ginger, salt, and glutinous rice paste.)

1844
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:05,396
(Mix everything well together to complete...)

1845
01:09:05,397 --> 01:09:08,497
(the refreshing and clean sauce for leaf mustard mulkimchi.)

1846
01:09:09,397 --> 01:09:10,426
- Now what?
- What?

1847
01:09:10,427 --> 01:09:11,436
Do we add water to this?

1848
01:09:11,437 --> 01:09:13,997
Yes. Add water to taste.

1849
01:09:14,267 --> 01:09:15,607
That's how you make mulkimchi.

1850
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:18,236
Gosh.

1851
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,283
(She leaves casually after telling them how to make it.)

1852
01:09:20,307 --> 01:09:22,427
(For something like this, I can do it all by myself.)

1853
01:09:22,777 --> 01:09:25,076
(He mixes it thoroughly...)

1854
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,347
(so that the leaf mustard absorbs the sauce well.)

1855
01:09:28,787 --> 01:09:32,887
(Then he adds a moderate amount of water.)

1856
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:40,127
(After giving it a good stir to mix the sauce and water well, )

1857
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:42,326
Mulkimchi is ready.

1858
01:09:42,327 --> 01:09:44,196
(the refreshing and clean-tasting leaf mustard mulkimchi is done.)

1859
01:09:44,197 --> 01:09:45,596
- Shouldn't I mix it more?
- Yes.

1860
01:09:45,597 --> 01:09:46,936
(Where did the lady go when the leaf mustard mulkimchi's ready?)

1861
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:49,507
It's the perfect hangover cure in the morning. It's the best.

1862
01:09:50,237 --> 01:09:53,107
(She is busy in the kitchen all by herself.)

1863
01:09:53,307 --> 01:09:54,376
(Done, done, done)

1864
01:09:54,377 --> 01:09:57,607
(Currently, there are 3 more dishes to make.)

1865
01:09:58,177 --> 01:10:00,857
(Because she wants to show them all kinds of leaf mustard dishes, )

1866
01:10:01,387 --> 01:10:03,246
(she has turned on...)

1867
01:10:03,247 --> 01:10:05,717
(the leaf mustard master's cooking booster.)

1868
01:10:07,057 --> 01:10:10,857
(Anchovy sauce, garlic, sesame oil)

1869
01:10:11,627 --> 01:10:13,426
(With just 3 ingredients, )

1870
01:10:13,427 --> 01:10:15,427
(the flavorful seasoned leaf mustard is complete.)

1871
01:10:16,197 --> 01:10:18,537
(Let's quickly move on to the next dish.)

1872
01:10:19,197 --> 01:10:21,367
(To the well-boiled back ribs, )

1873
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:26,737
(she adds the well-aged leaf mustard kimchi.)

1874
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:30,007
(Reducing the sourness by adding sugar)

1875
01:10:31,547 --> 01:10:32,976
(A rare delicacy you can't taste elsewhere, )

1876
01:10:32,977 --> 01:10:34,977
(spicy braised back ribs with leaf mustard kimchi)

1877
01:10:38,517 --> 01:10:40,787
(Done)

1878
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:44,287
(Should I go and make the last dish now?)

1879
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:48,027
You have to make batter to make buchimgae.

1880
01:10:48,267 --> 01:10:50,197
We don't eat that, so we just make this one.

1881
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:52,366
- Do I spread it once on each side?
- Yes.

1882
01:10:52,367 --> 01:10:53,566
Then fry it.

1883
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:55,007
(Put the batter roughly and fry it.)

1884
01:10:56,037 --> 01:10:57,706
- Okay.
- Can I get a plate for that?

1885
01:10:57,707 --> 01:10:59,537
- Is that enough batter?
- Yes.

1886
01:11:00,107 --> 01:11:01,906
- Is it like perilla leaf buchimgae?
- Yes.

1887
01:11:01,907 --> 01:11:03,747
(Put a thin layer of the batter on each side.)

1888
01:11:04,577 --> 01:11:05,617
- Just one?
- Yes.

1889
01:11:06,047 --> 01:11:07,116
Here we go.

1890
01:11:07,117 --> 01:11:09,016
Bring it closer to the other side.

1891
01:11:09,017 --> 01:11:12,257
(After frying it over medium heat in a pretty shape, )

1892
01:11:13,987 --> 01:11:16,327
(the golden leaf mustard buchimgae is complete.)

1893
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:18,056
It's done. I've already flipped it.

1894
01:11:18,057 --> 01:11:19,057
(Eddie is satisfied.)

1895
01:11:19,757 --> 01:11:20,856
(Si A and Eddie, the good students, work in sync.)

1896
01:11:20,857 --> 01:11:22,027
- Is it done?
- One more?

1897
01:11:22,297 --> 01:11:24,937
Yes. But let's do it right. Just one.

1898
01:11:25,837 --> 01:11:26,866
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1899
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:28,236
(Jung Nam and Yo Han try making leaf mustard buchimgae too.)

1900
01:11:28,237 --> 01:11:29,837
We have seasoned leaf mustard too.

1901
01:11:35,447 --> 01:11:37,307
Lower the heat. The heat is too strong.

1902
01:11:37,947 --> 01:11:40,447
(The heat isn't too strong, though.)

1903
01:11:40,577 --> 01:11:41,917
Jung Nam, try this buchimgae.

1904
01:11:42,747 --> 01:11:44,147
- How is it?
- Hurry up.

1905
01:11:45,187 --> 01:11:47,256
(I'm happy when you get angry.)

1906
01:11:47,257 --> 01:11:49,227
Should we make a big one at once?

1907
01:11:49,327 --> 01:11:50,857
- Sure.
- By putting them together?

1908
01:11:51,257 --> 01:11:53,226
- Hey. Can't we pour...
- We'll make a round one.

1909
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:54,597
The remaining batter into this?

1910
01:11:55,197 --> 01:11:56,227
- Like this?
- Yes.

1911
01:11:57,027 --> 01:11:58,397
Pour it over the empty spots.

1912
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:01,167
That's it. Make it round.

1913
01:12:03,107 --> 01:12:04,107
(This is how a man makes his buchimgae.)

1914
01:12:04,108 --> 01:12:06,007
We're almost done.

1915
01:12:07,437 --> 01:12:08,576
- It's hot.
- Yes.

1916
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:09,806
(Smoking suspiciously)

1917
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:11,146
Gosh. Where's the spatula?

1918
01:12:11,147 --> 01:12:13,116
Should we set the table here?

1919
01:12:13,117 --> 01:12:14,117
I think so.

1920
01:12:15,017 --> 01:12:16,017
It's burning.

1921
01:12:18,787 --> 01:12:20,717
(Flipping it desperately with his whole body)

1922
01:12:21,257 --> 01:12:23,126
You should slow down. Yes.

1923
01:12:23,127 --> 01:12:24,127
(It's burnt.)

1924
01:12:26,127 --> 01:12:27,456
Are you doing all right? Right now...

1925
01:12:27,457 --> 01:12:28,626
(The master is here.)

1926
01:12:28,627 --> 01:12:29,967
That's too burnt.

1927
01:12:30,127 --> 01:12:31,836
He should eat the burnt one.

1928
01:12:31,837 --> 01:12:33,597
- I'll have it. I like burnt ones.
- Do you?

1929
01:12:34,597 --> 01:12:36,066
Please put it here.

1930
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:37,387
(I wish I had flipped it sooner.)

1931
01:12:37,707 --> 01:12:38,836
(With Jung Nam's leaf mustard buchimgae as the last dish, )

1932
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:40,276
- Here, Jung Nam.
- Gosh.

1933
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:41,277
(the generous full-course meal with leaf mustard is complete.)

1934
01:12:41,278 --> 01:12:42,707
- Here.
- Kimchi.

1935
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:48,077
(A meal made with Park Chun Hwa)

1936
01:12:57,527 --> 01:12:58,997
Gosh. It looks amazing.

1937
01:12:59,897 --> 01:13:01,256
- It looks fantastic.
- Thanks for the food.

1938
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:02,727
- Thanks for the food.
- Yes.

1939
01:13:03,027 --> 01:13:04,966
- Thanks for the food, ma'am.
- Thanks for the food.

1940
01:13:04,967 --> 01:13:06,437
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1941
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:07,966
- Leaf mustard kimchi.
- It's a meal filled...

1942
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,307
with leaf mustard.

1943
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:11,907
How many leaf mustard dishes do we have right now?

1944
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:15,706
Leaf mustard buchimgae, mulkimchi, leaf mustard kimchi,

1945
01:13:15,707 --> 01:13:17,376
seasoned leaf mustard she made today,

1946
01:13:17,377 --> 01:13:19,053
- How many are they?
- and dried leaf mustard soup.

1947
01:13:19,077 --> 01:13:20,446
Gosh. There are so many leaf mustard dishes.

1948
01:13:20,447 --> 01:13:22,516
- I'll ladle it and serve it.
- Okay.

1949
01:13:22,517 --> 01:13:23,746
Gosh. It's the braised back ribs.

1950
01:13:23,747 --> 01:13:26,307
- Do you want a small amount?
- Yes. Just a little. That's good.

1951
01:13:26,357 --> 01:13:28,063
- Gosh.
- The leaf mustard kimchi is tasty.

1952
01:13:28,087 --> 01:13:30,826
- What is that? Is that pork?
- They are pork ribs.

1953
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:32,333
- Yes. They are pork back ribs.
- I see.

1954
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:33,677
- Okay.
- You can leave it there.

1955
01:13:34,097 --> 01:13:35,796
(A fresh combination of leaf mustard kimchi and back ribs, )

1956
01:13:35,797 --> 01:13:37,557
(braised back ribs with leaf mustard kimchi)

1957
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:40,836
(Eddie tries the back rib first.)

1958
01:13:40,837 --> 01:13:41,837
It's okay.

1959
01:13:44,607 --> 01:13:45,677
(Savoring)

1960
01:13:46,437 --> 01:13:48,076
(A Sung sips the soup first.)

1961
01:13:48,077 --> 01:13:49,107
(Savoring)

1962
01:13:50,477 --> 01:13:51,746
(Meat, broth, and kimchi)

1963
01:13:51,747 --> 01:13:52,776
(One can enjoy what they like...)

1964
01:13:52,777 --> 01:13:54,937
(with the braised back ribs with leaf mustard kimchi.)

1965
01:13:54,987 --> 01:13:57,016
I've never thought of making kimchi stew...

1966
01:13:57,017 --> 01:13:59,017
with leaf mustard kimchi.

1967
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:00,417
It's so tasty.

1968
01:14:01,117 --> 01:14:02,156
- It's just...
- It's better...

1969
01:14:02,157 --> 01:14:03,317
than the regular kimchi stew.

1970
01:14:04,627 --> 01:14:07,597
- Can I take another piece?
- Yes, go ahead.

1971
01:14:07,657 --> 01:14:09,067
- It's so tasty.
- Yes.

1972
01:14:09,497 --> 01:14:11,497
It's better than the one...

1973
01:14:11,597 --> 01:14:13,096
- that uses napa cabbage kimchi.
- This is much better.

1974
01:14:13,097 --> 01:14:14,097
It's so interesting.

1975
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:19,837
It was delicious. In fact, back ribs and kimchi...

1976
01:14:19,977 --> 01:14:21,846
are the best combination.

1977
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:24,007
So, it was guaranteed to be tasty.

1978
01:14:24,277 --> 01:14:26,577
The refreshing leaf mustard had a tang,

1979
01:14:26,677 --> 01:14:28,286
which complemented the back ribs.

1980
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:31,187
It was so refreshing that I could keep eating it.

1981
01:14:40,027 --> 01:14:42,097
- Jung Nam, does it taste good?
- It tastes good.

1982
01:14:42,197 --> 01:14:43,827
- Eat a lot.
- I'm happy.

1983
01:14:46,737 --> 01:14:48,337
(Staring)

1984
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:53,377
- It's good, right?
- They're watching us eating.

1985
01:14:54,037 --> 01:14:55,046
(Touched, heartwarming, moved)

1986
01:14:55,047 --> 01:14:56,406
(She feels sorry for the staff who are shooting.)

1987
01:14:56,407 --> 01:14:58,746
There is no one here. Who do you keep looking at?

1988
01:14:58,747 --> 01:14:59,776
There is no one here.

1989
01:14:59,777 --> 01:15:01,717
(I'm kidding.)

1990
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,647
- Mulkimchi.
- Try leaf mustard kimchi.

1991
01:15:08,527 --> 01:15:10,126
(Crunchy freshly-made leaf mustard kimchi...)

1992
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:11,887
(with an amazing and addictive tangy flavor)

1993
01:15:19,867 --> 01:15:22,666
Leaf mustard kimchi I'd had before wasn't a real leaf mustard kimchi.

1994
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:24,467
I only had the ones sold in the supermarkets.

1995
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:28,077
It tasted better because she made it with the leaf mustard I harvested.

1996
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:30,377
Is this leaf mustard?

1997
01:15:31,247 --> 01:15:32,247
(Savoring)

1998
01:15:32,248 --> 01:15:34,177
Gosh. Leaf mustard kimchi is so tasty.

1999
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:38,357
It's spicy, isn't it?

2000
01:15:39,357 --> 01:15:40,756
- It has a tang.
- Yes.

2001
01:15:40,757 --> 01:15:42,587
It's deliciously spicy.

2002
01:15:43,057 --> 01:15:44,726
The spiciness doesn't come from the chili powder.

2003
01:15:44,727 --> 01:15:46,857
The leaf mustard itself has that tang. That's it.

2004
01:15:47,157 --> 01:15:48,696
I love the scent of the leaf mustard.

2005
01:15:48,697 --> 01:15:49,697
You should take some.

2006
01:15:50,997 --> 01:15:53,936
It isn't healthy for me to eat salty food.

2007
01:15:53,937 --> 01:15:57,337
- No.
- So my kimchi is less salty.

2008
01:15:58,777 --> 01:16:00,457
- Compared to other houses' kimchi?
- Yes.

2009
01:16:01,007 --> 01:16:02,306
It's delicious, though.

2010
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:03,776
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

2011
01:16:03,777 --> 01:16:07,117
I thought I knew all about kimchi as a Korean.

2012
01:16:07,447 --> 01:16:10,486
But I didn't know such a kind of rich kimchi...

2013
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,516
- were hiding in Yeosu.
- This kimchi is amazing.

2014
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:14,157
I think I'll buy it a lot from now on.

2015
01:16:14,387 --> 01:16:15,956
When you go back to Seoul,

2016
01:16:15,957 --> 01:16:18,127
promote Dolsan's leaf mustard from Yeosu aggressviely.

2017
01:16:18,797 --> 01:16:20,326
(I'll definitely do that.)

2018
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:21,887
- It's really good.
- Have more kimchi.

2019
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,697
I enjoyed it very much.

2020
01:16:25,197 --> 01:16:27,637
I loved all dishes made with leaf mustard.

2021
01:16:29,107 --> 01:16:31,236
(Everyone fell in love with Dolsan's leaf mustard.)

2022
01:16:31,237 --> 01:16:32,477
It's so good.

2023
01:16:32,677 --> 01:16:34,677
The mulkimchi is really tasty.

2024
01:16:35,607 --> 01:16:37,377
(Have you heard of leaf mustard mulkimchi?)

2025
01:16:40,147 --> 01:16:41,147
(Amazed)

2026
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:45,386
That's why people say that leaf mustard can clear...

2027
01:16:45,387 --> 01:16:47,457
- a clogged hole.
- You should try this. It's good.

2028
01:16:47,757 --> 01:16:49,186
(A Sung tries a sip too.)

2029
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:50,187
(Savoring)

2030
01:16:51,557 --> 01:16:54,827
When leaf mustard kimchi is added to dongchimi broth,

2031
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:56,996
it's twice as refreshing.

2032
01:16:56,997 --> 01:16:58,967
I added the minced radish to make it refreshing.

2033
01:16:59,497 --> 01:17:00,566
It's really refreshing.

2034
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:02,183
How long do we have to wait before eating this?

2035
01:17:02,207 --> 01:17:03,936
If you weren't to have it right away,

2036
01:17:03,937 --> 01:17:06,077
you should keep it outside for about three days.

2037
01:17:06,177 --> 01:17:07,806
- For 3 days.
- For 3 days.

2038
01:17:07,807 --> 01:17:09,477
And we...

2039
01:17:09,777 --> 01:17:12,447
Gosh. I love them all.

2040
01:17:12,677 --> 01:17:14,977
- But this mulkimchi is the best.
- Yes.

2041
01:17:15,247 --> 01:17:16,247
- Yes.
- I see.

2042
01:17:17,847 --> 01:17:20,657
The mulkimchi was so delicious.

2043
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:23,587
I understand why Koreans say something is "refreshing."

2044
01:17:24,257 --> 01:17:28,026
And that to me was so... It had that exact flavors.

2045
01:17:28,027 --> 01:17:30,227
I could drink the whole thing.

2046
01:17:30,327 --> 01:17:33,397
It was just so fresh, light,

2047
01:17:33,497 --> 01:17:34,837
and refreshing.

2048
01:17:35,137 --> 01:17:37,706
So, when I drank it, I just...

2049
01:17:37,707 --> 01:17:40,407
immediately understood the expression, "refreshing."

2050
01:17:43,147 --> 01:17:44,587
Why aren't you eating the buchimgae?

2051
01:17:45,617 --> 01:17:47,716
I think this buchimgae is good too.

2052
01:17:47,717 --> 01:17:49,437
(A hidden delicacy, leaf mustard buchimgae)

2053
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:53,616
It's good.

2054
01:17:53,617 --> 01:17:55,157
- Yes.
- Ma'am, I...

2055
01:17:59,527 --> 01:18:00,527
Did you make it?

2056
01:18:00,528 --> 01:18:02,267
(Let's see if they made it well.)

2057
01:18:02,797 --> 01:18:04,526
You made the buchimgae well. It's very tasty.

2058
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:06,337
Right? It's tasty and flavorful.

2059
01:18:06,637 --> 01:18:07,877
It has such a nice scent to it.

2060
01:18:12,837 --> 01:18:14,507
It was very flavorful and light.

2061
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,047
Since it was a bit bitter,

2062
01:18:16,547 --> 01:18:18,307
I could eat it without getting sick of it.

2063
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:20,767
I thought it was more refreshing than green onion pancakes.

2064
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:26,387
This time in Yeosu, we had a course meal...

2065
01:18:27,087 --> 01:18:28,586
that incorporated leaf mustard.

2066
01:18:28,587 --> 01:18:31,997
(A course meal with leaf mustard you can't find elsewhere)

2067
01:18:33,127 --> 01:18:35,696
I only knew about leaf mustard kimchi.

2068
01:18:35,697 --> 01:18:37,966
But after seeing her making various dishes...

2069
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:39,567
using the leaf mustard,

2070
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:44,906
I realized it was an ingredient that could be used many ways.

2071
01:18:44,907 --> 01:18:46,307
That was what I thought.

2072
01:18:47,777 --> 01:18:50,457
(Here's 1 person who also learned how great leaf mustard could be.)

2073
01:18:51,007 --> 01:18:52,417
- It's very simple.
- Yes.

2074
01:18:52,677 --> 01:18:54,276
- But it's tasty.
- Yes.

2075
01:18:54,277 --> 01:18:55,287
Right.

2076
01:18:56,017 --> 01:18:58,116
(Taking another piece since it's tasty)

2077
01:18:58,117 --> 01:18:59,463
The leaf mustard kimchi is amazing.

2078
01:18:59,487 --> 01:19:00,487
(Laughing)

2079
01:19:01,057 --> 01:19:02,586
(What are you looking at?)

2080
01:19:02,587 --> 01:19:06,497
- Ever since he came to Yeosu, - I'm hungry.

2081
01:19:06,857 --> 01:19:08,297
He's been having a strong appetite.

2082
01:19:08,597 --> 01:19:12,467
He always finishes a bowl of rice whenever he eats in Yeosu.

2083
01:19:12,937 --> 01:19:14,066
I didn't say anything.

2084
01:19:14,067 --> 01:19:15,166
I know, but you were looking at me.

2085
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,166
- I didn't say anything.
- I'll have one bowl of rice only.

2086
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:18,483
- Just one bowl. That's it.
- Okay.

2087
01:19:18,507 --> 01:19:20,177
Aren't you almost done with it?

2088
01:19:22,077 --> 01:19:23,077
(I'm not going to show it to you.)

2089
01:19:23,078 --> 01:19:24,206
This is unbelievable.

2090
01:19:24,207 --> 01:19:26,477
- It's so good.
- Yes. Seriously.

2091
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:31,087
I love it.

2092
01:19:31,217 --> 01:19:33,157
Where do you live now?

2093
01:19:33,257 --> 01:19:34,986
I live in Washington, D.C.

2094
01:19:34,987 --> 01:19:36,087
- In Washington?
- Yes.

2095
01:19:37,387 --> 01:19:41,027
But I'll move to Yeosu.

2096
01:19:41,557 --> 01:19:43,897
- To Yeosu?
- He wants to move to Yeosu.

2097
01:19:43,997 --> 01:19:47,337
I've never had various kimchi like this before.

2098
01:19:47,437 --> 01:19:48,783
- Is it your first time today?
- So...

2099
01:19:48,807 --> 01:19:51,206
She has made this kimchi probably...

2100
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:53,707
more than a thousand times in her life, so...

2101
01:19:54,007 --> 01:19:57,147
she knows exactly what's in it. Because...

2102
01:19:57,707 --> 01:20:00,747
there is something magical in her hands...

2103
01:20:01,117 --> 01:20:03,417
that turns that leaf mustard into kimchi.

2104
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,657
That was the beauty of her touch in cooking.

2105
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:08,557
And eating it is very special.

2106
01:20:08,657 --> 01:20:09,897
It has a very different flavor.

2107
01:20:10,157 --> 01:20:12,896
But it also allows me to show them...

2108
01:20:12,897 --> 01:20:15,997
a different technique of how to cook this ingredient.

2109
01:20:17,527 --> 01:20:21,567
- Later, I'll teach you...
- Yes.

2110
01:20:21,937 --> 01:20:25,606
- a Western-style way to cook it.
- Okay.

2111
01:20:25,607 --> 01:20:27,676
Then you can use the remaining leaf mustard.

2112
01:20:27,677 --> 01:20:28,997
- Yes. I just need a few.
- Okay.

2113
01:20:29,547 --> 01:20:32,147
- He'll make a Western dish with it.
- Yes.

2114
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:34,616
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yes. Thank you.

2115
01:20:34,617 --> 01:20:35,716
- Thanks for the food.
- It was a good meal.

2116
01:20:35,717 --> 01:20:37,946
We enjoyed it very much.

2117
01:20:37,947 --> 01:20:39,157
Thank you. Gosh.

2118
01:20:39,207 --> 01:20:41,477
(The second cooking class that will be held in Yeosu)

2119
01:20:41,977 --> 01:20:43,893
(The main ingredient, the leaf mustard from Dolsa, Yeosu)

2120
01:20:43,917 --> 01:20:45,986
(The women work in peace.)

2121
01:20:45,987 --> 01:20:47,517
(The enemies meet again.)

2122
01:20:48,187 --> 01:20:53,357
(The skilled cooks proceed without any hiccups.)

2123
01:20:53,927 --> 01:20:57,227
(But the less skilled ones are in trouble.)

2124
01:20:57,597 --> 01:21:02,737
(They're mainly bickering rather than cooking.)

2125
01:21:02,937 --> 01:21:04,737
(Hey, Busan Guy, are you good?)

2126
01:21:04,837 --> 01:21:06,637
(Yes. I'm good.)

2127
01:21:06,837 --> 01:21:08,837
(Even nice Eddie becomes strict with them.)

2128
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,937
(Will they finish the second cooking class successfully?)

2129
01:21:12,877 --> 01:21:15,577
(The Country members are nearing the end of the journey.)

2130
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:21,717
(They alleviate their sadness with a short song.)

2131
01:21:26,657 --> 01:21:30,027
(The ending should be heartwarming, right?)

2132
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,927
(Don't even dream about it.)

2133
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:34,896
(Eddie's American way of thinking shocks the Country members.)

2134
01:21:34,897 --> 01:21:36,267
(Frustrated)

2135
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:38,097
(Dumbfounded)

2136
01:21:38,567 --> 01:21:42,237
(How will the journey end?)

2137
01:21:42,337 --> 01:21:44,406
(Gangwon, Andong, Yeosu)

2138
01:21:44,407 --> 01:21:48,007
(A 15-day food journey)

2139
01:21:48,477 --> 01:21:49,846
(After a long journey, )

2140
01:21:49,847 --> 01:21:51,677
(the Country members have become good chefs.)

2141
01:21:52,017 --> 01:21:54,517
(A course meal of 3 dishes made by 3 chefs)

2142
01:21:55,087 --> 01:22:00,827
(The train of cooking travels smoothly under Eddie's supervision.)

2143
01:22:00,927 --> 01:22:02,257
(Chef Eddie is satisfied.)

2144
01:22:02,897 --> 01:22:06,097
(The best finale to taste Gangwon, Andong, and Yeosu at once!)

2145
01:22:06,497 --> 01:22:08,967
(Do you want to know about the Country members' last meal?)

2146
