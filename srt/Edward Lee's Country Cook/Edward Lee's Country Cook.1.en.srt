00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:35,842
(I'm a bibim person.)

2
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:41,453
(His dishes were admired for his sincere storytelling.)

3
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:45,622
(The 2nd place more celebrated than the 1st place, Edward Lee)

4
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,523
(To try his food, people continue to visit his restaurant.)

5
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:53,832
(But there was no chance to taste his food in Korea.)

6
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:55,163
I'm coming.

7
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:58,532
(Thumping)

8
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:03,741
(His unpredictable...)

9
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:05,572
(country life? It's not boiling yet!)

10
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:09,142
The dishes Chef Lee cooks...

11
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,483
I'm not going to boil it.

12
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:14,512
(He's not going to boil this?)

13
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:16,111
I couldn't predict anything.

14
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:19,083
I was sure it would be a new flavor for me.

15
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:21,292
(He'll cook new dishes in the countryside.)

16
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:23,722
(No, just put it in.)

17
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:26,233
(Pouring in soy milk)

18
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:30,532
(Soy milk and makgeolli?)

19
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:33,073
(You're adding peanut butter here?)

20
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:36,972
(His ingredient selection is completely unpredictable.)

21
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:38,703
(Full of curiosity)

22
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:41,813
(Homemade doenjang and egg yolk?)

23
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:44,313
(Whatever you imagine, it's even crazier!)

24
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,052
(Jeotgal chimichurri)

25
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:49,483
(Unsure)

26
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,922
(Are his dishes delicacies or just plain weird?)

27
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:57,463
(Korean winter limited edition by Lee Kyun, not Edward)

28
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:00,462
(But grandmas can't lie.)

29
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:01,532
That's right.

30
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:03,862
If it doesn't taste good...

31
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,403
(Grandmas are the scariest judges.)

32
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:09,102
(If they scold me for making bad food, I'm going to cry.)

33
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:11,142
(Ready to cry)

34
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:13,271
Oh, the sound. I hear them.

35
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:14,412
Oh, no.

36
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,412
(Grandmas scarier than judges are here!)

37
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:18,582
(Will they like the food?)

38
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:22,012
(Edward's country cooking made with lots of care...)

39
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,222
(for the town's elders)

40
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:29,123
I'm Chef Edward Lee from the US.

41
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:33,463
(What will the elders think?)

42
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:37,631
(Very nervous)

43
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:39,903
(Is his food too unfamiliar for them to like?)

44
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,102
(His cooking story written with delicious winter ingredients)

45
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:47,773
Edward.

46
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:54,412
(It begins now.)

47
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:01,492
(Winter of 2024, CJ ENM meeting room)

48
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:02,652
Hello.

49
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:04,262
(A shy appearance)

50
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:05,721
(Actress Ko A Sung)

51
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:07,592
(The first meeting for Edward's special helpers)

52
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:09,132
- Hello.
- Oh, you're here.

53
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:10,661
- Where would you like to sit?
- Here.

54
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:11,662
Go ahead.

55
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:12,761
(Actor Byun Yo Han)

56
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,572
Weren't you filming something?

57
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:16,031
Filming?

58
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:17,701
- He really made us laugh.
- Really?

59
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:19,501
Why weren't you on any variety shows until now?

60
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:22,142
- I think it'll be fun.
- That's why I asked him to join.

61
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:23,282
Right.

62
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:25,481
I was really grateful...

63
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:29,282
and be asked to join some variety shows before.

64
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,023
But I didn't have the courage.

65
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:35,452
If I go on a variety show and show myself,

66
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:38,022
people will find out who I am.

67
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:39,893
I was worried about that.

68
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,562
I got a call.

69
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:42,883
(Then he got a call from A Sung.)

70
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,731
He asked what I thought.

71
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:47,302
I asked her for just two days.

72
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:49,031
(Preparing himself)

73
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:52,002
Then I told A Sung, "Let's just do it."

74
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:54,113
I really wanted to do it with him.

75
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,143
We got close working together.

76
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:59,512
And he's such a funny person.

77
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:02,911
(Please look forward to our bestie chemistry.)

78
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:06,892
Behind you, we put up many pictures.

79
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:07,893
I see.

80
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:09,522
(The list of travel destinations...)

81
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:11,323
(we picked after the meeting with Edward Lee)

82
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:14,362
(Gangwon Province, Andong, Yeosu)

83
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:16,031
(Each member must pick a region...)

84
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:17,701
(and be the guide...)

85
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:20,332
(for Edward Lee's country cooking.)

86
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,432
I want Yeosu.

87
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,143
Oh, you want Yeosu? Sounds good.

88
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,273
I had food I enjoyed there.

89
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:26,713
I tried skate.

90
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:28,713
(You want Eddie to try skate?)

91
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:30,511
(Didn't you say you'd show us eating raw skate?)

92
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,712
(I won't eat it.)

93
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:33,981
(Edward Lee's first-ever...)

94
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,652
(attempted to eat skate?)

95
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:38,023
- I want Andong.
- Andong? Okay.

96
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:41,222
The town feels familiar to me.

97
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,762
I'll do my research.

98
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:47,863
(A memorial service meal?)

99
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,532
(The epitome of Confucianism)

100
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,363
(Edward Lee's memorial service meal?)

101
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,473
(You must use a spoon.)

102
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:57,772
(As a bonus, he get to experience living with in-laws.)

103
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:00,872
Then Si A will naturally get Gangwon Province.

104
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:01,873
Hello.

105
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:03,412
- She's here. Welcome.
- Hello.

106
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:04,512
Good work.

107
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,011
- Thank you.
- We'll get going now.

108
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:07,012
(A Sung and Yo Han are just jokesters.)

109
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:08,252
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

110
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:10,422
- Hello.
- Have you been well, Si A?

111
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:11,651
(Teasing the cute youngster)

112
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,591
- You've been busy.
- Not at all.

113
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:15,191
What should I do...

114
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,599
(Actress Shin Si A, the lead for "The Witch: Part 2")

115
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:18,622
- Relax.
- We're just getting started.

116
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:19,793
I'm suddenly...

117
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,062
- getting so nervous.
- It's okay.

118
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:23,162
- Right.
- Exactly.

119
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:24,331
(This is the first variety show of my life...)

120
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,762
(But...)

121
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,233
(she is a different person in front of food.)

122
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,873
(Si A is always up to eat.)

123
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:36,172
(Aren't you going to eat the leftovers?)

124
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:38,243
(Then it's mine!)

125
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:40,852
(Great self-awareness)

126
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:41,982
(I only know how to eat.)

127
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:44,622
(Please look forward to seeing Foodie Si A.)

128
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:45,852
(So the three Country members, )

129
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:47,628
(Yo Han, A Sung, and Si A have come together.)

130
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:49,021
Everyone must say the same,

131
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:52,192
but I really enjoyed "Culinary Class Wars,"

132
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:56,603
and I was really touched by Chef Edward Lee's story.

133
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:59,162
He's really an artist.

134
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,672
His attitude, his approach to food,

135
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:03,272
his philosophy, and everything.

136
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,002
I get to learn how to cook from a chef that I like,

137
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:08,712
eat that food, and travel?

138
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,483
I thought it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

139
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:15,682
(For the next 15 days, )

140
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:19,082
(they'll travel to find the true "taste" of the country.)

141
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:24,592
(Special ingredients only found in certain areas)

142
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:27,933
(Local ingredients to inspire Chef Lee)

143
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,962
(Local foods to inspire Chef Lee)

144
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:35,772
(You really know how to eat, Chef.)

145
00:06:36,173 --> 00:06:37,373
I love this so much.

146
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:43,283
(The personal touch to inspire Chef Lee)

147
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,081
I think that brings a whole...

148
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:52,723
different kind of perspective.

149
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:57,492
(How did you do that in such a short time?)

150
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:58,493
Oh, my gosh.

151
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,761
I've never cooked it before. I've seen it before.

152
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:02,492
But I've never cooked it before.

153
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,632
(Dishes are reborn with new inspiration.)

154
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,201
(With local ingredients, foods, and personal touches, )

155
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:08,572
(Edward Lee will recreate dishes!)

156
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,872
I have so many ideas for food, and oftentimes,

157
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:13,312
I will forget it very fast.

158
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:15,512
So if I can write down the dish,

159
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:17,113
I'll remember them.

160
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:21,813
(The recipe book that will hold his brilliant ideas)

161
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:25,682
(Eddie will write out his own special recipes.)

162
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:27,521
I keep getting many ideas,

163
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:28,591
so before I forget...

164
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:29,622
(She's like Eddie.)

165
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:30,961
I'm going to note them down.

166
00:07:30,962 --> 00:07:33,392
I'm studying English.

167
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:36,392
I'm doing cooking practice today.

168
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,103
I can't believe I made this.

169
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:40,772
I thought it might be cold, so I'm packing scarves.

170
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:44,103
The Yeosu area is famous for jeotgal.

171
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:46,442
Thank you for making things comfortable for me.

172
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,113
I'm done packing.

173
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:51,841

174
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:53,402

(Incheon International Airport)

176
00:07:56,822 --> 00:08:00,053
(The day Edward Lee will arrive in Korea)

177
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:07,192
(Yo Han?)

178
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,063
(Now that I get to meet Kyun, I can die happily.)

179
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,233
(No way. It's Byun Yo Han!)

180
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:16,673
(Yo Han is only waiting for Edward Lee.)

181
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:19,201
- Okay.
- Okay.

182
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:20,673
- Hello.
- Hello.

183
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:23,112
It's so nice to meet you.

184
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:24,613
You're so handsome.

185
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:26,382
Like you?

186
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:28,651
(Full of cuteness)

187
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:29,652
Love.

188
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:30,821
(From the first meeting, the two are very friendly.)

189
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:32,782
Isn't "Chef" too formal?

190
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,922
What should I call you?

191
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:35,952
What do you...

192
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:39,493
Lee Kyun?

193
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:43,192
It's too rude. It's too impolite.

194
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:45,303
This is Korea.

195
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,632
(What would be good?)

196
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:49,973
How about Kyun?

197
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,102
- I can be your older brother.
- Yes, my brother, Kyun.

198
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:54,942
Kyun is so good.

199
00:08:55,712 --> 00:08:57,043
- Okay.
- Yes.

200
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,282
Okay.

201
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,481
(After their happy first meeting)

202
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:01,782
When is Chef Lee coming to Korea?

203
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:02,851
- On the 17th.
- On the 17th.

204
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:03,852
- The 17th?
- Yes.

205
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:06,081
When his plane lands,

206
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:08,029
- I should be there to greet him.
- Yes, welcoming him...

207
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:10,292
That feels so different.

208
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:12,122
- I know how that feels.
- Right.

209
00:09:13,862 --> 00:09:15,961
(That's how Yo Han's surprise for Kyun came to be.)

210
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:18,032
I'm so excited to meet him.

211
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,632
(Welcome to Korea, Kyun.)

212
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:20,772
The day has now come.

213
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,813
(Yo Han has been desperately waiting for this day.)

214
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,142
(The plane with Kyun has landed!)

215
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:25,173
(Here.)

216
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:27,813
(Excited, nervous)

217
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:30,242
(The passengers start to come out.)

218
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:32,112
(Where is my brother?)

219
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:34,753
(Right then, )

220
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:41,352
(Kyun finally appeared!)

221
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:43,721
(So happy)

222
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:44,722
Kyun.

223
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,992
Kyun! Edward Lee!

224
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:48,633
Here I am.

225
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,361
(Yo Han?)

226
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:53,673
(Joy to the world. Kyun has come.)

227
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:55,732
Hi.

228
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:57,841
Welcome back to Korea.

229
00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:59,202
(Welcome back to Korea, Lee Kyun.)

230
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:01,572
Hey.

231
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:03,413
How are you?

232
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:05,912
- You came all the way here?
- Welcome.

233
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:06,951
Thank you.

234
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:08,512
- This is my daughter, Arden.
- Nice to meet you.

235
00:10:08,513 --> 00:10:09,611
I know you.

236
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:11,152
(Arden: Edward Lee's daughter)

237
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,882
(This is my daughter, Arden.)

238
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:14,092
This is my wife, Dianne.

239
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:15,153
- Say hello.
- Nice to meet you.

240
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:16,153
- Hi.
- How are you?

241
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:17,163
- How are you?
- Okay.

242
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:18,991
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

243
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:20,532
First, this is for you.

244
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,162
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh. Handsome.

245
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,563
"Now that I..."

246
00:10:23,702 --> 00:10:25,962
"get to meet Kyun,"

247
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:27,872
"I can die happily."

248
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:29,533
Who's more handsome?

249
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:31,772
Which one's more handsome?

250
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:33,071
(Thinking about it)

251
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:34,841
- I guess, this one.
- This one?

252
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,471
Yes, good answer.

253
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:37,913
Good answer. Okay.

254
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:41,013
- Let's head out.
- This is a big welcome.

255
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:42,553
There's a lot of people.

256
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:44,752
- For you.
- Oh, no.

257
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:45,753
Really.

258
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:47,668
(The surprise welcome for Kyun was a huge success.)

259
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,652
This is the car. Right.

260
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:50,923
(Shall we get going?)

261
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:53,932
(Yo Han's mission)

262
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,803
(Get Kyun and his family safely to their lodging!)

263
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,202
(Are you a good driver?)

264
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,941
Hold on. What is...

265
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,112
(What?)

266
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:10,082
(Is this what I do?)

267
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:12,683
- Hold on.
- He doesn't know how to drive.

268
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:14,612
(Laughing)

269
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:16,682
Please trust me.

270
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,122
(Hurt)

271
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,553
Let's go. Here we go.

272
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:23,862
(We're really taking off now.)

273
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,763
(They arrived at the toll both in a heartbeat.)

274
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:35,403
Could you do this for me?

275
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,643
- You're so handsome.
- Oh, thank you.

276
00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:39,971
This is my brother, Edward Lee.

277
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:41,012
- What?
- My brother.

278
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,712
- Oh, my!
- Yes.

279
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:44,842
- Aren't you that chef?
- That's right.

280
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:46,712
- Is he your real brother?
- Yes.

281
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:48,782
- Yes.
- He's not, right?

282
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:49,783
My brother, Kyun.

283
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:52,683
(It's day 1 for the Kyun and Yo Han brothers.)

284
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:54,851
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

285
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:55,892
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

286
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:57,292
- Thank you.
- Be happy.

287
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:58,322
Merry Christmas.

288
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:03,832
(The Country Family is off to a good start!)

289
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:07,372
We'll go everywhere in this car.

290
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:09,033
Sounds nice.

291
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:11,003
I also drive a Cadillac at home.

292
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:12,471
- This one.
- Really?

293
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:14,773
This is really destiny.

294
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:17,142
I also drive a Cadillac.

295
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:18,182
(A true fan always looks for things in common with their star.)

296
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:20,912
- We're the same. This is destiny.
- Oh, right.

297
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:22,982
(Kyun and I were destined to meet.)

298
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:25,553
You're really good at Korean.

299
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,091
When I drink beer...

300
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,399
- You're even better, right?
- I'm even better.

301
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:29,893
- I become more fluent.
- I...

302
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:31,563
- When I drink beer...
- Yes.

303
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:33,462
I become so good at English.

304
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,433
(Laughing)

305
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:36,763
I seriously keep...

306
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,302
speaking in English.

307
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:41,143
(Unable to confirm, I can really talk freely.)

308
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:43,232
(He's cute.)

309
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:44,672
Arden.

310
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:48,612
What is your favorite dish cooked by Daddy?

311
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:50,741
(There are so many.)

312
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:53,242
I really like his black bean noodles.

313
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:55,152
- Jjajangmyeon. Yes.
- Jjajangmyeon?

314
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:59,023
It's her favorite. Jjajangmyeon and japchae.

315
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:00,492
You like grandma's japchae.

316
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:02,322
Grandma's japchae.

317
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:07,692
(The reason Edward came to Korea with Arden)

318
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:09,793
I love food, you know.

319
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:12,133
My daughter doesn't know Korea.

320
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:14,772
This is part of your heritage.

321
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,571
This is part of your identity. It's Korea.

322
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:18,979
(I want to teach Arden about Korea.)

323
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:20,003
(But)

324
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:21,013
(Please just try one.)

325
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:22,643
(Just once!)

326
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:23,643
(Turning him down)

327
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:26,012
(He wants to show Arden true Korean food.)

328
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,253
(It's not easy.)

329
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:30,183
(Arden will join briefly during their trip!)

330
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:31,951
(Eating)

331
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:33,351
(Biting)

332
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:34,893
(Tasting)

333
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:40,893
(She will get a true taste of Korea with Dad.)

334
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:45,533
(Look forward to seeing Arden on the trip!)

335
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,643
(Eddie's lodging near Hongik University)

336
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:57,081
Does anyone want to play Twister?

337
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:59,242
(Edward's family is resting before the trip.)

338
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:00,913
Does anyone want to play Twister?

339
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:05,522
Do it. You can dance.

340
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:07,591
You can do a twist. Do the twist.

341
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:08,592
Oh, my gosh.

342
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,873
(Feeling mischievous, she pulls a prank on her dad.)

343
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:14,932
(Playful)

344
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:15,961
(Doorbell ringing)

345
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:19,063
(At that moment, someone visits Eddie's place.)

346
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:22,372
(Who is it?)

347
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:24,673
(I'm coming.)

348
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:29,111
(The guests are...)

349
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:30,382
(the three Country Family members.)

350
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:32,142
- Hello.
- Hi.

351
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:33,783
- Welcome.
- How are you?

352
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,913
- Come on in.
- Hi.

353
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:37,782
Welcome to my home.

354
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:39,052
Thank you.

355
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,591
Did you get some rest?

356
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:41,653
Yes.

357
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:44,762
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

358
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:45,922
Nice to meet you.

359
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,892
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Edward Lee.

360
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,639
- Edward Lee. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

361
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:53,163
I was really nervous when I first met Edward.

362
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:56,732
He was the chef I rooted for the most.

363
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:00,442
Honestly, after watching "Culinary Class Wars,"

364
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,611
I've most wanted to try...

365
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:05,111
Chef Lee's food.

366
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,153
But I couldn't try his food in Korea.

367
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:11,622
I thought I could finally try his cooking.

368
00:15:12,283 --> 00:15:14,121
- Edward Lee. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

369
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,293
- They're my family.
- Hi.

370
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:17,461
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,022
- I am Si A Shin. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

372
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,331
- I'm Dianne.
- Dianne.

373
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:22,162
- Hi. It's really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

374
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:23,461
- Hi, you're Arden, right?
- Hello.

375
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:25,662
- Yes.
- I heard about you. I'm Si A Shin.

376
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:26,933
- Hello.
- Hi.

377
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:29,071
(11-year-old Arden is still feeling shy.)

378
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:30,802
I'm very happy to meet you.

379
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:32,672
- I'm very happy to meet you.
- I'm very excited.

380
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,512
Four of us finally met.

381
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:35,542
Okay.

382
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,119
(Country Family is complete for the first time.)

383
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,111
But then...

384
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,712
Do you guys cook?

385
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:43,282
- Sometimes.
- Just a bit.

386
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:44,321
Just a bit?

387
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:45,852
- I like cooking.
- Really?

388
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,491
- She's a good cook.
- Really?

389
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:48,922
I'm not a good cook, but I do like cooking.

390
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:49,952
Okay.

391
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:51,961
You need to help me when I cook.

392
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:53,792
- Of course we will.
- Yes.

393
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:56,532
- Today...
- We're not actors.

394
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,701
- We're just assistants for you.
- Assistants.

395
00:15:58,702 --> 00:16:00,701
- Yes.
- Okay? We're drivers.

396
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:03,172
Let me know if you need anything.

397
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:05,273
If you need anything, just tell us.

398
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,043
Whenever I come to Korea...

399
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:10,642
and taste some handmade food,

400
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:13,383
I can taste the food my grandma made.

401
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:15,683
That's what I'm reminded of.

402
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:17,252
I want to explore...

403
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:19,152
and learn more about the taste of handmade food.

404
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:20,451
The taste of handmade food.

405
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:23,491
That's right. As a chef,

406
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:26,392
I write down the recipe for everything.

407
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:28,263
Every time, I'll write one.

408
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,132
But Korean ladies don't write one.

409
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,201
- They don't.
- You're right.

410
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:32,362
- They just...
- They just...

411
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:34,832
We call it "eyeballing it."

412
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,731
Just eyeballing the amount...

413
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,043
- and putting in the ingredients.
- Yes.

414
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:42,441
So Korean grandmothers don't write. They just do it.

415
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:46,183
- All of them.
- But then, it tastes perfect. So...

416
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:49,183
Anyway, I want to learn all of that.

417
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:52,722
I want to become closer to Korean culture.

418
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:57,862
You know, Koreans are connected with "meals" very deeply.

419
00:16:58,122 --> 00:17:00,162
When we greet each other,

420
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:03,063
we'll say, "Are you eating well?"

421
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:06,403
When they're angry, they'll say,

422
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:09,133
"You make me lose my appetite."

423
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:12,643
- Right.
- And when they say goodbye,

424
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,471
they say, "We can grab something to eat."

425
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:16,071
Say, when you're mad, how do you say...

426
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:17,111
you make me lose my appetite?

427
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,782
How do you say it in Korean?

428
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:20,042
"You make me lose my appetite."

429
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,312
"You make me lose my appetite."

430
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:22,513
(Understood)

431
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,852
Please don't make me lose my appetite.

432
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:27,692
That won't happen.

433
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,463
We have to stay hungry.

434
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:32,992
(You're totally right.)

435
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:36,132
It's too bad that I... They told you beforehand, right?

436
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,233
I can't join you tomorrow.

437
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,062
You're not going to be there tomorrow.

438
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:42,332
I'll join you the day after tomorrow.

439
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:43,803
You're already...

440
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:47,372
You're already...

441
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,272
(The eldest member is strict.)

442
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:50,841
- I went to the airport.
- You won't be there.

443
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:52,881
I still went to the airport.

444
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:54,952
- You're so funny.
- I picked you up.

445
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:56,552
That was to make up for tomorrow.

446
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:57,882
Yes, it was.

447
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:03,793
(What kind of trip will they be having?)

448
00:18:09,063 --> 00:18:13,203
(The first day of the trip begins with dim dawn's air.)

449
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:18,142
(Sangam-dong, Seoul, 4:30am)

450
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:20,272
(The first to arrive)

451
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:21,743
- Hello.
- Hello.

452
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,841
Hello.

453
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:26,381
(The first Country member to arrive is Si A, the youngest.)

454
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:28,152
Let's put on your microphone first.

455
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,121
- You didn't sleep well, right?
- Sorry?

456
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,852
- You didn't sleep well, right?
- Yes.

457
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:36,223
I was...

458
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:38,222
Hello.

459
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:39,361
I can't look at the camera, right?

460
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:40,693
- You can.
- Can I?

461
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:41,932
Hello.

462
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,463
I ate chicken feet.

463
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:47,132
- Chicken feet?
- Yes.

464
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:48,333
Why did you have chicken feet?

465
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:51,543
I was thinking about what food I should have before coming here.

466
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:53,172
I decided on chicken feet.

467
00:18:53,703 --> 00:18:57,243
I ate it at 1am and came here energized.

468
00:18:57,783 --> 00:19:01,953
(Si A can't work on an empty stomach.)

469
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:04,253
Hello.

470
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:05,922
Hello.

471
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:07,293
That's amazing.

472
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:08,693
Is that the trailer?

473
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:10,792
It's so cute.

474
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:11,822
My gosh.

475
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:16,932
(What captured Si A's attention?)

476
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,832
(Country Family's food warehouse starts to transform.)

477
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:21,072
Goodness.

478
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:22,931
(A customized trailer for Country Cook...)

479
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:24,892
(which enables you to cook anywhere and any time)

480
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:27,342
(It has various kinds of kitchenware...)

481
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:30,112
(and many cooking utensils.)

482
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:33,611
(It will be in charge of transporting fresh ingredients...)

483
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:38,882
(throughout all their trips to find Korean handmade food.)

484
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:42,693
(Country Cook's portable ingredient storage)

485
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:44,822
Goodness.

486
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:46,693
- Is that enough?
- Yes.

487
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:48,892
It's nice.

488
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:50,963
My gosh.

489
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:53,262
I'll put this here.

490
00:19:53,263 --> 00:19:54,848
(She's brought various ingredients in her two hands.)

491
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:58,202
I'm going to pack the ingredients...

492
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:00,342
that I think are necessary.

493
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:02,213
Firstly,

494
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:03,642
this is fish sauce.

495
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:05,912
This is doenjang.

496
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:07,912
Look. This is...

497
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:10,082
young radish kimchi.

498
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:11,322
Hold on.

499
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:15,322
(Where is she going?)

500
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,391
(Here!)

501
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:19,462
Here you go.

502
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:22,132
This is the radish of young radish kimchi.

503
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:26,303
(She suddenly starts a young radish kimchi ASMR.)

504
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:27,772
(Delicious)

505
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:28,832
The texture...

506
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,842
is really crunchy.

507
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:35,072
It's so crunchy it almost feels crispy.

508
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:38,243
I can't wait to see what the chef will do...

509
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:41,282
with these ingredients to turn them into...

510
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,852
a whole new dish.

511
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,921
(She is looking forward to creating new dishes...)

512
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:50,453
(using winter ingredients, together with the handmade taste.)

513
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:52,361
It's heavy.

514
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:55,292
(A Sung has arrived too!)

515
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:57,162
(She has both hands full too.)

516
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,263
My gosh.

517
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:01,602
Hello, A Sung.

518
00:21:02,473 --> 00:21:04,371
Why did you bring so much stuff?

519
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:05,872
(It's nice to see you.)

520
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,472
I already put some of my things in.

521
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:09,871
- This is amazing.
- Yes.

522
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:11,342
- It's so cool.
- Yes.

523
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:13,312
What is this?

524
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,712
This is a coffee machine.

525
00:21:14,713 --> 00:21:16,483
The rectangular one? I see.

526
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:19,452
Here you go.

527
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:21,091
(The trailer has become a lot fuller with what they both brought.)

528
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:23,151
- This is great.
- I'll brew it for you every day.

529
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:24,222
Really?

530
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:28,733
(The real protagonist of the show arrives.)

531
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:30,193
It smells good.

532
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:32,132
Okay, thank you.

533
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,503
(Let's get going.)

534
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:38,943
(The wait for the trip is over. It's time to start!)

535
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:41,172
(Where's everyone?)

536
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:44,013
(Laughing because he's glad to see them)

537
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:47,141
(He arrives with a warm middle-aged man smile.)

538
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:48,581
Hello.

539
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,351
- Hi.
- Good morning.

540
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,851
- Good morning.
- Hello.

541
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,052
Oh, my gosh.

542
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,891
Long time no see.

543
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:56,553
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

544
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:59,263
- This is cool.
- Yes.

545
00:21:59,763 --> 00:22:01,391
Have you seen everything?

546
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:03,263
- Yes, we're doing it now.
- Yes.

547
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:04,702
(Very curious)

548
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:05,902
Oh, my gosh.

549
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:07,533
What is this?

550
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,331
- Coffee.
- It's an espresso machine...

551
00:22:09,332 --> 00:22:10,672
I brought.

552
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,942
Okay, good.

553
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:15,473
It's got everything in it.

554
00:22:16,172 --> 00:22:17,543
Is that the freezer?

555
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:18,842
A freezer?

556
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:20,243
It's a pot.

557
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:21,553
A pot.

558
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:24,322
It's obviously handmade and customized.

559
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:26,922
It was a really special thing for me.

560
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:29,122
How does this close?

561
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:32,263
(It closes automatically.)

562
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:33,661
It's automatic.

563
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:36,362
(Very shocked)

564
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:37,803
It's automatic.

565
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:40,161
(And a special signature prepared for Eddie)

566
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:41,703
"Edward Kyun Lee."

567
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:43,773
(Feeling happy)

568
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:45,303
Your face is here.

569
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:46,543
Face?

570
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:48,272
(Shining)

571
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:50,472
- You should look at this.
- No.

572
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:52,012
- I don't want to see it.
- My gosh, it's so adorable.

573
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:53,581
I'm embarrassed.

574
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,552
- It's a bit like dolhareubang...
- It looks so cute.

575
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:57,082
In Jeju Island.

576
00:22:58,223 --> 00:22:59,621
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's adorable.

577
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:01,091
When you go to Andong,

578
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:03,252
you can see something similar to this.

579
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:04,853
- The hahoe mask.
- Yes, the hahoe mask.

580
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:07,193
Oh, my gosh.

581
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:08,462
(Laughing)

582
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:11,631
Shall we go to the first destination?

583
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:13,102
Okay, let's go.

584
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:17,743
(Where is Country Family's first destination?)

585
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:23,943
(Jumunjin Port, Gangwon Province)

586
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:28,713
(You can come across fresh seafood at dawn in Jumunjin Port.)

587
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:30,982
(It's your chance to buy freshly caught fish...)

588
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:32,453
(if you go in time for the auction.)

589
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:34,351
(Gangwon Province's representative fish in winter)

590
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:37,223
(Moray, lumpfish, sandfish, octopus, squid, sandlance, amberjack)

591
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:40,661
(Various fishes to satisfy Edward who specializes in fish)

592
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:42,563
(Buy me now!)

593
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:45,902
(Which winter ingredient will be reborn in Edward's hands?)

594
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:48,071
- My gosh.
- Okay.

595
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:50,072
(Eddie, A Sung, and Si A get in the Country Car.)

596
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:52,443
(Today's driver)

597
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:55,219
(They set off to Gangwon Province, the first country destination.)

598
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:57,213
Have you all had breakfast?

599
00:23:57,372 --> 00:23:58,783
- No.
- No.

600
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:00,743
Do you eat breakfast?

601
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:02,181
Yes, big breakfast.

602
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,621
(Yes, chicken feet for big breakfast.)

603
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:06,082
Really?

604
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:09,953
I don't eat little just because it's breakfast.

605
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:12,362
Because I feel hungry.

606
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:15,993
I often eat meat for breakfast.

607
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:18,803
You're incredible.

608
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,002
You really do eat a lot.

609
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:23,803
So what's a good late night snack?

610
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:26,303
Definitely ramyeon.

611
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:27,401
- Ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

612
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:29,242
- I'm a ramyeon lover.
- Okay.

613
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:30,742
(Laughing)

614
00:24:30,743 --> 00:24:33,182
Ramyeon or fried chicken.

615
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:34,412
Fried chicken.

616
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:36,013
I'm hungry.

617
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:38,953
(Talking about food makes her hungry.)

618
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:40,553
I'll cook you five meals a day.

619
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:43,053
(5 meals a day)

620
00:24:43,152 --> 00:24:44,563
(I'm excited.)

621
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:47,293
Breakfast, then...

622
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:48,532
- Snack.
- Brunch.

623
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:51,503
You'll have brunch, then lunch, and dinner.

624
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:54,203
- And a late night snack.
- And a late night snack, yes.

625
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:56,303
Don't leave out late night snack.

626
00:24:57,842 --> 00:25:01,512
(Can they cook 6 meals a day for the big eater?)

627
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:03,213
Whenever I come to Korea,

628
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:05,882
I watch Korean movies...

629
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:09,012
in the airplane to practice Korean.

630
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,013
(I see.)

631
00:25:10,014 --> 00:25:11,053
But...

632
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:16,422
But I want to learn some nice Korean words,

633
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:18,493
but all they say in the movies are "brats..."

634
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:19,822
and "punks."

635
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:22,062
They do swear a lot in movies.

636
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,162
(That's right.)

637
00:25:23,793 --> 00:25:25,703
That's all the Korean I learned.

638
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:27,602
All I learned were curses.

639
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:29,973
You're right. The expats always ask,

640
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:32,472
what does "brat" and "punk" mean?

641
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:35,371
(The Country Family is brimming with K-style affection from the start.)

642
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:36,411
It's fun.

643
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:37,812
We don't need Yo Han to join us.

644
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:40,911
Tell Yo Han to just do the dishes.

645
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:43,081
(They completely forgot about Yo Han.)

646
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:44,213
We will cook.

647
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:47,321
It feels like we're going on a trip.

648
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:48,453
- Yes.
- Right?

649
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:51,522
When you go on a vacation,

650
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:53,263
you leave early at dawn like this.

651
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:56,192
So we're going to Jumunjin?

652
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:57,431
Jumunjin.

653
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,601
- Jumunjin.
- Jumunjin Port.

654
00:25:58,602 --> 00:26:00,362
- We're going to Gangneung.
- Okay.

655
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,632
- Have you been there?
- Yes.

656
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,071
- Have you?
- No.

657
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:06,503
- Have you ever heard of Gangneung?
- No.

658
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:09,612
Can you swim there in summer?

659
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:11,112
- In the sea?
- You can.

660
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:12,512
There's a beach.

661
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:14,082
It's too cold now, right?

662
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:15,833
- Yes, it's cold.
- It's too cold now.

663
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:18,522
Then can you try the fish...

664
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:19,581
Yes?

665
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:20,992
- you see...
- Yes.

666
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:23,053
At the market right there and then?

667
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:24,362
You can.

668
00:26:24,523 --> 00:26:27,493
We should try some when we get there.

669
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,362
I can't wait!

670
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:32,502
(The first destination is Jumunjin Port.)

671
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,932
(What kind of inspiration will Edward get?)

672
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:37,741
(The morning chases away the cold darkness...)

673
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:38,941
(and brightens slowly.)

674
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:40,422
(Jumunjin Port, Gangneung, minus 4°C)

675
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,612
(They arrive at their first destination, )

676
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:47,313
(Jumunjin Port, where hopeful waves welcome them!)

677
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:50,052
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

678
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:51,222
Ready for shopping?

679
00:26:52,123 --> 00:26:53,422
We have lots of money.

680
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:54,593
We have lots of money.

681
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:57,392
- Okay, you show me.
- It's my first time here.

682
00:26:57,393 --> 00:26:59,893
(Jumunjin Market)

683
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,062
- Hello.
- Hello.

684
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:03,461
Hello.

685
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:04,672
(The biggest fish market in the east coast)

686
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:05,873
I can smell the sea.

687
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:08,102
- Gosh, it's white.
- They have squid.

688
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:09,103
Yes.

689
00:27:09,343 --> 00:27:11,612
- Shall we buy some live squid?
- Come have a look.

690
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:12,733
(Foodie Si A mode activated)

691
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:15,011
(The east coast's representative seafood, squid)

692
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:17,242
They have pufferfish too.

693
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:19,583
Yes, pufferfish. You're right.

694
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:21,012
I don't want that.

695
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:23,422
- How about squid?
- Yes.

696
00:27:23,423 --> 00:27:25,021
- We should take it.
- Okay. One?

697
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:27,092
These are small, and those are big.

698
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:29,122
Do you want 2 and 1, maybe?

699
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:31,062
Okay. Can I have 2 small ones and 1 big one, please?

700
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:32,063
Okay.

701
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,692
It's very fresh.

702
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,853
(Freshly caught from the sea)

703
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,162
Do you want to try it raw?

704
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:38,501
Like sashimi?

705
00:27:38,502 --> 00:27:40,532
- She said she would...
- Really? I'll try.

706
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,742
Can we have one sliced...

707
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:44,572
- so we can have it raw?
- Shall I slice it?

708
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:45,672
Yes, please.

709
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:47,573
- I'll slice it for you.
- Okay.

710
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,482
(It's fresh!)

711
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:52,223
It's going to be delicious.

712
00:27:57,522 --> 00:28:00,722
(You can see how chewy it is.)

713
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:07,663
I think she's slicing it there.

714
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:12,073
In America, we don't eat a lot of squid.

715
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:16,373
Most of the squid that we eat is frozen.

716
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:19,042
And most of the squid we eat is fried.

717
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:22,012
It's just a different texture and flavor.

718
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:25,412
It's not the most popular food in America.

719
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,982
So things like having fresh raw squid...

720
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:30,251
It's just different.

721
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:34,252
Here, there is a reverence for squid...

722
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,863
that you just don't have in America.

723
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,892
(This special moment where he can taste fresh squid)

724
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:41,163
This lady has very nice hair.

725
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:43,931
(A woman's pride)

726
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,073
You know?

727
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,271
- The one with the pink.
- It's very cool.

728
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,972
She has a very cool hairstyle, kind of like my hair.

729
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,413
You have a cool hairstyle.

730
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:57,182
He says you have a cool hairstyle.

731
00:28:57,813 --> 00:28:59,011
Here you go.

732
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:00,511
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

733
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:01,852
It's 35 dollars.

734
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:03,333
- It's 35 dollars.
- It's 35 dollars?

735
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,691
(He has the vibe of a restaurant owner when he pays.)

736
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:05,852
(It looks like a clutch bag.)

737
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:07,823
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

738
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,491
Thank you.

739
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:10,823
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

740
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:15,162
(The seafood captures the East Sea's freshness...)

741
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:16,261
This is big.

742
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:17,702
(and stimulates your taste buds.)

743
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:21,403
- They have a lot of fish.
- A lot of fish.

744
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:23,803
We could make an aquarium.

745
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:28,742
But...

746
00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:31,011
- Do you want that?
- Do you want to eat it?

747
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:32,053
That's not it.

748
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,412
It looks very delicious.

749
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:35,482
It does.

750
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:37,553
(Sweetness in red shells, red crab)

751
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:39,552
(We must buy that!)

752
00:29:39,553 --> 00:29:41,392
But these are cooked, right?

753
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:43,261
- Or is it raw?
- It's raw.

754
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:44,662
(Her hope...)

755
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:45,863
They look like they're cooked.

756
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:47,992
(is extinguished.)

757
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:51,103
- Is there more?
- There's more.

758
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:53,032
Over there,

759
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:56,002
there's a place you can buy octopus exclusively.

760
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:59,742
Since this is Edward's first time in Gangwon Province,

761
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,441
I thought about the food...

762
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:04,282
that's most famous and delicious in the region.

763
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:07,452
And Gangwon Province is well-known for its octopus.

764
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,083
You can buy it and boil it on the spot.

765
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:11,452
Right there and then.

766
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:14,521
(Gangwon Province Special "Eddie-tion" 1)

767
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,163
(Giant octopus)

768
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:18,593
That's where they sell octopus.

769
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:21,292
(Honking)

770
00:30:24,563 --> 00:30:25,701
It's very wild.

771
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:26,971
(Laughing)

772
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:29,073
- Now this is the real deal.
- Yes.

773
00:30:29,742 --> 00:30:31,173
(Edward)

774
00:30:31,573 --> 00:30:33,712
- Hello, I'm your fan.
- Hello.

775
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:35,282
Watch out.

776
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,181
- Nice to meet you.
- My gosh.

777
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:38,653
You're a star.

778
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:42,022
Oh, my gosh.

779
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:44,323
Isn't that the one?

780
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:46,491
- That's the octopus.
- Where?

781
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:48,053
There, right there.

782
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:50,022
- Oh, my gosh.
- I think it's moving.

783
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:52,232
Watch your steps.

784
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:55,932
They're octopuses.

785
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,133
Look, there's octopus.

786
00:31:00,103 --> 00:31:02,142
(We have a lot of octopuses here.)

787
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:03,343
It's getting away.

788
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:06,142
It's a giant octopus.

789
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:07,549
(North Pacific giant octopus is the biggest octopus in the world.)

790
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,012
- Here.
- Come here.

791
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,583
It's way too big.

792
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:11,782
Oh, my gosh.

793
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:13,553
It's bigger than me.

794
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,082
(The octopus being auctioned)

795
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,422
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

796
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:19,522
- This is impossible.
- It's Kraken.

797
00:31:20,353 --> 00:31:22,623
This is crazy. It's too big.

798
00:31:22,962 --> 00:31:25,042
(The one that brought them here is more fascinated.)

799
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:27,191
Shall we get the giant one?

800
00:31:27,192 --> 00:31:28,231
- The big one.
- The giant one?

801
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:29,261
Maybe.

802
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,408
(Kyun becomes interested in the biggest octopus he's ever seen.)

803
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,633
How are we going to cook this?

804
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,732
We need a huge pot.

805
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:35,903
Sir.

806
00:31:37,002 --> 00:31:38,042
Sir.

807
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,373
Can we buy this?

808
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,143
- It's expensive.
- How much is it?

809
00:31:42,313 --> 00:31:43,843
Squid and conch for 15 dollars.

810
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:47,583
(A secretive octopus trading?)

811
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:48,853
It's 15 dollars.

812
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:52,823
(How much does the giant octopus cost?)

813
00:31:55,262 --> 00:31:57,192
- It's 50 dollars for 1.
- Okay.

814
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:58,832
Fifty dollars for one octopus?

815
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,833
For 1kg.

816
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,603
- For 1kg?
- It's 50 dollars for 1kg?

817
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:03,132
- Then how much is this?
- It's 50 dollars for 1kg,

818
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:05,903
and this is 10kg, so it costs 500 dollars.

819
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:08,742
Add the trading fee, and it's more than 500 dollars.

820
00:32:08,972 --> 00:32:10,072
It's 500 dollars.

821
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:12,212
- Sell it to us at a cheap price.
- At a cheap price?

822
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:14,619
I can't sell it at a cheap price. This is the price I'm offering.

823
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:15,912
It's out for an auction.

824
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:18,112
- I'm auctioning it.
- I see.

825
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:19,752
- Will you buy it?
- Well...

826
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:21,313
We'll buy it.

827
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,181
(Really?)

828
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:26,093
(Country Cook's first ingredient, octopus)

829
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:27,751
(She is already looking forward to it.)

830
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:29,922
- Thank you.
- It's huge.

831
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:31,492
(Grabbing it)

832
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,802
(She is way too pure and bubbly.)

833
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:38,302
(What are you doing?)

834
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,673
(She must like octopus.)

835
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:42,272
What are you doing?

836
00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:43,672
(Heave-ho)

837
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:46,212
(Its size astonishes them every time the look at it.)

838
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:49,441
You can take it like this.

839
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:50,712
- I understand.
- Okay.

840
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:52,813
Let's see. I can carry.

841
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,182
Let's go.

842
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,252
- It's very heavy, right?
- It's okay.

843
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:00,552
Shall we carry it together?

844
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:01,922
- Shall we carry it together?
- You sure?

845
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:03,791
Yes, sure. I'm strong.

846
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:05,292
I'm your assistant.

847
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:06,432
All right.

848
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,192
(Let's go.)

849
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:09,761
It's so heavy.

850
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:10,863
(Being honest)

851
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:12,333
It's actually heavy.

852
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:13,502
It's heavy.

853
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:16,872
- Over here.
- Ma'am, we bought the octopus.

854
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:19,442
(Where did they head to with the giant octopus?)

855
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:22,842
"We boil octopus" means...

856
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:24,913
you'll boil the octopus we bring, right?

857
00:33:25,113 --> 00:33:27,353
Big ones are rare these days.

858
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:29,021
It was really expensive.

859
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:31,552
It was, wasn't it? Octopus is expensive during winter.

860
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,391
It's cheap in spring, between March and April.

861
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:35,593
- I see.
- But not right now.

862
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:37,562
It's heavy.

863
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:39,062
- It is.
- Oh, my gosh.

864
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:44,232
(How does octopus boiled on the spot in Jumunjin Port taste?)

865
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:47,502
I'd like to see how it's cooked in the kitchen.

866
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:48,802
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

867
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:52,012
Ma'am. May we go inside and watch what you do?

868
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:53,743
Of course. Come in.

869
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:58,142
(Watching carefully)

870
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,981
- You take the skin off.
- Yes.

871
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:02,182
So it's turned inside out.

872
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:04,923
- Yes. This right here is the gill.
- I see.

873
00:34:04,993 --> 00:34:06,823
- The gill?
- Yes.

874
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:08,961
Because it's quite thick here,

875
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:10,522
cuts need to be made.

876
00:34:10,892 --> 00:34:12,593
Only then will it cook well.

877
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,961
And it's tasty.

878
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:16,303
(Amused)

879
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:18,133
Octopus from the East Sea...

880
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:21,132
have no mud inside. As the water is deep, it's clean.

881
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,903
In other places, octopus is thoroughly cleaned...

882
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:26,243
- with flour.
- Right.

883
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:28,412
But octopus from here only has to be rinsed well.

884
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:30,312
Move back a bit.

885
00:34:36,082 --> 00:34:39,922
It could actually get really chewy and tough,

886
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:43,763
so the bigger it is, the harder it is to cook.

887
00:34:44,223 --> 00:34:46,433
I was a little skeptical at first.

888
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:49,032
So we brought it to the lady,

889
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:51,673
and she was going to boil it right there.

890
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,972
The water is boiling right now.

891
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:57,772
I rinsed it a little bit more.

892
00:34:58,343 --> 00:34:59,372
Gosh.

893
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:05,351
It should be cooked 3 to 4 minutes more.

894
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:06,953
- Because it's so big, right?
- Yes.

895
00:35:08,752 --> 00:35:12,851
And I didn't think that it could really cook so fast.

896
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:15,692
I thought it was going to take like 20 minutes,

897
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,923
but she cooked it in less than ten minutes.

898
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:30,942
(Making it more chewy and plump by dunking it in ice-cold water)

899
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:35,582
Eating it at such a place is the real deal.

900
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:38,312
Buying it fresh and boiling it right away.

901
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,752
(Freshly boiled octopus is hard to hold back.)

902
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:44,252
Oh, my gosh.

903
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:46,923
- Thank you.
- It's so...

904
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,122
Thank you.

905
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:54,462
(What's this?)

906
00:35:57,462 --> 00:36:00,532
(Oh, dear. It's so good.)

907
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,001
- It's so fresh.
- It's so good.

908
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:05,112
- It's too fresh.
- It's so good.

909
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:06,243
(Amazed)

910
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:09,742
It's funny that it doesn't need sauce.

911
00:36:09,743 --> 00:36:12,152
- I agree.
- It's already good by itself.

912
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:13,453
- It's enough.
- Yes.

913
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:18,553
The texture. I guess you don't have that when the legs are small.

914
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:22,162
I'll never forget that flavor because...

915
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,561
there was a little chewiness on the outside,

916
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:26,593
but the inside was really tender.

917
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:29,862
- Go over there. Hold on.
- Okay, thank you.

918
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:31,363
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

919
00:36:31,662 --> 00:36:33,433
Where were the chopsticks again?

920
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:38,142
- Thank you.
- No problem.

921
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:45,612
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it different?

922
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:46,812
- Yes.
- I mean the texture.

923
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:49,222
She boiled it a lot faster than I imagined.

924
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:50,423
- Is that so?
- Right?

925
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:53,993
It's so good. I want to try it with the chogochujang.

926
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,732
That sauce is good.

927
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:03,532
The chogochujang.

928
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:04,609
(Chogochujang is the best.)

929
00:37:04,633 --> 00:37:08,903
(Chogochujang is the perfect soulmate with Korean seafood.)

930
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:12,173
(He said he didn't need sauce.)

931
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:15,942
- It tastes very Korean, right?
- Yes.

932
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:17,243
It's so good.

933
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:21,252
(Getting inspired)

934
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:24,423
They way Koreans eat raw fish with chogochujang.

935
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:27,522
To me, it has a really unique flavor.

936
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:30,522
But it's also, for me, an addicting flavor.

937
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:33,191
You know, seafood has a delicate flavor.

938
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:35,093
It's very subtle.

939
00:37:35,232 --> 00:37:39,403
I think the chogochujang gives it a lift up.

940
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:43,642
And so, it really... You can taste the texture and everything,

941
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:46,243
and it all works in harmony.

942
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:48,743
The more you eat, the more you want to eat it.

943
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:50,783
I guess so. It's so good.

944
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:52,383
I can eat this whole thing.

945
00:37:53,412 --> 00:37:55,052
(It's delicious.)

946
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:56,752
Shall we get another octopus?

947
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:58,383
Three?

948
00:37:58,593 --> 00:37:59,692
Three of them?

949
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:04,262
- It's really good. Thank you.
- Is it? Great.

950
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:05,462
Please enjoy.

951
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:07,862
I'll do it.

952
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:10,033
(One bite for the lady who boiled the giant octopus)

953
00:38:11,403 --> 00:38:13,202
You haven't eaten a giant octopus in a while, right?

954
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:14,232
Yes.

955
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:16,772
Giant octopus tastes better than small ones.

956
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:18,142
- Really?
- Yes.

957
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:23,312
(Foodie Si A is on the go!)

958
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:26,283
(Eating)

959
00:38:30,022 --> 00:38:33,392
(Devouring the breakfast octopus)

960
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:45,502
The taste of the sea. I could feel it in my mouth.

961
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,133
It was delicious.

962
00:38:51,102 --> 00:38:53,742
Do people in the US...

963
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:55,582
- Yes?
- eat octopus like this?

964
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:57,782
- Never.
- Really?

965
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:58,812
"Never?"

966
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,282
Then only grilled octopus?

967
00:39:02,283 --> 00:39:04,453
Mostly grilled. I'd say grilled.

968
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:08,391
So I will... Tonight, I will grill the octopus.

969
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:11,161
It'll have a very different flavor. But we'll try.

970
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:13,263
- Okay.
- Try different flavors.

971
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:15,132
But I love this so much.

972
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,932
Don't compare my octopus to this.

973
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:18,263
Okay, we won't.

974
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:22,703
(The octopus will be born anew with Eddie's recipe.)

975
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:25,842
(It's heavy.)

976
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:27,412
(Come to me, giant octopus.)

977
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,912
(Eddie has done it again.)

978
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:33,153
(I'm so happy to be on this show!)

979
00:39:33,513 --> 00:39:34,912
Edward!

980
00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:36,423
It's so good.

981
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:40,522
It's an old town, right?

982
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:42,363
Yes. It's a pretty old town.

983
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:47,093
Apparently, the sandlance boat has returned.

984
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:49,502
How about we check the boat out?

985
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:54,533
(Why are the three looking for the sandlance boat?)

986
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:57,342
Eat sandlance when it's in season,

987
00:39:57,343 --> 00:39:58,771
and it's full of roe.

988
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,843
Male sandlance has what's called milt.

989
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:02,512
It's...

990
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:03,589
(A sandlance spokesperson?)

991
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:05,042
You did some research, didn't you?

992
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:07,811
- When it's sandlance season, - Yes?

993
00:40:07,812 --> 00:40:10,322
I always buy some and dry them out at home.

994
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:11,882
After cooling them,

995
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:14,351
I dry them out on the balcony.

996
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:16,622
If you freeze it, you can have it for a long while.

997
00:40:16,662 --> 00:40:18,992
If the chef tries it,

998
00:40:18,993 --> 00:40:20,492
I think he'll come up...

999
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:22,562
- with several fusion recipe ideas.
- I agree.

1000
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:27,533
(Gangwon Province Special Eddie-tion 2: Sandlance Family)

1001
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:31,542
(Sandlance Dock in Gangwon Province)

1002
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:33,242
Is that sandlance?

1003
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:34,872
Yes, I think so.

1004
00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:36,482
All of them are sandlances.

1005
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:38,751
(The tip of Jumunjin Port...)

1006
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:40,592
(where the boats return after morning fishing)

1007
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:42,952
Oh, my gosh. That's beautiful.

1008
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:46,823
(Sandlance Dock is where the freshly caught sandlances arrive at.)

1009
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:52,262
(The sea's loach and winter's delicacy, sandlance)

1010
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:54,533
So they're taking it out of the net.

1011
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:58,501
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

1012
00:40:58,502 --> 00:41:01,133
Even though we live in Seoul, Korea,

1013
00:41:01,173 --> 00:41:04,142
it's my first time in such a place.

1014
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:05,942
(Something catches Eddie's eyes.)

1015
00:41:06,843 --> 00:41:08,142
Look at all of these.

1016
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:09,711
Hi.

1017
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,282
- Hi.
- Hi.

1018
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:13,053
(What did Eddie see?)

1019
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:14,512
(Freshly grilled sandlances)

1020
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,522
He must be grilling them right away.

1021
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,492
The person I only see on TV is here.

1022
00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:21,493
Yes, hi.

1023
00:41:21,493 --> 00:41:22,493
(Eddie is fixed on the sandlances.)

1024
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:24,723
- Would you like to try it?
- Yes, please.

1025
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:27,791
(The three get dragged in by instinct.)

1026
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,532
- How do I eat it?
- Aside...

1027
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:32,102
from its head, you can eat everything as is.

1028
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:33,872
It's filled with roe.

1029
00:41:36,002 --> 00:41:38,711
(The sandlance in season is packed with roe.)

1030
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:39,941
It's good.

1031
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:41,411
- Eat it as is.
- Thank you.

1032
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:44,183
(Choosing a well-cooked one and eating it whole without the head)

1033
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:46,851
It's filled with roe.

1034
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,482
(A speedy delivery to Eddie)

1035
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,982
My gosh.

1036
00:41:50,082 --> 00:41:51,782
(Encountering sandlance for the first time)

1037
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:52,892
It's good.

1038
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,752
- Eat it as is.
- Thank you.

1039
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:58,192
(In awe)

1040
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,363
(Amazed)

1041
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:02,101
- How is it?
- It's good.

1042
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,102
Right?

1043
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:05,633
(A Sung and Si A are also surprised.)

1044
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:07,231
It's delicious. For real.

1045
00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:08,232
Isn't it flavorful?

1046
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:12,542
The roe-filled ones are female.

1047
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,271
In males, if you see this one,

1048
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:16,883
they have white cream inside. It's milt.

1049
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:18,282
Try this one, too.

1050
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:19,682
(The creamy milt is a signature in male sandlance.)

1051
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:21,581
- Try it.
- Is it different?

1052
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:22,622
Yes.

1053
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:26,322
(Taking a bite of male sandlance)

1054
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:27,352
It's hot.

1055
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:33,961
There's like a liquid inside.

1056
00:42:33,962 --> 00:42:35,803
- "A liquid inside?" - It's not liquid, but...

1057
00:42:35,832 --> 00:42:37,402
(Wintertime sandlance has a chewing charm.)

1058
00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:38,732
- Is it different?
- Yes.

1059
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:40,871
Both are good.

1060
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:42,792
- Try it. It's completely different.
- Should I?

1061
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:47,073
(Si A tries the male sandlance as well.)

1062
00:42:48,073 --> 00:42:49,582
- Isn't it different?
- It is.

1063
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:52,581
(The creamy male sandlance is different to the flavorful female.)

1064
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:54,082
It's much creamier.

1065
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:56,033
- Which one do you prefer?
- This one.

1066
00:42:57,153 --> 00:42:58,482
- This one?
- Yes.

1067
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,993
It's burnt on the outside but creamy in the middle.

1068
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:03,823
It has a really unique flavor.

1069
00:43:04,263 --> 00:43:06,592
It tastes like fresh anchovy...

1070
00:43:06,593 --> 00:43:07,593
but different.

1071
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:09,561
I just didn't find any other fish...

1072
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:12,173
I've had before that's grilled like that.

1073
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,073
- After catching sandlance...
- Yes?

1074
00:43:15,602 --> 00:43:17,072
You wash it with sea water...

1075
00:43:17,073 --> 00:43:19,042
- Wash it and then...
- and grill it right away.

1076
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:20,912
- These are...
- Without salt?

1077
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:23,243
No, without salt.

1078
00:43:23,482 --> 00:43:25,811
- Sandlance is quite salty already.
- I see.

1079
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,912
That's why no salt is needed.

1080
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:31,481
How do you normally eat this? Would you eat it with rice?

1081
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:32,592
- How do you usually...
- With rice?

1082
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:34,952
We eat it with rice. It's a good drink snack, too.

1083
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:37,562
Simply grilling on a frying pan is as good.

1084
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:39,032
(I see.)

1085
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,093
(Staring)

1086
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:43,302
(After explaining, )

1087
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:45,502
(he keeps looking at one direction?)

1088
00:43:47,403 --> 00:43:50,441
(Why does he keep looking at A Sung?)

1089
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:52,072
You look much prettier in person.

1090
00:43:52,073 --> 00:43:53,142
Thank you.

1091
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:55,271
- In person.
- Thank you.

1092
00:43:55,272 --> 00:43:56,283
(Feeling shy)

1093
00:43:58,743 --> 00:43:59,751
Lucky you.

1094
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:01,282
(I'm jealous you get to be with A Sung.)

1095
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:02,283
(A shy confession from a big fan)

1096
00:44:02,284 --> 00:44:03,352
Stop it.

1097
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:06,622
(The superstar is still very shy.)

1098
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:09,621
- Thank you for the sandlance.
- No problem.

1099
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:10,822
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1100
00:44:10,823 --> 00:44:11,892
Thank you.

1101
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:13,691
(On the way to...)

1102
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,062
(the sandlance workplace Si A looked into)

1103
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:18,101
It seems to be this place.

1104
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:19,203
We must have arrived.

1105
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:21,331
Hi.

1106
00:44:21,332 --> 00:44:23,772
- Hi.
- Welcome.

1107
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,972
- Nice to meet you.
- Coming here must've been tough.

1108
00:44:25,973 --> 00:44:27,513
- No.
- Hi.

1109
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:28,673
Thank you for coming.

1110
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:30,081
This way.

1111
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:32,783
(Among the lined-up sandlance workplaces, )

1112
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,751
(a unique sandlance dish...)

1113
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:39,153
(only served at this place awaits the three.)

1114
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:41,322
Warm yourselves up here.

1115
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:43,191
(What recipe will impress Eddie?)

1116
00:44:43,192 --> 00:44:44,263
Nice.

1117
00:44:44,493 --> 00:44:45,592
Warm yourself here.

1118
00:44:45,593 --> 00:44:46,691
(Grilled sandlance is prepared for them.)

1119
00:44:46,692 --> 00:44:48,492
Have you had sandlance before?

1120
00:44:48,493 --> 00:44:49,802
We had some just now.

1121
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:51,303
Did you have some on the way?

1122
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:53,403
Yes. We had a little taste of it.

1123
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,872
Can I get a male sandlance, please?

1124
00:44:56,743 --> 00:44:58,973
You know what's good. There's one here.

1125
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:01,141
But the male ones are mine.

1126
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:02,243
(Park Tae Ja)

1127
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:04,742
- Split it in half.
- It's hot.

1128
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,453
These get hot.

1129
00:45:07,712 --> 00:45:09,482
Are you a family?

1130
00:45:09,823 --> 00:45:10,952
Yes. She's my mom.

1131
00:45:10,953 --> 00:45:12,422
The one who went fishing is my dad.

1132
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:13,593
I'm the daughter.

1133
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:18,892
My dad and second baby sister catch and bring them over.

1134
00:45:19,462 --> 00:45:20,961
There can be crewmen.

1135
00:45:20,962 --> 00:45:22,502
But right now, he's with my sister.

1136
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,231
My mom works here,

1137
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:25,462
while my dad catches them.

1138
00:45:26,102 --> 00:45:28,871
I sell them at the market you were at earlier.

1139
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:31,802
I sell the sandlances my dad catches.

1140
00:45:31,803 --> 00:45:33,711
- It's a sandlance family.
- Yes.

1141
00:45:33,712 --> 00:45:35,343
(A true sandlance family)

1142
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:37,613
Now that they're all grilled,

1143
00:45:37,883 --> 00:45:40,112
- how about we eat together?
- Shall we?

1144
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,012
- I'll set up the table.
- Really?

1145
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:43,622
Thank you.

1146
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:46,453
(The real reason we came here)

1147
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:50,062
(Braised sandlance with Mother’s secret recipe)

1148
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:52,862
(Steamed sandlance roe only available at the place of origin)

1149
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:53,933
Take a seat.

1150
00:45:54,363 --> 00:45:56,032
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1151
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:58,102
- Dig in.
- Thank you for the food.

1152
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:00,501
(Focused on the dishes)

1153
00:46:00,502 --> 00:46:03,602
I'm going to eat when my husband comes back.

1154
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:05,272
When my husband comes back.

1155
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:08,311
(How cute of her.)

1156
00:46:08,312 --> 00:46:09,513
He could be late.

1157
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:12,041
I'll eat when Young Bae returns.

1158
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:13,182
He won't come.

1159
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:14,883
You're overflowing with love.

1160
00:46:15,683 --> 00:46:18,283
My gosh, how romantic.

1161
00:46:18,453 --> 00:46:20,553
I'll eat with Young Bae.

1162
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:23,492
(I'll catch a lot of sandlances, Tae Ja.)

1163
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:25,622
(Shall we now try the sandlance dishes?)

1164
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:27,033
All right.

1165
00:46:27,763 --> 00:46:29,203
Which one do I eat first?

1166
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,461
- Try that first.
- The steamed roe.

1167
00:46:31,462 --> 00:46:32,831
- This one?
- Yes, try it.

1168
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,331
It's not heavily seasoned.

1169
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:35,842
(Thick steamed roe)

1170
00:46:35,843 --> 00:46:38,772
(Will it capture Eddie's appetite?)

1171
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:41,813
- I'll try it first without rice.
- We...

1172
00:46:42,783 --> 00:46:45,383
asked first because you looked familiar.

1173
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:52,521
(Carefully savoring it)

1174
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:53,723
If you need it.

1175
00:46:54,493 --> 00:46:56,022
(Isn't it good?)

1176
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:58,122
I never had something like this before.

1177
00:46:58,392 --> 00:47:00,272
I had it for the first time when I got married.

1178
00:47:00,662 --> 00:47:02,032
(Unless you work in fishing, )

1179
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:03,913
(steamed sandlance roe is hard to come across.)

1180
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,771
- It's different.
- Isn't it unique?

1181
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:10,173
It's very different.

1182
00:47:13,272 --> 00:47:15,911
(Understanding the unique taste of sandlance)

1183
00:47:15,912 --> 00:47:18,342
Other than roe, what other ingredients are in it?

1184
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:19,382
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Only roe.

1185
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:20,613
- Only roe?
- Yes.

1186
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:23,553
- The roes are taken out.
- We take the roe out...

1187
00:47:23,953 --> 00:47:25,121
and cook it with seawater.

1188
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:26,422
- Plain water is a no.
- I see.

1189
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:28,993
(Here's the steamed sandlance roe recipe.)

1190
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:31,392
Cut the raw sandlance's head off.

1191
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:33,692
Squeeze it, and you get the roe out.

1192
00:47:34,192 --> 00:47:35,363
And when you have enough,

1193
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,062
stir it in seawater.

1194
00:47:40,073 --> 00:47:42,332
Pour it into a sieve.

1195
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:44,303
Leave it to solidify.

1196
00:47:44,473 --> 00:47:46,343
Once it solidifies,

1197
00:47:46,642 --> 00:47:48,912
steam it for about 20 minutes...

1198
00:47:49,343 --> 00:47:51,343
for it to be deliciously steamed.

1199
00:47:53,212 --> 00:47:54,952
(The rare and priceless steamed sandlance roe...)

1200
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:56,622
(made with thousands of roe)

1201
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:00,222
And then I started to think,

1202
00:48:00,223 --> 00:48:02,423
"How many sandlances..."

1203
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:04,992
"did you have to take the eggs out of?"

1204
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:07,462
Because it was a big cake of fish eggs.

1205
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:10,231
And I think that's a real luxurious treat...

1206
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:12,062
to be able to eat something like that.

1207
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:15,403
In the past, when people fished pollack.

1208
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:19,141
Only the meat of sandlance was used as bait.

1209
00:48:19,142 --> 00:48:20,612
- The roe was leftover.
- Right.

1210
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:22,141
The roe...

1211
00:48:22,142 --> 00:48:24,343
was steamed to eat as a side dish.

1212
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:26,903
- It's so interesting.
- The seaweed stems.

1213
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:30,553
Try it together with the seaweed stems.

1214
00:48:30,852 --> 00:48:31,923
Here.

1215
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:34,043
It tastes different from when you grill it.

1216
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:36,062
This right here.

1217
00:48:36,993 --> 00:48:38,962
So those are seaweed stems.

1218
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:40,192
Like this.

1219
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:43,232
(Hidden under the plentiful braised sandlance...)

1220
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:46,832
(is seaweed stems filled with the scent of the sea.)

1221
00:48:47,673 --> 00:48:51,403
(The flavorful braised seaweed stem sandlance)

1222
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:53,672
(Try plenty of everything.)

1223
00:48:53,673 --> 00:48:54,973
Thank you.

1224
00:48:56,412 --> 00:48:58,683
I bet this will be another taste I've never had before.

1225
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:01,452
You can smell the sea from the seaweed stem.

1226
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:02,453
I see.

1227
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:06,492
Is it salty? I reheated it earlier.

1228
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:07,852
It's so good.

1229
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:10,561
- Really?
- Yes. It's really good.

1230
00:49:10,562 --> 00:49:12,093
- What is?
- The seaweed stem.

1231
00:49:12,462 --> 00:49:13,561
The texture...

1232
00:49:13,562 --> 00:49:14,992
and the seasoning are a perfect match.

1233
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,702
(What's the seaweed stem like to Eddie?)

1234
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,033
(Impressed)

1235
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:20,002
I'll try this one, too.

1236
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:26,612
(A mouthful of white rice topped with seaweed stem and sandlance)

1237
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:28,513
It had so much flavor to it.

1238
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:30,082
But it was still crunchy.

1239
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:33,312
And it added a really nice texture to it.

1240
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,582
It's delicious.

1241
00:49:37,923 --> 00:49:39,891
It's an excellent side dish for rice.

1242
00:49:39,892 --> 00:49:41,191
(The braised sandlance...)

1243
00:49:41,192 --> 00:49:42,791
(is the perfect side dish for Koreans.)

1244
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:43,792
It's so good.

1245
00:49:43,793 --> 00:49:46,233
(The seaweed stem and sandlance's chemistry is unbelievable.)

1246
00:49:48,462 --> 00:49:50,332
(Si A grabs a dried seaweed.)

1247
00:49:51,562 --> 00:49:53,372
(Let's see how she eats it.)

1248
00:49:55,332 --> 00:49:57,202
(She puts a bit of rice on the dried seaweed.)

1249
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,412
(Yes, that's it.)

1250
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:01,173
Put it on a dried seaweed.

1251
00:50:01,942 --> 00:50:03,183
Top it with some sandlance.

1252
00:50:03,642 --> 00:50:04,682
Add some roe.

1253
00:50:04,683 --> 00:50:06,403
- A bit of seaweed stem - The seaweed stem.

1254
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:08,412
- Add a bit of roe.
- Yes.

1255
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:12,352
After wrapping it, I'll dip it into soy sauce.

1256
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:14,792
- You know how to dig in.
- Exactly.

1257
00:50:19,462 --> 00:50:20,732
(Stuffing in)

1258
00:50:24,263 --> 00:50:25,803
- How is it?
- It's good.

1259
00:50:26,272 --> 00:50:27,403
It's good.

1260
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:29,501
So what did you do? What did you put inside it?

1261
00:50:29,502 --> 00:50:31,101
- I put in the roe.
- Yes.

1262
00:50:31,102 --> 00:50:33,311
- And seaweed stems.
- Okay.

1263
00:50:33,312 --> 00:50:34,342
Like this.

1264
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:36,283
- I'll follow you.
- Here.

1265
00:50:37,383 --> 00:50:38,782
- I'll try it, too.
- It tastes better...

1266
00:50:38,783 --> 00:50:40,351
as a wrap with the dried seaweed.

1267
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:43,081
(A dried seaweed wrap with sandlance craze)

1268
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,882
I'm going to put kimchi in it, too.

1269
00:50:44,883 --> 00:50:46,323
I'm going to put in a little kimchi.

1270
00:50:47,993 --> 00:50:51,422
(After gently putting some kimchi on top, )

1271
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,292
(he rolls the dried seaweed.)

1272
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:56,231
- The dried seaweed.
- Try it?

1273
00:50:56,232 --> 00:50:57,561
(And it goes into his mouth.)

1274
00:50:57,562 --> 00:50:58,763
It's unsalted seaweed.

1275
00:50:59,162 --> 00:51:00,433
(Munching)

1276
00:51:02,073 --> 00:51:03,101
- Isn't it good?
- It's so good.

1277
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,702
Right? As a wrap.

1278
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:06,142
(Highly satisfied)

1279
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:09,982
(A Sung tries it, too.)

1280
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:14,012
(Wrap should be eaten as a whole.)

1281
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:15,283
It's very flavorful.

1282
00:51:16,883 --> 00:51:20,992
Ma'am. Can you show us how to cook the braised sandlance?

1283
00:51:20,993 --> 00:51:22,251
Can you show us?

1284
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:25,562
It's just so good. We want to know the recipe.

1285
00:51:25,723 --> 00:51:26,763
What...

1286
00:51:27,162 --> 00:51:28,262
(It's a no, right?)

1287
00:51:28,263 --> 00:51:29,292
Please.

1288
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:31,332
We want to learn the recipe.

1289
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:33,032
How can we get you to make it?

1290
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:34,231
(You're doing great, Si A.)

1291
00:51:34,232 --> 00:51:36,942
I want to cook it for my family in Seoul.

1292
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,742
(Should I teach them or not?)

1293
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:41,223
Are you going to buy some sandlances?

1294
00:51:41,613 --> 00:51:42,683
Right away, ma'am.

1295
00:51:43,582 --> 00:51:44,812
Just teach them.

1296
00:51:45,912 --> 00:51:46,953
You're the best.

1297
00:51:47,852 --> 00:51:49,013
Teach them.

1298
00:51:49,252 --> 00:51:51,121
Only then will they come here every year.

1299
00:51:51,122 --> 00:51:52,223
(Please.)

1300
00:51:52,723 --> 00:51:54,791
- All right. I'll teach you.
- Really?

1301
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,593
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1302
00:51:57,892 --> 00:51:59,162
I'll whip it up.

1303
00:51:59,662 --> 00:52:01,792
I'll blanch the seaweed stems first.

1304
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:04,032
We're done here.

1305
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,478
(Let's learn before she changes her mind.)

1306
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:06,732
This should be fine, right?

1307
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:08,573
It's big enough.

1308
00:52:09,843 --> 00:52:11,572
So this is just from the ocean.

1309
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:12,872
- Right.
- Just like this.

1310
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:15,042
It's been fished out of the sea, right?

1311
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,141
- Has it been fished out of the sea?
- No.

1312
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:19,782
- These are salted.
- Aren't those salt?

1313
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:21,052
So these are...

1314
00:52:21,053 --> 00:52:23,452
- Isn't it really salty?
- Yes.

1315
00:52:23,453 --> 00:52:24,682
- It's salty.
- Right?

1316
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,751
Is it salty?

1317
00:52:25,752 --> 00:52:27,252
(It's so salty.)

1318
00:52:27,593 --> 00:52:29,823
(While Eddie is wincing at the saltiness, )

1319
00:52:31,223 --> 00:52:33,993
(the braised seaweed stem sandlance cooking class is ready.)

1320
00:52:35,892 --> 00:52:38,863
It has to be boiled.

1321
00:52:41,232 --> 00:52:43,442
It's all boiled. Let's go.

1322
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:45,172
(Work blanched seaweed stems in purified seawater.)

1323
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:46,513
Work them hard.

1324
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:49,411
Rinse them multiple times.

1325
00:52:49,412 --> 00:52:50,941
(Getting rid of the saltiness)

1326
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:53,052
(Studying hard)

1327
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:54,082
All done.

1328
00:52:54,752 --> 00:52:55,953
Try it.

1329
00:52:56,352 --> 00:52:58,352
See if it's less salty than before.

1330
00:52:59,892 --> 00:53:01,252
If it's not salty, then it's good.

1331
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:03,622
(Have the saltiness decreased?)

1332
00:53:04,392 --> 00:53:05,992
Is it salty? It's not, right?

1333
00:53:05,993 --> 00:53:07,593
- It's not salty.
- Good.

1334
00:53:07,993 --> 00:53:10,403
The saltiness is gone, then.

1335
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:17,002
(After a few touches, the seaweed stems taste lighter.)

1336
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:19,243
You shouldn't chop it off completely.

1337
00:53:19,973 --> 00:53:22,013
This way, you can remove the guts.

1338
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:23,783
Just put the knife in slightly.

1339
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:26,252
I have chopped off so many heads of sandlance.

1340
00:53:26,712 --> 00:53:28,552
When I die, all the sandlance will tell me,

1341
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:29,923
"Give our heads back."

1342
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:32,081
(No, they won't.)

1343
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:33,822
"Give our heads back."

1344
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,022
(Give our heads back.)

1345
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:37,461
- I lay the seaweed stems.
- Yes.

1346
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:38,561
(Lay the seaweed stems and put sandlance on top of it.)

1347
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:41,633
You wouldn't get it even if you see it a hundred times.

1348
00:53:42,433 --> 00:53:43,553
You have to try it yourself.

1349
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,602
How many times have you done it?

1350
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:48,232
Me?

1351
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:52,073
I could do it well at once.

1352
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:53,871
(Laughing)

1353
00:53:53,872 --> 00:53:55,442
I excel at it on my first try.

1354
00:53:56,783 --> 00:53:57,783
Now.

1355
00:53:57,784 --> 00:54:00,224
(Learning the seasoning recipe by the one who excels at once)

1356
00:54:00,683 --> 00:54:01,683
Chili powder.

1357
00:54:01,684 --> 00:54:03,423
- Minced garlic.
- Minced garlic.

1358
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:05,452
- Spicy chili.
- Spicy chili.

1359
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:06,453
Soy sauce.

1360
00:54:08,192 --> 00:54:09,192
(Water)

1361
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:11,791
(Mix the seasoning well...)

1362
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:14,493
(and put it over the sandlnace.)

1363
00:54:16,363 --> 00:54:18,232
Can I try it a little?

1364
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:20,533
It's salty.

1365
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,642
- It's not salty.
- No?

1366
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,641
- It's so good.
- Really?

1367
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:26,642
- Gosh.
- Do you want to try it?

1368
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:28,041
(K-seasoning with enhanced flavors while it's measured with the eye)

1369
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:29,882
- I mean, it's salty, but not...
- But it's...

1370
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:32,183
Drink it, then.

1371
00:54:32,383 --> 00:54:33,553
(Enjoying)

1372
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:37,022
By the way, the soy sauce isn't sweet at all.

1373
00:54:37,683 --> 00:54:39,322
It tastes really light.

1374
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:40,652
(She's very keen.)

1375
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:41,993
(How did she catch that secret?)

1376
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:45,462
(There's a secret to the sauce.)

1377
00:54:46,633 --> 00:54:48,291
(Having another secret deal after the octopus deal)

1378
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:49,098
(What is the secret of the sauce?)

1379
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:50,729
It tastes really light.

1380
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,068
(She's very keen.)

1381
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:53,440
(How did she catch that secret?)

1382
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,870
(There's a secret to the sauce.)

1383
00:54:58,109 --> 00:54:59,916
(Having another secret deal after the octopus deal)

1384
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,238
(What is the secret of the sauce?)

1385
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:02,739
Maybe it's the MSG.

1386
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,080
(Cracking up)

1387
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,109
Gosh. What did she say?

1388
00:55:07,149 --> 00:55:08,149
What did she say?

1389
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,350
I knew it.

1390
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:10,949
(MSG is good.)

1391
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:13,766
- Keep it a secret.
- It's a secret.

1392
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,159
Okay. It's a secret.

1393
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,759
(Let's keep it a secret.)

1394
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,959
After pouring the seasoning evenly...

1395
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,636
(The last step of making the braised seaweed stem sandlance)

1396
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,999
- Green onions.
- Chili. Lower the heat a little.

1397
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,945
(Add green onions and chilis and boil it down to finish!)

1398
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:28,238
- Gosh. It's perfect.
- Is it?

1399
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:29,709
- It's just perfect.
- Good.

1400
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,439
(The braised sandlance made with the sea-protecting hands)

1401
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,440
It's perfect.

1402
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,350
They were the dishes I couldn't have normally.

1403
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:39,680
I was inspired to try making it.

1404
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,818
Cooking doesn't start from our tongue.

1405
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:44,790
I realized that it starts from a space.

1406
00:55:46,589 --> 00:55:50,230
Ma'am, can we take it to go?

1407
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:51,589
Will you pack some for us?

1408
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:56,000
Please. Just a little.

1409
00:55:56,569 --> 00:55:57,668
Thank you.

1410
00:55:57,669 --> 00:55:59,568
Thank you. It's so tasty.

1411
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:01,169
I made it anyway, so...

1412
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:03,540
- You did well when it was cold.
- Thank you.

1413
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,040
If you want to prepare sandlance again,

1414
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:06,838
- You can come again.
- Thank you.

1415
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:08,640
- Okay.
- I'll remember it.

1416
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:11,779
- Thank you.
- When in the countryside,

1417
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:14,619
the chef said we could taste the origin,

1418
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,819
so he wanted to experience it.

1419
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:20,218
During our visit to the first fish market,

1420
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:22,359
I could already understand what he meant.

1421
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:26,830
Tasting the freshly-caught fish...

1422
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,629
was a totally different experience.

1423
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,870
I was glad we came with Chef Lee here.

1424
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:34,569
That was what I thought.

1425
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,940
Let's go.

1426
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,440
(Both hands are full with ingredients in season)

1427
00:56:40,441 --> 00:56:42,338
- You too, right?
- We have a lot here.

1428
00:56:42,339 --> 00:56:43,350
Right.

1429
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,648
So, this is all our dinner tonight.

1430
00:56:46,649 --> 00:56:47,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

1431
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:51,049
We open this side.

1432
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,250
Be careful.

1433
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:53,919
Okay.

1434
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,489
(Piling up the local ingredients)

1435
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,929
- All good?
- All good?

1436
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,000
- Okay.
- All right.

1437
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,099
(The first day of the trip is going smoothly.)

1438
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,100
All right.

1439
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,100
- Let's go.
- I'm relieved.

1440
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:08,699
(They leave with their trailer filled!)

1441
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,969
(Walking confidently)

1442
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,409
(Which dish will Chef Edward Lee transform...)

1443
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:17,910
(the seasonal ingredients of Gangwon Province into?)

1444
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,448
(They finally arrive at their first lodging...)

1445
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:23,119
(in Gangneung, Gangwon Province.)

1446
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,190
Hey.

1447
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:25,890
(How will their first lodging look?)

1448
00:57:25,891 --> 00:57:27,089
We're finally here.

1449
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,689
(They finally arrive at the lodging while they are tired.)

1450
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,100
- Amazing.
- Goodness.

1451
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,330
It's a real hanok, the Korean-style house.

1452
00:57:41,739 --> 00:57:44,640
(From the entrance, they are amazed by the house.)

1453
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,878
This is beautiful.

1454
00:57:46,879 --> 00:57:48,139
It's pretty.

1455
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,309
(It's a hanok lodging with a large front yard...)

1456
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,750
(and the quietness of an old house.)

1457
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:54,579
(The beautiful looks of hanok...)

1458
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,719
(can be seen everywhere.)

1459
00:57:57,149 --> 00:57:58,689
Gosh. There's a barbeque.

1460
00:57:58,690 --> 00:57:59,789
(They even have a barbeque in the middle of the yard.)

1461
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,619
So, we'll cook dinner right here tonight.

1462
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,620
Yes.

1463
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:05,460
We'll have a little wine and dinner.

1464
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,499
- Sure.
- Shall we go inside?

1465
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

1466
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,199
(Exclaiming)

1467
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,039
(A Sung and Si A's room, Eddie and Yo Han's room)

1468
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,339
It's so beautiful.

1469
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,770
A Sung, which bed do you want?

1470
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,040
It doesn't matter to me.

1471
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:21,839
I'll sleep here.

1472
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,310
Okay. I'll use the other bed, then.

1473
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,079
You can use this space. I'll unpack on this side.

1474
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,278
- Okay.
- I didn't expect...

1475
00:58:28,279 --> 00:58:29,449
it'd be this spacious.

1476
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,418
(Edward enters the room...)

1477
00:58:32,419 --> 00:58:34,020
(he's going to share with Yo Han first.)

1478
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,588
(This is my side.)

1479
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:40,529
(Automatically, this bed becomes Yo Han's.)

1480
00:58:42,629 --> 00:58:43,699
(Groaning)

1481
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,770
(He's twice as tired due to jet lag.)

1482
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,569
(But as a chef, he goes to the kitchen instinctively.)

1483
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:57,080
We're going to cook the giant octopus.

1484
00:58:58,509 --> 00:58:59,580
But there's no...

1485
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,750
There's no... They don't have a pot.

1486
00:59:03,649 --> 00:59:05,048
- That one.
- That would work.

1487
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:08,259
(Sous Chef A Sung helps the main chef.)

1488
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,989
(They start off by organizing the items they shopped for dinner.)

1489
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:15,160
(In perfect harmony)

1490
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,500
Yes. Where's... Is that the cod?

1491
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,628
- Cod. Yes.
- Yes.

1492
00:59:18,629 --> 00:59:20,875
(They separate the ingredients that need to be prepared.)

1493
00:59:20,899 --> 00:59:23,468
(The braised sandlance they received from the sandlance workplace...)

1494
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:25,509
(goes into the fridge too.)

1495
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:26,979
I've never tried it before.

1496
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,509
(With two sous chefs, the kitchen is organized quickly.)

1497
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,649
(Rapidly running out of energy)

1498
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,448
We have tofu...

1499
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:36,750
Chill out. Do we have an hour?

1500
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:38,750
We have one hour.

1501
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,690
Okay. I'm going to take a small nap.

1502
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,059
- Okay. See you.
- Bye.

1503
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,600
(They have a small break.)

1504
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:52,569
(On a deep-sleep mode)

1505
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,640
(Si A organizes her stuff.)

1506
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,310
(But A Sung is missing!)

1507
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:02,040
(Opening)

1508
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:13,859
(She checks again where the cookingware is placed.)

1509
01:00:15,759 --> 01:00:17,729
(She thoroughly checks the corners of the kitchen...)

1510
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,730
(she couldn't check before.)

1511
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,069
(After grasping it completely, she goes back to the room.)

1512
01:00:25,669 --> 01:00:30,310
(What will the Country Family do after a sweet break?)

1513
01:00:30,469 --> 01:00:32,409
- Let's go.
- Go.

1514
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,050
(They head to find the third ingredient.)

1515
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,109
(Who will drive the Country Car this time?)

1516
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,080
Si A's going to drive.

1517
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,580
Okay.

1518
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,879
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

1519
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,219
- Okay. New driver.
- Cool. Hi.

1520
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,219
Let's go.

1521
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,259
(Let's get going.)

1522
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,690
(Growling)

1523
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,160
I think I'm hungry.

1524
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:56,829
(It's been 2 hours since they had sandlance.)

1525
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:57,870
- Really?
- Yes.

1526
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,829
I'm still full.

1527
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:03,409
I feel hungry now that we're heading somewhere.

1528
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,410
(When they get hungry while thinking about food, )

1529
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,410
(A Sung makes a call.)

1530
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,980
(Who is she calling?)

1531
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,279
Hello. This is the M restaurant.

1532
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:19,049
Is this Master Oh Sook Hi's buckwheat restaurant?

1533
01:01:19,149 --> 01:01:21,959
Right. Are you coming with Mr. Edward Lee?

1534
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,019
Right.

1535
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,730
We'll arrive in about 15 minutes.

1536
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,229
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1537
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,830
- Yes. Thank you.
- Yes.

1538
01:01:30,529 --> 01:01:32,769
She's one of the best masters...

1539
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:34,139
- of buckwheat food in Korea.
- Really?

1540
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,140
Yes.

1541
01:01:35,141 --> 01:01:37,739
Have you ever cooked with buckwheat?

1542
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,680
Yes. I've only made noodles before.

1543
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:45,508
And it's hard. If you do it wrong, the noodles become too tough.

1544
01:01:45,509 --> 01:01:47,918
- Too tough.
- If you do it the other way,

1545
01:01:47,919 --> 01:01:48,919
it falls apart.

1546
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,649
- I see.
- I have to do it just right, so...

1547
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,620
We'll see how the master does it.

1548
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,159
I'm excited to learn what else we can make...

1549
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,730
- with buckwheat.
- I see.

1550
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,198
(Gangwon Province Special Eddie-tion 3)

1551
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:04,069
(Buckwheat and the master)

1552
01:02:04,529 --> 01:02:06,099
(Country Family is here to taste the buckwheat.)

1553
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,100
There it is.

1554
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,410
I'm going to eat a lot when we get there.

1555
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,040
(Master's restaurant in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province)

1556
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

1557
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:20,218
What a pleasure to have you.

1558
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:22,048
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

1559
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:24,418
- Yes. Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1560
01:02:24,419 --> 01:02:26,120
- I'm such a fan.
- Really?

1561
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:28,619
Thank you for coming.

1562
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,620
Please take a seat.

1563
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:30,789
(They've caught the customers' attention too.)

1564
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,528
Okay. You can sit here. Yes.

1565
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:34,529
(Is this buckwheat?)

1566
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:38,099
(Staring)

1567
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,729
- When you look at...
- Are you...

1568
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:42,238
Oh Sook Hi?

1569
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:43,639
(The 1st buckwheat cuisine master, World Masters Association's master)

1570
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,809
Hello.

1571
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:45,968
- She's the master.
- Nice to meet you.

1572
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,738
- Yes.
- Hello.

1573
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:48,838
It's an honor.

1574
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:50,549
No. Thank you.

1575
01:02:51,779 --> 01:02:56,319
(When she handles buckwheat, she does it without hesitation.)

1576
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:01,488
In a simple phrase, I'm crazy about buckwheat.

1577
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:03,088
(The one who is crazy about buckwheat)

1578
01:03:03,089 --> 01:03:05,959
Here's the secret to our delicious buckwheat.

1579
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,500
Usually, others use sweet buckwheat.

1580
01:03:08,859 --> 01:03:11,669
But we use bitter buckwheat more.

1581
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:15,599
The bitter buckwheat has a much better texture,

1582
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,008
and it's way more nutritious.

1583
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:19,529
(Achieving both texture and nutrition)

1584
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:23,449
(The rediscovery of bitter buckwheat that isn't used commonly)

1585
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,379
After studying it for a long time,

1586
01:03:28,149 --> 01:03:31,390
I've become a world master in buckwheat cuisine in 2020.

1587
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:33,418
(She earned her place by challenging herself...)

1588
01:03:33,419 --> 01:03:35,136
(with new ingredients and by making ceaseless efforts.)

1589
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,029
(What is the buckwheat cuisine made by the master?)

1590
01:03:38,129 --> 01:03:40,500
- Before I cook, - Yes.

1591
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:44,528
Can I show you some stuff in the kitchen?

1592
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,838
Yes. Of course. We'd love to.

1593
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:48,540
(Standing up right away)

1594
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:52,509
I'll show you how we make buckwheat noodles.

1595
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:55,709
Wash your hands there.

1596
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,390
(The basis of all cooking is cleanliness.)

1597
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,448
Edward, here's what I can tell you...

1598
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:03,180
- with utmost confidence.
- Okay.

1599
01:04:03,649 --> 01:04:05,850
I'm sure you've seen this buckwheat many times before.

1600
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:08,390
This is sweet buckwheat.

1601
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:10,629
- Sweet buckwheat.
- It's sweet.

1602
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,230
Try it.

1603
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:16,799
(How does 100-percent sweet buckwheat taste?)

1604
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,500
It has a light taste.

1605
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,108
- Yes.
- Right. Try this one, then.

1606
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:27,109
What is it, though?

1607
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,338
Just try it first.

1608
01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:29,616
(What is this similar-looking powder?)

1609
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,649
How does it taste?

1610
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:32,210
You too.

1611
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,350
Try it.

1612
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:37,350
- It's bitter.
- Yes. It's bitter.

1613
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:40,259
This is bitter buckwheat. It's bitter.

1614
01:04:40,819 --> 01:04:41,819
(The color of each buckwheat is totally different.)

1615
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,829
(Bitter buckwheat)

1616
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,528
(Sweet buckwheat)

1617
01:04:45,529 --> 01:04:49,000
The bitter one is 52 times more nutritious.

1618
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:52,229
(Sweet buckwheat is consumed commonly...)

1619
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:54,839
(because it's soft and less bitter.)

1620
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:57,639
(The bitter buckwheat is called "Golden Smile...")

1621
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,210
(due to the round shape of the seeds)

1622
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:02,008
(Biter buckwheat: Its seeds are smaller and rounder.)

1623
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:04,009
(It's healthier as it contains more antioxidants.)

1624
01:05:04,149 --> 01:05:06,309
There are not too many cuisines...

1625
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:10,219
in the world that celebrate this bitterness.

1626
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:14,190
We think of bitterness as being something we try to avoid.

1627
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:16,588
I don't know how I'm going to feel about it.

1628
01:05:16,589 --> 01:05:18,335
(I wonder what she'll make with the bitter buckwheat.)

1629
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:21,600
If I were to make noodles with 100-percent buckwheat...

1630
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,399
- It's too bitter.
- Yes.

1631
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,738
(What is the secret of World Master of buckwheat cuisine?)

1632
01:05:27,739 --> 01:05:29,870
Gosh. You mix them.

1633
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,608
(She brings out something amazing.)

1634
01:05:31,609 --> 01:05:33,639
- Okay.
- Come on and take it.

1635
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,009
Gosh. I'm dying here.

1636
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:36,639
(He got yelled at for just being amazed by it.)

1637
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,850
- Okay.
- Okay.

1638
01:05:38,149 --> 01:05:39,149
She's such a veteran.

1639
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,679
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

1640
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,819
(He is in a student mode because of her charisma.)

1641
01:05:43,049 --> 01:05:44,648
(Master Oh Sook Hi's introduction to buckwheat)

1642
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,988
(1st period, buckwheat noodles)

1643
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:48,190
After you handle the buckwheat today...

1644
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:53,028
Edward Lee? You'll treat me like a big sister.

1645
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:54,759
- Okay.
- Okay.

1646
01:05:56,259 --> 01:05:57,569
(Excited)

1647
01:05:57,669 --> 01:05:59,870
(Master reveals her recipe for buckwheat noodles.)

1648
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:03,099
(She starts off by pouring water into buckwheat powder.)

1649
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,508
Is the water hot?

1650
01:06:04,509 --> 01:06:06,468
No. That's a good question.

1651
01:06:06,469 --> 01:06:09,580
Si A has a good sense of cooking.

1652
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,109
When you make buckwheat dough, you can use hot water...

1653
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:14,680
or ice water.

1654
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:18,418
Unlike most of the people, I make the dough with ice water.

1655
01:06:18,419 --> 01:06:19,520
- Okay.
- Yes.

1656
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:22,988
(Hot water dough: Kneading with hot water...)

1657
01:06:22,989 --> 01:06:26,089
(to increase the dough's viscosity for easier shaping.)

1658
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:29,729
(How about Master's dough with ice water?)

1659
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:32,770
(It increases the chewy texture of the buckwheat.)

1660
01:06:33,899 --> 01:06:36,369
Do you add flour to it too?

1661
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:38,640
I didn't add any flour.

1662
01:06:39,339 --> 01:06:41,579
- Without the flour, - Yes.

1663
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,580
It becomes so hard.

1664
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,579
When you mix the two kinds of buckwheat in the right ratio,

1665
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,349
it's more flavorful...

1666
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,718
- and less bitter.
- Right.

1667
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:49,879
It has a good viscosity too.

1668
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:53,189
(The key is to mix the sweet and bitter buckwheat...)

1669
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,219
(in the Master's unique ratio.)

1670
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:57,990
When you try the noodles later,

1671
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,560
you will love the noodles more than me.

1672
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:04,899
(Filled with curiosity, he can't take his eyes off.)

1673
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,070
- Try kneading it.
- Okay.

1674
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:09,270
My arm hurts.

1675
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,610
I get it.

1676
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,479
Do it with both hands.

1677
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,280
(He feels the texture of the dough with the ice water with his hands.)

1678
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,979
Okay. Jump on in. Six hands.

1679
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,049
Six hands.

1680
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:27,059
- It's stickier than I thought.
- Right.

1681
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,060
Yes.

1682
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,758
(A sticky buckwheat dough is forming.)

1683
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:35,100
While kneading, try it with the tip of your tongue.

1684
01:07:36,259 --> 01:07:37,929
Okay. I'll do this.

1685
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,050
(It used buckwheat powder 100 percent without flour.)

1686
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:46,409
(How does it taste?)

1687
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:51,950
It's soft.

1688
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,118
It's not as bitter as before.

1689
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,119
Right.

1690
01:07:55,850 --> 01:08:00,089
Her buckwheat was something that was earthy but soft.

1691
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:02,718
Now, it's time to make the noodles.

1692
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:04,288
(When she puts the glutinous dough into the machine right away...)

1693
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,789
This makes the noodles.

1694
01:08:07,999 --> 01:08:09,529
- Look.
- Goodness.

1695
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:10,850
(The noodles with bouncy texture)

1696
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,600
(Amazed)

1697
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:17,270
(Adding the touch of Edward)

1698
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:24,150
Count the seconds until you reach 100.

1699
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,208
(Counting 100 seconds)

1700
01:08:26,209 --> 01:08:28,529
(They can feel Master's technique of boiling the noodles.)

1701
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,149
- Gosh.
- The noodles from elsewhere...

1702
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,118
- are white.
- Yes.

1703
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:35,319
When you add the bitter buckwheat, it has a different color.

1704
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,666
(Master's noodles are darker because she put bitter buckwheat.)

1705
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:40,700
(Watching carefully)

1706
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,899
(After a cold shower, )

1707
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,969
(the noodles are clearly darker and bouncier.)

1708
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:49,168
(The first buckwheat noodles made by the Country Family)

1709
01:08:49,169 --> 01:08:52,538
This noodles are so delicious when you chew it 100 times.

1710
01:08:52,539 --> 01:08:54,259
- A hundred times. Okay.
- A hundred times.

1711
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,209
(Chewing)

1712
01:08:56,909 --> 01:08:59,709
Try it like this.

1713
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:02,649
- At once?
- Yes. When you're eating,

1714
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:05,289
you have to fill your mouth to enjoy it.

1715
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:08,759
- Chew 100 times.
- Yes. 100 times.

1716
01:09:09,789 --> 01:09:10,990
Gosh. It's so good.

1717
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:14,729
- It's so amazing.
- Is it amazing?

1718
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,430
Yes. It's so good.

1719
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,930
I've been eating buckwheat wrong my whole life.

1720
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,468
I always thought... It kind of gave me...

1721
01:09:22,469 --> 01:09:25,440
a new window into looking at buckwheat.

1722
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:29,078
Gosh. When I touch it, it's so bouncy.

1723
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:30,810
Right. How is it?

1724
01:09:31,579 --> 01:09:33,309
(Slurping)

1725
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:35,650
I love it. It's the best of the best.

1726
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:38,918
In fact, when I'm hungry, I eat it while walking around.

1727
01:09:38,919 --> 01:09:40,959
(When I'm hungry, I eat it while walking around.)

1728
01:09:41,419 --> 01:09:44,390
It doesn't need to be seasoned. It's just so good.

1729
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:47,699
I love how it goes down the throat.

1730
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,798
- It slurps down.
- Did you finish it already?

1731
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,079
I told you to chew it 100 times.

1732
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,570
- I still have some.
- That's the way to eat it.

1733
01:09:53,999 --> 01:09:55,399
I didn't chew it 100 times, either.

1734
01:09:55,499 --> 01:09:57,038
(Interpretation)

1735
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:58,599
(I'll try it again properly this time.)

1736
01:09:58,669 --> 01:09:59,669
It's really good, right?

1737
01:10:01,339 --> 01:10:02,378
It's so good.

1738
01:10:02,379 --> 01:10:04,385
(They learned about the charm of the bitter buckwheat this time.)

1739
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:06,449
(Master Oh Sook Hi's introduction to buckwheat)

1740
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:08,350
(2nd period, buckwheat crepe)

1741
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:12,588
(Master Oh's cooking continues.)

1742
01:10:12,589 --> 01:10:14,190
- Okay.
- Do you know what it is?

1743
01:10:15,289 --> 01:10:16,289
Radish.

1744
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,490
- Radish.
- Yes.

1745
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:21,229
You're Korean.

1746
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,510
- You're Korean.
- That's right.

1747
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,669
Korean... Go around with it.

1748
01:10:24,999 --> 01:10:26,229
Usually, we use a spoon...

1749
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,599
- when adding oil.
- That's right.

1750
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,639
But when you use the radish,

1751
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,369
the pan absorbs the oil evenly.

1752
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,909
(A touch of old sentimentality and wisdom)

1753
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:42,019
I... This is a buckwheat crepe.

1754
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,020
It's napa cabbage.

1755
01:10:43,419 --> 01:10:44,539
- Is it napa cabbage?
- Yes.

1756
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,088
Right. Okay.

1757
01:10:46,089 --> 01:10:49,619
(We can't talk about buckwheat dish without the buckwheat crepe.)

1758
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:53,060
(Lay small napa cabbage and chive on the well-heated pan.)

1759
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:55,099
Paint on it.

1760
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,569
- With this?
- As if you were making egg garnish.

1761
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:58,570
Okay.

1762
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:00,998
- How much?
- That much.

1763
01:11:00,999 --> 01:11:02,569
- Grab some and pour.
- How much is "That much?"

1764
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:03,600
Okay.

1765
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,609
(Let's try it first.)

1766
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:07,379
- Make it bigger.
- Like this? Bigger?

1767
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:09,680
- Come on, make it bigger.
- Bigger.

1768
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,680
Bigger. Gosh. You have a small hand.

1769
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,020
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1770
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:16,919
Make it bigger if possible.

1771
01:11:17,919 --> 01:11:20,019
- I see. Like that.
- See?

1772
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,159
- Okay. I got it.
- Okay?

1773
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,889
Do I make it thick?

1774
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,029
- No. Make it thin.
- Thin.

1775
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,489
- Make it as thin as possible.
- Okay.

1776
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,210
Yes. Do it and make it as thin as possible.

1777
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,200
That one is really thick right now.

1778
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,169
- Okay?
- Yes.

1779
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:35,440
- Now, with eggs...
- Now, I'm nervous.

1780
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,369
- Right.
- You can do it.

1781
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,140
You're doing a good job.

1782
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:41,440
You're half Gangwon Province local now.

1783
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,578
(Experienced Master of buckwheat leads Edward by the nose.)

1784
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:45,809
I'll adjust the heat.

1785
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,209
Do I flip it now?

1786
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,279
- Wait a little.
- Sure.

1787
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,320
Then flip it over.

1788
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:54,820
(What does she mean by that this time?)

1789
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:56,439
- Actually...
- It's hard, right?

1790
01:11:56,759 --> 01:11:58,628
- It's your first time.
- I keep...

1791
01:11:58,629 --> 01:12:01,129
- I keep getting nervous.
- You did good.

1792
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,600
(His heart is pounding.)

1793
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:06,129
I'm even more nervous. I'm shaking right now.

1794
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,298
(She wins.)

1795
01:12:08,299 --> 01:12:09,338
Okay.

1796
01:12:09,339 --> 01:12:11,445
(Now, it's time for the long-awaited highlight, flipping.)

1797
01:12:11,469 --> 01:12:13,740
(The master shows him a demonstration.)

1798
01:12:15,339 --> 01:12:16,409
- I see. Okay.
- Okay?

1799
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,180
(This shouldn't be that hard.)

1800
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,248
(He failed.)

1801
01:12:22,249 --> 01:12:23,320
It folded.

1802
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,289
(Flustered)

1803
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:26,949
(The buckwheat crepe folded in half.)

1804
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,289
I'm sorry.

1805
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

1806
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:32,101
(He quickly fixes the buckwheat crepe that folded.)

1807
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,860
(Second attempt to flip a buckwheat crepe)

1808
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,959
(This time, it broke in half.)

1809
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,129
(Gosh)

1810
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,668
(He attempts to flip at least one half of the buckwheat crepe.)

1811
01:12:42,669 --> 01:12:43,700
You did it.

1812
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,480
You can put this here.

1813
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:48,909
Okay.

1814
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:50,810
Okay.

1815
01:12:55,049 --> 01:12:56,749
Put it on top of this one.

1816
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:58,749
On top of it?

1817
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,559
You're indeed a professional.

1818
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,560
(He's doing a neat job of plating the buckwheat crepes.)

1819
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:03,619
- All done.
- Okay.

1820
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:08,030
(Edward Lee's first-ever buckwheat crepes)

1821
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,560
(Eddie's skills are improving...)

1822
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,560
(as the buckwheat crepes turn golden brown.)

1823
01:13:10,561 --> 01:13:12,200
Gosh, you did great.

1824
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,969
Ms. Oh.

1825
01:13:15,299 --> 01:13:18,839
She was kind of bossing me around, telling me what to do.

1826
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,879
When I come into their kitchen, it doesn't matter who I am.

1827
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,780
And I just... To me, that's...

1828
01:13:24,879 --> 01:13:28,320
It's such a fun way to interact with people.

1829
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:32,749
A lot of the times, the food that you cook will reflect who you are.

1830
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:36,219
I could immediately tell her personality was big...

1831
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,490
and that her flavors were going to be big.

1832
01:13:40,799 --> 01:13:43,929
Wait outside. I'll make you something really tasty.

1833
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:44,930
(The lesson is over. It's finally time to taste the master's cooking.)

1834
01:13:44,931 --> 01:13:47,469
I'm so excited to see what she makes.

1835
01:13:48,969 --> 01:13:49,999
I'm hungry.

1836
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:52,809
She's here.

1837
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:55,530
(The world master of buckwheat is bringing out the dishes she made.)

1838
01:13:55,839 --> 01:13:56,839
Gosh.

1839
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,909
(Give it a try.)

1840
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,249
(They have faith and hope in the master.)

1841
01:14:02,619 --> 01:14:05,119
(We love buckwheat.)

1842
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,618
(A table full of buckwheat dishes made by the master)

1843
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:12,390
- This is so pretty.
- It's so pretty.

1844
01:14:13,959 --> 01:14:18,030
You have to try our main dish, the buckwheat noodles,

1845
01:14:18,129 --> 01:14:21,039
to know if our food is good or not.

1846
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:23,716
(They begin eating with excitement at the master's suggestion.)

1847
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,739
You won't find something like this anywhere else in the country.

1848
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,039
(Today's main dish: buckwheat noodles)

1849
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:33,809
If you dip it in the broth, the noodles will become more chewy.

1850
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:36,530
(Dipping the noodles in iced broth enhances the flavor and texture.)

1851
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:40,219
(They follow the master's tip...)

1852
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:44,490
(and take their first bite after dipping the noodles in the broth.)

1853
01:14:59,709 --> 01:15:01,909
- Amazing.
- It's so good.

1854
01:15:03,839 --> 01:15:07,449
(The buckwheat noodles taste even better with the broth.)

1855
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,570
- It's chewy, right?
- Gosh.

1856
01:15:08,919 --> 01:15:12,549
But even, you know, Japanese soba,

1857
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:16,190
it's like one flavor. Very clean.

1858
01:15:16,589 --> 01:15:18,958
It's consistent with one flavor.

1859
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:20,359
- But Korean food is like...
- Right.

1860
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,629
- everything.
- That's right.

1861
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,769
- It's a mix of different flavors.
- Right.

1862
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,970
(The buckwheat noodles are awakening their taste buds.)

1863
01:15:27,299 --> 01:15:28,299
The dongchimi.

1864
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:31,368
- Then here...
- There's some...

1865
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:32,969
- It's so refreshing.
- It's refreshing.

1866
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,240
I taste a lot of pear. Right?

1867
01:15:35,909 --> 01:15:39,280
Is the broth cooking liquid?

1868
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

1869
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,020
What are the ingredients of the broth?

1870
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:48,190
We use a lot of ingredients like...

1871
01:15:48,619 --> 01:15:50,589
- apples, pears, and lemons.
- Apples.

1872
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,859
Please tell us the specifics.

1873
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,860
(We want to know more.)

1874
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,360
Tell you the specifics?

1875
01:15:58,169 --> 01:16:00,100
That's our secret recipe.

1876
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,570
- I make...
- It's so good.

1877
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:06,669
With dried pollack and brisket.

1878
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,509
(We can't reveal her secret recipe on TV. That's all you can hear.)

1879
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:12,749
(She stops eating and goes through her bag.)

1880
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:14,049
What happened?

1881
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,719
(Laughing)

1882
01:16:16,249 --> 01:16:17,378
I want to write it down.

1883
01:16:17,379 --> 01:16:18,389
(I want to write it down.)

1884
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,389
The master was explaining to us,

1885
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:25,229
but I think all this would have felt new to Chef Lee.

1886
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:29,559
So I wrote everything down, thinking that I should memorize...

1887
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,570
the master's recipe for him.

1888
01:16:33,499 --> 01:16:36,469
(Edward Lee's chief assistant is very diligent.)

1889
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,940
What's this?

1890
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,569
- That's...
- These ones that look like sprouts.

1891
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,310
Those are buckwheat sprouts.

1892
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,009
Have you ever seen buckwheat sprouts?

1893
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:47,110
No.

1894
01:16:47,111 --> 01:16:49,419
Taste the texture.

1895
01:16:49,749 --> 01:16:53,189
You have to cook mung bean sprouts and bean sprouts to eat them.

1896
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,719
But buckwheat sprouts have to be eaten raw.

1897
01:16:57,829 --> 01:16:59,559
So this is the buckwheat sprout.

1898
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,560
- Yes, it is.
- Yes.

1899
01:17:03,499 --> 01:17:05,399
(What do buckwheat sprouts taste like?)

1900
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,600
- It's similar to bean sprouts.
- Gosh, it's so good.

1901
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,168
Very organic.

1902
01:17:09,169 --> 01:17:10,368
(They look familiar, but none of them have ever tasted...)

1903
01:17:10,369 --> 01:17:11,569
(the unique refreshing flavor...)

1904
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:12,809
It's so good.

1905
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:14,139
(of buckwheat sprouts that fills their mouths.)

1906
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,480
This is my favorite.

1907
01:17:15,579 --> 01:17:18,150
- It's so good. It's nice and plain.
- I love it.

1908
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,718
At first, I thought it was bean sprouts.

1909
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:25,520
But it's a completely different flavor.

1910
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:28,190
Very fresh, very crunchy.

1911
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,329
I'm really fascinated by that and I want to try and use it more.

1912
01:17:34,799 --> 01:17:36,199
(The flavor of buckwheat is beautiful like the novel, )

1913
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,258
It's so good.

1914
01:17:37,259 --> 01:17:38,298
("When the Buckwheat Flowers Bloom.")

1915
01:17:38,299 --> 01:17:39,900
Gosh, this is really good.

1916
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:42,139
(The flavor is impressive.)

1917
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,169
It's so good.

1918
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:46,008
- Hello.
- This is so good.

1919
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:47,809
- Yes, hello.
- I'm such a fan.

1920
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,050
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your food.

1921
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:52,810
(Chef Lee is as popular as buckwheat.)

1922
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:55,150
We didn't even do this one yet.

1923
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,649
(They had forgotten about another delicacy, spicy buckwheat noodles.)

1924
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:01,419
- Gosh.
- I'll mix it.

1925
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,190
(He uses both his hands to mix the noodles to hurry and eat.)

1926
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,890
(Working hard)

1927
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:07,998
Okay.

1928
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:09,429
(The human mixer mixed the spicy buckwheat noodles for them.)

1929
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:12,600
- Gosh, Chef Lee mixed...
- This is going to be so good.

1930
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,860
The buckwheat noodles for us.

1931
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,980
(What does the spicy buckwheat noodles taste like?)

1932
01:18:17,469 --> 01:18:19,509
My chopsticks feel different against these noodles.

1933
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:21,579
- I get it.
- The noodles are so bouncy.

1934
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,408
(Gosh)

1935
01:18:26,409 --> 01:18:27,409
Good?

1936
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,680
(Gosh)

1937
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,748
(They can't help but keep exclaiming.)

1938
01:18:33,749 --> 01:18:36,389
This dish has buckwheat sprouts and yukhoe.

1939
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,189
It's spicy, sweet, and sour,

1940
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,630
so I think this is the dish with the most variety of flavors.

1941
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,469
This is my favorite.

1942
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:53,169
I love the...

1943
01:18:53,969 --> 01:18:55,640
I think this one is my favorite too.

1944
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,708
It screams "main dish."

1945
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:59,709
- Right.
- Yes.

1946
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:01,695
(The spicy buckwheat noodles give off main dish energy.)

1947
01:19:01,719 --> 01:19:04,990
It has... So this is kind of like makguksu, right?

1948
01:19:05,089 --> 01:19:06,089
- Makguksu.
- Yes.

1949
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:09,119
But the noodles have such different flavors.

1950
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:13,029
This is pretty strong for strangers.

1951
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,798
And that's what I love about Korean food.

1952
01:19:14,799 --> 01:19:17,230
I love that. Like right now, my mouth has...

1953
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:19,629
It's spicy,

1954
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,770
there are pickles, it's got sour, it's got sweet,

1955
01:19:22,869 --> 01:19:25,539
it's got everything all at the same time.

1956
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:29,709
- It's like a fire.
- Yes, fire in your face.

1957
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:32,850
I love that. To me, that's Korean food.

1958
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:35,548
It has everything.

1959
01:19:35,549 --> 01:19:39,990
(Each of the different flavors come together to create a new flavor.)

1960
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,458
It could be risky to try and put all those together,

1961
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:45,890
because if they're not right in proportion,

1962
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,030
it could really taste off.

1963
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,659
It's very difficult...

1964
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,829
to balance so many different aggressive flavors...

1965
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:57,400
and make them come together and feel in harmony.

1966
01:19:57,499 --> 01:19:59,709
It was really life-changing for me.

1967
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:01,810
Sometimes,

1968
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:10,820
after eating such a perfect meal,

1969
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,450
I don't want to make anything, you know?

1970
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:15,490
- I see.
- It's...

1971
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:18,659
Mine is not going to be better than this.

1972
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,659
So it's like... But,

1973
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,859
I'll think about it.

1974
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:26,829
To me, this is so perfect.

1975
01:20:27,799 --> 01:20:29,539
- He's praising this very highly.
- Right.

1976
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,708
I have to eat more...

1977
01:20:31,709 --> 01:20:33,868
- Okay.
- and have ideas.

1978
01:20:33,869 --> 01:20:36,780
(It's as if every bite he takes became inspiration.)

1979
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,078
This was so nice.

1980
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:40,079
(This precious moment provided the seasoned chef with inspiration.)

1981
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,378
Did you enjoy your meal?

1982
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:42,379
- Yes.
- Yes.

1983
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:45,520
Eating here today changed my life.

1984
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:48,119
Gosh, it changed your life.

1985
01:20:48,589 --> 01:20:51,458
So can I give you...

1986
01:20:51,459 --> 01:20:53,628
- a gift, Chef Lee?
- Of course.

1987
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:54,730
Wait just a moment.

1988
01:20:55,299 --> 01:20:56,730
(What could the gift be?)

1989
01:20:56,829 --> 01:20:58,700
These buckwheat noodles...

1990
01:20:59,369 --> 01:21:02,239
will be good with any kind of sauce you want to make with it.

1991
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,240
- Okay.
- Yes.

1992
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,709
- This is... Yes, it's powder.
- Powder.

1993
01:21:06,169 --> 01:21:08,009
If you incorporate this...

1994
01:21:08,409 --> 01:21:10,379
into your cooking,

1995
01:21:10,839 --> 01:21:13,409
you'll be able to create something...

1996
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:18,020
that's far greater than anything I make.

1997
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:20,349
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1998
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,989
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1999
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:23,990
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

2000
01:21:23,991 --> 01:21:25,489
Thank you for the food.

2001
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:26,860
(Thank you.)

2002
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:30,700
Now, I want to go back to the US. How do I get this?

2003
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,968
(Just as the flavor of buckwheat filled their mouths, )

2004
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:34,576
(they leave with their hearts filled with warmth.)

2005
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,200
Sometimes, I think...

2006
01:21:37,299 --> 01:21:40,039
the way a person focuses on...

2007
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:42,440
making one thing...

2008
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:45,009
and become a master at one thing...

2009
01:21:46,509 --> 01:21:47,579
makes me envious.

2010
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,249
I can't do that. I'm too impatient.

2011
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,390
You know? So I like to do a lot of things.

2012
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:59,560
Even today, the fishermen, you know?

2013
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,859
They only do one thing in their entire lives.

2014
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:03,930
Yes.

2015
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:07,668
Sometimes, I feel very respectful for...

2016
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:10,799
someone who sticks to one job.

2017
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,269
They're really amazing.

2018
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:15,070
(We applaud those who make an honest living.)

2019
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:16,979
It's a different brain.

2020
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:19,049
A different brain. Definitely.

2021
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:22,850
But I can't ever be a master of one thing.

2022
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:26,150
You know? I master something and then I switch.

2023
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:28,059
Maybe you're a master of switching.

2024
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,520
- Master of switching? Thank you.
- Yes.

2025
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:33,128
Switching isn't easy, either.

2026
01:22:33,129 --> 01:22:34,959
- Right.
- Switching is difficult.

2027
01:22:35,799 --> 01:22:38,730
(From the first day, meeting the master got him thinking.)

2028
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,529
(Not only did he get to taste food, )

2029
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,130
(he also got a taste of someone's life.)

2030
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:49,408
(The feelings from the experience are still lingering for Edward.)

2031
01:22:49,409 --> 01:22:51,110
(Meanwhile, A Sung is driving now.)

2032
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,208
Gosh.

2033
01:22:52,209 --> 01:22:53,810
(Is he about to say what's on his mind?)

2034
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,048
I want dessert.

2035
01:22:55,049 --> 01:22:56,219
Me too.

2036
01:22:56,549 --> 01:22:57,718
I feel the same way.

2037
01:22:57,719 --> 01:22:59,218
- I want either ice cream...
- Something sweet.

2038
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:00,490
Or something sweet.

2039
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:02,658
- I'm craving for something sweet.
- I want ice cream right now,

2040
01:23:02,659 --> 01:23:04,289
- because it's warm right now.
- Right.

2041
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,489
Do you think there's an ice cream place on the way?

2042
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:08,498
Maybe.

2043
01:23:08,499 --> 01:23:10,129
- Should I look it up?
- Yes.

2044
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,128
It would be so great to have something sweet right now.

2045
01:23:13,129 --> 01:23:14,369
(Aggressively searching online)

2046
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:18,270
(Edward can't hide his smile at the thought of having ice cream.)

2047
01:23:18,469 --> 01:23:20,140
The main location...

2048
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:23,740
of a famous cafe is nearby.

2049
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:25,649
Apparently, they're very famous...

2050
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,408
- for their dessert.
- That's my favorite one!

2051
01:23:27,409 --> 01:23:30,118
- Let's go!
- We should go there.

2052
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:32,989
They have coffee and soft serve ice cream...

2053
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:34,989
- and everything.
- We should get takeaway.

2054
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:36,059
- Only to go.
- Don't...

2055
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:38,458
Just run away. Don't tell anybody.

2056
01:23:38,459 --> 01:23:41,129
(Let's run away toward the newly added destination.)

2057
01:23:41,499 --> 01:23:45,730
(As if the world was on their side, the road is open and empty.)

2058
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:47,569
(They arrive at the dessert cafe.)

2059
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:49,669
- Coffee?
- Yes, all of it.

2060
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:52,338
- Let's get everything.
- Get the whole thing.

2061
01:23:52,339 --> 01:23:53,716
(Get everything you want. We're having a party!)

2062
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:55,839
(A Sung and Si A order, )

2063
01:23:56,009 --> 01:23:57,309
Thank you.

2064
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:59,180
(while Edward pays.)

2065
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:01,479
- I'll bring our coffees.
- Okay.

2066
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,548
(Coffee with rich flavor is being prepared for you.)

2067
01:24:02,549 --> 01:24:04,819
Have a bite of the vanilla ice cream.

2068
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:05,949
(They share vanilla ice cream before they begin drinking coffee.)

2069
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:08,459
It really wakes you up, right?

2070
01:24:08,789 --> 01:24:09,989
It wakes you up.

2071
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,129
(Si A takes a bite too.)

2072
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:13,759
So good.

2073
01:24:14,999 --> 01:24:16,029
(The Country Family enjoys the sweetness of the desserts.)

2074
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:17,530
You're right.

2075
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,400
Maybe it's broken now.

2076
01:24:19,469 --> 01:24:20,498
Right.

2077
01:24:20,499 --> 01:24:22,819
(All of a sudden, he puts down his spoon and grabs a pen.)

2078
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,939
Maybe we'll make...

2079
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,669
(What is he doing?)

2080
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:30,179
Noodles.

2081
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,378
(What is he writing so seriously instead of eating the ice cream?)

2082
01:24:31,379 --> 01:24:32,449
Fish soup.

2083
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:33,685
(What is Edward writing so seriously instead of eating the ice cream?)

2084
01:24:33,709 --> 01:24:35,879
(Anguish)

2085
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,820
(He fills the paper with drawings and writings as if he was inspired.)

2086
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:42,490
Is this a recipe book?

2087
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,588
You're drawing pictures of what...

2088
01:24:44,589 --> 01:24:46,359
- you'll be cooking today, right?
- Yes. I just...

2089
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,359
The wrapped cabbage, peppers, cod.

2090
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,829
So I'm going to do cod and then we're going to put like...

2091
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,468
little peppers on top...

2092
01:24:52,469 --> 01:24:54,299
and wrap with cabbage.

2093
01:24:54,869 --> 01:24:56,270
And then we'll steam.

2094
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:00,038
You know, we'll take the bones from the cod and we'll make fish soup.

2095
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:01,485
(Turning the ingredients he saw into his own unique recipe)

2096
01:25:01,509 --> 01:25:05,209
I had so many ideas in my brain.

2097
01:25:05,549 --> 01:25:08,119
To me, it's like a puzzle,

2098
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,280
and we just have to find ways to bridge and connect them.

2099
01:25:12,089 --> 01:25:14,489
(Octopus, buckwheat noodles, cod, sandlance)

2100
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:16,520
(The four puzzle pieces he has)

2101
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:20,030
(What will Edward Lee's first dish using those four pieces be?)

2102
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:24,299
Okay. I think, if we do this, there will be plenty of food tonight.

2103
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,298
(Smacking on lips)

2104
01:25:27,299 --> 01:25:28,369
I can't wait.

2105
01:25:29,339 --> 01:25:30,868
(Just the thought of it makes Si A hungry.)

2106
01:25:30,869 --> 01:25:32,110
Mouthwatering.

2107
01:25:32,869 --> 01:25:33,968
(Edward's 4-course meal)

2108
01:25:33,969 --> 01:25:35,610
- Okay.
- Cool.

2109
01:25:36,839 --> 01:25:40,579
(When the sun goes down, Edward will begin cooking his first meal.)

2110
01:25:41,619 --> 01:25:43,379
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

2111
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,690
I don't see the octopus.

2112
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:51,560
Do you need the octopus now?

2113
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:53,459
Okay.

2114
01:25:53,789 --> 01:25:55,458
(A Sung knows her away around the kitchen now.)

2115
01:25:55,459 --> 01:25:58,019
(A Sung finds the octopus right away and brings it to Chef Lee.)

2116
01:26:01,299 --> 01:26:02,969
I brought the octopus.

2117
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:04,640
I wonder how it's doing.

2118
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:07,538
(The size of it still amazes them.)

2119
01:26:07,539 --> 01:26:08,680
It's still alive.

2120
01:26:09,509 --> 01:26:11,549
We're going to start with the octopus.

2121
01:26:12,009 --> 01:26:13,009
Ready?

2122
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:15,280
(He takes the octopus out of the cooler.)

2123
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:17,219
(Grunting)

2124
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:20,089
(The octopus is so huge that they have to carry it together.)

2125
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:21,450
Gosh, it's heavy.

2126
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:23,819
Here.

2127
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,628
- Is it still alive?
- Yes, it is.

2128
01:26:25,629 --> 01:26:28,129
- Gosh.
- It's still alive.

2129
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,169
So here's what I'm going to do. I'm not going to cook all of it.

2130
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:38,409
(He's going to cut off its legs that are the size of Si A's arm.)

2131
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,908
How many legs?

2132
01:26:41,909 --> 01:26:44,509
- How many legs would you like?
- Three? Four?

2133
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:46,509
One leg per person?

2134
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,249
(One octopus leg per person, coming right up)

2135
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:54,519
(Put the octopus legs straight into the pot.)

2136
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,890
What are we making right now?

2137
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:01,799
So we're going to make grilled octopus.

2138
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,498
Grilled octopus?

2139
01:27:03,499 --> 01:27:05,730
First, I have to...

2140
01:27:05,869 --> 01:27:07,530
boil it slowly...

2141
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:10,468
and make it tender. And then, we finish it on the grill.

2142
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:12,339
We'll finish it on the grill outside.

2143
01:27:12,409 --> 01:27:14,208
He's going to boil it first and then grill it after.

2144
01:27:14,209 --> 01:27:15,969
(They've never heard of this method before.)

2145
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:18,449
The Korean way is to cook it...

2146
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:21,350
very hot, very fast,

2147
01:27:21,509 --> 01:27:23,020
and then eat it right away.

2148
01:27:23,219 --> 01:27:25,249
And this is the exact opposite. It's...

2149
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:28,490
very slow, very low fire.

2150
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,360
And then just tenderly simmer it over a long period of time.

2151
01:27:33,129 --> 01:27:36,030
Look. I'm cooking. I didn't...

2152
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:38,329
- Put anything?
- No, nothing.

2153
01:27:38,969 --> 01:27:40,769
- Water? No water?
- No. No water.

2154
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:42,569
And then what happens is...

2155
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,668
(The broth looks concentrated.)

2156
01:27:43,669 --> 01:27:46,239
- the juice will come out.
- The purple juice?

2157
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,209
Yes. And then it will cover the whole octopus.

2158
01:27:49,539 --> 01:27:51,479
It kind of smells like the sea.

2159
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,949
It kind of smells like octopus soup, yeonpotang.

2160
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:53,979
Right, it smells like yeonpotang.

2161
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:57,048
And then at this point, you cook it very low.

2162
01:27:57,049 --> 01:27:58,989
Very slowly.

2163
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:00,689
Okay. Now,

2164
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:02,889
we're going to start making sauce.

2165
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:04,020
What sauce?

2166
01:28:04,459 --> 01:28:08,530
It's also going to be a new sauce for me.

2167
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:11,969
It's going to be jeotgal chimichurri.

2168
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:14,530
- Jeotgal chimichurri?
- Jeotgal chimichurri.

2169
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,069
(Jeotgal)

2170
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:21,169
(Grilled octopus with jeotgal chimichurri)

2171
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:25,209
(Wait! What's chimichurri?)

2172
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,748
(An Argentinian condiment, )

2173
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:30,048
(it's usually served with meat...)

2174
01:28:30,049 --> 01:28:32,449
(such as steak or barbecue.)

2175
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:34,690
(The fresh herbs and spices go well with grilled meat.)

2176
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:39,789
(Edward is going to use jeotgal to make such an exotic sauce?)

2177
01:28:41,999 --> 01:28:43,799
(7 hours ago at Jumunjin Port)

2178
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,730
(He tried jeotgal by chance.)

2179
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,039
It's so good.

2180
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:53,509
We have this really intense fish-flavored jeotgal.

2181
01:28:53,539 --> 01:28:56,009
So why don't we use that as the base?

2182
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,249
So in chimichurri, you might add paprika to give you spice.

2183
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:04,849
So I thought we could take out the paprika.

2184
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:07,549
Instead, we'll use jeotgal.

2185
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,690
(Seed jeotgal to flavor the grilled octopus)

2186
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,359
I'm going to start...

2187
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,906
(The strong flavors of the East and the West are brought together...)

2188
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:19,100
(by Edward Lee to create jeotgal chimichurri.)

2189
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:21,899
How much should we make? Let's start with that.

2190
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,038
(Put one tablespoon of seed jeotgal into the bowl.)

2191
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:24,469
Garlic.

2192
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:26,669
Add lots of garlic. Then...

2193
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:28,509
Okay. Lemon zest.

2194
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:29,838
Lemon zest.

2195
01:29:29,839 --> 01:29:32,179
(Zest a lemon into the bowl.)

2196
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:33,208
(Pour in a lot of olive oil.)

2197
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:34,480
- Olive oil.
- Olive oil.

2198
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:38,119
This kind of feels like yukhoe sauce.

2199
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:41,990
Right? The combination of minced raw garlic with oil.

2200
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:43,918
(Add a little bit of vinegar.)

2201
01:29:43,919 --> 01:29:46,190
Vinegar and lemon juice.

2202
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,329
That's a lot of lemon juice.

2203
01:29:49,329 --> 01:29:51,669
Then we're going to put in salt.

2204
01:29:51,799 --> 01:29:53,569
(They can smell the fresh flavor of the sauce.)

2205
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:55,468
It smells really fresh.

2206
01:29:55,469 --> 01:29:56,770
Can I try it?

2207
01:29:57,469 --> 01:29:59,110
- Do you want to try it?
- Yes.

2208
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:01,739
(A combination of the East and the West)

2209
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:04,579
(What does Edward Lee's jeotgal chimichurri taste like?)

2210
01:30:06,909 --> 01:30:08,519
- Gosh.
- What do you think?

2211
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,749
Is it good?

2212
01:30:10,049 --> 01:30:11,320
- Very good.
- You think?

2213
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:13,690
(Humming)

2214
01:30:13,691 --> 01:30:14,719
Is it good?

2215
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,360
Gosh.

2216
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:18,390
- It's new.
- This is so good.

2217
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:21,158
Mexican, Korean...

2218
01:30:21,159 --> 01:30:23,429
- It's so balanced.
- It's kind of like salsa.

2219
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:24,899
Yes, and...

2220
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,298
- it's so nice.
- The seeds give a nice texture.

2221
01:30:27,299 --> 01:30:30,439
(Since he used seed jeotgal, even the texture is perfect.)

2222
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,440
I like it.

2223
01:30:34,369 --> 01:30:37,179
How about we add black pepper, or something?

2224
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,748
- Yes, that's what I was going for.
- Sure.

2225
01:30:38,749 --> 01:30:39,780
Look.

2226
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:42,048
(He gives Si A a high five as approval.)

2227
01:30:42,049 --> 01:30:45,390
- Look. She's already...
- Guys, this is my first day.

2228
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:47,990
(Si A is killing it on her first day.)

2229
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:50,690
Tell... We don't need Yo Han.

2230
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:53,459
Yo Han, stay home. You lost your job.

2231
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:57,200
(Yo Han lost without even being here.)

2232
01:30:57,999 --> 01:31:00,569
(Put in a lot of black pepper.)

2233
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:02,400
- We're going to put a lot.
- Yes.

2234
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,739
- Can you slice the perilla leaves?
- Yes.

2235
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,570
- Chop the perilla leaves.
- Thank you.

2236
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:10,708
Typical chimichurri would add lots of parsley,

2237
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:14,879
but, again, we're here in Korea. We don't have a lot of parsley.

2238
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:19,288
I thought perilla leaves were like the parsley of Korea.

2239
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:21,320
You know, it's everywhere and in everything.

2240
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,370
(Edward reinterpreted perilla leaves as the parsley of Korea.)

2241
01:31:24,589 --> 01:31:27,329
(Chopping)

2242
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,600
Beautiful.

2243
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,400
Very nice.

2244
01:31:31,159 --> 01:31:34,129
- Put in there?
- Yes. Let's start with half.

2245
01:31:34,669 --> 01:31:37,869
(Add chopped perilla leaves instead of parsley.)

2246
01:31:38,509 --> 01:31:41,070
(The perilla leaves' aroma is arousing their appetite.)

2247
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:42,739
(The combination of Eastern flavors and Western flavors)

2248
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:43,940
(Jeotgal chimichurri sauce)

2249
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:45,578
See? I think that's enough.

2250
01:31:45,579 --> 01:31:47,748
(What does Edward Lee's unique recipe taste like?)

2251
01:31:47,749 --> 01:31:48,918
- What do you think?
- What do you think?

2252
01:31:48,919 --> 01:31:50,049
So good.

2253
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:53,218
(This is exciting!)

2254
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:54,990
A Sung. Here.

2255
01:31:55,419 --> 01:32:00,659
(Will A Sung and Si A like it?)

2256
01:32:03,799 --> 01:32:04,899
- What do you think?
- It's good.

2257
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,469
- It tastes so good.
- Oh, my.

2258
01:32:06,669 --> 01:32:07,998
It's so good.

2259
01:32:07,999 --> 01:32:09,099
Goodness.

2260
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,570
(This is real.)

2261
01:32:10,999 --> 01:32:12,338
The sour taste is great.

2262
01:32:12,339 --> 01:32:14,209
- I like sour sauce.
- Yes.

2263
01:32:14,969 --> 01:32:16,180
It's so good.

2264
01:32:16,339 --> 01:32:18,239
In a way, it's better than parsley.

2265
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,649
- Right.
- It has a stronger aroma.

2266
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:21,350
Since it has a pungent aroma...

2267
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,450
This is amazing.

2268
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,330
How can you make something like this?

2269
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,249
I'm literally amazed.

2270
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:30,959
Appearing in this show was a great choice.

2271
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:32,489
Eddie!

2272
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:33,758
(The amazing taste makes A Sung act cute.)

2273
01:32:33,759 --> 01:32:34,789
It's so good.

2274
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:37,758
(Today, he had to read the room...)

2275
01:32:37,759 --> 01:32:40,270
(and was scolded by a master chef.)

2276
01:32:40,499 --> 01:32:41,499
(Come on!)

2277
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,940
(Make it larger!)

2278
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,869
(Although he suffered abuse, )

2279
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:47,869
(forget the time when he made salty food.)

2280
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:49,109
It's so good.

2281
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:50,179
(I'm Edward Lee!)

2282
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:51,508
Oh, my goodness.

2283
01:32:51,509 --> 01:32:53,649
- This is crazy.
- It's so good.

2284
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:55,109
(Still admiring the taste)

2285
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:57,350
I thought the sauce made with jeotgal...

2286
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,850
could have a fishy taste.

2287
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:02,218
He just added lemon juice and perilla leaves to it.

2288
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:04,520
But the moment I tasted it,

2289
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:07,430
the rich flavor of olive oil...

2290
01:33:07,759 --> 01:33:10,530
and the spicy and savory flavor of jeotgal were mixed,

2291
01:33:10,829 --> 01:33:12,770
and I could feel the sour taste of lemon in it.

2292
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,100
The more I tasted it, the more I craved it.

2293
01:33:15,169 --> 01:33:18,270
When he added jeotgal, it created a new taste.

2294
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:22,640
I want to bring out that taste again at home, someday.

2295
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:24,640
It's so good.

2296
01:33:25,409 --> 01:33:27,208
- It's totally my style.
- Let me test the octopus.

2297
01:33:27,209 --> 01:33:29,449
(Time to check how the octopus was cooked)

2298
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:30,549
It's okay.

2299
01:33:32,089 --> 01:33:34,950
(Looking nice)

2300
01:33:35,259 --> 01:33:37,159
It smells so good.

2301
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:39,329
This smell is really...

2302
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:42,730
I want to use it as my perfume.

2303
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:47,329
We're just going to marinate it in a lot of olive oil.

2304
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:50,070
- Olive oil.
- It must be so good.

2305
01:33:50,799 --> 01:33:52,909
So, this is ready.

2306
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:54,169
It looks so nice.

2307
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:55,809
It looks good.

2308
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:57,109
I'm so excited.

2309
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:59,025
(Marinate the tenderly cooked octopus legs in olive oil.)

2310
01:33:59,049 --> 01:34:01,748
Okay. Shall we cook octopus?

2311
01:34:01,749 --> 01:34:02,749
- Yes.
- Okay.

2312
01:34:03,549 --> 01:34:05,819
(The main story begins now. The wood-fired octopus)

2313
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,820
Okay.

2314
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:08,189
(Are you ready to enjoy grilled octopus...)

2315
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:09,458
(under the night sky of Gangneung?)

2316
01:34:09,459 --> 01:34:10,919
Okay. Now it's going to sizzle.

2317
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:13,190
I'm going to film this.

2318
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:15,530
(Oh, my. I have to film this.)

2319
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,329
(An octopus leg goes onto the hot grill.)

2320
01:34:26,169 --> 01:34:27,639
It already sounds tasty.

2321
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,008
(Laughing)

2322
01:34:29,009 --> 01:34:30,980
- It sounds tasty.
- Right.

2323
01:34:32,509 --> 01:34:34,249
(One more leg going in)

2324
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:54,499
(Grill the outside crispy over high heat.)

2325
01:35:00,539 --> 01:35:02,479
(The octopus legs have the aroma of firewood...)

2326
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,680
(and are crispy outside and tender inside.)

2327
01:35:06,049 --> 01:35:07,909
(Her mouth waters.)

2328
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:09,850
Yes. Okay.

2329
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:11,378
- Okay?
- I think...

2330
01:35:11,379 --> 01:35:13,749
- one more minute.
- One more minute.

2331
01:35:15,589 --> 01:35:17,269
(Then something catches Si A's attention.)

2332
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:18,729
What's this?

2333
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,759
That's a tentacle.

2334
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,559
- Is this for me?
- Oh, my.

2335
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,899
(Are you giving that tentacle for me now?)

2336
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,929
- It's the lucky one's.
- Lucky.

2337
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:27,010
(Eating without hesitation)

2338
01:35:27,329 --> 01:35:28,498
(Goodness. It tastes so good.)

2339
01:35:28,499 --> 01:35:29,499
- Is it crispy?
- It's so good.

2340
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,338
- Is it?
- It's just so good.

2341
01:35:31,339 --> 01:35:32,859
(Isn't there any tentacle coming off?)

2342
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:33,968
(The time for waiting is over.)

2343
01:35:33,969 --> 01:35:35,609
This one should be done. Okay.

2344
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:37,839
So, if we're going to do...

2345
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:40,280
(At last, the octopus legs are done.)

2346
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:47,020
(Crispy outside, soft and tender inside)

2347
01:35:48,759 --> 01:35:51,560
(Cutting it into a bite-size)

2348
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,959
Our crazy sauce.

2349
01:35:55,289 --> 01:35:56,759
Crazy chimichurri sauce.

2350
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:58,199
(Finishing with jeotgal chimichurri)

2351
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,700
Since it tastes crazy good, we can name this...

2352
01:36:02,799 --> 01:36:05,508
- crazy chimichurri...
- Crazy chimichurri...

2353
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:06,610
octopus...

2354
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:09,408
Since "crazy" is "michin" in Korean,

2355
01:36:09,409 --> 01:36:10,409
- michin, - Michin.

2356
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:12,109
- it's michinchurri.
- Michinchurri?

2357
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:13,479
- Michinchurri?
- Michinchurri?

2358
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,749
Michinchurri sounds good.

2359
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:16,119
Michinchurri.

2360
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:17,878
Michinchurri grilled octopus.

2361
01:36:17,879 --> 01:36:21,419
(Their first night in the trip will be happy...)

2362
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:28,089
(with a dish they never tasted anywhere in the world.)

2363
01:36:32,129 --> 01:36:33,829
It's grilled octopus.

2364
01:36:34,169 --> 01:36:35,439
Michinchurri octopus.

2365
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,721
(Country Cook's first dish, michinchurri grilled octopus)

2366
01:36:39,709 --> 01:36:43,640
(Spicy and refreshing sauce on the crispy and tender octopus)

2367
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:46,249
Ta-da.

2368
01:36:46,709 --> 01:36:47,980
Please enjoy.

2369
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:51,149
(Taste it.)

2370
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:53,118
- Michinchurri.
- Michinchurri.

2371
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,418
(Dashing with chopsticks)

2372
01:36:54,419 --> 01:36:55,819
I'd like to grab one in the middle.

2373
01:36:56,119 --> 01:36:57,918
- So...
- Enjoy.

2374
01:36:57,919 --> 01:36:58,990
Happy.

2375
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:02,659
(Taking a mouthful)

2376
01:37:04,459 --> 01:37:06,999
(Intensely moved)

2377
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,270
Very cool?

2378
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:14,139
(They never tasted something like this.)

2379
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:15,980
- It's so good.
- It's to die for.

2380
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:21,908
(One more bite)

2381
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:23,350
This is really good.

2382
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,379
- Since it tastes sour, - Right.

2383
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,418
It feels like sweet and sour octopus salad.

2384
01:37:27,419 --> 01:37:28,419
Yes.

2385
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:30,088
It has a taste similar...

2386
01:37:30,089 --> 01:37:32,530
- to an octopus with ponzu sauce.
- But it's grilled.

2387
01:37:32,659 --> 01:37:34,059
(Crispy and tender grilled octopus has a maximized chewy texture.)

2388
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:36,829
I love it grilled.

2389
01:37:38,259 --> 01:37:41,100
We usually have chimichurri with meat,

2390
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:42,639
and it's my first time...

2391
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,199
- having it with octopus.
- Yes.

2392
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,640
So it feels very new,

2393
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:49,379
but somehow, the taste makes me glad.

2394
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,040
Right. That's exactly how it feels.

2395
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:58,119
- It's crispy. I like it.
- It's crispy.

2396
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:02,520
It opens a door...

2397
01:38:02,619 --> 01:38:04,789
of the new level of octopus.

2398
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:09,729
(The happiest look she made today)

2399
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:12,060
It tastes so good that it makes me tearful.

2400
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,030
It's so good.

2401
01:38:14,969 --> 01:38:15,998
(Edward Lee created this feeling.)

2402
01:38:15,999 --> 01:38:17,099
I feel so happy.

2403
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,699
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy too.

2404
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,969
It tastes so good, really.

2405
01:38:21,409 --> 01:38:23,439
- Thank you.
- It makes me excited.

2406
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,232
(His first dish makes them look forward to the next one.)

2407
01:38:25,256 --> 01:38:26,896
(Grilled octopus was just the beginning.)

2408
01:38:26,956 --> 01:38:28,385
(Country members are surprised...)

2409
01:38:28,786 --> 01:38:30,555
(by the next ingredient, sandlance.)

2410
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:32,424
(I'm going to use the buckwheat flour.)

2411
01:38:32,425 --> 01:38:33,866
(Buckwheat flour?)

2412
01:38:34,265 --> 01:38:37,095
(They still have three dishes left to taste.)

2413
01:38:38,265 --> 01:38:40,135
(His creative recipes only make them admire.)

2414
01:38:40,805 --> 01:38:43,435
(Eddie's Korean-American dishes are created.)

2415
01:38:46,275 --> 01:38:49,916
(The feast of tastes widens their eyes.)

2416
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:52,546
(Byun Yo Han is back.)

2417
01:38:52,786 --> 01:38:54,515
(I'll have a couple costume with you.)

2418
01:38:54,946 --> 01:38:58,684
(Eddie and Yo Han have a chemistry of bromance.)

2419
01:38:58,685 --> 01:39:00,655
(Did you go to the bathroom?)

2420
01:39:00,656 --> 01:39:01,685
(What?)

2421
01:39:02,326 --> 01:39:05,666
(With Yo Han, the spirit of members are lifted up.)

2422
01:39:06,196 --> 01:39:09,765
(Yo Han comes up with an idea of a treat.)

2423
01:39:09,895 --> 01:39:11,634
(Are you saying we can make it as a party?)

2424
01:39:11,635 --> 01:39:13,235
- Would you want to...
- Okay.

2425
01:39:13,966 --> 01:39:15,982
(That's how the members started the treat mission.)

2426
01:39:16,006 --> 01:39:17,635
(Shall we start it now?)

2427
01:39:18,435 --> 01:39:19,845
Is peanut butter going in?

2428
01:39:20,305 --> 01:39:24,175
(Edward Lee cooks with a special recipe for the elderly.)

2429
01:39:25,246 --> 01:39:27,286
(We have a problem here.)

2430
01:39:27,946 --> 01:39:31,716
(Country members face unexpected situations.)

2431
01:39:32,086 --> 01:39:33,325
(Appearing right after are the elderly in the countryside...)

2432
01:39:33,326 --> 01:39:34,455
(who are scarier than Anh Sung Jae.)

2433
01:39:34,456 --> 01:39:35,586
(Running)

2434
01:39:38,456 --> 01:39:41,095
(Would they be able to treat without a problem?)

2435
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,400
Dramaday.me
