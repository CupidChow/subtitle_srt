1
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:33,598
(A place where you can feel the true beauty of Korea)

2
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:35,252
(The second destination, Andong)

3
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:38,962
(Eddie's family is back as special guests.)

4
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:41,268
(Yo Han was curious about Eddie and Dianne's love story.)

5
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,909
(So what dishes did you teach me to cook?)

6
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:45,973
(Eddie and Dianne's love story has begun.)

7
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,302
(It felt like the universe was sending me a sign.)

8
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:50,942
(It's so romantic.)

9
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:55,411
(Dianne and Arden are in love with Andong ingredients.)

10
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:57,011
(I think this has become one of my favorite Korean dishes.)

11
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,541
(In love with Andong jjimdak)

12
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,542
(A special recipe using Andong ingredients)

13
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:02,612
(And the first dessert on Country Cook)

14
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:05,122
(Never-before-seen Christmas Eddie-tion)

15
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:08,352
(This is so...)

16
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:12,162
(Will the Country brothers satisfy their tastes?)

17
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:15,162
(Edward Lee's Country Cook)

18
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:20,531
You said Dianne often cooked at home.

19
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:21,602
Yes.

20
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:24,442
Is it all delicious? Or is it...

21
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:27,001
Nobody is perfect.

22
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,612
My wife makes mistakes. I make mistakes too.

23
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,012
You eat her food and it doesn't taste good.

24
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:35,151
It's not what you expected.

25
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:36,751
- If so...
- Do you just eat it anyway?

26
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:40,322
If so, I suddenly say, "I need to go to the restaurant."

27
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:42,522
"I'll see you later."

28
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:45,492
- I leave...
- "I'm busy."

29
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:46,992
and eat a burger.

30
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,361
Don't tell her my secret.

31
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:51,902
That's so wise.

32
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,972
(I feel like I hear something.)

33
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:56,902
Okay.

34
00:01:57,302 --> 00:01:59,742
Next thing is strawberries.

35
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:03,412
First, we're going to make the sauce.

36
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:04,842
I'll show you.

37
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:06,782
Take this.

38
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:08,812
(Slicing off the top)

39
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,551
Maybe 20?

40
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:12,722
- Twenty?
- Yes.

41
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,752
We cut off the unripe part and only use the ripe part.

42
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:16,922
Exactly.

43
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:21,032
I've never cooked with another guy before.

44
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,662
- Isn't it fun?
- It's so fun.

45
00:02:24,932 --> 00:02:26,162
It's so fun.

46
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,672
I'm going to really use what I learned from you.

47
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:30,872
- Really?
- Really.

48
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:36,072
And what I'm going to do is make...

49
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,512
(He'll use fresh cream to fill the hotteok.)

50
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,812
(A heaping tablespoon of cream cheese)

51
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,152
(Next, to add freshness, )

52
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,122
(some gently grated lemon zest)

53
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:46,882
(Sugar)

54
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:50,192
(5 teaspoons of sugar, Sweetness is a must.)

55
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,762
(Mix it.)

56
00:02:53,392 --> 00:02:55,562
Korean people like cream cheese, right?

57
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:56,792
They do.

58
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,401
They love it.

59
00:02:58,402 --> 00:02:59,932
(Eddie likes cream cheese too.)

60
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:04,741
(Shall I have a taste?)

61
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:05,742
(Licking)

62
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:08,442
(Nice.)

63
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:09,941
- Try that.
- This?

64
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:11,012
Thank you.

65
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:14,812
- Is it okay?
- It's delicious.

66
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:16,482
(Proud)

67
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:20,822
(How will Andong strawberries taste with cream cheese?)

68
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:23,992
Okay. I'm going to put this in the freezer.

69
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:26,822
(Putting the fresh cream cheese in the freezer to cool)

70
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:28,632
Give me a mission.

71
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,561
Okay. Let's put this in the fire.

72
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:35,332
- Just melt this?
- Yes.

73
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:36,772
Oh, my.

74
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,642
- And add a little bit of sugar.
- Okay.

75
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:43,072
- And a little bit of water.
- Water.

76
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:46,012
Then I'm going to add the yogurt drink.

77
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:48,982
I'm going to check right now.

78
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:54,222
(Cooking down into a sweet sauce)

79
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:58,061
(Strawberry hotteok sauce)

80
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:02,431
(Once the strawberries cook down, blend the mixture in a blender.)

81
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,492
Okay.

82
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:07,332
Strawberry sauce.

83
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:10,671
(Strawberry hotteok sauce)

84
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:12,742
(Put the blended sauce into the freezer to cool.)

85
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:15,171
Okay. I'm going to put this in the freezer.

86
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,312
Okay. The next one is...

87
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:19,482
It's going to be a bit harder.

88
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,312
- Here.
- Okay.

89
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,652
I want to put cream cheese in the middle.

90
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:25,782
So like this.

91
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,052
- I see.
- A little bit.

92
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:29,991
This looks hard.

93
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:31,061
Like this. A little.

94
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,122
I'll give it a try.

95
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,952
(Scoop out a little bit from the middle of the strawberry.)

96
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:37,132
(Worried)

97
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:42,302
Oh, this isn't easy.

98
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:48,572
(Unconfident hands)

99
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:52,142
- Kyun.
- Yes.

100
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:53,282
I don't think I can do this.

101
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:55,781
- Kyun.
- Yes.

102
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:56,881
(I'm not a chef!)

103
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:58,322
(Laughing)

104
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:01,191
- I'm sorry.
- You have to do it.

105
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:02,852
I'll do things I can do, but...

106
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:05,092
(Eating)

107
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,022
- Did you eat...
- I'll give it...

108
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,932
- I'll give it one more try.
- Okay.

109
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,302
- Don't give up.
- All right.

110
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:16,101
(Super focused)

111
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:17,302
(His pride hangs on this now.)

112
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:18,971
From the side.

113
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:21,542
(Handling it gently like a baby)

114
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:24,812
(Pursed lips)

115
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,842
(This should be okay, right?)

116
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:28,212
(Done)

117
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:33,021
(He quickly finishes...)

118
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,291
(the second strawberry too.)

119
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,352
Okay.

120
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:40,692
(Yo Han focuses as much as he can so he can help Eddie.)

121
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:44,362
Let me see.

122
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,502
(He's kind of embarrassed about his work.)

123
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,671
- But...
- I'll go for quantity over quality.

124
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:51,802
I'll keep going.

125
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:54,141
It's hard to make the scoops...

126
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:55,911
because these strawberries are too small.

127
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:57,781
It's too... Just a little bit.

128
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:59,212
- Like this.
- Right. A thin slice.

129
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:00,952
This isn't easy.

130
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:03,252
You do that, and I'll make the...

131
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,781
If you cut them, I'll do the scooping part.

132
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,782
Okay.

133
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:11,722
That's too small.

134
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,022
(Eating)

135
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,332
- Okay.
- Isn't it too small?

136
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,032
- It's okay.
- I'll use a big one.

137
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:22,172
Yes. Big ones are nice.

138
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:27,642
Okay. I think we're good.

139
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:30,371
Good job.

140
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:31,412
- Thank you.
- Good work.

141
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:33,012
Okay.

142
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:36,652
And the hotteok should be ready by now.

143
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:38,521
Should I bring the dough over?

144
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:39,552
Yes.

145
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,622
Oh, I think it looks good.

146
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:44,862
Right? Like this.

147
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,462
Watch this.

148
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:47,962
A little.

149
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:49,632
(Poking)

150
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:51,832
(Poking)

151
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:54,572
(Poking)

152
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,001
You need to make the sound.

153
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:57,102
- Poke, poke.
- I see.

154
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:59,072
- Poke, poke.
- Yes.

155
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:00,942
- Poke, poke.
- Exactly.

156
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:03,512
- Is this the right sound?
- It is.

157
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:04,782
Poke, poke.

158
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,041
Why do we have to do that?

159
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,581
You want to check... When you push it in,

160
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:10,582
- it should bounce back up.
- I see.

161
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:12,121
Do you see the bubbles?

162
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:14,021
Do the bubbles need to be gone?

163
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:15,151
No, bubbles are good.

164
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,292
- They're okay?
- Yes.

165
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:18,961
- Take this whole thing.
- The dough turned out well.

166
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:19,992
Yes.

167
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:22,092
There. Okay.

168
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,562
We're going to take a little bit.

169
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:27,332
- Pinch.
- Okay.

170
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:28,472
Okay?

171
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:32,171
Do you see that? Look at that.

172
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:33,348
(Lightly tap the dough to spread it out into a thin sheet.)

173
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:34,572
Make it thin.

174
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:36,742
Like making dumplings?

175
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:37,881
(Yes!)

176
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:39,612
Now, what we're going to do is...

177
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,482
We'll add a strawberry.

178
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:46,021
A little bit of cream cheese, then strawberry.

179
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:47,621
(Add the strawberry and cream cheese and wrap the dough around it.)

180
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,152
Then wrap the hotteok up.

181
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:51,492
Just like that.

182
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,591
(Shaping the hotteok)

183
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:57,131
I'm just going to put it right here, just like that.

184
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:59,572
(Fluffy white hotteok dough with strawberry and cream cheese)

185
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:01,602
Is this too big?

186
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,642
- It's a bit sticky.
- Yes, you have to make it thinner.

187
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:06,002
(Make it thinner!)

188
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:08,512
(It's not that easy!)

189
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:10,542
It's too big.

190
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,141
I see that.

191
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,181
(I tried my best.)

192
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,781
- They're a bit big, right?
- Too big.

193
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:16,488
(Cutting off some of the dough that Yo Han made)

194
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,682
(Staring)

195
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:21,291
You should do it like this.

196
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,452
- What?
- Together.

197
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:26,462
I should just add a finger there. I can't do this.

198
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:31,532
Yo Han is becoming a very good chef.

199
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,501
He still makes mistakes.

200
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:35,371
I think moments like that are very funny,

201
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:38,042
and they keep the kitchen light-hearted.

202
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,142
(Shutting his mouth)

203
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:43,111
(A Sung and Si A are curious about what they're cooking.)

204
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:44,542
- Let's just go and check.
- Yes.

205
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,112
Seeing how they're not picking up...

206
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,282
- They must be really busy.
- Yes.

207
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,122
- They must need some help.
- Yes.

208
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:53,482
Yo Han!

209
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:54,892
Chef!

210
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,552
Where are they?

211
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,392
- There they are!
- Here they are.

212
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:00,962
(Running over)

213
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,731
(We're here to help.)

214
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:04,862
Yo Han. Chef.

215
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:06,761
- Look who's there.
- Hello. How are you doing?

216
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,102
We tried to video call you.

217
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:11,772
- We can't pick up now.
- We figured that was the case.

218
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:13,901
- We came for an interim check.
- Thank you.

219
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:15,312
Are these hotteok?

220
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:17,371
(Eddie seems to have a lot that he wants to say.)

221
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,842
I need...

222
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:21,352
Delicate fingers.

223
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,081
You know, very gentle.

224
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:24,112
He's like...

225
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:26,051
- He's very tough.
- Yes.

226
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:27,522
So I need very delicate fingers.

227
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,491
So he needs someone with more delicate technique.

228
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:31,592
Take a break.

229
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:33,191
It's okay, Kyun.

230
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:34,291
Take a break.

231
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,791
(Very upset)

232
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,432
- I'll try to change.
- Okay.

233
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:39,501
Do you want to cut kimchi?

234
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:40,932
- Then we can put...
- Okay.

235
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:43,532
This isn't easy. Seriously.

236
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:47,272
I used to be in an origami class.

237
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:49,641
I used to do Korean paper art.

238
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:50,672
I see.

239
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:53,282
- Okay. I'll show you one.
- Okay.

240
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,381
- I take one.
- One strawberry.

241
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,381
- And this is cream cheese.
- Oh, that must be delicious.

242
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:58,828
- Oh, yummy.
- A little bit of cream cheese.

243
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,021
(A Sung and Si A quickly absorb Eddie's explanation.)

244
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:02,352
Close. Bye-bye. And then...

245
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:04,422
just cover it.

246
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:05,891
- Mouth-watering.
- Okay.

247
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:06,991
- See?
- Okay.

248
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:08,331
(That's enough theory.)

249
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:10,092
We'll get started.

250
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:14,032
(Cooking is about application.)

251
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:17,001
You can relax now. We're here.

252
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:18,878
(Super reliable A Sung and Si A to the rescue!)

253
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:20,502
(I feel more at ease now.)

254
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,142
(Adding the strawberry)

255
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,012
(Squeezing out some cream cheese)

256
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:28,722
(Adding the strawberry to cover)

257
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:30,882
(The hotteok process is going very smoothly.)

258
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,522
Like this? Okay.

259
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:35,991
Chef. Look.

260
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:38,362
- What? Oh, my.
- Look how I made it.

261
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:41,292
(Passing on the first try)

262
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,631
(Now, I'll show you the skills of a Korean paper art student.)

263
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,262
- Squeeze.
- This is fun.

264
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:47,562
- Things like this are fun for us.
- Yes.

265
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:50,802
(Adding the strawberry without any errors)

266
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:53,502
(Impressive technique)

267
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,912
(Korean paper artist A Sung's hotteok art)

268
00:10:58,142 --> 00:10:59,911
(The round hotteok doughs quickly fill the pan.)

269
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:02,281
We're a complementary pair.

270
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:04,112
- Right.
- Let's see. How many do we have?

271
00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:06,321
One, two, three, four, five. Okay.

272
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:07,322
- Enough?
- One more?

273
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:08,951
- One more?
- We have one more strawberry left,

274
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:10,152
so we'll make one more.

275
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,792
- Okay.
- Add lots of cheese.

276
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:13,322
- Lots of cheese?
- Yes.

277
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,592
- This much?
- Si A. Wait.

278
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:15,932
It's going to come out.

279
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:17,391
It's for A Sung.

280
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:18,401
I asked her.

281
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:19,661
- It's customized for A Sung.
- But it's going to come out.

282
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:20,761
I asked her.

283
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:22,972
- Yes, lots of cheese for A Sung.
- I love cheese.

284
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:24,272
(Edward suddenly cuts a strawberry.)

285
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:26,442
- Look. For you.
- One more?

286
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,672
No. Just eat it.

287
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,771
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

288
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,212
(One for Si A)

289
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:35,952
(One for A Sung too)

290
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,111
Hold on.

291
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:38,281
This is lemon cream cheese, right?

292
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,551
- You put lemon in it.
- Yes.

293
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:40,581
- I added lemon.
- You're right.

294
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:41,951
- This is so delicious.
- How did you know that?

295
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,651
- Can you feel it right away?
- Of course, I can.

296
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:44,992
The scent of lemon.

297
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,922
Oh, you added lemon zest.

298
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,368
- Wait. This is so delicious.
- This is so delicious.

299
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,312
- Are there more strawberries?
- Strawberries...

300
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:54,012
Why are there so little strawberries?

301
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:56,371
- There are no strawberries.
- Who was it?

302
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:57,412
(Looking around nervously)

303
00:11:57,602 --> 00:12:00,201
- He ate two, and I ate two.
- Why are the strawberries...

304
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:01,541
- Why did you eat them all?
- Kyun.

305
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,312
- Tell them the truth.
- Should I?

306
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,741
(What happened to our strawberries?)

307
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:08,852
He messed up on the first several, so we...

308
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:10,312
Did you throw them away?

309
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:12,381
(Case number 202500)

310
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:13,742
(Case of the missing strawberries)

311
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:15,951
(He failed this difficult mission and damaged the strawberries.)

312
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,928
(Nobody saw that, right? Getting rid of the evidence)

313
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:20,032
(I'm sorry, strawberry. Getting rid of the evidence)

314
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:21,831
(He's getting bolder and bolder.)

315
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:22,992
(Getting rid of the evidence)

316
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:24,592
(And then a man appeared...)

317
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:26,492
(Getting rid of the evidence)

318
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:28,812
(That's too small. Getting rid of the evidence)

319
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,172
(Cold-blooded Edward even ate the living strawberries.)

320
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,502
(That's how the strawberries started to go missing.)

321
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:37,372
(We're in this together. Let's keep it a secret, Kyun.)

322
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,142
(Moving past the case of the missing strawberries)

323
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,551
Baby hotteok.

324
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,212
(They continue to make hotteok.)

325
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:46,782
(Adding the last hotteoks onto the pan)

326
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:49,192
(The hotteoks are ready to go.)

327
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:51,892
Hold on. Now that we're done with this,

328
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,522
- let's go to Dianne and Arden.
- Right.

329
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,532
- We're almost finished.
- Really?

330
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,592
- Yes.
- If so...

331
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,832
I think we have less than half an hour.

332
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:01,571
- Okay.
- Okay.

333
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,071
Okay. Thank you so much.

334
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:04,772
- Thank you.
- See you.

335
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:07,472
Let's go.

336
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:10,111
- I was feeling bad...
- Exactly.

337
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:12,352
That the two of them were doing everything on their own.

338
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,212
- I'm glad it's almost done.
- Yes.

339
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:17,752
- Wait, Kyun.
- Yes?

340
00:13:18,622 --> 00:13:20,752
How can you tell them that I messed all of them up?

341
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:22,752
I don't want...

342
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:26,091
We ate them together.

343
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:27,852
(Yo Han starts to express his frustrations.)

344
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:30,691
I get nervous, and then I...

345
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,432
Me too. I understand.

346
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,101
Let's make hotteok.

347
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:36,208
(Time to forget about the bad things and finish making hotteok.)

348
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,001
(The kitchen feels more relaxed thanks to A Sung and Si A's help.)

349
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,671
The big one with a lot of cheese.

350
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:43,272
(Placing the hotteoks one at a time into the pan with oil)

351
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:45,711
That smells amazing.

352
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:46,712
(Become delicious.)

353
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:47,912
That looks good.

354
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:49,852
(Salivating)

355
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:51,782
Nice.

356
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:56,222
I think I can make hotteok at home now.

357
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,722
(Of course, you can make it at home.)

358
00:14:00,662 --> 00:14:02,182
- Did they turn out well, Kyun?
- Yes.

359
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:03,992
Beautiful.

360
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:05,501
Okay. Are you ready?

361
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,502
(Next up)

362
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:07,502
Snow.

363
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:09,532
(Snow)

364
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:11,841
It's snowing.

365
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:15,141
Doesn't this remind you of Gangwon Province?

366
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:16,442
- The snow.
- Yes.

367
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:20,041
(Strawberry cream hotteok with some snow on top)

368
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,181
And then, strawberry sauce.

369
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:24,512
(And strawberry yogurt sauce to dip the hotteok)

370
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:28,921
(Snowflake strawberry hotteok with strawberry sauce on the side)

371
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:29,952
Okay. So.

372
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:31,992
Let's make chickens.

373
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:35,132
(Let's review the recipe from last week.)

374
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:37,291
(Spicy chicken and non-spicy chicken recipe)

375
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,378
(Stuff the chicken with stir-fried ginkgo nuts and vegetables.)

376
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:40,861
(Spicy chicken and non-spicy chicken recipe)

377
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,371
(Massage lemon oil inside and outside of the chicken skin.)

378
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:44,212
(Refer to Episode 4 for the lemon oil recipe!)

379
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:46,842
- Oh, and we pan-fry it.
- Yes.

380
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:54,081
(Add the chicken, salt, vegetables, and chicken broth into a pot.)

381
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:58,981
(Cover with a lid and cook on low heat for about 30 minutes.)

382
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,482
I'm going to use very low heat.

383
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,652
Okay. Let's do the garlic.

384
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:05,761
Okay.

385
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:07,192
Can you open this for me?

386
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:09,131
- Let's do...
- Yes.

387
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:10,531
(Add whole garlic cloves.)

388
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:11,532
Okay.

389
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,001
- This too.
- A little bit.

390
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,002
Oh, dear.

391
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:16,132
And I'm going to add macaroni.

392
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,342
(Macaroni?)

393
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,572
(Why not? Macaroni!)

394
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:26,211
I wanted to...

395
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:29,082
The jjimdak had these delicious noodles in it.

396
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:32,352
And it was kind of like... The noodles were swimming...

397
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,821
inside of the sauce.

398
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:36,352
I kind of wanted to mimic that.

399
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,092
But in America, we would use pasta.

400
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:40,962
So we did macaroni pasta.

401
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,362
(Do you see my plan now?)

402
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:46,032
(Yes, chef!)

403
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,301
Let's try the macaroni.

404
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:50,902
(How does macaroni with Korean broth and garlic taste?)

405
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,172
- Okay. Yes, good.
- Is it okay?

406
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:55,342
(He's not giving me any.)

407
00:15:55,712 --> 00:15:57,112
Right.

408
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:58,342
Try this.

409
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:00,811
(Eddie doesn't forget to offer Yo Han some.)

410
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:01,812
Here.

411
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,782
(He finally gets a taste.)

412
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,721
That really stimulates my appetite.

413
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:07,362
- Because it's so delicious.
- It's done.

414
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,992
(Since the macaroni is cooked, should we finish things off?)

415
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:11,991
(First, the non-spicy chicken.)

416
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,192
Lemon chicken.

417
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:16,632
(Squeezing fresh lemon juice on the non-spicy chicken)

418
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:20,202
(Cheese)

419
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:22,901
A happy chicken.

420
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:25,201
(Grating some cheese on top for the non-spicy chicken)

421
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:26,771
All right. Almost finished.

422
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:28,912
(Non-spicy chicken is finished.)

423
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:36,152
(I'm a totally non-spicy chicken)

424
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:38,952
Okay, the spicy one.

425
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:41,172
- This is the spicy one, right?
- Yes.

426
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:42,391
(Red chili, Spicy chicken recipe)

427
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,392
(Add a generous amount of red chili.)

428
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:44,721
(Add black pepper.)

429
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:46,361
And then we add kimchi,

430
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:48,022
add chives, and then finish.

431
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,132
- You're putting kimchi in here?
- Yes.

432
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:51,901
I'm adding kimchi.

433
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:53,031
(With the addition of spicy kimchi, Eddie surprised Yo Han once again.)

434
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,662
Oh, beautiful. Okay.

435
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:57,371
(Cheese for the non-spicy chicken, chives for the spicy chicken)

436
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:58,972
Nice. Look at that.

437
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:01,572
(You thought that was it, right?)

438
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:04,712
(His one last secret weapon!)

439
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,242
(What is this black sauce?)

440
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,112
It's the jjimdak sauce.

441
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:13,052
- So I'm going to... Yes.
- It's strong.

442
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:16,092
I'm going add this and reduce it now.

443
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,452
A little bit of sugar.

444
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:18,772
(Another teaspoon of sugar)

445
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,422
(Low heat)

446
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:22,531
- Make it thick.
- Yes, make it thick.

447
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:23,832
That's right. Thick.

448
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:28,772
(They had left the jjimdak sauce to cool down a bit.)

449
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:33,972
(Eddie's spicy chicken meets Andong jjimdak.)

450
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:36,312
There we go.

451
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,711
Ready? One, two, three.

452
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:40,042
Ta-da. It's done.

453
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,752
(I'm a hot spicy chicken)

454
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,952
Beautiful. Two chickens.

455
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:49,951
Let's have dinner.

456
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,092
(It's time for dinner!)

457
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,221
- I did well, right?
- Yes.

458
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:56,331
- Was I helpful?
- Always.

459
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:57,731
- Seriously.
- I trust you.

460
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:59,531
- Thank you.
- You trust me, I trust you.

461
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:00,931
Oh, they're coming.

462
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:02,202
Oh, really?

463
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,902
- Shall we go?
- Dinner's ready. Come on.

464
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:06,001
They're ready.

465
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,041
Dinner's ready?

466
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,542
Yes, it's all ready now.

467
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:10,342
Do you know what's also ready?

468
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:13,481
- No.
- Snowball fight.

469
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:15,281
(Arden runs away.)

470
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:18,421
Dad is always prepared for some pranks.

471
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,582
(Like father, like daughter, Arden's surprise attack!)

472
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:22,652
(Here's one more!)

473
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:24,622
No, that's too big.

474
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,491
- Small.
- Oh, that's a big one.

475
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,062
Oh, this isn't big enough?

476
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:29,261
(Eddie woke the prankster inside of Arden.)

477
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:30,992
Oh, my goodness. I'm leaving.

478
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:34,261
I always stand back because you never know.

479
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:35,402
(Right on target)

480
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:39,202
I've been caught in the line of fire too often. Believe me.

481
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,741
(Today's appetizer is snow!)

482
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:43,972
It's snowing!

483
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:46,112
Come on. Eat this snow.

484
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:47,282
Okay.

485
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:49,812
Don't.

486
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,521
(You trust me, right, Dad?)

487
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,152
(You shouldn't!)

488
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:58,352
(Arden got him good.)

489
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,892
I knew you were going to do that.

490
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,831
- The food got done very quickly.
- It really did.

491
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,902
- I'm glad. I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry.

492
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:10,201
- Let's go to the restaurant...
- Yes.

493
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:12,542
- and set the table.
- Yes, we'll do that.

494
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,841
Ready? We're going in circles.

495
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:15,842
(We made up.)

496
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:18,111
Are you trying to go that way?

497
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,742
Which way? This way?

498
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:21,541
All right. Then you have to go backward.

499
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,412
(Let's go to the restaurant on Daddy's feet.)

500
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:24,982
Here we go.

501
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:27,952
Let's take our shoes off...

502
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:30,591
and put them in our shoe closet. Do you remember?

503
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:32,562
Always. The shoe closet.

504
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:35,792
I like this tradition.

505
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:40,362
- Welcome.
- Welcome to Edward's Diner.

506
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:43,232
- Chicken two ways.
- Yes.

507
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:46,202
You know I'm not just going to do one thing.

508
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:49,542
(Today's special dinner for the ladies in Eddie's life)

509
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:52,211
And since it's Christmas,

510
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:54,282
I wanted to make something special.

511
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,982
(For your sweet tooth, Snowflake strawberry hotteok)

512
00:19:58,252 --> 00:20:01,482
This is spicy chicken pasta.

513
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:05,022
Most of us will probably eat from this chicken.

514
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:06,761
- I see.
- Oh, my.

515
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:09,132
(Spicy chicken for the adults!)

516
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:13,502
This is savory cheese chicken pasta.

517
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:16,232
Arden, you're going to eat from this chicken.

518
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:19,772
(Non-spicy chicken for Arden!)

519
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,742
So please enjoy.

520
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:23,772
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

521
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:25,611
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you so much.

522
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:27,542
- You're welcome.
- Thank you for the food.

523
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:29,911
Which part do you like?

524
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:31,821
I love the leg.

525
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,581
The legs? Sure.

526
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:34,982
(A Sung serves Arden first.)

527
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:37,422
Yes, that looks delicious.

528
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:39,361
(You always have to eat the leg first.)

529
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,292
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

530
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:43,431
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

531
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:45,402
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

532
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:48,602
- Here you go, honey.
- Oh, thank you.

533
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:51,841
Shall I dig in?

534
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:53,002
(Si A will serve herself.)

535
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,942
(Foodie Si A is ready to eat.)

536
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,941
- Do you want a leg?
- Yes.

537
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:59,422
- Where should... I'll put it here.
- Yes, please put it here.

538
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:04,552
(Shall I try Dad's cooking?)

539
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:06,121
Arden, what do you think?

540
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:08,482
I kind of made this while thinking about you.

541
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:10,651
Made with...

542
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:11,922
(Nervous)

543
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:15,862
Arden is the toughest food critic in the world.

544
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:20,862
So if she doesn't like something, she says it.

545
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:24,702
And she does not worry about hurting my feelings.

546
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,632
(What does food critic Arden think about the non-spicy chicken?)

547
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:32,382
(Epicure Arden's food tasting 1. Take a bite of the white meat.)

548
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:35,112
(Looking over at Dad)

549
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:37,281
(Chewing well, )

550
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:39,082
(then pausing)

551
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:43,022
(He can't tell what Arden is thinking.)

552
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:46,691
(Epicure Arden's food tasting)

553
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,572
(2. Take a bite of the leg, her favorite part.)

554
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,761
(Prim and serious)

555
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:53,102
(My score is...)

556
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,092
(He can't tell what Arden is thinking.)

557
00:21:58,562 --> 00:22:00,561
(Epicure Arden's food tasting)

558
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,572
(2. Take a bite of the leg, her favorite part.)

559
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:05,641
(Prim and serious)

560
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:06,771
(My score is...)

561
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:09,212
No wonder it tasted better than your usual one.

562
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:12,882
(This cute girl)

563
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:15,081
She's really eating a lot of this one.

564
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:16,282
- Really?
- Yes.

565
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:19,121
(You don't need to say a lot...)

566
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:22,352
(when it comes to tasty food.)

567
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:26,392
She ate all of the chicken.

568
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:28,291
Being a chef dad,

569
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:31,391
the best feeling in the world is when I made something...

570
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,161
and I just see her eating it.

571
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:35,062
She doesn't even have to say anything.

572
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:38,171
I can just feel... You know, it feels good in my heart.

573
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:39,172
(Eating to the bone)

574
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,401
And now, I'll try this one.

575
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,012
(Eddie finally relaxes and starts to eat.)

576
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:48,142
(What do the Country members think about the non-spicy chicken?)

577
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:50,181
Oh, thank you. You're always so considerate.

578
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:52,452
- It's on the way.
- Okay.

579
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:55,122
(Dianne tries the non-spicy chicken too.)

580
00:22:57,452 --> 00:22:58,992
- Isn't it delicious?
- Yes.

581
00:22:59,262 --> 00:23:00,491
This is just your taste.

582
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,332
- Like mild.
- Yes, that's right.

583
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,532
(A deep and gentle flavor from the vegetables and broth)

584
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:10,571
(This was worth the hard work.)

585
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:12,871
Inside... All of the vegetables.

586
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:14,471
- Inside.
- Inside.

587
00:23:14,472 --> 00:23:16,071
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hello.

588
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:18,411
They usually put rice...

589
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:20,442
- Yes.
- inside of chicken. Do you know?

590
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:23,212
So if you open it, all of the vegetables come out.

591
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:26,822
- I've never seen it with macaroni.
- That was a good idea.

592
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:29,391
- Oh, my gosh.
- Should we have a taste?

593
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:31,392
(A refreshing combination of chicken and macaroni)

594
00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:35,192
(A bite with lots of macaroni!)

595
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,032
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

596
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:40,261
I've never tasted something like this before.

597
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:42,832
- The thickness was perfect.
- Oh, my.

598
00:23:44,472 --> 00:23:46,171
This one is really good.

599
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:47,672
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

600
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:51,012
Oh, my gosh. It's really great.

601
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:55,682
I didn't think chicken and macaroni would go so well together.

602
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:59,421
Using macaroni was a brilliant idea.

603
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:01,228
(Macaroni was the perfect pairing for spicy chicken.)

604
00:24:01,252 --> 00:24:02,891
I think there's also kimchi in here.

605
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,651
That's why it's so refreshing.

606
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,291
I forgot we put kimchi in there.

607
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:09,032
- The kimchi is tasty.
- The kimchi is great.

608
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:13,162
(The secret to the spicy flavor was kimchi.)

609
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:16,431
The crunchiness of kimchi and the macaroni went well together.

610
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:18,272
You know barbecue chicken.

611
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:20,041
That barbecue sauce chicken.

612
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,271
It tastes like that barbecue sauce...

613
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,211
was turned into a spicy broth,

614
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,712
added on top of oven-baked chicken, and mixed together.

615
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,711
(With chicken, macaroni, and kimchi, )

616
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:30,952
(spicy chicken was recreated by Eddie's personal touch.)

617
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:34,022
This is good.

618
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:37,852
And now, I'll try this one.

619
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,221
That ginkgo nut is so interesting.

620
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,721
Right? I love ginkgo nuts.

621
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:43,791
That's why the texture is nice. You fried them.

622
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,292
(Interesting texture)

623
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:47,761
Make sure to get some of the ginkgo nuts.

624
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:48,902
Yes, the ginkgo nuts.

625
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:51,872
The ginkgo nuts are so good.

626
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,272
When we were cooking the ginkgo nuts earlier,

627
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:57,441
we coated them in oil and lightly fried them.

628
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:59,081
- The ginkgo nuts?
- In Korea,

629
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,182
- we fry them.
- Right.

630
00:25:00,842 --> 00:25:02,412
That's why the texture is so good.

631
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:04,312
Exactly. And it's crunchy.

632
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:06,822
Thank you.

633
00:25:07,782 --> 00:25:10,651
I learned from you too. We did it together.

634
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:12,421
- Was frying it your idea?
- Yes.

635
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:14,182
I asked, "What do you think?" and then he...

636
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:17,892
You guys bonded in the kitchen.

637
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:19,731
My chef brother.

638
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:21,962
(Eddie's approval, my chef brother Yo Han)

639
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:23,531
This is so delicious.

640
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,871
(Thanks to these two guys, they have a delightful dinner.)

641
00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:26,618
- This one is really...
- It makes your mouth water.

642
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:28,971
I could easily eat up to three pieces.

643
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:30,641
This one... I could eat the whole thing.

644
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:31,988
- Infinitively, for sure.
- The entire chicken.

645
00:25:32,012 --> 00:25:35,341
I could keep eating, switching between this and that.

646
00:25:35,342 --> 00:25:36,858
(Endless eating by switching back and forth)

647
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:38,211
It kind of reminded me of this.

648
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:40,451
A classic combo for any Korean,

649
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,622
fried chicken and seasoned chicken.

650
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:47,162
Yes, that moment when both just have to be together.

651
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:49,531
One piece, then another, and another...

652
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,261
I ended up eating so much.

653
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:55,871
(Perfect combo of half-and-half non-spicy chicken and spicy chicken)

654
00:25:55,872 --> 00:25:58,631
This is perfect for a Christmas dinner.

655
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,041
- Right, Christmas.
- Yes, Christmas.

656
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,241
Christmas dinner.

657
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:02,312
Yes.

658
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:04,212
You did it again.

659
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:06,941
- It's hard.
- I'm okay.

660
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,711
- Thank you.
- You made it.

661
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:10,582
- Thank you, chef.
- Thank you.

662
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:14,182
I'm running out of ideas.

663
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:17,552
(He feels like opening a new restaurant every week.)

664
00:26:18,422 --> 00:26:21,121
(Country Cook isn't easy.)

665
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,861
(Hang in there, Dad.)

666
00:26:22,862 --> 00:26:24,831
One week from now... I don't know.

667
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:26,601
Don't worry. You've got us.

668
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:27,831
- Okay.
- We'll make it.

669
00:26:27,832 --> 00:26:28,832
All right.

670
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:30,231
(Please take good care of my husband.)

671
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:31,232
Make some progress.

672
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,442
Strawberry hotteok is coming.

673
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,111
Oh, this is the one. This is it.

674
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:37,432
(Time to recharge the confidence)

675
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:38,881
Gosh.

676
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,218
(This is the dessert time Arden's been waiting for.)

677
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:43,511
This is Andong strawberry hotteok.

678
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:45,582
(Snowflake strawberry hotteok)

679
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:47,952
With lemon cream cheese...

680
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:50,151
and strawberry sauce.

681
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,632
(Filled with lemon cream cheese, topped with strawberry sauce)

682
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:55,932
I'll take one here. Like this.

683
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:57,891
(Dip it in the strawberry sauce.)

684
00:26:57,892 --> 00:26:59,762
- Dip it.
- Dip it in the strawberry sauce.

685
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:03,002
(Let me try one first.)

686
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:06,142
(We want some too.)

687
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,342
Go for it, Arden.

688
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,541
(Dipping it generously in the strawberry sauce)

689
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,612
- You go get the sauce.
- Good job.

690
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:17,381
(A big bite)

691
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,051
- Thank you.
- Good sauce, isn't it?

692
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,082
Yes, I know.

693
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:23,722
That way, everyone has their own sauce.

694
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:26,192
- Thank you.
- Let me take a bite.

695
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,031
- What?
- Sauce, please.

696
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:30,962
(Pass me some sauce too.)

697
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:32,132
Isn't it good?

698
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:35,462
(Si A takes one bite too.)

699
00:27:35,463 --> 00:27:36,572
Isn't it good?

700
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:40,971
- This is crazy.
- It's really good.

701
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:42,412
(Delicious)

702
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:43,912
(A Sung tries it too.)

703
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,741
You took the big one.

704
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,512
(A flavor that makes her eyes pop open)

705
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,221
- It's so good.
- It's really good.

706
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:54,281
Delicious.

707
00:27:54,282 --> 00:27:59,692
(The sweetness of strawberry hotteok that made everyone fall in love)

708
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:03,631
(Foodie Si A is recharging with happiness.)

709
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:05,192
- Really good.
- Yes.

710
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,031
Somewhere between a donut and hotteok,

711
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:11,272
that's what I felt about the texture.

712
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:15,642
The familiar taste of Korean rice cakes along with...

713
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:19,941
the lemon cream cheese and strawberry sauce mixed in,

714
00:28:19,942 --> 00:28:22,512
create two completely new and unique flavors.

715
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,951
- This is so good.
- It's very fresh tasting...

716
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:28,151
but not too sweet.

717
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:29,722
- Not too sour.
- Yes.

718
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:32,022
- This is...
- This is really good.

719
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:33,791
So delicious.

720
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:34,891
(Arden takes a big bite, filling her mouth.)

721
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:35,972
(Already on her second one)

722
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:38,662
You like this one?

723
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,761
- You want to share one?
- Good?

724
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,432
(Dad is proud.)

725
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:45,602
Tissue.

726
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:47,741
(But it's so good. I couldn't stop.)

727
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:48,742
No.

728
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:51,041
(The look that makes Chef Dad happy.)

729
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,112
It is so tasty.

730
00:28:52,512 --> 00:28:54,642
The desserts are always so delicious.

731
00:28:54,812 --> 00:28:56,711
I really want to sell this.

732
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:57,712
Yes.

733
00:28:57,713 --> 00:28:59,051
We can go to Insa-dong,

734
00:28:59,052 --> 00:29:00,622
and set up a little...

735
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,021
hotteok shop.

736
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:03,022
- Strawberry hotteok.
- It sounds good.

737
00:29:03,023 --> 00:29:04,521
Edward's strawberry hotteok.

738
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:06,762
I'll work part-time as a side job.

739
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,162
- Do it all at once.
- Okay.

740
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:11,491
Don't worry, Dad. The dishes are already clean.

741
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:13,332
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

742
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:15,261
Good job, Na Mi. Good job.

743
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:17,072
- She finished everything.
- Good job, Na Mi.

744
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:19,142
- Hearty appetite, Na Mi.
- For real.

745
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:22,101
Dessert is really important, right?

746
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:24,272
That's right. The next day...

747
00:29:24,812 --> 00:29:27,812
what you remember is, a lot of times, dessert.

748
00:29:28,742 --> 00:29:29,781
- I see.
- Yes.

749
00:29:29,782 --> 00:29:31,651
Because it's the last thing you eat.

750
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:32,682
Exactly.

751
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:35,521
Is it like the ending scene in a movie?

752
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:36,992
Yes.

753
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:41,022
Well, good ending scene today.

754
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:42,632
Look.

755
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:44,662
Good ending scene, Arden?

756
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:46,602
Yes, definitely.

757
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:47,932
This is...

758
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,571
This is a really sharp and insightful question I've got.

759
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:51,572
Yes.

760
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:54,302
Did you fall for Dianne first?

761
00:29:56,112 --> 00:29:57,271
- All of a sudden?
- Did you...

762
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:59,542
Did you fall in love first? With Dianne?

763
00:30:01,142 --> 00:30:02,281
Do you want to talk about it?

764
00:30:02,282 --> 00:30:04,182
(He suddenly speaks in Korean to Dianne.)

765
00:30:04,852 --> 00:30:05,852
(She didn't understand.)

766
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:08,082
Kyun, are you flustered?

767
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:09,991
Would you like to talk about it?

768
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:12,152
Why do you speak in Korean to Dianne?

769
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:14,191
Why in Korean...

770
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,931
- I was confused.
- I said the question was sharp.

771
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:17,161
(I got confused.)

772
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:18,592
It was too sharp, I guess.

773
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:21,462
So, where did you meet?

774
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:24,802
We were introduced by mutual friends.

775
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:26,702
- I see.
- Yes.

776
00:30:26,703 --> 00:30:28,801
But it was not a set-up. It was not a set-up.

777
00:30:28,802 --> 00:30:30,971
It was just a coincidence.

778
00:30:30,972 --> 00:30:32,542
We met at a restaurant.

779
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:34,582
We met at a restaurant.

780
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,552
Wait, did you get my... No, I got your phone number.

781
00:30:37,812 --> 00:30:39,251
No, I gave you my phone number.

782
00:30:39,252 --> 00:30:41,122
- Yes.
- I gave it to her.

783
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:43,822
And I said, "Call me."

784
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:48,661
(Eddie is so cute.)

785
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:51,492
He says, "Maybe we do something next weekend?"

786
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:54,231
And I was like, "Yes, okay."

787
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:56,671
And then I made plans...

788
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:58,672
to go to Chicago with friends...

789
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:00,801
instead.

790
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:01,871
You canceled it?

791
00:31:01,872 --> 00:31:04,112
Well, so I called him to cancel.

792
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:05,741
I'm like, "Oh, I'm sorry."

793
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:09,451
"I'm going to the Taste of Chicago instead."

794
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:10,511
And he's like...

795
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:12,152
(How did Eddie react to Dianne's call?)

796
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:14,622
"Oh, I'm going to be at a booth there."

797
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:19,092
So she was calling to cancel my date...

798
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:22,222
because she was going to Chicago, but I forgot.

799
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:24,792
- To go to Chicago?
- I'm also going to Chicago.

800
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:26,831
- What a coincidence.
- So I said,

801
00:31:26,832 --> 00:31:27,862
"How lucky."

802
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:30,632
"I'm also in Chicago too."

803
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:33,972
- Very fateful.
- That was fate.

804
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:37,412
That was fate. That was where we had our first date, in Chicago.

805
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:39,411
Really, true fate always finds...

806
00:31:39,412 --> 00:31:41,382
- a way to bring people together.
- That is fate.

807
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:43,712
So romantic.

808
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:46,181
- It is a movie.
- Yes, we're like magnets.

809
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:48,352
(We are like magnets.)

810
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:52,791
Very happy, beautiful moments...

811
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,421
(The happy and beautiful moments they spent together)

812
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:56,992
She's my wife. She's my best friend.

813
00:31:57,562 --> 00:32:00,402
She is everything.

814
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:04,132
(The precious result of love like a movie, Arden)

815
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:07,771
(This is so sweet.)

816
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:10,311
Well, thank you. That's a very nice Christmas gift.

817
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:11,342
Yes.

818
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,312
I mean, you're Santa.

819
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:16,411
(The Eddie Santa theory sparked by Arden)

820
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:17,451
Santa.

821
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,922
Those iconic looks, the beard...

822
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:23,221
(Actually, he does look like Santa Claus.)

823
00:32:23,222 --> 00:32:24,692
You don't think that's Santa?

824
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:26,522
Hey.

825
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:29,961
This is Santa.

826
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:33,962
(Delicious food and lots of cheerful laughter)

827
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,231
This is the best Christmas.

828
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:39,102
It's been 40 years since I've spent time...

829
00:32:39,242 --> 00:32:40,402
with new family members.

830
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,242
So it's the first time, right?

831
00:32:45,072 --> 00:32:47,041
It's great to go for a walk after a meal.

832
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:48,081
Right.

833
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:49,611
(Country members are heading out for a walk after dinner.)

834
00:32:49,612 --> 00:32:51,982
- The air is so fresh.
- That was a good walk.

835
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:55,322
The air feels clean.

836
00:32:57,152 --> 00:33:00,022
The mountains and trees are so beautiful.

837
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:02,461
(After a warm meal, what kind of scenery awaits next?)

838
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:04,761
Shall we go to the bridge?

839
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:06,302
- Yes, the bridge.
- Wolyeonggyo.

840
00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:09,062
Let's go.

841
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:10,772
- So beautiful.
- Yes.

842
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:12,702
It's a very famous place.

843
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:17,912
(Stepping out and walking, when lost in the scenery...)

844
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:23,212
(there appears a picturesque bridge over the vast Nakdong River.)

845
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:26,881
(Wolyeonggyo is a bridge built...)

846
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:29,451
(to honor the heartfelt love of a couple.)

847
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:31,921
(Their noble love story makes it a popular spot...)

848
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:35,222
(for many couples visiting Andong.)

849
00:33:36,562 --> 00:33:37,762
Gosh, look at the bridge.

850
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:41,432
- Gosh.
- This is so beautiful.

851
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:44,232
- That's nice.
- Great.

852
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:48,102
- So beautiful.
- This feels great.

853
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:50,272
It is a very beautiful sky.

854
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:54,482
Oh, look at that. Look at the moon on the water.

855
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:56,752
Moon boat. Yes.

856
00:33:58,212 --> 00:33:59,282
Nice colors.

857
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:01,352
That must have been so much fun too.

858
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:02,521
- Yes.
- Gosh.

859
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:03,751
(Moon boat enjoying the view of Wolyeonggyo while riding the moon)

860
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,022
- Picture.
- Great.

861
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:08,892
How is it? This means, in English... How it goes?

862
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:11,832
Yes, it's very pretty so far.

863
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:14,462
Shall we go this way?

864
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:16,331
- Sounds good.
- Yes, sure.

865
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:17,371
This is so pretty.

866
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:18,671
(How will Wolyeonggyo greet...)

867
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:19,872
(the Country members?)

868
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:22,771
- So beautiful.
- Gosh.

869
00:34:22,772 --> 00:34:24,341
(Golden lights make the walking path elegant.)

870
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:26,312
- That's nice.
- How beautiful.

871
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:29,041
This place would look so beautiful on camera.

872
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:31,382
We're lucky to spend Christmas here.

873
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:35,382
Well, even when people become friends...

874
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:37,951
they wouldn't meet so often.

875
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,421
They wouldn't set a date, and have a meal together often.

876
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:42,362
But for us,

877
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:44,962
how many meals have we had in just four days?

878
00:34:45,192 --> 00:34:46,762
We had three meals a day,

879
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,862
so we've definitely had over 12 meals.

880
00:34:49,932 --> 00:34:54,002
(Country members have become a true family.)

881
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,542
Look at this wonderful structure.

882
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,881
Gosh.

883
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:04,082
It's beautiful.

884
00:35:04,712 --> 00:35:06,481
Gosh, it's so beautiful.

885
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:08,598
(Country members indulge in the night view of Andong.)

886
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:09,751
(Eddie is looking up something.)

887
00:35:09,752 --> 00:35:10,752
Here.

888
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:13,862
Arden. I want to show...

889
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:16,491
Here.

890
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:18,992
(What does Eddie want to show Arden?)

891
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:21,001
(The root of Eddie and Arden)

892
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:25,372
(The photo of Eddie's grandmother)

893
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:29,142
Arden. I just want to show you one thing.

894
00:35:31,472 --> 00:35:34,181
- You know, you have your grandma.
- Yes.

895
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:35,511
- She's my mother.
- Yes.

896
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:38,712
She loves you so much. She's always good to you.

897
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:44,322
So, I also have my grandmother too.

898
00:35:44,652 --> 00:35:46,092
You've never met her.

899
00:35:46,462 --> 00:35:48,191
So, that's my grandmother.

900
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:49,392
Great-grandma?

901
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:53,431
(First time seeing Dad's grandmother and Arden's great-grandmother)

902
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:55,202
And she lived here.

903
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:59,402
In Korea. And she came here one time.

904
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:03,742
And this is her home. And this is her land. Okay?

905
00:36:05,742 --> 00:36:07,142
You've never met her.

906
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,651
But she was a very important person to me.

907
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:12,722
Okay? So, I want you to just understand.

908
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:15,752
It's really important.

909
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:20,962
When I come to Korea, I always think about...

910
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:24,491
My grandmother.

911
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,162
(My beloved grandmother)

912
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,132
I still feel her inside me.

913
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:33,842
She's a really important person in my life.

914
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:38,912
I know that struggle and they had a hard life.

915
00:36:40,212 --> 00:36:43,812
They gave us the opportunity to have a better life in America.

916
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:47,151
(Now, it's his turn to give her daughter the love...)

917
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:51,422
(he received from his grandmother.)

918
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,422
I think my life has been so fulfilling.

919
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:58,462
I know that I have a Korean side.

920
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:01,962
I want Arden to understand it.

921
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:09,241
(Dear my daughter Arden, I want you to remember...)

922
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:14,742
(my grandmother and Korea, which is part of your root.)

923
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:25,752
Whenever I come here, I think about my grandmother.

924
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:28,521
So, we say, "Hello, Grandma."

925
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:29,662
Hello, Grandma.

926
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:32,802
"Nice to see you." Okay?

927
00:37:33,732 --> 00:37:38,202
(Cherished time with family that he wouldn't trade anything with.)

928
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:41,802
And, everybody, say hello to my grandmother.

929
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:45,841
- Hello.
- Hello, Grandma.

930
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:48,212
(Eddie tries to lighten the mood with a smile.)

931
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:50,352
Okay. Thank you.

932
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:53,352
- Thank you.
- This is a very nice evening.

933
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,492
I'm touched. All the love. Yes.

934
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:01,291
(A Sung, thank you for making this trip possible for us.)

935
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:02,462
Dianne.

936
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:04,591
It's a wonderful Christmas.

937
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,602
You said no crying.

938
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:11,632
Why did you tell me?

939
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:15,341
You're crying.

940
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:17,371
- No.
- Because of my grandmother.

941
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:20,342
It's really an honor to be a part of this.

942
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:22,142
- Thank you, honey.
- Thank you.

943
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:26,752
He doesn't always talk about things from his childhood.

944
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:28,981
And for him to bring it up...

945
00:38:28,982 --> 00:38:32,352
at that particular time was very meaningful.

946
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:35,191
And I know that they were so close.

947
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:37,832
And I know she was there with us.

948
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,961
I felt connected to my ancestors.

949
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:45,531
And I really could understand...

950
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:48,602
his home country and his grandmother a lot more.

951
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:50,641
- I love you.
- I love you.

952
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:52,011
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

953
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:53,111
- Bye.
- Take care.

954
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:54,241
- Please come visit.
- Take care.

955
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:55,382
I'll root for you.

956
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:57,652
I'll always support you.

957
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:00,151
He's on our side.

958
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:01,381
Inside.

959
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,781
He's always on our side.

960
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:04,222
- So lovely.
- Safe trip.

961
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:05,452
Thank you.

962
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:10,532
Could you take a picture of us?

963
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:14,962
We'll take a picture together. Six of us.

964
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:17,772
Let's take a picture. A family photo.

965
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:24,341
(The first day in Andong captured in a photo)

966
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:26,312
Smile. One, two, three.

967
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:29,711
(Country members' first family photo on Wolyeonggyo Bridge, Andong)

968
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:31,651
- Okay.
- Love you, guys.

969
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:33,651
- Bye.
- Bye.

970
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:36,222
(The first day in Andong was filled with heartwarming moments.)

971
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:40,992
(The second day of the Andong trip)

972
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,932
(Everyone is enjoying a relaxing morning.)

973
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:51,932
(Where is this sound coming from?)

974
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:53,801
(A Sung is still sleeping.)

975
00:39:53,802 --> 00:39:55,522
(Si A is busy doing something next to her.)

976
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,912
(Strawberries and whipped cream?)

977
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,882
(Strawberries taste the best in the morning.)

978
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:09,221
(Gosh, she scared me.)

979
00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:10,852
(Si A. What are you doing there?)

980
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,251
(Freeze, tag!)

981
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:13,392
Good morning.

982
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:15,192
(Good morning.)

983
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:16,762
When did you wake up?

984
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:19,132
I woke up about ten minutes ago.

985
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:23,978
(How about morning strawberries?)

986
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:25,202
Do you want some strawberries?

987
00:40:25,772 --> 00:40:27,072
Yes. Morning strawberries.

988
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,641
Strawberries to wake up.

989
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:29,712
I love that.

990
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:32,411
- With whipped cream?
- Totally.

991
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:34,282
(Foodie Si A's Strawberry Restaurant is open.)

992
00:40:36,112 --> 00:40:38,982
(The owner eats it more.)

993
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:40,451
It's so delicious.

994
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:42,991
- Isn't it so good?
- It's really good.

995
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:44,992
(Customer Review: Fresh food and a friendly owner)

996
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:46,522
It just woke me up.

997
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:48,492
It totally woke me up.

998
00:40:49,022 --> 00:40:51,132
(He's still sleeping. Yo Han is here.)

999
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:54,362
(Eddie is gone?)

1000
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:57,132
(What does Eddie do in the morning?)

1001
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,802
(Bright laughter is welcoming us.)

1002
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:04,642
(What makes Eddie smile in the morning?)

1003
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,012
- Do you need help?
- No.

1004
00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:08,382
I'm going to jump.

1005
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:10,552
- No.
- No, you're going to trot.

1006
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:14,051
Dad, if you tell them you can jump that,

1007
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:16,322
you're going to die. So, you lie.

1008
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:17,821
We can't have you get injured.

1009
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:19,991
- Come on.
- If you lie, you die in this sport.

1010
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:21,961
- In other sports...
- Oh, it rhymes.

1011
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:23,831
No, in other sports...

1012
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:25,872
(Where are they having a frightening conversation?)

1013
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:28,732
(Clip-clop)

1014
00:41:29,772 --> 00:41:32,272
(Connecting with horses while dashing through the wind)

1015
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:35,442
(Time for Arden who loves horses)

1016
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:38,411
(Arden is ready.)

1017
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,441
(Let's ride a horse.)

1018
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:41,641
(Eddie is ready.)

1019
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:42,842
(I'll show you how good I am.)

1020
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:45,381
Oh, boy.

1021
00:41:45,382 --> 00:41:47,698
(How skilled are the father and daughter at horse riding?)

1022
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:48,781
(Arden is warming up with the working canter.)

1023
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:49,922
There you go.

1024
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:52,592
(Riding a horse steadily)

1025
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:54,592
Arden, shoulders back.

1026
00:41:57,362 --> 00:42:00,132
(I'll unite with a superior horse.)

1027
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:04,172
Oh, dear.

1028
00:42:06,572 --> 00:42:09,472
- Oh, gosh.
- No.

1029
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:12,112
That's a very nice horse.

1030
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,042
Wait.

1031
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:16,652
Dad. Don't canter.

1032
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,051
(I will do canter.)

1033
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:21,582
Oh, nice canter.

1034
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:25,052
(The dignity of the master)

1035
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:30,692
(A picture-perfect jump)

1036
00:42:30,992 --> 00:42:32,662
(10 out of 10)

1037
00:42:33,332 --> 00:42:35,602
Looking good, Arden. Edward?

1038
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:37,431
Oh, dear.

1039
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:38,432
(Eddie gives up.)

1040
00:42:40,702 --> 00:42:43,002
(Dad. Cheer up.)

1041
00:42:43,212 --> 00:42:44,412
Do you want to see me canter?

1042
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:47,441
No, I want to see you trot.

1043
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:49,281
- I just did. I just tried.
- No. I was watching you.

1044
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:51,052
I saw you do this.

1045
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:53,422
(Mimicking him almost perfectly.)

1046
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:55,652
I just tried to run the entire ring.

1047
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:57,492
I know, but you didn't do it well.

1048
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:01,092
See? Beautiful. Beautiful form.

1049
00:43:02,522 --> 00:43:03,561
Good riding.

1050
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:05,892
(The next spot to enjoy time with family)

1051
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:09,202
(The spot where Dad picked for Arden, who loves animals)

1052
00:43:09,402 --> 00:43:11,122
- Would you like to touch it?
- No, thanks.

1053
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,001
(I'll give my daughter the opportunity.)

1054
00:43:13,002 --> 00:43:15,342
Look at this guy. That's very pretty, though.

1055
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:18,241
(Arden, the fearless animal lover)

1056
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:19,682
(Placing the snake around her neck.)

1057
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:22,511
- This is...
- Oh my gosh.

1058
00:43:22,512 --> 00:43:24,051
An African bullfrog.

1059
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:25,181
(The next friend is an African bullfrog.)

1060
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:26,482
Oh, dear.

1061
00:43:26,882 --> 00:43:28,582
We both like midnight snacks.

1062
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:33,991
(Making happy memories in Andong)

1063
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:35,192
That's a good day.

1064
00:43:35,762 --> 00:43:37,931
- Oh, my gosh. That was so much fun.
- Yes.

1065
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:41,862
(We hope Eddie's family had a loving time together.)

1066
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:45,402
(2 hours later)

1067
00:43:45,702 --> 00:43:49,202
(Eddie begins to work.)

1068
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:51,972
(Would you like to try the dinner I'm going to make?)

1069
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:54,482
(In this place?)

1070
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:58,652
(What are you going to do?)

1071
00:43:58,952 --> 00:44:02,322
(Right here? Serving these people?)

1072
00:44:02,382 --> 00:44:04,122
(Kyun...)

1073
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,592
(Trust me!)

1074
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:09,932
(Guest Greeting Project is back.)

1075
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:13,061
(It began with what Yo Han said.)

1076
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:14,732
(Guest Greeting Project)

1077
00:44:15,502 --> 00:44:17,601
(A party)

1078
00:44:17,602 --> 00:44:19,532
(Not just a party. It's a chaotic party.)

1079
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:24,372
(The first project had many mistakes.)

1080
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:26,842
(Clenching his teeth)

1081
00:44:26,843 --> 00:44:29,742
(Eddie showed his magic in the toughest circumstances.)

1082
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:32,581
(Food ingredients take on a new life in Eddie's hands.)

1083
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:33,722
This is amazing.

1084
00:44:34,182 --> 00:44:36,222
(Two thumbs up)

1085
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:38,351
(It delighted the taste buds of the locals in Gangwon Province.)

1086
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:39,821
You did a great job.

1087
00:44:39,822 --> 00:44:42,542
(The beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will the future be.)

1088
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:45,762
(You may have body aches, though.)

1089
00:44:45,832 --> 00:44:48,101
(But you want us to do it again?)

1090
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,131
- Hi.
- Hello. How are you?

1091
00:44:50,132 --> 00:44:52,172
(Visiting the Head House with 400 years of history)

1092
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:55,102
(We need to please the Head House family's taste buds!)

1093
00:44:57,072 --> 00:45:00,141
That was... It was very nerve-racking...

1094
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:01,212
for me to do the bow.

1095
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,812
The person with long hair. Is he famous?

1096
00:45:03,982 --> 00:45:05,752
He was on "Culinary Class Wars."

1097
00:45:05,882 --> 00:45:07,182
I didn't watch that show.

1098
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:12,121
(What kind of dishes...)

1099
00:45:12,122 --> 00:45:15,562
(will Andong's ingredients turn into?)

1100
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:17,731
(Eddie capturing the Head House elderly's tastes)

1101
00:45:17,732 --> 00:45:19,062
(Coming soon)

1102
00:45:20,508 --> 00:45:21,838
What's the plan today?

1103
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:24,248
Today, we'll have a traditional culture experience.

1104
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:26,707
We call it a head house.

1105
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:30,077
It's a family with a very long history.

1106
00:45:30,078 --> 00:45:32,877
There, we'll experience the ancestral rites...

1107
00:45:32,878 --> 00:45:34,347
that has been passed down...

1108
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:37,357
since the Joseon era.

1109
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:39,057
- And we'll eat together.
- Okay.

1110
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:40,628
- Are we eating with them?
- Yes.

1111
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:41,808
It was very special for me.

1112
00:45:42,188 --> 00:45:45,358
That's something I've only seen in pictures before.

1113
00:45:45,528 --> 00:45:47,568
So it's very meaningful.

1114
00:45:47,698 --> 00:45:50,468
And it's very touching and thoughtful.

1115
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:52,938
It's quite an honor to be able to...

1116
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:55,437
be invited into someone's home...

1117
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:56,938
to see this.

1118
00:45:58,378 --> 00:45:59,408
Let's go.

1119
00:45:59,578 --> 00:46:02,107
What will happen today?

1120
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:04,108
(Let's go and experience Korea's holiday culture.)

1121
00:46:11,858 --> 00:46:15,088
The food for the ancestral rites...

1122
00:46:15,528 --> 00:46:16,687
- The ancestral rites?
- Yes.

1123
00:46:16,688 --> 00:46:18,368
- The food for the ancestral rites.
- Yes.

1124
00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:22,498
Is it different from your ordinary Korean cuisine?

1125
00:46:23,468 --> 00:46:25,968
It's more traditional Korean cuisine.

1126
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:27,867
And one thing special about it...

1127
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,708
is that they don't use garlic.

1128
00:46:29,808 --> 00:46:31,408
- No garlic?
- No.

1129
00:46:31,678 --> 00:46:32,678
Why?

1130
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:35,278
They believe that the dead won't be able to find the way back.

1131
00:46:35,408 --> 00:46:37,447
Even in the States, they use garlic...

1132
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:39,217
- to chase away ghosts.
- Yes.

1133
00:46:39,218 --> 00:46:40,388
It's the same thing.

1134
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:43,128
I guess garlic really is strong in that sense.

1135
00:46:43,688 --> 00:46:45,918
It even turned a bear into a human.

1136
00:46:46,258 --> 00:46:47,258
You're right.

1137
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:49,027
- A human...
- I didn't know that.

1138
00:46:49,028 --> 00:46:51,497
So I shouldn't use garlic today?

1139
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:52,598
- No.
- Okay.

1140
00:46:53,398 --> 00:46:55,727
Are there other rules?

1141
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:56,897
There are quite a lot.

1142
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:58,968
- A lot?
- Yes, it's very strict.

1143
00:46:59,768 --> 00:47:01,638
But things are changing nowadays.

1144
00:47:01,938 --> 00:47:04,577
They now put the food the dead used to like...

1145
00:47:04,578 --> 00:47:06,238
when they were still alive.

1146
00:47:06,538 --> 00:47:07,677
I saw a family...

1147
00:47:07,678 --> 00:47:09,707
who put fried chicken on the rite table.

1148
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:11,677
- Fried chicken?
- Yes, fried chicken.

1149
00:47:11,678 --> 00:47:13,117
- They ordered it for the rite.
- Exactly.

1150
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:14,217
They put pizza and chicken,

1151
00:47:14,218 --> 00:47:16,618
- the food the dead liked.
- That's right.

1152
00:47:16,848 --> 00:47:18,287
I heard some did that.

1153
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:19,658
I think it's nicer that way.

1154
00:47:19,918 --> 00:47:23,488
I do think a lot of stuff in Korea is related to food.

1155
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:27,298
We even set up a table full of food for the deceased.

1156
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:29,398
That's our way of paying respect.

1157
00:47:29,698 --> 00:47:30,898
You're right.

1158
00:47:32,668 --> 00:47:35,268
I'm starting to get the vibe.

1159
00:47:35,868 --> 00:47:37,307
(Where did the Country Family go for Eddie?)

1160
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:39,008
Do you see the thatched houses?

1161
00:47:40,548 --> 00:47:42,277
That's amazing. It's completely...

1162
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:43,677
(Hahoe Village, Andong, is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.)

1163
00:47:43,678 --> 00:47:46,017
- It's like I'm in the Joseon era.
- It's Joseon.

1164
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:48,347
- What's this?
- It's amazing.

1165
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:50,494
(The Country Family is deeply in love with Hahoe Village.)

1166
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:52,688
(I can't take my eyes off of them.)

1167
00:47:53,088 --> 00:47:55,227
I feel like I should be riding a horse...

1168
00:47:55,228 --> 00:47:56,728
instead of driving a car.

1169
00:47:59,158 --> 00:48:01,497
(Hahoe Village in Andong...)

1170
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:03,668
(feels different from the hanok lodging.)

1171
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:06,338
Are these all called "hanok?"

1172
00:48:06,568 --> 00:48:07,638
- Hanok. Yes.
- Hanok.

1173
00:48:09,938 --> 00:48:13,338
This place is bigger than I thought.

1174
00:48:14,148 --> 00:48:17,778
This is our destination.

1175
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:19,277
Chunghyodang?

1176
00:48:19,278 --> 00:48:21,618
(What is Chunghyodang?)

1177
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:24,287
(It is the head residence of Seoae Ryu Seong Ryong, )

1178
00:48:24,288 --> 00:48:25,557
(an outstanding and loyal official that represents Joseon...)

1179
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:27,598
(who protected the country with bright strategies.)

1180
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,357
(Seoae Ryu Seong Ryong)

1181
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:30,797
(He wrote the book "Jingbirok...")

1182
00:48:30,798 --> 00:48:32,157
(which records in great detail...)

1183
00:48:32,158 --> 00:48:33,518
(the fierceness of the Imjin War.)

1184
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:35,767
(To honor his wish to be loyal to the country...)

1185
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:37,497
(and be respectful to his parents, )

1186
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,267
(Ryu Seong Ryong's head residence was named Chunghyodang, )

1187
00:48:39,268 --> 00:48:41,268
("Chung" for loyalty and "Hyo" for filial duties.)

1188
00:48:42,508 --> 00:48:46,037
(The descendants continue to uphold Ryu Seong Ryong's mindset...)

1189
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:48,408
(and the tradition.)

1190
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:50,647
(Queen Elizabeth of the UK herself visited Chunghyodang...)

1191
00:48:50,648 --> 00:48:53,117
(to experience the traditional culture of Korea.)

1192
00:48:53,118 --> 00:48:56,188
(The eldest daughter-in-law we'll be meeting today)

1193
00:48:57,218 --> 00:48:59,157
This is our destination today.

1194
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:00,217
(What will the Country Family experience here?)

1195
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:02,187
Chef, you have an important mission.

1196
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:03,188
What is it?

1197
00:49:03,189 --> 00:49:04,597
To open the door,

1198
00:49:04,598 --> 00:49:07,468
you must stand in front of the door and shout out loud.

1199
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:09,268
"Come here."

1200
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:11,737
- "Come here." - Yes.

1201
00:49:11,738 --> 00:49:12,968
- Come here.
- That's right.

1202
00:49:13,468 --> 00:49:14,908
What does it mean?

1203
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:16,578
You're asking them to open the door.

1204
00:49:16,938 --> 00:49:19,018
You're announcing that they have an important guest.

1205
00:49:19,238 --> 00:49:21,548
- Teach me again.
- "Come here."

1206
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:23,008
Come here.

1207
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:26,348
Come here.

1208
00:49:27,388 --> 00:49:28,488
(Come here.)

1209
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:33,488
(Who's there?)

1210
00:49:34,288 --> 00:49:38,098
(Who is making so much noise?)

1211
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:45,937
(It feels like the calm before the storm.)

1212
00:49:45,938 --> 00:49:47,737
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1213
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:48,738
Come in.

1214
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:49,868
- Hello.
- Hello.

1215
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:53,407
(Welcome to Chunghyodang.)

1216
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,277
- Hello.
- Hello.

1217
00:49:55,278 --> 00:49:56,507
- Come in.
- It's so cold.

1218
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:59,277
Thank you for coming.

1219
00:49:59,278 --> 00:50:00,347
It's nothing.

1220
00:50:00,348 --> 00:50:02,047
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1221
00:50:02,048 --> 00:50:03,408
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you too.

1222
00:50:03,988 --> 00:50:05,187
(Lee Hye Yeong, the eldest daughter-in-law...)

1223
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:06,387
(of Seoae Ryu Seong Ryong 15th-generation descendant)

1224
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:07,627
(Ryu Chang Hae, the eldest son...)

1225
00:50:07,628 --> 00:50:09,748
(of Seoae Ryu Seong Ryong 15th-generation descendant)

1226
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:11,298
Come on in.

1227
00:50:11,598 --> 00:50:12,828
Let's go in.

1228
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,427
It's so pretty.

1229
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,128
- It's pretty.
- It's so pretty.

1230
00:50:16,468 --> 00:50:17,897
This house is 380 years old.

1231
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:19,638
- It's 380 years old?
- It's 380 years old.

1232
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:23,037
(A new area greets them whenever they pass a door.)

1233
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:24,078
Come this way.

1234
00:50:26,408 --> 00:50:29,908
(Chunghyodang is a living history.)

1235
00:50:30,578 --> 00:50:34,118
This is for you to balance yourself when you come up.

1236
00:50:34,388 --> 00:50:35,947
You grab it.

1237
00:50:35,948 --> 00:50:38,817
This is called "anbusa."

1238
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:40,387
- Anbusa?
- Yes, anbusa.

1239
00:50:40,388 --> 00:50:43,057
"Anbusa" means a rope you grab onto to climb up safely.

1240
00:50:43,058 --> 00:50:44,628
- So it's anbusa.
- Anbusa.

1241
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:46,658
(Like this?)

1242
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:50,068
(Si A follows A Sung.)

1243
00:50:50,198 --> 00:50:53,938
Thank you for coming a long way on this cold day.

1244
00:50:54,438 --> 00:50:57,108
I prepared some warm tea.

1245
00:50:58,978 --> 00:51:03,948
(They have warm and fragrant green tea first.)

1246
00:51:04,818 --> 00:51:08,148
(The eldest daughter-in-law pours tea with grace.)

1247
00:51:09,148 --> 00:51:12,158
(The Country Family feels the warmth of Andong.)

1248
00:51:12,418 --> 00:51:13,857
Can you show us how to drink?

1249
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:15,257
- Or can I just drink it?
- Just drink.

1250
00:51:15,258 --> 00:51:16,327
(Just drink.)

1251
00:51:16,328 --> 00:51:17,527
Shouldn't you smell it first...

1252
00:51:17,528 --> 00:51:18,697
- or something?
- Well, yes.

1253
00:51:18,698 --> 00:51:20,158
To drink the tea,

1254
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,767
- you should smell it first.
- Right?

1255
00:51:22,768 --> 00:51:25,567
Then you admire its green color.

1256
00:51:25,568 --> 00:51:26,597
- Admire the color.
- Admire the color.

1257
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:27,938
Yes, admire the color.

1258
00:51:28,238 --> 00:51:30,007
That's what you do.

1259
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:31,978
Drink it in three sips.

1260
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:33,907
- Three sips? Okay.
- Three sips.

1261
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:36,207
(They follow the graceful eldest daughter-in-law.)

1262
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:37,648
(Sipping)

1263
00:51:40,148 --> 00:51:42,418
(Sipping too)

1264
00:51:44,218 --> 00:51:51,228
(The green tea melts their bodies that had been frozen from the cold.)

1265
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:53,257
- Isn't it smooth?
- Yes.

1266
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:56,128
The tea is fermented.

1267
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:59,167
This green tea isn't bitter at all.

1268
00:51:59,168 --> 00:52:00,968
- Yes.
- And it's so smooth to swallow.

1269
00:52:01,738 --> 00:52:03,338
But green tea...

1270
00:52:04,078 --> 00:52:06,038
isn't good for those with a bad stomach.

1271
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:08,578
- It scratches your stomach.
- Bad for your stomach?

1272
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:10,848
- And...
- Honey.

1273
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:12,877
- this fermented tea...
- You shouldn't say that.

1274
00:52:12,878 --> 00:52:13,947
Fermented tea...

1275
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:15,917
- You should compliment the tea.
- makes you feel comfortable...

1276
00:52:15,918 --> 00:52:17,018
I mean, it's good.

1277
00:52:17,588 --> 00:52:19,417
- People are drinking coffee...
- Those with poor stomach...

1278
00:52:19,418 --> 00:52:21,127
over tea nowadays.

1279
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:22,128
Yes, that's funny.

1280
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:23,897
- Two of you...
- I mean...

1281
00:52:23,898 --> 00:52:25,227
should settle it.

1282
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,898
We'll step outside for a bit.

1283
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:28,728
We're filming.

1284
00:52:29,268 --> 00:52:31,197
- It's okay. They'll edit it.
- You should say nice things...

1285
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:33,078
- They'll edit it.
- about our traditional tea.

1286
00:52:33,298 --> 00:52:35,637
(The eldest son is cute.)

1287
00:52:35,638 --> 00:52:37,537
Try the dasik too.

1288
00:52:37,538 --> 00:52:38,608
The snacks.

1289
00:52:39,508 --> 00:52:41,678
- Thank you.
- It's so cold today.

1290
00:52:46,978 --> 00:52:49,187
(The dasik is very colorful...)

1291
00:52:49,188 --> 00:52:52,717
(and comes in various shapes and sizes.)

1292
00:52:52,718 --> 00:52:54,457
When Queen Elizabeth came,

1293
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:58,757
I made and served her this dasik too.

1294
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,027
- She must've loved it.
- Yes.

1295
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:01,028
I agree.

1296
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:03,827
(Even the queen of the UK fell in love with...)

1297
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:05,998
(Korean beauty and taste.)

1298
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:09,538
(Let me try it.)

1299
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:15,547
(The new world of taste unfolds in Eddie's head.)

1300
00:53:15,548 --> 00:53:17,047
There's something in the middle, no?

1301
00:53:17,048 --> 00:53:18,277
Is it fruit?

1302
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,718
- Ma'am, how did you make this?
- There's no fruit, is there?

1303
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:22,487
No, I only added honey.

1304
00:53:22,488 --> 00:53:24,117
- Honey.
- Honey.

1305
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,588
Dasik only uses raw ingredients.

1306
00:53:26,888 --> 00:53:30,628
Songhwa dasik has its unique tanginess.

1307
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:33,197
It has a nice yellow color too.

1308
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:34,268
I see.

1309
00:53:34,868 --> 00:53:36,768
(What is "songhwa?")

1310
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:39,797
(Songhwa is the pollen of pine tree.)

1311
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:41,338
(It is yellow and smells sweet.)

1312
00:53:42,538 --> 00:53:45,837
(Yellow and bitter songhwa powder...)

1313
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,108
(mixed with sweet honey)

1314
00:53:49,848 --> 00:53:51,477
(Songhwa dasik is soft in texture...)

1315
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,947
(and sweet in taste.)

1316
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:57,517
The snack felt foreign even to me, and I'm Korean.

1317
00:53:57,518 --> 00:54:01,158
It felt like powder. It dispersed in my mouth.

1318
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:05,797
The flavors of Korean ingredients...

1319
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:08,498
spread in your mouth like this.

1320
00:54:09,828 --> 00:54:11,637
Ma'am, what's this black stuff?

1321
00:54:11,638 --> 00:54:14,207
- That is black sesame seeds.
- Black sesame seeds?

1322
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:15,437
- Black sesame seeds.
- Black sesame seeds.

1323
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:16,478
(Black sesame seeds dasik)

1324
00:54:17,308 --> 00:54:18,707
(When you take a bite, )

1325
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,638
(the savory taste fills your mouth.)

1326
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:25,048
(It's perfect for Yo Han too!)

1327
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:27,317
(For Eddie, )

1328
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:29,418
(there's no need for words.)

1329
00:54:30,218 --> 00:54:34,628
(He eats black sesame seeds dasik nonstop.)

1330
00:54:36,128 --> 00:54:37,797
- It's so delicious.
- It is, isn't it?

1331
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:41,198
- It's my favorite.
- Sesame seeds are savory.

1332
00:54:41,268 --> 00:54:43,727
Dates go really well with pine nuts too.

1333
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:44,768
Try it.

1334
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:47,408
The nuttiness goes well with the sweetness of dates.

1335
00:54:48,108 --> 00:54:49,607
(He is already eating one.)

1336
00:54:49,608 --> 00:54:50,807
- It's good.
- Sorry?

1337
00:54:50,808 --> 00:54:51,808
It's good.

1338
00:54:52,438 --> 00:54:53,638
I can't stop eating it.

1339
00:54:53,808 --> 00:54:55,607
- This...
- He can't stop eating it.

1340
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:56,707
It's that delicious.

1341
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:59,817
Dates and the black ones are my favorites.

1342
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:01,087
Dates?

1343
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:03,417
(Korean traditional snack "dasik" is just right for Eddie's taste.)

1344
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,957
- Here you go.
- Gosh, be careful.

1345
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,864
(Meanwhile, outside the room of the Head House, )

1346
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,327
- Let's go.
- Here you go.

1347
00:55:10,328 --> 00:55:13,298
(the Ryu family members are busy preparing for the ancestral rites.)

1348
00:55:14,628 --> 00:55:19,038
(There are 2 special dishes you can only taste here.)

1349
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:22,708
(The first dish)

1350
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,538
(Have you heard of dumplings without dumpling skin?)

1351
00:55:26,038 --> 00:55:29,347
("Chomandu," skinless dumplings, which has a history of 400 years)

1352
00:55:29,348 --> 00:55:32,277
Chomandu is a dish we make for our family.

1353
00:55:32,278 --> 00:55:34,587
- Yes.
- We mix buckwheat powder...

1354
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:36,317
instead of using dumpling skins.

1355
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:37,718
- Buckwheat powder?
- Yes.

1356
00:55:38,988 --> 00:55:41,327
It's a dish unique to this family.

1357
00:55:41,328 --> 00:55:42,328
I see.

1358
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:43,704
(Beef, salt, pepper, steamed radish, tofu, and buckwheat powder mixed)

1359
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:46,428
You can understand why they would make it this way.

1360
00:55:46,528 --> 00:55:49,797
But surprisingly, it has a lot of flavor in it as well.

1361
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:51,767
I could feel in the recipe...

1362
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:55,008
that it was a very old and traditional recipe.

1363
00:56:03,948 --> 00:56:06,577
Eating chomandu was like eating a loaf of bread...

1364
00:56:06,578 --> 00:56:09,418
but without the crusts.

1365
00:56:09,588 --> 00:56:13,058
You eat just the most important aspect.

1366
00:56:13,158 --> 00:56:16,628
The meat went into my mouth straight away.

1367
00:56:18,698 --> 00:56:23,128
(The second dish with a long history of the family)

1368
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:26,897
This dish is called junggae.

1369
00:56:26,898 --> 00:56:28,907
It's equivalent to modern-day snacks.

1370
00:56:28,908 --> 00:56:29,908
That's right.

1371
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:33,778
Back then, flour was very rare.

1372
00:56:33,908 --> 00:56:35,878
So they only had this in the palace.

1373
00:56:36,108 --> 00:56:38,418
When Ryu Seong Ryong passed away,

1374
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:40,918
the King himself ordered...

1375
00:56:41,248 --> 00:56:43,717
to prepare this for his ancestral ritual...

1376
00:56:43,718 --> 00:56:47,158
because he liked this food.

1377
00:56:48,258 --> 00:56:50,628
Flour and honey.

1378
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:54,028
And add some makgeolli.

1379
00:56:54,128 --> 00:56:56,128
Then, you leave it for one day to ferment it.

1380
00:56:57,268 --> 00:56:58,798
Once the oil becomes hot enough...

1381
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:01,368
Is this just any oil?

1382
00:57:01,568 --> 00:57:03,108
No, this is avocado oil.

1383
00:57:04,108 --> 00:57:06,377
- Really?
- Yes. It's good oil.

1384
00:57:06,378 --> 00:57:10,147
- Yes, it's healthy oil.
- I like this oil.

1385
00:57:10,148 --> 00:57:12,748
(Keeping up with the flow of times, she adds her own preference.)

1386
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:17,688
(How does "junggae," the Joseon snack, taste?)

1387
00:57:20,118 --> 00:57:21,628
Very gentle flavors.

1388
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:23,758
It didn't really seem like a lot,

1389
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:25,828
but you bite into it,

1390
00:57:25,928 --> 00:57:27,458
and it has such a flavor.

1391
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:30,938
You could taste the fermented flavor from makgeolli.

1392
00:57:31,968 --> 00:57:34,567
And it's really fascinating to think that...

1393
00:57:34,568 --> 00:57:36,638
my hands are making this bread.

1394
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:45,848
(The traditional food for the rite is prepared.)

1395
00:57:46,748 --> 00:57:48,487
(People at the wooden floor are getting busier...)

1396
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:50,148
(as time for the rite draws near.)

1397
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:54,358
(They plate the food nicely with care.)

1398
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:57,727
(The food is put onto the table one after another.)

1399
00:57:57,728 --> 00:57:59,257
(I see!)

1400
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:01,667
I thought it was interesting how they pre-cut...

1401
00:58:01,668 --> 00:58:05,368
the fruits so it's easier for the ancestors to eat.

1402
00:58:05,468 --> 00:58:06,697
I guess it's not just "Here's some fruit."

1403
00:58:06,698 --> 00:58:08,167
But like, "Here's the fruit,"

1404
00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:09,688
"and we're going to slice it for you."

1405
00:58:09,938 --> 00:58:11,107
It's very meaningful.

1406
00:58:11,108 --> 00:58:13,738
And it's very touching and thoughtful.

1407
00:58:15,278 --> 00:58:17,848
(Eddie gets to know more and more about Korean ancestral rites.)

1408
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:19,778
Shall we start?

1409
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:20,778
- Yes.
- Yes.

1410
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:25,318
(It starts with the eldest son offering the drink.)

1411
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:28,127
(Ancestral rite steps)

1412
00:58:28,128 --> 00:58:32,898
(The eldest son offers a cup of drink and bows twice.)

1413
00:58:37,398 --> 00:58:39,398
(Observing carefully)

1414
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,168
(The other participants bow twice too.)

1415
00:58:50,608 --> 00:58:52,948
(Glancing up)

1416
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,228
It's over now.

1417
00:59:02,558 --> 00:59:07,528
Edward Lee, would you like to come up and bow?

1418
00:59:08,068 --> 00:59:10,267
Can I?

1419
00:59:10,268 --> 00:59:12,768
- Yes.
- Okay. Please teach me.

1420
00:59:13,368 --> 00:59:15,138
- Just...
- Have a seat.

1421
00:59:15,438 --> 00:59:17,238
(I hope he does well.)

1422
00:59:17,268 --> 00:59:18,738
- Like this?
- That's it.

1423
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:21,408
No, you...

1424
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:23,877
No, you...

1425
00:59:23,878 --> 00:59:26,248
- Go down to the floor.
- Oh, okay.

1426
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:27,348
Left hand on top of your right.

1427
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:29,048
(He's so cute.)

1428
00:59:29,518 --> 00:59:30,947
(This time, Eddie bows properly.)

1429
00:59:30,948 --> 00:59:31,958
That's right.

1430
00:59:33,158 --> 00:59:34,627
- Stand up.
- Stand up...

1431
00:59:34,628 --> 00:59:36,187
- and bow again.
- Again?

1432
00:59:36,188 --> 00:59:38,228
(Again?)

1433
00:59:39,628 --> 00:59:42,527
(We're watching you.)

1434
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:44,298
- Okay.
- That's all.

1435
00:59:44,398 --> 00:59:46,468
Okay. Thank you.

1436
00:59:47,238 --> 00:59:51,378
He said when he was seven years old,

1437
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:54,014
he would run away when he was told to bow for the New Year.

1438
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:55,238
He would get scolded for that.

1439
00:59:55,578 --> 00:59:57,247
But now,

1440
00:59:57,248 --> 00:59:59,748
Edward is very eager to take part in the culture...

1441
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:01,688
and learn more about it.

1442
01:00:01,788 --> 01:00:03,048
That was what I thought.

1443
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,387
(Right after the ancestral rite)

1444
01:00:07,388 --> 01:00:10,228
What did you want to talk about, Edward?

1445
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,228
I...

1446
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:15,968
I want to...

1447
01:00:17,298 --> 01:00:19,398
cook a meal for them.

1448
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:24,508
What would be a good meal?

1449
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:26,008
So...

1450
01:00:26,478 --> 01:00:29,708
I felt really honored by the family...

1451
01:00:29,808 --> 01:00:31,447
allowing me into their home...

1452
01:00:31,448 --> 01:00:33,417
and sharing all these things with me.

1453
01:00:33,418 --> 01:00:37,488
So I wanted to repay that honor...

1454
01:00:37,588 --> 01:00:38,588
and cook for them.

1455
01:00:39,188 --> 01:00:40,518
Give me some ideas.

1456
01:00:41,088 --> 01:00:43,928
It would be perfect with just one more kick to it.

1457
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:47,558
Why don't you barbecue yam using a torch?

1458
01:00:47,968 --> 01:00:50,468
You can mince some yam and mix it with yukhoe.

1459
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:51,568
Okay.

1460
01:00:52,498 --> 01:00:53,498
That's a good idea.

1461
01:00:54,298 --> 01:00:55,337
(Their meeting is over!)

1462
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:56,338
Okay.

1463
01:00:56,908 --> 01:00:58,807
What shall we start with?

1464
01:00:58,808 --> 01:00:59,808
Yes.

1465
01:01:00,578 --> 01:01:02,078
- I...
- Yes.

1466
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:05,318
This is quite important.

1467
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:06,978
It's going to be hard,

1468
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:10,947
- but I'll work on it alone.
- What?

1469
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:12,894
- I'll cook it myself.
- You'll cook on your own?

1470
01:01:12,918 --> 01:01:14,627
Kyun, will you be fine?

1471
01:01:14,628 --> 01:01:16,728
(He's going to cook everything on his own?)

1472
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:18,628
We'll help you.

1473
01:01:18,728 --> 01:01:20,797
- It's okay.
- Are we fired?

1474
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:22,327
Yes. Go home...

1475
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:24,267
- Really?
- and take a rest.

1476
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:25,297
No, but...

1477
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:27,667
- Come on, Kyun. We should help.
- This is the Head House's...

1478
01:01:27,668 --> 01:01:30,907
No mistake is allowed for this.

1479
01:01:30,908 --> 01:01:32,608
So I'm going to do it on my own.

1480
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,948
Let's cook together next time.

1481
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:38,648
It's not like he's cooking for one or two people.

1482
01:01:39,048 --> 01:01:43,187
On top of that, this family adheres to Confucianism.

1483
01:01:43,188 --> 01:01:47,088
How will he adjust to the family?

1484
01:01:47,558 --> 01:01:49,758
I felt like he was a child unsupervised by the river.

1485
01:01:50,688 --> 01:01:52,558
I was so worried about him.

1486
01:01:52,658 --> 01:01:57,298
He was very firm and determined.

1487
01:01:58,338 --> 01:01:59,897
It will be very tough.

1488
01:01:59,898 --> 01:02:01,867
- It's okay.
- I trust you, Kyun. I'll leave.

1489
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:03,008
Okay, thank you.

1490
01:02:03,408 --> 01:02:05,537
If anything goes wrong, call us.

1491
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:06,877
- Okay.
- We'll come running.

1492
01:02:06,878 --> 01:02:07,947
- Thank you.
- You got this.

1493
01:02:07,948 --> 01:02:09,007
Thank you, I got this.

1494
01:02:09,008 --> 01:02:10,854
- Team Country Cook, let's do this.
- Let's go.

1495
01:02:10,878 --> 01:02:12,248
- You got this.
- We'll get going.

1496
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,077
- Will he be okay?
- Let's go, guys.

1497
01:02:14,078 --> 01:02:15,887
- He...
- I can't leave.

1498
01:02:15,888 --> 01:02:17,647
Can he cook...

1499
01:02:17,648 --> 01:02:19,457
- for everyone?
- Let's trust him and leave.

1500
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:20,458
Let's go.

1501
01:02:21,118 --> 01:02:23,057
- Bye, Kyun. You got this.
- See you.

1502
01:02:23,058 --> 01:02:24,058
All the best.

1503
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,358
(We're really leaving.)

1504
01:02:26,998 --> 01:02:29,668
(Meanwhile, Eddie is left alone.)

1505
01:02:32,668 --> 01:02:35,638
(He draws his recipes more seriously than ever.)

1506
01:02:36,538 --> 01:02:40,708
(Will Eddie's magic work on the elderly of Andong too?)

1507
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:43,778
(Eddie finishes writing the recipe and gets moving.)

1508
01:02:44,408 --> 01:02:47,988
(Where does Eddie first visit?)

1509
01:02:48,688 --> 01:02:50,088
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

1510
01:02:50,648 --> 01:02:55,557
Can I use your kitchen to cook?

1511
01:02:55,558 --> 01:02:57,657
Yes. The kitchen is small. Is that okay?

1512
01:02:57,658 --> 01:02:59,258
- It's fine.
- Okay.

1513
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:01,197
Use it however you like.

1514
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:02,227
Thank you.

1515
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:05,638
Do you have leftover chestnuts from lunch?

1516
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:07,137
- Yes.
- If you have,

1517
01:03:07,138 --> 01:03:09,007
I'd like to use some.

1518
01:03:09,008 --> 01:03:10,507
Sure, you can use them.

1519
01:03:10,508 --> 01:03:12,478
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1520
01:03:14,848 --> 01:03:16,408
(He leaves Chunghyodang this time?)

1521
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:18,978
Right now. Let's go quickly.

1522
01:03:20,748 --> 01:03:21,887
(Eddie's third mission)

1523
01:03:21,888 --> 01:03:25,918
(Buy the lacking ingredients from the supermarket.)

1524
01:03:26,688 --> 01:03:29,258
(What kind of dishes will Eddie make this time?)

1525
01:03:30,128 --> 01:03:33,428
(He finishes grocery shopping on his own.)

1526
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:37,198
(He is fully prepared now!)

1527
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:41,468
I'll mix Korean cuisine and European cuisine.

1528
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:42,738
It'll be a bit strange.

1529
01:03:44,638 --> 01:03:47,178
I wanted to create something that...

1530
01:03:47,878 --> 01:03:49,278
was interesting to them.

1531
01:03:50,978 --> 01:03:52,417
(For the elders of Chunghyodang)

1532
01:03:52,418 --> 01:03:55,348
(A course meal of gratitude and respect)

1533
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:57,547
(What is the first course meal?)

1534
01:03:57,548 --> 01:04:00,957
That was my first time trying the salted mackerel.

1535
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:03,158
I've eaten mackerel before, but not salted mackerel.

1536
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:05,797
- We share?
- Yes.

1537
01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:06,857
(Before coming to Chunghyodang, )

1538
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:10,528
(Eddie studied the ingredients of Andong.)

1539
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:17,768
(Impressed)

1540
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:21,448
I eat the skin of the mackerel too. The best part is the skin.

1541
01:04:22,648 --> 01:04:23,947
It's perfect.

1542
01:04:23,948 --> 01:04:24,988
(He can't help but laugh.)

1543
01:04:27,478 --> 01:04:29,147
(Amazed)

1544
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:30,148
It's so good.

1545
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:32,517
I like to eat just the skin.

1546
01:04:32,518 --> 01:04:36,488
(The salted mackerel's skin left a great impression on Eddie.)

1547
01:04:36,688 --> 01:04:38,058
This gives me lots of ideas.

1548
01:04:39,728 --> 01:04:43,698
Unlike the fresh one, it goes through a bit of fermentation.

1549
01:04:43,898 --> 01:04:45,838
Is it fermentation?

1550
01:04:47,098 --> 01:04:48,708
It gives it an extra layer.

1551
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:51,707
But to me, the mackerel skin...

1552
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:53,507
is the best part of the fish.

1553
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:54,908
I definitely want to use that.

1554
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:59,518
(Eddie's first-course dish using salted mackerel skin)

1555
01:05:00,248 --> 01:05:02,564
(Crispy seaweed, mackerel, caviar, mushroom, mackerel skin)

1556
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:04,787
(What is Andong's 2nd specialty ingredient selected by Eddie?)

1557
01:05:04,788 --> 01:05:06,948
(Quail egg, grated walnut, yam, beef tartar with pear)

1558
01:05:07,188 --> 01:05:08,227
This one's new to me.

1559
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:09,388
(This is yam?)

1560
01:05:10,128 --> 01:05:11,758
(Smelling)

1561
01:05:12,928 --> 01:05:14,497
(Andong Yam: Also known as mountain medicine, )

1562
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:16,067
(it has a firm texture...)

1563
01:05:16,068 --> 01:05:17,767
(and is rich in various minerals and vitamins...)

1564
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:19,928
(due to Andong's unique geographical characteristics.)

1565
01:05:20,468 --> 01:05:21,668
It kind of tastes like radish.

1566
01:05:23,968 --> 01:05:26,208
But it's not radish. It's more crispy and crunchy.

1567
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:30,077
The yam was so unique.

1568
01:05:30,078 --> 01:05:31,848
I never had that before. It was like...

1569
01:05:32,348 --> 01:05:33,348
fresh.

1570
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:36,687
It tasted like the earth. It also had...

1571
01:05:36,688 --> 01:05:40,358
that sticky, slimy texture to it.

1572
01:05:41,388 --> 01:05:44,028
The yam tastes bland.

1573
01:05:44,128 --> 01:05:47,028
It's clean and fresh.

1574
01:05:47,128 --> 01:05:50,768
I'd be interested to see what happens when you cook this.

1575
01:05:51,268 --> 01:05:53,198
(What's the second-course dish using yam?)

1576
01:05:53,438 --> 01:05:54,567
(Crispy yam, strawberry, pork neck, perilla leaf, doenjang vinaigrette)

1577
01:05:54,568 --> 01:05:56,937
(And the last ingredient)

1578
01:05:56,938 --> 01:05:58,977
(Andong strawberry)

1579
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:02,308
The Andong strawberry was still on my mind.

1580
01:06:02,608 --> 01:06:04,178
But do you know what's weird?

1581
01:06:04,608 --> 01:06:08,548
I'm eating strawberries. I know it's dessert.

1582
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:12,758
But I want to eat strawberries with pork belly.

1583
01:06:13,118 --> 01:06:15,088
Strawberry PB? Strawberry with pork belly?

1584
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:17,188
What do you think? Is it weird?

1585
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:19,828
I don't think strawberry with pork belly is a good idea.

1586
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:21,868
(The members were against the idea.)

1587
01:06:22,628 --> 01:06:25,898
(What kind of dish will be created with strawberry and pork?)

1588
01:06:25,968 --> 01:06:27,137
(Salted mackerel, strawberry, )

1589
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:28,138
(yam)

1590
01:06:28,139 --> 01:06:30,968
(A course meal made with Andong's specialties)

1591
01:06:31,538 --> 01:06:35,508
(It's time to give shape to the recipe in his head.)

1592
01:06:36,108 --> 01:06:39,748
(He prepares thinly sliced strawberries...)

1593
01:06:39,948 --> 01:06:42,318
(and makes diagonal cuts to the thick pork neck.)

1594
01:06:43,948 --> 01:06:45,588
(The pork is turned to make more cuts.)

1595
01:06:46,618 --> 01:06:48,988
(Making uniform honeycomb-shaped cuts)

1596
01:06:49,728 --> 01:06:51,498
(Salt and pepper are the basic flavorings.)

1597
01:06:52,598 --> 01:06:54,558
(Grilling the prepped pork neck right away)

1598
01:06:56,168 --> 01:06:59,698
(The pork neck is cooked until golden.)

1599
01:07:01,038 --> 01:07:03,208
(Eddie works well despite being alone.)

1600
01:07:04,468 --> 01:07:07,838
(The juicy grilled pork neck looks good even on its own.)

1601
01:07:08,478 --> 01:07:10,008
(He adds a spoonful of ssamjang.)

1602
01:07:10,648 --> 01:07:13,348
(He stir-fries the ssamjang that's usually dipped into...)

1603
01:07:13,448 --> 01:07:15,518
(and adds the pork neck back in.)

1604
01:07:16,288 --> 01:07:20,218
(Eddie's kick is to coat the evenly cooked pork neck with ssamjang.)

1605
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:23,088
(To the chef, detail is everything.)

1606
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:28,798
(He cuts the yam into rectangles...)

1607
01:07:29,728 --> 01:07:31,968
(and stir-fries it in oil.)

1608
01:07:32,438 --> 01:07:34,368
It's to show that there's effort put into it.

1609
01:07:37,268 --> 01:07:39,938
(He juliennes the stir-fried yam.)

1610
01:07:42,008 --> 01:07:46,448
(What kind of a course meal will Eddie cook?)

1611
01:07:47,518 --> 01:07:49,147
(Meanwhile, the food judges have gathered.)

1612
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,658
I heard we were getting a delicious meal.

1613
01:07:52,688 --> 01:07:55,558
Where did the chef mainly study?

1614
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:57,458
- The US.
- The US?

1615
01:07:57,758 --> 01:07:58,858
Is it pasta?

1616
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:01,097
I heard it was steak.

1617
01:08:01,098 --> 01:08:03,427
Isn't steak grilling meat and slicing it?

1618
01:08:03,428 --> 01:08:05,467
Not steak. Something made with noodles.

1619
01:08:05,468 --> 01:08:07,867
What other dish is there other than spaghetti?

1620
01:08:07,868 --> 01:08:09,408
(Just wait.)

1621
01:08:11,268 --> 01:08:14,208
(A big chunk of meat)

1622
01:08:15,378 --> 01:08:18,218
(Is it steak as the elders predict?)

1623
01:08:19,118 --> 01:08:20,847
But then, it got me thinking that...

1624
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:24,048
I would really love some yukhoe right now.

1625
01:08:25,918 --> 01:08:29,528
(Eddie finely chops the meat.)

1626
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,967
When we were making the dumplings,

1627
01:08:34,968 --> 01:08:36,298
(Used in making chomandu)

1628
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:38,337
obviously the meat was raw.

1629
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:39,468
(Fresh raw meat)

1630
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:42,937
So I used that idea to make the yukhoe.

1631
01:08:42,938 --> 01:08:44,314
(The chomandu ingredients gave him the yukhoe idea.)

1632
01:08:44,338 --> 01:08:46,738
I think the meals are...

1633
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:50,048
The meal that I had was very bright.

1634
01:08:51,248 --> 01:08:53,277
Adding too much salt...

1635
01:08:53,278 --> 01:08:55,948
and too much spice would be disrespectful.

1636
01:08:56,888 --> 01:08:59,518
I wanted to keep the flavors...

1637
01:08:59,858 --> 01:09:02,357
very simple and from the earth.

1638
01:09:02,358 --> 01:09:06,398
I wanted them to be able to taste the actual dishes.

1639
01:09:07,998 --> 01:09:10,028
And not just taste the spice.

1640
01:09:10,768 --> 01:09:12,137
(Using the least condiments, )

1641
01:09:12,138 --> 01:09:15,468
(Eddie's yukhoe is seasoned with pear and chives.)

1642
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:20,637
(The elders will like it, right?)

1643
01:09:20,638 --> 01:09:22,048
Shall we go to the room?

1644
01:09:22,508 --> 01:09:23,978
- I'm in.
- Let's go.

1645
01:09:24,778 --> 01:09:28,917
Kyun wanted to do something ambitious.

1646
01:09:28,918 --> 01:09:30,388
I don't know what we should do.

1647
01:09:31,288 --> 01:09:33,087
(Worried about Kyun)

1648
01:09:33,088 --> 01:09:35,028
It's almost 4pm now.

1649
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:38,057
In two hours, it's dinner time.

1650
01:09:38,058 --> 01:09:40,428
Shouldn't we make our own dinner?

1651
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:42,798
- Should we?
- Either way, we must cook...

1652
01:09:42,898 --> 01:09:44,197
in order to eat.

1653
01:09:44,198 --> 01:09:45,198
You're right.

1654
01:09:45,668 --> 01:09:48,538
For almost every day, the chef...

1655
01:09:48,638 --> 01:09:50,667
- He cooked for us.
- cooked for us.

1656
01:09:50,668 --> 01:09:52,407
- It's our turn to...
- We should cook for him.

1657
01:09:52,408 --> 01:09:53,477
(It's time for the rookie chefs to return the favor.)

1658
01:09:53,478 --> 01:09:56,577
Our chef became the daughter-in-law of a Head House.

1659
01:09:56,578 --> 01:09:58,538
(The chef is now a Head House's daughter-in-law.)

1660
01:09:59,178 --> 01:10:00,517
He has to prepare a feast,

1661
01:10:00,518 --> 01:10:02,988
and it doesn't sit right with us.

1662
01:10:03,148 --> 01:10:05,717
We'll use this chance to treat him to a meal...

1663
01:10:05,718 --> 01:10:06,887
with our lacking skills.

1664
01:10:06,888 --> 01:10:08,534
(The Country members will take care of the chef.)

1665
01:10:08,558 --> 01:10:10,588
How about this, Yo Han and A Sung?

1666
01:10:11,428 --> 01:10:14,157
(What is it?)

1667
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:15,727
For fun,

1668
01:10:15,728 --> 01:10:18,228
let's have our version of "Culinary Class Wars."

1669
01:10:19,338 --> 01:10:21,238
- That sounds more fun.
- Right?

1670
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:23,708
Our chef will be the judge.

1671
01:10:23,968 --> 01:10:25,838
Like a blind test?

1672
01:10:26,478 --> 01:10:28,978
Yo Han will feed him. How about it?

1673
01:10:29,778 --> 01:10:30,778
I'm in.

1674
01:10:30,779 --> 01:10:32,648
Do you have a blindfold of some sort?

1675
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:35,317
- We can make a sleep mask.
- A sleep mask?

1676
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:37,418
Or we can use our hands to cover his eyes.

1677
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:40,388
Or we can do it the Korean way.

1678
01:10:40,788 --> 01:10:42,928
- Put it horizontally.
- It's the Korean way.

1679
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:46,627
The time limit will be one hour.

1680
01:10:46,628 --> 01:10:48,997
The chef will taste in order of...

1681
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:50,374
- when you hit the bell.
- The bell.

1682
01:10:50,398 --> 01:10:51,768
I want to come in second.

1683
01:10:51,868 --> 01:10:53,014
I'm not aiming for first place.

1684
01:10:53,038 --> 01:10:54,038
I'm confident.

1685
01:10:54,438 --> 01:10:55,607
- It can overlap.
- What is it?

1686
01:10:55,608 --> 01:10:57,638
(I won't lose, either.)

1687

1689

1690
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,618

(Unconventional cooking skills)

1692

(I think I'm done for.)

1693
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:12,018
(I'm done cooking.)

1694
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:14,958
(The time is flying by way too quickly.)

1695
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:18,028
(What is this flavor?)

1696
01:11:18,228 --> 01:11:19,874
(Judge: Edward Lee, Former White House State Dinner Chef)

1697
01:11:19,898 --> 01:11:22,898
(An exclusive war without any class)

1698
01:11:23,398 --> 01:11:25,868
(It'll soon be revealed!)

1699
01:11:26,398 --> 01:11:28,268
(Meanwhile, in Chunghyodang, )

1700
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:30,738
(Eddie's hands keep moving.)

1701
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:36,078
It was very nerve-racking for me to do it.

1702
01:11:36,808 --> 01:11:40,518
(His hands are moving faster.)

1703
01:11:41,378 --> 01:11:42,388
(Dish one)

1704
01:11:42,988 --> 01:11:43,988
(Dish two)

1705
01:11:44,448 --> 01:11:45,458
(Dish three)

1706
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:49,027
They don't probably eat a lot of Western food.

1707
01:11:49,028 --> 01:11:52,327
So, I wanted to make sure the flavors were still Korean enough...

1708
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:54,528
so that they didn't feel it was too strange.

1709
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:57,868
(1 hour and 10 minutes have passed since he started cooking.)

1710
01:11:58,128 --> 01:11:59,568
Gosh, I'm starving.

1711
01:12:00,368 --> 01:12:01,838
It'll be good as much as we waited.

1712
01:12:02,468 --> 01:12:03,507
- True.
- Let's wait.

1713
01:12:03,508 --> 01:12:05,184
(The elders are getting exhausted waiting.)

1714
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,538
(There's no time to waste.)

1715
01:12:07,638 --> 01:12:10,048
(The salted mackerel is still waiting!)

1716
01:12:12,248 --> 01:12:13,747
(Eddie is prepping...)

1717
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:16,618
(the salted mackerel after 1 hour and 20 minutes.)

1718
01:12:18,088 --> 01:12:19,658
(Eddie is speeding up.)

1719
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:22,228
(His fight against time continues.)

1720
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:25,598
(In a hurry)

1721
01:12:26,298 --> 01:12:28,704
(1 hour and 40 minutes have passed since he started cooking.)

1722
01:12:28,728 --> 01:12:31,727
What's going on? Is he getting ingredients from the US?

1723
01:12:31,728 --> 01:12:33,367
Is that why we're waiting?

1724
01:12:33,368 --> 01:12:36,137
My stomach is growling.

1725
01:12:36,138 --> 01:12:37,608
(I'm hungry.)

1726
01:12:39,338 --> 01:12:41,584
(The frying pan for the salted mackerel finally appears.)

1727
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:43,348
(I must grill it fast.)

1728
01:12:49,218 --> 01:12:53,018
(The salty smell spreads from the evenly cooked skin.)

1729
01:12:55,988 --> 01:12:57,657
(Cooking fast with all his heart and skills)

1730
01:12:57,658 --> 01:12:58,658
(He's very busy.)

1731
01:12:58,698 --> 01:13:00,928
(Finishing touches)

1732
01:13:01,058 --> 01:13:03,598
(He ties a knot with a chive and matches the length.)

1733
01:13:04,068 --> 01:13:06,538
(He takes the skin off of the grilled salted mackerel...)

1734
01:13:07,038 --> 01:13:09,638
(and cuts it into pieces.)

1735
01:13:10,538 --> 01:13:13,107
(The last hurdle)

1736
01:13:13,108 --> 01:13:14,938
(Plating)

1737
01:13:15,038 --> 01:13:18,108
(The foods are filling up the plates one by one.)

1738
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,118
I used...

1739
01:13:20,418 --> 01:13:23,488
a lot of special ingredients to make it look pretty.

1740
01:13:24,248 --> 01:13:27,158
To show that there was effort put into it.

1741
01:13:28,688 --> 01:13:31,828
(He devoted himself to cooking the dishes more than ever before.)

1742
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:36,427
(Placing each ingredient with utmost effort, )

1743
01:13:36,428 --> 01:13:38,428
(the plating looks like a piece of drawing.)

1744
01:13:39,738 --> 01:13:42,138
(It took him 2 hours and 10 minutes to cook 7 portions.)

1745
01:13:44,738 --> 01:13:47,778
(Chunghyodang special course meal inspired by ancestral rites)

1746
01:13:48,778 --> 01:13:53,178
(What will the elders think of it?)

1747
01:13:56,888 --> 01:13:57,888
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1748
01:13:57,889 --> 01:14:01,087
(The hangry elders have appeared.)

1749
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:03,588
- Goodness.
- Let's go inside.

1750
01:14:06,328 --> 01:14:08,398
Good. It seems he's done.

1751
01:14:09,898 --> 01:14:12,367
- I'm starving.
- I'm hungry.

1752
01:14:12,368 --> 01:14:13,368
When can we eat?

1753
01:14:16,268 --> 01:14:17,968
Good grief. What...

1754
01:14:19,008 --> 01:14:20,337
Something does smell good.

1755
01:14:20,338 --> 01:14:21,808
- Gosh.
- Really.

1756
01:14:22,048 --> 01:14:24,577
- It smells great.
- Take a seat. I'll...

1757
01:14:24,578 --> 01:14:26,417
- Okay.
- I'm getting excited.

1758
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:29,518
(The elders full of expectations enter.)

1759
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,327
- Over there.
- Come here.

1760
01:14:35,328 --> 01:14:36,658
It's been nicely set up.

1761
01:14:38,128 --> 01:14:41,498
(Will Eddie capture the palates of the picky Head House elders?)

1762
01:14:41,998 --> 01:14:44,068
- Here it is.
- Gosh.

1763
01:14:44,628 --> 01:14:46,368
- Starting from him.
- Okay.

1764
01:14:46,838 --> 01:14:47,838
The end.

1765
01:14:48,038 --> 01:14:50,768
(He follows the manner of placing the food.)

1766
01:14:51,438 --> 01:14:53,177
- Great work.
- Thank you.

1767
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:55,878
Goodness. It looks appetizing.

1768
01:14:56,608 --> 01:14:57,608
It's a flower.

1769
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:02,648
(A flower has bloomed on the plate.)

1770
01:15:03,488 --> 01:15:07,458
(How interesting.)

1771
01:15:08,118 --> 01:15:11,458
In the past, they said you eat with your eyes.

1772
01:15:11,858 --> 01:15:13,058
It seems they were right.

1773
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:16,268
I think it's worth the wait.

1774
01:15:17,528 --> 01:15:20,167
(The plating alone makes the expectations go up.)

1775
01:15:20,168 --> 01:15:23,708
It's such an honor today.

1776
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:26,108
Please enjoy.

1777
01:15:26,378 --> 01:15:28,077
- May we eat?
- Yes.

1778
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:29,947
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1779
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:30,948
- Thank you for the food.
- Dig in.

1780
01:15:30,949 --> 01:15:32,817
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1781
01:15:32,818 --> 01:15:34,317
The dish looks beautiful.

1782
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:35,448
Right. Please eat.

1783
01:15:35,548 --> 01:15:39,288
The first dish is a perilla leaf roll.

1784
01:15:39,818 --> 01:15:44,027
- In the perilla leaf is pork neck, - Pork neck.

1785
01:15:44,028 --> 01:15:45,158
- yam, - Yam.

1786
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,957
And Andong strawberry.

1787
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:50,098
I put them in the perilla leaf.

1788
01:15:50,398 --> 01:15:53,238
People say what looks good also tastes good. It's pretty.

1789
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:56,007
(What's important is the taste.)

1790
01:15:56,008 --> 01:15:57,008
It's perilla leaf.

1791
01:15:57,808 --> 01:15:58,838
Yes, perilla leaf.

1792
01:15:59,978 --> 01:16:04,178
(The pork neck and strawberry combo can be unfamiliar to the elders.)

1793
01:16:13,088 --> 01:16:18,488
(The elders each take a bite of it.)

1794
01:16:27,538 --> 01:16:30,468
(For some reason, the silence draws out.)

1795
01:16:31,668 --> 01:16:33,607
(He keeps sighing, and his lips are drying.)

1796
01:16:33,608 --> 01:16:35,508
(The loneliest man at the moment)

1797
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:43,418
(The elders eat without talking at all.)

1798
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:47,588
It's good.

1799
01:16:48,788 --> 01:16:49,927
(He automatically smiles.)

1800
01:16:49,928 --> 01:16:51,458
You can be honest with me.

1801
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:54,758
It's a new flavor, but it's good.

1802
01:16:54,858 --> 01:16:55,898
It's indeed good.

1803
01:16:56,928 --> 01:16:59,467
The ingredients go well together,

1804
01:16:59,468 --> 01:17:00,468
- from what I see.
- I agree.

1805
01:17:00,469 --> 01:17:02,837
And it suits our palate. You did a good job.

1806
01:17:02,838 --> 01:17:03,868
Thank you.

1807
01:17:04,568 --> 01:17:06,438
I was quite worried.

1808
01:17:06,738 --> 01:17:07,807
How come?

1809
01:17:07,808 --> 01:17:08,878
(Eddie had no confidence.)

1810
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:10,608
This doenjang sauce...

1811
01:17:11,678 --> 01:17:14,248
(What? Is there a problem with the sauce?)

1812
01:17:14,348 --> 01:17:16,518
doesn't taste like doenjang.

1813
01:17:18,048 --> 01:17:20,218
- I think it's doenjang.
- Lemon...

1814
01:17:20,718 --> 01:17:22,527
- Is it our traditional doenjang?
- Yes.

1815
01:17:22,528 --> 01:17:24,327
(What's the sauce under the perilla leaf roll?)

1816
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:26,227
I added lemon to it.

1817
01:17:26,228 --> 01:17:27,658
- Lemon?
- I see.

1818
01:17:27,758 --> 01:17:30,467
- I made the doenjang sauce...
- The sauce?

1819
01:17:30,468 --> 01:17:34,198
Like an American vinaigrette.

1820
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:36,267
(Vinaigrette Sauce:)

1821
01:17:36,268 --> 01:17:38,137
(Made with vinegar or lemon juice with oil and various spices, )

1822
01:17:38,138 --> 01:17:40,137
(commonly used as a salad dressing...)

1823
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:42,148
(or an accompaniment for seafood and meat dishes)

1824
01:17:42,248 --> 01:17:44,377
(Into the doenjang, )

1825
01:17:44,378 --> 01:17:46,548
(refreshing lemon was added.)

1826
01:17:48,518 --> 01:17:51,718
(Doenjang vinaigrette, a brilliant mix only Eddie could think of)

1827
01:17:51,848 --> 01:17:53,818
I also added yam.

1828
01:17:54,318 --> 01:17:56,587
But I wanted to pan-fry the yam.

1829
01:17:56,588 --> 01:18:00,698
I actually cooked the yam in the pork fat...

1830
01:18:01,298 --> 01:18:02,698
and then rolled it in perilla leaf.

1831
01:18:05,568 --> 01:18:10,108
And it was something that like... I tied each one with a chive.

1832
01:18:11,238 --> 01:18:13,978
And then, I added a doenjang vinaigrette to it.

1833
01:18:15,378 --> 01:18:18,878
(The perilla leaf roll was completed with labor of love.)

1834
01:18:19,418 --> 01:18:22,348
The doenjang sauce under the perilla leaf was unique.

1835
01:18:22,988 --> 01:18:26,118
It was unusual and tasted quite strong.

1836
01:18:27,358 --> 01:18:30,258
Andong's doenjang...

1837
01:18:30,358 --> 01:18:32,298
isn't that salty.

1838
01:18:32,658 --> 01:18:35,358
But what I had today was a little salty...

1839
01:18:35,468 --> 01:18:37,828
but had that scent of doenjang. It was unique.

1840
01:18:38,768 --> 01:18:41,598
A dish like that with pork neck was a first for me.

1841
01:18:41,998 --> 01:18:44,838
Having pork neck with various ingredients...

1842
01:18:45,368 --> 01:18:47,337
(Perilla leaf, pork neck, yam, and strawberry)

1843
01:18:47,338 --> 01:18:49,148
(A fantastic combination)

1844
01:18:49,448 --> 01:18:50,508
was delicious.

1845
01:18:51,448 --> 01:18:53,217
It was truly excellent.

1846
01:18:53,218 --> 01:18:54,717
Thank you.

1847
01:18:54,718 --> 01:18:55,718
Have some.

1848
01:18:55,719 --> 01:18:58,119
(The combination of strawberry and pork neck was a success.)

1849
01:18:58,518 --> 01:19:00,418
In the middle is mackerel.

1850
01:19:00,988 --> 01:19:03,358
Seaweed, mackerel, aged kimchi,

1851
01:19:03,558 --> 01:19:06,128
rice mixed with mackerel,

1852
01:19:06,528 --> 01:19:09,368
mushroom, and caviar from the US.

1853
01:19:09,598 --> 01:19:13,237
As today is a special day,

1854
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:14,538
I added a bit of caviar.

1855
01:19:15,368 --> 01:19:16,967
(Mackerel, aged kimchi, and caviar)

1856
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:19,538
(Edward has once again presented a new combination.)

1857
01:19:21,938 --> 01:19:25,577
(Will it satisfy the taste of the Head House's elders again?)

1858
01:19:25,578 --> 01:19:27,178
You can smell yam in it.

1859
01:19:43,798 --> 01:19:44,998
(Glancing)

1860
01:19:45,098 --> 01:19:47,467
(Even if it's the second menu, he's again nervous.)

1861
01:19:47,468 --> 01:19:48,698
(Looking)

1862
01:19:49,808 --> 01:19:50,907
(Tilting his head)

1863
01:19:50,908 --> 01:19:53,637
This looks like mackerel gimbap.

1864
01:19:53,638 --> 01:19:56,178
Yes, it's mackerel gimbap.

1865
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:00,578
It's mackerel gimbap.

1866
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:03,248
(Chewing)

1867
01:20:03,618 --> 01:20:04,887
It tastes like mackerel.

1868
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:07,218
- Does it?
- Yes, the mackerel is good.

1869
01:20:07,988 --> 01:20:09,028
Mackerel gimbap.

1870
01:20:10,258 --> 01:20:12,088
- We had a rare dish today.
- Yes.

1871
01:20:12,188 --> 01:20:13,857
Eating a rare dish makes today special.

1872
01:20:13,858 --> 01:20:14,858
I agree.

1873
01:20:15,328 --> 01:20:17,668
- The mackerel isn't fishy.
- No.

1874
01:20:18,098 --> 01:20:20,037
The combination works.

1875
01:20:20,038 --> 01:20:22,168
It had a unique flavor.

1876
01:20:22,738 --> 01:20:23,738
Thank you.

1877
01:20:24,568 --> 01:20:26,977
(Eddie smiles in relief once again.)

1878
01:20:26,978 --> 01:20:29,848
One gentleman said it was mackerel gimbap,

1879
01:20:30,508 --> 01:20:31,778
which was kind of the idea.

1880
01:20:32,418 --> 01:20:35,548
(After grilling the Andong salted mackerel until golden, )

1881
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:40,558
(debone the fish, and mix the meat with some rice.)

1882
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:43,887
(After making mackerel riceball, )

1883
01:20:43,888 --> 01:20:46,028
(place seaweed and aged kimchi on top.)

1884
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:50,268
(Top it off with some caviar on a piece of mushroom.)

1885
01:20:50,598 --> 01:20:51,967
Mackerel gimbap.

1886
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,667
(Mackerel gimbap, the elder's perfect name for it)

1887
01:20:53,668 --> 01:20:54,668
It's a delicacy.

1888
01:20:55,838 --> 01:20:56,838
With mackerel.

1889
01:20:58,268 --> 01:21:00,337
(The second menu also had a good response.)

1890
01:21:00,338 --> 01:21:04,478
The last one is similar to yukhoe.

1891
01:21:04,748 --> 01:21:07,017
Quail egg is on top.

1892
01:21:07,018 --> 01:21:09,188
Please mix it before you eat.

1893
01:21:10,718 --> 01:21:12,518
Mix it with the quail egg.

1894
01:21:15,628 --> 01:21:19,128
(He can't let his guard down until the end.)

1895
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:22,898
(Checking the ingredients thoroughly)

1896
01:21:23,398 --> 01:21:24,927
(A strict, )

1897
01:21:24,928 --> 01:21:26,437
(solemn, )

1898
01:21:26,438 --> 01:21:27,838
(and earnest meal)

1899
01:21:30,408 --> 01:21:31,408
Yes.

1900
01:21:31,409 --> 01:21:33,538
(What's this taste?)

1901
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,007
What's on top of the yukhoe is yam.

1902
01:21:36,008 --> 01:21:37,008
- This?
- Yes.

1903
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:39,218
This white thing.

1904
01:21:39,418 --> 01:21:41,078
- This is yam.
- Right.

1905
01:21:41,648 --> 01:21:43,888
I added a bit of yam to the yukhoe.

1906
01:21:44,848 --> 01:21:46,558
So this is yam.

1907
01:21:48,918 --> 01:21:51,158
(The last dish, yukhoe, )

1908
01:21:51,558 --> 01:21:54,627
(only used salt and pepper.)

1909
01:21:54,628 --> 01:21:56,498
(Seasoning true to the basics)

1910
01:21:57,498 --> 01:21:59,897
I used the quail egg, which I think was...

1911
01:21:59,898 --> 01:22:02,068
smaller, creamier, and more special.

1912
01:22:02,468 --> 01:22:05,678
(Grating yam, the ingredient that shocked everyone)

1913
01:22:06,038 --> 01:22:08,777
(Adding a taste of freshness to the yukhoe)

1914
01:22:08,778 --> 01:22:11,577
There were so many fruits and nuts...

1915
01:22:11,578 --> 01:22:13,847
that I saw on the ancestral rites table.

1916
01:22:13,848 --> 01:22:17,118
I wanted to incorporate that, so I added the Asian pear.

1917
01:22:17,918 --> 01:22:20,658
(Dicing the pear from the ancestral rites table into cubes)

1918
01:22:20,758 --> 01:22:22,927
(Adding crunchiness)

1919
01:22:22,928 --> 01:22:27,728
I also sprinkled some shaved walnuts on top.

1920
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:32,568
(Eddie's yukhoe, which can't be tasted anywhere else, is complete.)

1921
01:22:33,338 --> 01:22:36,708
(So, how does it taste?)

1922
01:22:37,368 --> 01:22:40,378
(Only the sound of chopsticks can be heard in the quiet room.)

1923
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:42,478
It's good.

1924
01:22:43,078 --> 01:22:44,248
Thank you.

1925
01:22:44,808 --> 01:22:48,518
Making yukhoe like this makes it delicious. It's nice.

1926
01:22:49,748 --> 01:22:53,158
It was all good, but if I had to choose the best,

1927
01:22:53,418 --> 01:22:55,687
it'd be the yukhoe. It was really good.

1928
01:22:55,688 --> 01:22:56,927
(He enjoyed yukhoe the most.)

1929
01:22:56,928 --> 01:23:00,158
The pear and yukhoe are usually eaten separately.

1930
01:23:00,598 --> 01:23:04,068
But the two were mixed gently together.

1931
01:23:04,428 --> 01:23:07,638
I've never had such yukhoe before, even at hotels.

1932
01:23:09,308 --> 01:23:11,738
With quail egg, yukhoe,

1933
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:14,907
and pear in it, it was full of nutrition.

1934
01:23:14,908 --> 01:23:16,848
In short, it was a healthy dish.

1935
01:23:17,608 --> 01:23:18,978
I can live another decade.

1936
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:21,347
The yukhoe is good.

1937
01:23:21,348 --> 01:23:22,948
- The yukhoe?
- Yes.

1938
01:23:23,048 --> 01:23:24,048
Thank you.

1939
01:23:24,049 --> 01:23:25,289
(He takes another taste of it.)

1940
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:28,317
- It's good.
- It's very good.

1941
01:23:28,318 --> 01:23:29,838
(The elders highly praise the yukhoe.)

1942
01:23:30,258 --> 01:23:32,357
(Eddie's eyes are fixed in one place.)

1943
01:23:32,358 --> 01:23:33,798
(Feeling anxious)

1944
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:38,798
(Her plate is still quite full.)

1945
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:42,298
(10 minutes ago)

1946
01:23:43,408 --> 01:23:48,207
(She tasted a bit of it, )

1947
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:52,917
(then a bit again, )

1948
01:23:52,918 --> 01:23:56,518
(and didn't react much.)

1949
01:23:58,988 --> 01:24:01,348
(The eldest daughter-in-law didn't finish any of the food.)

1950
01:24:01,688 --> 01:24:04,428
(Did she not like them?)

1951
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:08,398
You won't taste the food if you just keep taking pictures.

1952
01:24:09,098 --> 01:24:10,498
She must be eating with her eyes.

1953
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:14,067
I didn't finish my food...

1954
01:24:14,068 --> 01:24:15,538
because my nephew is here,

1955
01:24:16,108 --> 01:24:17,737
and he's a huge fan of Edward.

1956
01:24:17,738 --> 01:24:19,777
(My nephew is a huge fan of Edward!)

1957
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:21,477
So I wanted to leave some for him.

1958
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:23,377
I thought you weren't eating because the food wasn't good.

1959
01:24:23,378 --> 01:24:25,547
No. Not at all.

1960
01:24:25,548 --> 01:24:26,824
(- There's no way. - I was worried.)

1961
01:24:26,848 --> 01:24:28,747
I was kind of worried.

1962
01:24:28,748 --> 01:24:29,987
Gosh, no.

1963
01:24:29,988 --> 01:24:31,087
(Eddie was nervous and worried that they might not like the food.)

1964
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:32,418
The flavor was clean.

1965
01:24:32,988 --> 01:24:35,088
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1966
01:24:35,788 --> 01:24:37,187
I could tell you put your heart into it.

1967
01:24:37,188 --> 01:24:38,527
It was made with sincerity.

1968
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,928
(Eddie's confidence is 100 percent charged.)

1969
01:24:41,058 --> 01:24:42,667
I've learned a lot here.

1970
01:24:42,668 --> 01:24:47,298
I feel deeply happy.

1971
01:24:47,468 --> 01:24:52,738
After seeing the ritual food today,

1972
01:24:53,078 --> 01:24:54,507
it gave me an idea.

1973
01:24:54,508 --> 01:24:59,107
I didn't use garlic.

1974
01:24:59,108 --> 01:25:03,718
And in the morning, I used a lot of fruits.

1975
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:08,888
These are what I thought of.

1976
01:25:10,258 --> 01:25:12,897
You used foods we use for ancestral rites as the ingredients.

1977
01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:14,298
- Yes.
- Good.

1978
01:25:14,428 --> 01:25:15,967
Thank you.

1979
01:25:15,968 --> 01:25:18,927
This was a nice ancestral rite meal.

1980
01:25:18,928 --> 01:25:20,997
- Right. It was really good.
- Yes.

1981
01:25:20,998 --> 01:25:22,438
Thank you.

1982
01:25:22,838 --> 01:25:24,537
- Thank you for your efforts.
- Thank you for your efforts.

1983
01:25:24,538 --> 01:25:26,337
- Thank you for...
- Thank you.

1984
01:25:26,338 --> 01:25:29,408
- We thank you too.
- making us such a tasty meal.

1985
01:25:30,508 --> 01:25:32,778
He has a thick beard,

1986
01:25:33,648 --> 01:25:36,587
so honestly, I was skeptical that he could cook well.

1987
01:25:36,588 --> 01:25:39,858
But his work...

1988
01:25:40,088 --> 01:25:42,318
lived up to his name.

1989
01:25:42,688 --> 01:25:45,827
I'm always the one who makes the food here.

1990
01:25:45,828 --> 01:25:48,148
It was nice to eat food made by someone else for a change.

1991
01:25:48,728 --> 01:25:51,627
The fact that he used foods...

1992
01:25:51,628 --> 01:25:53,797
that we put on the ancestral rite table...

1993
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:55,568
deeply moved me.

1994
01:25:55,668 --> 01:25:57,867
Thank you so much for your efforts. It must have been cold.

1995
01:25:57,868 --> 01:25:59,021
(I enjoyed and appreciated what you made for us.)

1996
01:25:59,668 --> 01:26:02,038
(Like "Culinary Class Wars!")

1997
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,038

(Reverse Hospitality Project: We'll Take Care of Eddie)

1999
01:26:06,648 --> 01:26:07,928
I'll do whatever I'm told to do.

2001

(Ko A Sung, the sous-chef)

2003
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:16,081
Next.

2004

2005

(The 3 Country members are in a classless culinary war.)

2006
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,528
(Baseless cooking skills)

2007
01:26:24,628 --> 01:26:26,198
(I think I'm done for.)

2008
01:26:26,268 --> 01:26:29,068
(I'm done cooking.)

2009
01:26:29,738 --> 01:26:32,538
(The time is flying by way too quickly.)

2010
01:26:33,008 --> 01:26:35,438

01:26:44,378 --> 01:26:45,988
(Welcome!)

2015

(You remind me of my son.)

2016
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:52,288
(We finally get to eat grandma's cooking.)

2017
01:26:52,388 --> 01:26:58,228
(And Eddie makes a special burger for the grandmothers in their 80s.)

2018
01:26:58,528 --> 01:26:59,998
(This is the secret ingredient.)

2019
01:27:00,098 --> 01:27:01,898
(What is this sauce made of?)

2020
01:27:02,298 --> 01:27:06,168
(The grandmothers love it.)

2021
01:27:06,368 --> 01:27:07,608
(Gosh, it's good.)

2022
01:27:08,008 --> 01:27:09,708
