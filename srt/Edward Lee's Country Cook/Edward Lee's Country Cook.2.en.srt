17
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,445
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:06,585
(He was inspired by the ingredients he discovered in Gangwon Province.)

20
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:11,986

- Yes.

00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:15,696

(The Country Family and cod meet for the first time.)

24
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:22,566
Thank you.

25
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:26,106
(Eddie will cook this cod with his magical touch.)

26
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:30,435
The texture of cod is really nice, meaty, and firm.

27
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:34,646
So I wanted to do something that could accentuate that.

28
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,416
But something also pretty.

29
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,214
(Cod's beautiful transformation)

30
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:39,886
- Okay. So you...
- Yes.

31
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:42,015
I'm going to pick...

32
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,985
Try to find the nicest...

33
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:47,726
- Cutest?
- leaves.

34
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:48,895
For the wrap?

35
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:50,726
What's the standard of a cute wrap?

36
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:52,896
A cute wrap?

37
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,135
- Someone pretty.
- Okay.

38
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:56,136
(A cute wrap like me)

39
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,704
This is a good size. It's big enough.

40
00:01:57,705 --> 00:01:59,865
- We have to wrap the fish.
- Oh, that big.

41
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,805
- Okay.
- So it doesn't get ripped.

42
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:04,246
And then, do you want to start cutting vegetables?

43
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,404
Sure.

44
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:06,976
(It's A Sung time!)

45
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,776
Very small.

46
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,246
Okay.

47
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:12,715
Very small.

48
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,655
(A Sung will chop the vegetables so they're cute and pretty.)

49
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:19,455
(Eddie will personally prep the main ingredient, cod.)

50
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,455
(Perfect angles)

51
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,196
(Sprinkling some salt on the prepped cod)

52
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,365
Then what I'm going to do is steam...

53
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,536
just the leaves.

54
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:31,735
- The cabbage?
- The cabbage.

55
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:32,904
I'm just going to look at it.

56
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:34,174
- I want it...
- When it becomes translucent?

57
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:35,506
- Yes, until it's...
- I see.

58
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:39,976
So what I want to do is make a packet.

59
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:41,315
- A packet.
- Yes.

60
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:42,775
A pocket of fish.

61
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:46,915
Okay. The thick part...

62
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,014
Because it gets in the way.

63
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:49,155
(Going right into Eddie's mouth)

64
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:50,316
- Good.
- Is it okay?

65
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,984
The sliced vegetables...

66
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:54,825
(Add the vegetables onto the steamed cabbage leaves.)

67
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:56,855
And the cod.

68
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,226
(Add the seasoned cod onto the vegetables.)

69
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:00,165
Sprinkle a little bit more salt.

70
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,264
(Sprinkling some more salt)

71
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,536
- It has to be pretty, right?
- It has to be pretty.

72
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,264
Cute and pretty.

73
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:06,535
Yes, that's everything.

74
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:07,775
(Following today's theme, make a cute and pretty wrap.)

75
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,204
Then we're going to steam all of the vegetables.

76
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,245
When all of these vegetables cook,

77
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:16,716
the juice is going to fall down on top of the fish.

78
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,716
So, you're very good at this.

79
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,416
When did you start cooking?

80
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,316
- When?
- Yes.

81
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,255
It was when I was really young.

82
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,256
I see.

83
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,095
It was our daily life.

84
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:32,166
So it was like play.

85
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:35,835
Sometimes, we'd make bossam, suyuk,

86
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:39,335
braised dishes, grilled dishes.

87
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:43,476
So in Korean families, do you always cook together?

88
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:45,244
Not always.

89
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,545
But in my case, we cook together.

90
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:49,715
- For me?
- Yes.

91
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:52,745
She worked in an office.

92
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:57,554
She was tired of everything she had for lunch...

93
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,356
nearby the office.

94
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:02,055
So I made some lunch for her.

95
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:04,424
Then I just started cooking.

96
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:05,725
(She started cooking to cook for her older sister.)

97
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,936
So more than flavor,

98
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:11,935
function was more important with my cooking.

99
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:15,436
I'm responsible for one meal out of this person's day.

100
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,946
Then I felt very satisfied...

101
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:22,715
that I took responsibility for her lunch.

102
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:23,716
Of course.

103
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:26,044
So we all started because of our families.

104
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,555
- Right.
- That's why we started cooking.

105
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,315
I think cooking really is love.

106
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:33,256
Right. Thinking of the person who will eat it.

107
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,355
How about you, Edward?

108
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:36,794
(When did Eddie start cooking?)

109
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,265
I started cooking...

110
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:40,495
very young.

111
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:42,795
Like when? Around three or something?

112
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,864
I mean, I wasn't cooking.

113
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:46,205
(Even genius chef Eddie couldn't cook when he was 3.)

114
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,905
Probably around 10 or 11,

115
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:51,505
I started making some stuff.

116
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:54,045
- Around 10 or 11.
- I was always curious about it.

117
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:57,916
So I would look in magazines and find a recipe.

118
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,916
Then I would save my allowance,

119
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:03,416
- go buy it, and make it myself.
- Oh, my.

120
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,726
I remember one time, I made duck.

121
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,125
- Duck?
- Yes.

122
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,195
- Duck?
- Duck.

123
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:11,624
You know how in chickens or ducks,

124
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,865
- there are those intenstines?
- Yes.

125
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:18,005
Usually, in American supermarkets,

126
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,435
they're already cleaned.

127
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:22,076
But I went to Chinatown...

128
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,804
- in New York.
- I see.

129
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:25,976
And I bought a duck.

130
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:29,776
But it had all of the intestines and everything in it.

131
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,114
(Worried)

132
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,015
The magazine didn't say to cut it...

133
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:35,355
- and clean it out.
- Oh, my gosh.

134
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:36,884
So I made the whole thing,

135
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:37,985
- From scratch?
- I roasted...

136
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:39,885
- I roasted the whole thing.
- Oh, my gosh.

137
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,825
(Appalled)

138
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,856
I didn't know, and I took it out.

139
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,525
And I served it to my family.

140
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:48,495
We cut into it, and all of the stuff...

141
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:50,734
- came out.
- Oh, that's awful.

142
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:51,934
(A shocking ending)

143
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,005
Oh, my gosh.

144
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,375
Nobody ate it that day.

145
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,075
(A mistake of a cooking newbie)

146
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,706
(You can't listen to Eddie's story without tearing up.)

147
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,346
And then... Oh, let's get your doenjang.

148
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:03,975
- Oh, my doenjang?
- Your special doenjang.

149
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,016
Okay.

150
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:07,985
(Doenjang now?)

151
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,956
This doenjang is from Pohang,

152
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:13,225
and a distant relative made it.

153
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,226
Really?

154
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:16,295
She farmed these beans,

155
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:17,624
- Really?
- and she made this.

156
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,864
- So it was all made by her.
- Oh, my gosh.

157
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:21,134
- Okay.
- Please try it.

158
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:22,166
I want to try it.

159
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,836
You should smell it first.

160
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:27,105
(After checking the aroma,)

161
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:28,106
(he puts it straight in his mouth.)

162
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,175
It must be really salty.

163
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,305
- It's good.
- Is it okay?

164
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:36,646
All of the flavor was going to be very gentle,

165
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,244
so I wanted a sauce...

166
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:42,885
that was going to be creamy and salty,

167
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,685
again, to balance out...

168
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,055
the gentleness of that dish.

169
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:52,265
To me, egg yolks are a really easy way...

170
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:55,065
to add flavor, texture...

171
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:57,835
(Egg yolk and doenjang)

172
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,266
(Eddie's special sauce using Korean ingredients)

173
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,635
Mix the egg and doenjang together.

174
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:06,576
- Homemade doenjang and egg yolk...
- Yes.

175
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:09,716
- I've never seen...
- Everything is new to me.

176
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,516
(Salt)

177
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:13,945
(Black pepper)

178
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:15,786
(Chili powder)

179
00:07:15,787 --> 00:07:17,115
(Three powders to season the sauce)

180
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:21,456
(Olive oil to add richness!)

181
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,096
More?

182
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:24,666
You're going to do a lot.

183
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:27,896
Why do you need to stir faster when adding oil?

184
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,365
Because you want it to... We say "emulsify."

185
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:32,605
- Emulsify?
- You want to... Yes.

186
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:33,836
You want it to mix.

187
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,405
(You need to stir quickly for the olive oil to mix in.)

188
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:40,745
- Maybe a little lemon juice?
- Lemon juice?

189
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:43,775
Just a touch of lemon?

190
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:45,745
(Spontaneously adding some lemon juice)

191
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:47,985
This is fascinating.

192
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:51,485
(The sauce is turning more and more yellow.)

193
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,726
(Eddie's doenjang sauce full of inspiration is done.)

194
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:02,365
(The pretty cabbage wraps with cod are ready too!)

195
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:08,535
(Carefully cut into the wraps,)

196
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,976
(open them up like a pouch,)

197
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,544
(and add the doenjang sauce on top!)

198
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,445
This has to be delicious.

199
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,925
He's adding a bit of sliced chili.

200
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:30,495
(Lastly, decorate with chili and chili powder.)

201
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:31,726
Yes.

202
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:35,166
Okay. Let's start course number two.

203
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:37,095
- Cod.
- What is it called?

204
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:38,134
Cod cabbage...

205
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,706
- Cod... Cod roll?
- Wrap?

206
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:40,905
Wrap. Yes.

207
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,004
- A roll?
- Roll.

208
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,336
Or a pocket.

209
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:44,775
- Oh, that's it.
- Pocket.

210
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:45,976
Cod and cabbage pocket.

211
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,115
Perfect.

212
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,884
(The cod dish that looks and tastes good is done!)

213
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,115
We're ready.

214
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:55,815
(It's finally tasting time!)

215
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:01,956
(A two-person eating show)

216
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:05,865
- Oh, that's delicious.
- Yes, that's delicious.

217
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:07,264
(Eyes opening wide)

218
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,265
Oh, my gosh.

219
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:12,165
(Almost eating her hand too)

220
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,405
(She really is Foodie Si A.)

221
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:23,846
(They can't stop eating the cod and cabbage pockets.)

222
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:26,785
- That's so delicious.
- The aroma of the black pepper...

223
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:28,285
and the gentle...

224
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:29,615
(Eddie is satisfied too.)

225
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:32,926
I think the main character of this dish is the doenjang.

226
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,926
- The doenjang feels so modern.
- Seriously.

227
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:40,264
The doenjang is saying, "It's me. I'm here."

228
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:41,296
Yes.

229
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:45,234
To me, it's softer...

230
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:47,805
than doenjang stew. You know?

231
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,175
- Right.
- It's kind of...

232
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:51,805
The presence of the doenjang is very important.

233
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:53,076
Why is this so delicious?

234
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:56,014
My homemade doenjang became so modern.

235
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,176
The doenjang is so...

236
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,144
The cod inside is very moist,

237
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:03,556
and the vegetables inside had a crunchy texture.

238
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:07,995
We were eating one dish, but it felt like we ate many.

239
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:10,596
- Oh, this is so delicious.
- Yes.

240
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:14,864
But I'm a bit sad that there's only one piece.

241
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:15,865
Right.

242
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,566
Okay. Here, taste the soup.

243
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:20,305
It's hot. Be careful.

244
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:21,676
(Eddie prepared another dish.)

245
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,774
Oh, this is delicious too.

246
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:24,845
(Si A has a spoonful too.)

247
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,274
- It's hot.
- It's sweeter...

248
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,606
- than I expected.
- Oh, my.

249
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,615
I don't know if this is the right expression,

250
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,384
- but umami...
- Yes.

251
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:33,884
- Umami.
- Right?

252
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:35,284
- Umami.
- Because I put the...

253
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,385
Very clean.

254
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,524
(Eddie's special broth...)

255
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:40,956
(with pumpkin seeds, radish, onion, halibut, and seaweed)

256
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:45,226
(What will they make with this broth exploding with umami?)

257
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:48,865
I'm actually going to make pumpkin soup.

258
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,165
- Pumpkin soup?
- Pumpkin?

259
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:51,864
With the buckwheat noodles.

260
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:52,905
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

261
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:55,336
Buckwheat with pumpkin.

262
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:57,305
Buckwheat has a bitterness.

263
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:58,306
- Yes.
- You're right.

264
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,106
- Pumpkin is slightly...
- Sweet.

265
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:02,775
sweet, so the bitter and sweet hopefully...

266
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,014
- He's a genius.
- But I've never...

267
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:06,644
I've never made this before, so we'll see.

268
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,216
It's a challenge for you.

269
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,785
(The combination of deep flavors, Eddie's pumpkin soup broth)

270
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:15,025
It takes an extra step,

271
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:20,466
but what I'm doing is trying to add layers of flavor.

272
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:24,466
So we can just boil the pumpkins in water...

273
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,566
and then puree them.

274
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,935
Your cooking is so creative.

275
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:32,605
(His sincerity gives his dishes that rich flavor.)

276
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:35,076
(Eddie's cooking philosophy is to cook with sincerity.)

277
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:37,985
(How will it taste?)

278
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:41,415
(Curious and excited)

279
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:44,356
(That's delicious.)

280
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:48,255
Salt.

281
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:49,696
(Salt)

282
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:50,926
(Salt)

283
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,765
(A Sung will try first.)

284
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:55,865
How is it?

285
00:11:57,936 --> 00:11:59,936
(Impressed)

286
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,405
I can really taste the fish.

287
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:06,145
The question is...

288
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,014
Should I add butter?

289
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:09,075
- Butter?
- Yes.

290
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:12,115
- I'm always okay with butter.
- A little.

291
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:15,186
- Si A is always okay with butter.
- Always okay with butter.

292
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:17,556
With butter, always yes.

293
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,955
(Adding a cube of butter)

294
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:24,255
If the heat is too high, butter turns to grease.

295
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:27,195
- With low heat like this, - Low heat.

296
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,264
it becomes creamy.

297
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:29,335
Creamy.

298
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:31,235
That's very important information.

299
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,976
- And then...
- Layers and layers.

300
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,005
- Good?
- Perfect.

301
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,415
(The buckwheat noodles are finally here!)

302
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:44,815
(If you soak the noodles in cold water,)

303
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:46,686
(the texture becomes even more special!)

304
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:53,285
So this is going to be a very different flavor.

305
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:57,994
Oh, my. This is...

306
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:01,495
(Rich pumpkin soup and the master's buckwheat noodles!)

307
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,606
- I have no idea how that'll taste.
- Same.

308
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,065
I don't either. I don't know.

309
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,176
(Even Eddie can't imagine how it will taste.)

310
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:10,076
- Seriously.
- This is new.

311
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:13,206
We have the yellow... The same color.

312
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,816
- Color matching.
- Yes.

313
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:17,245
Color matching.

314
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:19,716
Chrysanthemum.

315
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,046
(Adding green chrysanthemum on top of it)

316
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:23,485
Oh, that's pretty.

317
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:25,326
Oh, yes.

318
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,655
Oh, yes. Perfect.

319
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:30,826
Seriously. Everything goes together.

320
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,895
(Sweet pumpkin soup and bitter buckwheat noodles)

321
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:41,535
(Country Cook's third dish, Pumpkin Soup Buckwheat Noodles)

322
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:44,134
This one... I don't know.

323
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,845
(Eddie is also curious about today's main dish.)

324
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,106
An unknown world.

325
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,375
What do you call this dish?

326
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:53,586
Pumpkin... Buckwheat noodles?

327
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,514
- Maybe...
- I'm just going to mix it all up.

328
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:59,326
Buckwheat in the Pumpkin's Embrace.

329
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,726
- I like that.
- Like pumpkin hugging buckwheat.

330
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,764
- I like that.
- Is it okay?

331
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:05,795
Yes.

332
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:07,466
You're good at naming things.

333
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:08,765
Really? Thank you.

334
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,965
So I'd do this. Take a little spoon.

335
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,966
- Okay.
- Put a little soup.

336
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:16,374
(Having a taste first)

337
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,904
With the buckwheat noodles.

338
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,705
(Do pumpkin and buckwheat go well together?)

339
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:20,745
Is it okay?

340
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:23,976
(Curious)

341
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:26,716
It's a bit weird.

342
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:30,215
We'll try.

343
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:31,655
(Honest)

344
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,254
I'll try some.

345
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,425
The broth alone tasted good.

346
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,595
I'll be very objective.

347
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:39,265
(It's funnier the more she thinks about it.)

348
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:41,735
It's not a failure.

349
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:44,465
- It's a lesson.
- But it's...

350
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,836
- Anyway, You taste it. You try.
- Okay, I'll try.

351
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:49,035
(This time, Foodie Si A give it a taste.)

352
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:51,504
(Well...)

353
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:52,745
(Well...)

354
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,576
(Let's just laugh.)

355
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,346
So funny.

356
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:02,056
It's still good, but...

357
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:03,915
How is it? Tell us.

358
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,725
I think you need to try it to see.

359
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:07,124
I want to know what I'm getting into.

360
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,755
It doesn't taste bad.

361
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:11,254
- It's not bad.
- Like... Yes. It's not bad.

362
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:12,394
It's just strange.

363
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:16,296
I think the noodles are overpowering.

364
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:17,936
Oh, maybe.

365
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,264
They don't blend together.

366
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,734
- They don't blend together.
- They don't go well together.

367
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,106
(Quietly having another bite)

368
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,245
To be honest, I think it tastes good.

369
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:29,914
- You keep eating it.
- It is... It is good,

370
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:32,346
but it's missing one thing.

371
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:34,855
(Should I try it again?)

372
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:37,415
- It's good. It really is.
- It has a gentle...

373
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:43,125
Honestly, it suited my taste.

374
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,895
I personally like dishes that have a gentle flavor.

375
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:49,566
That gentle charm...

376
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,565
blended well with the flavor of the buckwheat...

377
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,735
I tasted earlier. It was really delicious.

378
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,374
It tastes better...

379
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,105
- the more I eat it.
- Yes, it tastes good.

380
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:02,414
- If we eat it with kimchi...
- Right.

381
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:05,884
I think it'll be delicious with young radish kimchi.

382
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:06,915
Yes.

383
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,754
My housemates enjoyed the dish more than I did.

384
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:10,784
I didn't like it,

385
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:13,284
but again, I will come back to it.

386
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:16,056
It just needs more experimentation.

387
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:18,426
To me, I never see failure.

388
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:21,364
And I love the process of making it,

389
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:23,195
understanding that it doesn't work,

390
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:25,835
figuring out how to fix it and how to make it better.

391
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:29,105
That process is what being a chef is all about.

392
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:31,176
We come back to it...

393
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:34,245
with different flavor elements and changes.

394
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:39,914
(The first night is coming to an end.)

395
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,556
(What new flavors will they try out tomorrow?)

396
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:49,625
(It's our Country Family's first morning in Gangwon Province.)

397
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:54,525
(For A Sung and Si A, it's still in the middle of the night.)

398
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,836
(Eddie got up first.)

399
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,505
(Evidence of a good night's sleep)

400
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,845
(He comes out to the living room...)

401
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:12,015
(and does a quick check in the mirror.)

402
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:13,815
- Lights on.
- Oh, my.

403
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:15,715
Oh, this is so nice.

404
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:16,754
(A Sung and Si A are up too.)

405
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:17,785
I love it.

406
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:27,525
(A Sung wakes her body up with some stretches.)

407
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:33,935
Shall we go?

408
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,705
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

409
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:39,905
(They take off to find new Gangwon Province ingredients.)

410
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:43,414
How pretty.

411
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:44,474
(What did they see from the yard?)

412
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:45,915
It's beautiful.

413
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:48,715
How magnificent.

414
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:50,516
It looks like egg yolk.

415
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:52,124
- Egg yolk.
- Oh, egg yolk.

416
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,455
You always think of cooking.

417
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,795
(Today's driver...)

418
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:06,106
(is Eddie!)

419
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:08,775
Okay.

420
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:10,606
(Let's go to discover more flavors of Gangwon Province!)

421
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,675
I like driving.

422
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:17,046
(Slowly starting their country road drive)

423
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,944
Are we going to fish...

424
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,046
- Yes.
- "Fish..."

425
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:22,986
A place where they dry fish.

426
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:28,026
Oh, I have a question for you.

427
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,266
Korean words. "Dish."

428
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:34,724
And "Meal."

429
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:35,736
Meal?

430
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,364
How are they different?

431
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:38,365
(What is the difference between "dish" and "meal?")

432
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:42,905
(Not sure how to answer that sudden question)

433
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:44,634
(Foodie Si A is here.)

434
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:45,675
(Smiling)

435
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:48,645
Jjajangmyeon is a meal.

436
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:50,445
- Okay.
- But tangsuyuk...

437
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,016
is a dish.

438
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:53,715
Pepper japchae is a dish.

439
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,256
Jjamppong is a meal.

440
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,155
Okay.

441
00:18:58,225 --> 00:18:59,325
That's so accurate.

442
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:00,425
(Regardless of whether she's right, Foodie Si A answered his question.)

443
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:04,425
(Encyclopedia Si A)

444
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:07,026
How would you call something that's humble?

445
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,935
For example, I would say,

446
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,836
my mother's cooking.

447
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:14,634
Meal? It sounds weird to say "My mother's meal."

448
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,875
- My mother's...
- My mother's...

449
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:18,945
- Would you say...
- Home cooking.

450
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,076
(Proud)

451
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,875
- Home cooking?
- Yes.

452
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:24,816
- Home cooking?
- Home cooking.

453
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:29,585
My mother's home cooking.

454
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,086
(Eddie drives while quietly saying his new word, "home cooking.")

455
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,496
Hello.

456
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,265
- Hi, Si A.
- Hi.

457
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,495
Where are you?

458
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:44,694
(The last piece of the Country Family, Yo Han)

459
00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:45,905
I'm on my way now.

460
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:47,165
We miss you.

461
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:50,075
I really miss you too, Kyun.

462
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:51,276
I'll be there soon.

463
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:52,904
(Get here soon, Yo Han!)

464
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,174
- Okay. See you later.
- Okay.

465
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:56,746
- See you later.
- See you.

466
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:01,184
(As they get close to their destination,)

467
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:03,516
(they see more snowy fields.)

468
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:06,585
I suddenly see a lot of snow.

469
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,086
(Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon Province)

470
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:12,265
This is my first snow in Korea.

471
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,325
- Oh, really?
- Really?

472
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:14,996
Yes, because I always come in the summertime.

473
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:17,835
It's beautiful.

474
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:19,035
(The snow in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province...)

475
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:21,536
(makes Eddie smile.)

476
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:27,306
Oh, my. It's like a painting.

477
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:35,056
Oh, the scenery is no joke.

478
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:37,355
(First snow in Korea)

479
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,756
(I have to get a picture of this.)

480
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:43,695
(Meanwhile, she can't look at the snow at all.)

481
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,096
Oh, is there some traffic up ahead?

482
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,965
- Oh, it's snowing a lot.
- It's snowing a lot.

483
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:52,035
Oh, there's so much snow here.

484
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:53,236
(The weather is getting worse and worse.)

485
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:58,205
(Where are they headed?)

486
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:01,816
It must be that place.

487
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:04,445
- What is it?
- Up ahead. Right there.

488
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:07,586
Something is hung up there.

489
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:10,115
(What is that?)

490
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:11,115
Oh, my gosh.

491
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,544
Something is hung up there.

492
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:16,984
Oh, my gosh.

493
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:19,223
I've never seen so many in my life.

494
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:22,523
I can smell it.

495
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:24,294
(The Country Family has finally arrived.)

496
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,824
I can smell all of the fish.

497
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:30,833
(700m above sea level, about 26,446m²)

498
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:31,903
(Gangwon Province Pollack Drying Field)

499
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:37,303
(Withstanding the icy winter wind,)

500
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:38,744
(freezing and thawing over and over again)

501
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:40,843
(The natural refrigerator gifted by nature...)

502
00:21:40,844 --> 00:21:42,344
(deepens the flavor over time.)

503
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:45,912
(Crafted by winter's wind and sunlight)

504
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:49,054
(Golden dried pollack)

505
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:52,653
(And working in the harsh and freezing air for the finest pollack)

506
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,324
(Kim Soon Yeol, 75 years old, the pollack drying field owner)

507
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:58,423
(Lee Sang Myeong, 78 years old, the pollack drying field owner)

508
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:03,163
(Much more spectacular in winter, dried pollack)

509
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:05,764
Hi.

510
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:14,804
(Excuse me?)

511
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:19,713
(The owner couple are focused on their job.)

512
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,484
(The three are frozen like dried pollack.)

513
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:26,182
(Where am I?)

514
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:30,354
(Who am I?)

515
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:32,663
Put those gloves on...

516
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:34,823
- and get to work.
- Okay.

517
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:36,063
Put those gloves on.

518
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,662
(Move it.)

519
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:39,764
- I will...
- The gloves.

520
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,372
- I'll help.
- Give them the gloves.

521
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:43,403
Let's go.

522
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,173
Thank you.

523
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:50,172
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

524
00:22:50,173 --> 00:22:51,343
(Ready to work in a flash)

525
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,344
(I'm ready.)

526
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:53,683
Thank you.

527
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:56,313
Hang these up with us.

528
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:57,354
- Hang them.
- Okay.

529
00:22:57,683 --> 00:22:59,652
It's snowing heavily, so move quickly.

530
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:00,754
- Quickly.
- Okay.

531
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:04,193
(He's the quickest.)

532
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:05,823
Okay.

533
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:06,893
- Good?
- Good job.

534
00:23:07,963 --> 00:23:09,433
Hang them up like this.

535
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:11,294
- Like this?
- Yes.

536
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:12,703
Got it.

537
00:23:14,064 --> 00:23:16,433
(Eddie is working hard.)

538
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:18,074
You're good at it.

539
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,373
You're doing a great job. Well done.

540
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:24,014
- By the way, - It's melted.

541
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:26,942
do animals from the mountain not come down and eat these?

542
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:28,043
No. They can't.

543
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:29,652
- How come?
- Because people are on guard.

544
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:30,913
- People guard them?
- Yes.

545
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:32,284
Hang them straight.

546
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:34,922
What's this for?

547
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:36,994
Letting them freeze and then thaw.

548
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:38,622
- What's the reason?
- The freezing and thawing...

549
00:23:38,623 --> 00:23:40,264
of pollacks make them tasty.

550
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:41,823
- Is it tastier?
- Yes.

551
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,463
And it becomes full of nutrition.

552
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:45,833
(Dried pollack: Made by freezing and thawing pollack)

553
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,774
Dried pollack must be frozen and thawed multiple times here,

554
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:50,873
700m above sea level,

555
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:54,344
with natural wind and sunlight for about five months.

556
00:23:54,604 --> 00:23:57,613
Only then are the best dried pollacks produced.

557
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,243
- If you boil...
- Yes?

558
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:02,753
the skin, it becomes jelly.

559
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:03,783
- Jelly?
- Yes.

560
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:06,324
Take these and hang them up quickly.

561
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,084
- There's more work to do.
- Okay.

562
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:09,653
More work.

563
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,963
- Don't play around.
- Yes, sir.

564
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:14,692
- Okay.
- It's blinding.

565
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:15,933
We should hang them tighter.

566
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,903
Sir. Will we get some if we help?

567
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:21,633
- Of course.
- We'll work hard.

568
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,334
Let's go.

569
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,142
Let's work.

570
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:27,344
(While everyone is busy working)

571
00:24:27,774 --> 00:24:29,472
Was everything all right yesterday?

572
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:30,573
(A familiar voice can finally be heard.)

573
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:31,613
Great.

574
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:33,083
On my way here,

575
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:34,642
(Yo Han has arrived!)

576
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,254
it was snowing hard.

577
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:38,514
I wondered how things were like here.

578
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:42,192
I got worried whether they froze to death.

579
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,452
(Worried, Yo Han rushed over.)

580
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:44,824
Where's everyone, including Edward?

581
00:24:46,594 --> 00:24:47,662
Goodness.

582
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:49,463
(I miss you, Kyun.)

583
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:54,834
(Kyun is currently struggling badly.)

584
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,643
(Why does he have one more jumper?)

585
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:03,373
Hi.

586
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,182
- Put this on.
- Hey. How are you?

587
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:09,213
- Yo Han.
- Hi.

588
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:11,514
Hi.

589
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:13,683
We have a new worker.

590
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:15,952
- Finally.
- Let's hang them up quickly.

591
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:17,793
We've got to hurry to finish them all today.

592
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:19,764
- Here.
- I couldn't greet anyone.

593
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:21,564
I have to work right away.

594
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:23,163
Have you been well?

595
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:24,662
Let me ask around. How have you been?

596
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:26,263
This is not perfect.

597
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:27,333
(Greetings can wait.)

598
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:28,734
Kyun. These are...

599
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,372
(Two pollacks are stuck together.)

600
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:31,774
- It's frozen together.
- Hold on.

601
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,372
- These are frozen.
- Okay.

602
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:36,443
(Struggling)

603
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:37,673
This is crazy.

604
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:39,343
Si A. You're stepping on my foot.

605
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:40,584
I'm sorry.

606
00:25:41,244 --> 00:25:42,882
I was too busy to notice.

607
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:43,984
(Laughing)

608
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:46,024
Hurry up and hang them up. This one too.

609
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:47,324
Here.

610
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:48,584
Right here.

611
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:52,494
(Stop chatting.)

612
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:54,824
Here you go.

613
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:57,534
Okay. Thank you.

614
00:25:58,234 --> 00:25:59,264
It's super heavy.

615
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:02,034
I'll carry it with you.

616
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,403
Is there any more room? Here?

617
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:08,574
There's no room for the fish.

618
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:11,044
- Or does this come off?
- If we push them over.

619
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:15,912
(The tough but caring owner solves the problem.)

620
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:18,253
I see. This moves.

621
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:19,883
- How does...
- Hang them up here.

622
00:26:20,024 --> 00:26:21,024
Okay.

623
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:22,523
(Is there more empty space?)

624
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:23,524
Move that one.

625
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:25,764
- Stick them closer.
- Okay.

626
00:26:26,893 --> 00:26:28,094
This is hard work.

627
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:32,402
Freezing and melting and freezing.

628
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:36,034
It's really fascinating to see how...

629
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:39,544
the physics of it works and the chemistry.

630
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:44,143
I'm really excited to see how that fish is going to taste...

631
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:46,544
once we put it into a dish.

632
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:50,484
- We're done.
- Gosh.

633
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:54,023
Come to the restaurant, and I'll cook you something good.

634
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:55,024
- Really?
- Thank you.

635
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:56,294
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

636
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,123
She'll probably make dried pollack soup.

637
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:00,763
Eating dried pollack soup after working hard...

638
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:02,064
will taste so good.

639
00:27:02,764 --> 00:27:04,294
Wait. We have to do this once.

640
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:05,734
What?

641
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:12,103
- I'll take a photo for you.
- The drone.

642
00:27:12,104 --> 00:27:13,203
Why, Kyun?

643
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:15,173
Why?

644
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:16,544
The drone is over there.

645
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:18,373
- Lie down, Si A.
- Is there a drone?

646
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:25,083
- Hi.
- Hi.

647
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:26,084
(The Country members...)

648
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:28,222
(found both ingredients and innocence.)

649
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:29,254
Okay.

650
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:34,623
Thank you.

651
00:27:34,624 --> 00:27:36,462
See? It's a fairy.

652
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:37,563
A snow fairy.

653
00:27:37,564 --> 00:27:38,764
(Off to the restaurant run by the owner)

654
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:41,303
(Opened in 1985,)

655
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:42,733
(the restaurant is 40 years old.)

656
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:45,004
(Owner Kim Soon Yeol will cook up her specialty.)

657
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:48,304
I consider dried pollack the same as humans.

658
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:52,014
It's a fish, but there's nothing to waste.

659
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:54,913
Everything can be used, from its head to its bones.

660
00:27:56,014 --> 00:28:00,323
This fish called dried pollack offers...

661
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,993
everything of itself to others.

662
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:05,294
(Dried pollack leaves everything behind.)

663
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,093
That's why I like it.

664
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:08,223
(She's been loving it for 40 years.)

665
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:10,294
This is it. Okay.

666
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:15,873
- Welcome.
- Hi.

667
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:18,234
Hi.

668
00:28:18,804 --> 00:28:19,844
Hi.

669
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,142
(The restaurant is full of customers.)

670
00:28:23,143 --> 00:28:24,472
- Hi.
- Hi.

671
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:25,643
- Sir.
- Yes?

672
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,883
(Eddie's little fan appeared!)

673
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:32,152
(Everyone is a fan of Eddie.)

674
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:33,223
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

675
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:39,323
(Mom. I got Edward Lee's autograph.)

676
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:40,863
(Good job!)

677
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:44,834
- You have a lot of customers.
- I do.

678
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:46,203
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

679
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:49,104
- It's warm in here.
- It is.

680
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:55,143
It's a big restaurant.

681
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:57,313
They get around 1,000 customers a day, right?

682
00:28:57,314 --> 00:28:58,343
One thousand?

683
00:28:58,344 --> 00:29:00,612
The restaurant itself is quite big.

684
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,084
- It's two stories.
- Exactly.

685
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:03,452
What do you want to eat, Kyun?

686
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:04,583
- Hi.
- What are you interested in?

687
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:06,452
- Thank you.
- I want to try everything.

688
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,422
- Everything?
- Dried pollack soup...

689
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:11,994
- Dried pollack soup.
- or dried pollack hangover soup?

690
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:15,323
(Spending 40 years with dried pollack,)

691
00:29:15,324 --> 00:29:16,462
(what does dried pollack mean to Ms. Kim Soon Yeol?)

692
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,104
I wake up at around 4am...

693
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:20,564
and come to the restaurant by 5am.

694
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:23,172
I boil the broth first...

695
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:24,604
and then boil dried pollack hangover soup.

696
00:29:25,943 --> 00:29:27,574
I had three sons.

697
00:29:28,274 --> 00:29:29,814
Back then, my second son...

698
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:32,843
was a senior in high school.

699
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:34,314
(The owner talks about her painful past.)

700
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:37,413
Just three months before the CSAT, I lost him in an accident.

701
00:29:39,254 --> 00:29:41,423
I moved to this place thoughtlessly.

702
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:44,122
Despite not knowing a thing, I started this restaurant.

703
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:45,824
(Started a dried pollack restaurant to forget about her son)

704
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:48,794
While running this restaurant for about 40 years,

705
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,293
not once did I close it for a day...

706
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:51,863
because of the pain I carry.

707
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,503
(The dried pollack restaurant and customers...)

708
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,274
(comforted the owner's heart.)

709
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:02,573
(The dish made by the owner,)

710
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:04,173
(filled with her life of cooking it for 40 years)

711
00:30:05,943 --> 00:30:09,254
(The dried pollack hangover soup is made with her unchanging devotion.)

712
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:16,053
Is this dried pollack hangover soup?

713
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:17,324
- Yes.
- Dried pollack.

714
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:23,063
That's broth made with dried pollack.

715
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:24,133
- This one?
- Yes.

716
00:30:24,193 --> 00:30:26,064
Goodness. It's good.

717
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:27,504
Is it refreshing and nice?

718
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:31,034
(A Sung takes a sip of it too.)

719
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:32,903
The broth is amazing.

720
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:37,413
Taking this trip during winter was a great choice.

721
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:43,084
(Dried pollack hangover soup is the optimal menu in a winter trip.)

722
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:44,952
- Is it refreshing?
- It's so refreshing.

723
00:30:44,953 --> 00:30:48,253
Ma'am. Can you explain the secret behind your broth?

724
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:50,122
- The broth?
- Yes.

725
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:52,253
I use the head and the bones of the dried pollack.

726
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:55,123
At times, I put in the meat of the dried pollack.

727
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:57,334
I boil it together for a whole day.

728
00:30:57,463 --> 00:31:00,003
I let it boil even as the broth is being used.

729
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:01,104
(Dried Pollack Hangover Soup)

730
00:31:02,873 --> 00:31:06,303
I use that broth to make the final soup.

731
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:07,743
(Dried pollack meat, radish, onion, green onion,)

732
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:09,043
(minced garlic, and more are added into the broth...)

733
00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:10,314
(and boiled until the soup turns white.)

734
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,743
It's kind of like that hangover soup.

735
00:31:13,744 --> 00:31:17,584
It can really cleanse your body of...

736
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:20,683
too much drinking and the toxins that are in it.

737
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:25,824
Gosh.

738
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:28,223
It's good.

739
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:32,632
That one over there is dried pollack sikhae.

740
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,932
Make it into a wrap with the napa cabbage.

741
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:35,933
Also try mixing it in rice.

742
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:39,373
Why is this called sikhae and not salted?

743
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:41,073
Because it's fermented.

744
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,173
I see.

745
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:46,583
It's fermented, so it's called sikhae, not salted.

746
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:47,783
(Dried Pollack Sikhae)

747
00:31:47,784 --> 00:31:49,084
It's fermented.

748
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:52,083
- What was this again?
- Dried pollack sikhae.

749
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,123
- Sikhae? This is sikhae?
- Yes.

750
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,953
(How is it?)

751
00:31:57,893 --> 00:31:58,953
How is it?

752
00:32:00,324 --> 00:32:01,393
It's good.

753
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:05,733
I love fermented food. I've never seen anything like it.

754
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:08,432
The taste was so delicate...

755
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:13,103
and so light. I could feel the fermentation...

756
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:14,672
happening even in my mouth.

757
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:17,373
It's a really special thing for me.

758
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:23,083
Is there a recipe you want to know?

759
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:24,084
This one.

760
00:32:24,514 --> 00:32:26,182
- How is this made?
- How is this made?

761
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:29,223
You make rice first.

762
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:34,564
Leave the dried pollack in barely malt for a day.

763
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,692
Then you season it.

764
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,333
(Dried Pollack Sikhae)

765
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:41,503
Fine barley flour, sugar, chili powder,

766
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:43,873
dried pollack powder, and starch syrup.

767
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,443
Those are the ingredients in the seasoning that blend together.

768
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:49,442
You let it ferment for two days.

769
00:32:49,443 --> 00:32:53,613
(The cooking and time make the dried pollack sikhae more special.)

770
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:57,452
(Seasoning the pollack dried with Daegwallyeong wind...)

771
00:32:57,453 --> 00:33:01,284
(and sweet and spicy sauce makes it savory.)

772
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:03,794
I have a question.

773
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:07,392
If I make a wrap, what do I put in it?

774
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:09,122
She told us to put everything in, including the sikhae.

775
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:10,962
Okay. Then let's do this one.

776
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:11,993
Put this in too.

777
00:33:11,994 --> 00:33:13,362
(Grilled dried pollack)

778
00:33:13,363 --> 00:33:14,833
And then this sikhae.

779
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:17,333
(A generous amount of dried pollack sikhae)

780
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:19,402
- Sikhae.
- It's too much.

781
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:21,142
- No, it's perfect.
- And then...

782
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:23,513
- Add a bit of rice on top.
- Rice.

783
00:33:23,514 --> 00:33:24,942
(White rice)

784
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:26,013
And?

785
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:28,683
(Pickled onion)

786
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:31,983
It must be salty. After all, it's jeotgal.

787
00:33:31,984 --> 00:33:33,483
He's eating too much jeotgal.

788
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:35,183
He's a big fan of jeotgal.

789
00:33:36,424 --> 00:33:39,163
(The dried pollack wrap is right up Eddie's street.)

790
00:33:39,623 --> 00:33:40,662
Do you like it?

791
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:41,694
Is it good?

792
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:45,433
- I love the different textures.
- I see.

793
00:33:45,564 --> 00:33:47,333
- It has different textures.
- It's spicy,

794
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,503
- salty, and crispy.
- Salty.

795
00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:51,404
- And chewy.
- Yes, chewy.

796
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,703
I'll copy you.

797
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:56,843
(The Country members try the dried pollack wrap as well.)

798
00:33:57,743 --> 00:34:00,683
(Yo Han also adds a generous amount of dried pollack sikhae.)

799
00:34:02,513 --> 00:34:07,024
(The Country members' tastes are becoming similar.)

800
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:15,864
(Satisfied)

801
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:19,033
(Eddie eats another wrap.)

802
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,433
Eating it like this is really fun.

803
00:34:27,444 --> 00:34:31,713
Korean people can find value in it. And they find flavor in it.

804
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:36,254
They can find the technique to make that work.

805
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:40,323
To take something that's not very desirable...

806
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:44,654
and then turn it into something that has a lot of flavor.

807
00:34:45,194 --> 00:34:50,393
That mentality and resourcefulness...

808
00:34:50,663 --> 00:34:53,533
are partly what make Korean food so unique.

809
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:59,203
(What kind of inspiration did Eddie gain from the owner's dishes?)

810
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:02,142
Now then, we'll set off.

811
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,444
Let's get going.

812
00:35:04,243 --> 00:35:05,372
(To meet their next ingredient)

813
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:06,683
Gangwon Province.

814
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:09,583
- Jeongseon.
- In Jeongseon,

815
00:35:09,584 --> 00:35:12,754
there's a really famous master of namul.

816
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:16,423
The master takes the vegetables grown in Korea, dries them up,

817
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:18,424
and makes them into side dishes.

818
00:35:18,593 --> 00:35:19,863
It's the best.

819
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:21,064
- Really?
- Let's meet the master.

820
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:23,564
During this trip, you must've had...

821
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,593
something you...

822
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:31,904
never made but wanted to try.

823
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:34,142
That's why we'll do some grocery shopping.

824
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:35,343
- Okay.
- Good.

825
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:37,973
We'll get the ingredients.

826
00:35:38,243 --> 00:35:40,343
And sharing them with others seems like a good idea.

827
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:43,912
Are you suggesting we hold a party, Yo Han?

828
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:47,283
- Invite the neighbors and such?
- That's also a good idea.

829
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:51,353
(But little did they know...)

830
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:54,024
(what kind of result Yo Han's words would bring.)

831
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:56,092
I like the idea...

832
00:35:56,093 --> 00:35:58,093
of making a recipe and sharing it.

833
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:01,063
The people want to meet you, Edward.

834
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:02,163
Okay.

835
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:05,333
(And so starts...)

836
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:08,603
(the Country members' party project.)

837
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:09,674
What do I do?

838
00:36:09,774 --> 00:36:11,473
I have to go right now.

839
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:14,983
(Serving food to the elders like a town festival)

840
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:16,484
I heard they'd serve delicious food.

841
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,183
We have a problem.

842
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:22,322
(Jeongseon)

843
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:25,622
(Andong)

844
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:29,024
(Yeosu)

845
00:36:29,294 --> 00:36:32,294
(Captivate the appetite of the elders)

846
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:36,834
(Will the Country members satisfy the K-elders?)

847
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:41,572
(Already excited)

848
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:43,613
I love the idea.

849
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:45,573
- I have a question.
- Okay.

850
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:49,484
What's the difference between namul and vegetables?

851
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:52,084
- Namul is vegetables?
- You see...

852
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:55,322
Yes. "Vegetable" is the bigger category.

853
00:36:55,323 --> 00:36:57,523
- Okay.
- Namul is in vegetables.

854
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:58,653
- But...
- What is...

855
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:00,964
- specifically namul?
- namul is dried vegetables.

856
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:03,363
- Dried vegetables...
- It has to be dried?

857
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:05,662
- Yes, it has to be dried.
- Okay.

858
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,334
Or... I'm wrong.

859
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:10,233
- It's namul even if it's not dried.
- No.

860
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:12,334
- Isn't spinach namul too?
- I take it back.

861
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:14,743
- Isn't spinach namul too?
- Yes.

862
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:16,343
I'll look into it.

863
00:37:16,473 --> 00:37:18,214
- I can find the definition.
- Spinach isn't namul, right?

864
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:21,682
(Searching complete)

865
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:23,553
It should be a wild...

866
00:37:23,683 --> 00:37:25,214
- Okay. Wild.
- plant.

867
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:26,384
(Si A puts it together again.)

868
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:27,953
I get it.

869
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:32,323
It can be boiled, stir-fried, or raw.

870
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:37,133
You mix it with condiments.

871
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:38,334
And that's all namul.

872
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:40,004
If it's anything we can eat.

873
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:44,134
The basic ingredient of namul is sesame oil.

874
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:46,473
For example, carrots.

875
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:49,143
If I season carrots,

876
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:50,573
- is that namul?
- It's namul.

877
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:53,043
- No.
- No, it's not.

878
00:37:53,044 --> 00:37:54,283
No. It is namul.

879
00:37:54,544 --> 00:37:55,613
No, it's not.

880
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:57,313
But there's also radish namul, Yo Han.

881
00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:58,383
I'll do some digging.

882
00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:00,683
Isn't it just a dish? I don't think that's namul.

883
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:04,023
I don't think carrots can become namul.

884
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:06,052
- I'm 1,000 percent sure...
- I didn't know...

885
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:07,492
- there's a difference.
- Koreans wouldn't know.

886
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,093
- Nobody actually knows.
- Look it up.

887
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:12,233
Is it namul if you season the vegetable?

888
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:14,803
- If carrots are included.
- Stir-frying it is still namul.

889
00:38:16,104 --> 00:38:18,134
Both seasoning and stir-frying it.

890
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:20,373
- I had no idea.
- Okay, I get it.

891
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:24,674
Vegetables plus cooking it equals namul.

892
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:26,314
- I think so.
- Yes.

893
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,114
You're right.

894
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:32,313
Thanks to Edward, we're doing some studying.

895
00:38:32,314 --> 00:38:33,323
(The Country members are learning Korean ingredients.)

896
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:35,654
- It's fun.
- I ask hard questions.

897
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:39,424
We're not that good at Korean, either.

898
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:41,893
We're still studying Korean.

899
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:44,194
(Yo Han is hilarious.)

900
00:38:45,163 --> 00:38:47,064
Kyun. Did you have a comfortable...

901
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:49,234
poo session?

902
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:52,473
Was it all right?

903
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:53,643
(Bumping)

904
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:55,973
For a second, I thought I heard him wrong.

905
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:58,072
Are you okay, A Sung?

906
00:38:58,073 --> 00:38:59,174
Did you bump your head?

907
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:01,142
Oh, gosh.

908
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:02,614
- I had a pleasant session.
- I see.

909
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,782
- No, but...
- I'm empty now.

910
00:39:04,783 --> 00:39:05,783
I'm covering my ears.

911
00:39:05,784 --> 00:39:06,984
(Yo Han made everyone laugh.)

912
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:09,653
Having this kind of conversation is just so funny.

913
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:10,823
We're a family.

914
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:15,063
(While they were chatting)

915
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:17,234
We're in Jeongseon now, right?

916
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:18,493
Yes.

917
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:20,104
How pretty.

918
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:24,933
(Thistle Hanchi Village, Jeongseon, Gangwon Province)

919
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:29,774
(Who will the Country members meet in the sub-zero weather?)

920
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:33,483
(The actual protagonist in "Sikgaek" by Huh Young Man)

921
00:39:33,484 --> 00:39:36,453
When seasoning namul, the cooking skill is key.

922
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:39,013
The cooking skill of a mother.

923
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:41,623
My hometown is Seoul.

924
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:44,154
By chance, I got to know thistle.

925
00:39:44,754 --> 00:39:46,423
After wondering what to make with it,

926
00:39:46,424 --> 00:39:49,123
I made jeonggwa and namul.

927
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:51,493
It's been almost 30 years.

928
00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:54,864
I can't let go of thistle.

929
00:39:55,404 --> 00:39:58,104
When it comes to thistle, it's me, and vice versa.

930
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:01,444
(Thistle has become her whole life.)

931
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:04,714
The air is fresh.

932
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:08,183
We're in the middle of the mountain.

933
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:10,453
- Yes. We are.
- Right in the middle.

934
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:13,084
The air is clear.

935
00:40:14,323 --> 00:40:15,583
(Surrounded by mountains and wild fields)

936
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:16,592
Look at the mountains.

937
00:40:16,593 --> 00:40:17,754
(Surrounded by mountains and wild fields)

938
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:21,423
That must be the place.

939
00:40:21,424 --> 00:40:22,663
(Kwon Young Won's house is at the foot of the mountain.)

940
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:25,294
The neighborhood is very quiet.

941
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:26,404
True.

942
00:40:27,663 --> 00:40:29,873
All three of us are wearing the same shoes.

943
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:32,234
Koreans.

944
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:34,373
It's comfortable.

945
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:36,813
- Hi.
- Hi.

946
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:38,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

947
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:40,642
Hi.

950
00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:43,884
How pretty.

951
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:45,183
- Nice to meet you.
- You're so pretty.

952
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:47,623
Nice to meet you.

953
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,053
- Hi.
- Hi.

954
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:51,952
- I'm a fan.
- Hi.

955
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:53,694
- Hi.
- Thank you.

956
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:56,334
It's cold, right? Warm yourselves here.

957
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:58,733
It's an old-style cast iron pot.

958
00:40:58,734 --> 00:40:59,803
Yes, an old cast iron pot.

959
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:01,762
(Eddie shows interest.)

960
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:02,803
This one.

961
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,372
- It's warm.
- Right? There are potatoes inside.

962
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:06,774
- Potatoes?
- Yes.

963
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:09,043
(Welcome potatoes for the Country members)

964
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:10,743
How long have you been boiling them for?

965
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:13,343
I've been boiling them for an hour to serve them to you right away.

966
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:15,383
It already smells amazing.

967
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:16,384
- Does it?
- Yes.

968
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:17,884
- Would you like to try one?
- Yes.

969
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:19,452
We're ready.

970
00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:21,583
(Opening the cast iron pot)

971
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:22,623
We're ready.

972
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:24,952
(The potatoes in the pot finally reveals themselves.)

973
00:41:24,953 --> 00:41:26,323
(Sparkling)

974
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:28,523
My gosh.

975
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:29,622
These are Dubek potatoes,

976
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:30,992
the most famous potatoes in Gangwon Province.

977
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:32,092
- Dubek?
- Dubek?

978
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,834
- Dubek potatoes.
- Dubek potatoes.

979
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:36,333
- Here.
- It looks hot.

980
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:37,572
(It smells delicious.)

981
00:41:37,573 --> 00:41:38,802
I can smell the fire.

982
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:39,973
- It's really hot.
- The fire.

983
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:41,243
I like handmade food.

984
00:41:41,774 --> 00:41:42,774
Thank you.

985
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:44,242
(Eating the warm potato...)

986
00:41:44,243 --> 00:41:46,243
(scented from the cast iron pot)

987
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:55,583
(The Country members are completely lost in the potatoes.)

988
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:56,823
- Is it good?
- Yes.

989
00:41:57,493 --> 00:41:58,653
It's so good.

990
00:41:58,654 --> 00:41:59,794
(Happy and satisfied)

991
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:02,893
It felt almost like a pillow.

992
00:42:03,593 --> 00:42:06,933
It was soft and steaming.

993
00:42:07,064 --> 00:42:08,404
And...

994
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:10,674
it was almost creamy inside.

995
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:12,433
It's delicious.

996
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,404
- Is it?
- Yes, it's so good.

997
00:42:15,544 --> 00:42:17,143
It's delicious.

998
00:42:17,513 --> 00:42:18,642
It's so fluffy.

999
00:42:18,643 --> 00:42:20,313
- What do you think?
- It's not sweet potato, is it?

1000
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:21,583
- It's potato.
- Potato.

1001
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:22,584
- Potato?
- Potato.

1002
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:24,012
- I can taste sweet potatoes.
- But it tastes like...

1003
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:25,853
- Yes. It's very sweet.
- Aren't they sweet?

1004
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:26,924
Yes, they are.

1005
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:30,493
Among all potatoes, this has the most starch in it.

1006
00:42:31,254 --> 00:42:33,193
This potato is filled with starch.

1007
00:42:33,194 --> 00:42:34,763
(Dubek Potato)

1008
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:39,903
It tastes sweet, salty, and clean.

1009
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:41,163
Yes, it's quite salty.

1010
00:42:42,504 --> 00:42:44,604
(Loving Dubek potatoes)

1011
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:47,544
(Staring)

1012
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:50,573
Praise the potato.

1013
00:42:50,743 --> 00:42:51,774
"Praise?"

1014
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:53,843
Thank you.

1015
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:55,782
- Praise the potato.
- Praise.

1016
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:56,913
Praise the potato.

1017
00:42:57,553 --> 00:42:58,584
Praise the potato.

1018
00:42:59,513 --> 00:43:02,154
We heard you had crocks.

1019
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:03,794
- Would you like to see them?
- Yes.

1020
00:43:05,194 --> 00:43:07,463
Kyun is very interested in pastes.

1021
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:08,524
- Really?
- Yes.

1022
00:43:09,194 --> 00:43:10,194
It's so good.

1023
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:11,194
- Is it?
- Yes.

1024
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:13,103
I'll give you a box of potatoes each on your way back.

1025
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:14,202
- Really?
- Yes.

1026
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:15,863
- But aren't these rare potatoes?
- I'm so happy.

1027
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:17,702
Potatoes are Gangwon Province's specialty.

1028
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:19,803
- Really? Thank you.
- Your mothers will love it.

1029
00:43:21,703 --> 00:43:23,774
- Why do you have so many crocks?
- Oh, gosh.

1030
00:43:24,114 --> 00:43:25,214
I have a collection.

1031
00:43:25,473 --> 00:43:27,213
(On top of the snowed-on crocks...)

1032
00:43:27,214 --> 00:43:29,483
(are baskets of namul.)

1033
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:30,513
My gosh.

1034
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:32,884
Okay. So this is real namul.

1035
00:43:33,053 --> 00:43:34,484
Yes. This is real namul.

1036
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:37,993
Is this thistle?

1037
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:39,153
What is it?

1038
00:43:39,154 --> 00:43:40,722
This is called goatsbeard.

1039
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:43,393
- I see.
- This is the first namul...

1040
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:45,493
to push up from the snow,

1041
00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:46,803
and just for a week.

1042
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:49,834
Story has it that Michael Jackson revisited Korea to have...

1043
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:53,302
spicy goatsbeard beef soup and stir-fried goatsbeard again.

1044
00:43:53,303 --> 00:43:54,873
This namul is just that good.

1045
00:43:55,973 --> 00:43:58,412
It tastes like beef and is quite chewy.

1046
00:43:58,413 --> 00:43:59,713
It has a great texture.

1047
00:43:59,714 --> 00:44:01,043
(Goatsbeard)

1048
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:02,314
(Tasting like meat, it's called beef of wild greens.)

1049
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:06,283
Are these namul grown around the area?

1050
00:44:06,553 --> 00:44:07,682
Yes.

1051
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:10,023
Various namul can be found in Gangwon Province.

1052
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:12,593
The further up you go, the sweeter the namul is.

1053
00:44:13,123 --> 00:44:14,464
This is the very thistle.

1054
00:44:16,424 --> 00:44:18,033
It's today's highlight.

1055
00:44:21,004 --> 00:44:22,563
(Thistle, Gangwon Province's main ingredient)

1056
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:23,834
- This...
- It looks like seaweed.

1057
00:44:24,303 --> 00:44:25,873
- He said it looks like seaweed.
- He said it looks like seaweed.

1058
00:44:25,973 --> 00:44:28,802
It's green when you don't boil it.

1059
00:44:28,803 --> 00:44:31,913
But once you do, the color changes to black.

1060
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:35,113
(When the green leaves meet heat,)

1061
00:44:35,114 --> 00:44:36,282
(it turns black.)

1062
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:37,552
- It's good.
- Is it?

1063
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:38,783
It's delicious.

1064
00:44:39,614 --> 00:44:41,283
It's a totally different flavor.

1065
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,564
This one is darae. In other words, kiwi.

1066
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:50,334
These are native kiwi from the mountain.

1067
00:44:50,663 --> 00:44:51,833
- Darae.
- Those...

1068
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:53,463
- Darae is Korean-style kiwi.
- Yes.

1069
00:44:53,464 --> 00:44:55,463
- Darae.
- Darae. It's all-natural.

1070
00:44:55,464 --> 00:44:57,403
- That's the leaves?
- Leaves of darae.

1071
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,104
This namul is very delicious.

1072
00:44:59,404 --> 00:45:02,174
(Putting it right into his mouth)

1073
00:45:03,473 --> 00:45:04,944
(Impressed)

1074
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,483
The scent of it. It's very aromatic.

1075
00:45:08,484 --> 00:45:10,084
(What does the uncooked darae taste like?)

1076
00:45:10,754 --> 00:45:13,013
- Sunlight...
- Sunlight.

1077
00:45:13,424 --> 00:45:15,182
- Do you dry them under the sun?
- Yes, the sun.

1078
00:45:15,183 --> 00:45:17,293
Yes, under the sun.

1079
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:19,654
No. It tastes like sunlight.

1080
00:45:20,123 --> 00:45:21,592
- It tastes like sunlight.
- He said it tastes like sunlight.

1081
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,762
So it tastes like sunlight.

1082
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,492
(The flavor of nature)

1083
00:45:24,493 --> 00:45:26,063
It's funny because if you look at them,

1084
00:45:26,064 --> 00:45:27,903
they all look similar.

1085
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:29,333
But when you taste it,

1086
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:32,273
every single one of them has a very distinct flavor.

1087
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:35,774
Some are more nutty, some are brighter,

1088
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:37,813
some are deeper,

1089
00:45:37,814 --> 00:45:41,043
and some have an earthy taste to them.

1090
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:42,412
(The taste of earth)

1091
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:44,154
Some taste like sunshine.

1092
00:45:44,913 --> 00:45:46,512
What's all in here?

1093
00:45:46,513 --> 00:45:48,084
There are empty crocks.

1094
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:49,822
(The crocks are filled with gochujang and doenjang.)

1095
00:45:49,823 --> 00:45:50,924
The pastes are in them.

1096
00:45:51,053 --> 00:45:52,553
- All the pastes are here?
- Gochujang and doenjang.

1097
00:45:54,323 --> 00:45:57,393
We call this Korean cuisine doenjang.

1098
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:01,163
(Having a taste of the handmade doenjang)

1099
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:04,703
- It tastes more flavorful.
- Isn't this one better?

1100
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:08,503
(Eddie is speechless at the depth of taste.)

1101
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,673
It's needed when stir-frying thistle.

1102
00:46:10,674 --> 00:46:11,813
- Have you tried it?
- Yes.

1103
00:46:11,814 --> 00:46:13,384
- Why?
- Try it.

1104
00:46:14,614 --> 00:46:15,944
(Amazed)

1105
00:46:17,654 --> 00:46:19,153
(As soon as it touches the tongue,)

1106
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:20,854
(the depth can be tasted.)

1107
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:23,993
- It tastes more flavorful.
- Isn't this one better?

1108
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:28,123
I don't think I've ever tasted doenjang that delicious before.

1109
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:29,863
It's not salty.

1110
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:32,163
It was salty but not unpleasant.

1111
00:46:32,564 --> 00:46:36,234
It had a really deep nutty flavor.

1112
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:38,872
Again, there's this beauty to...

1113
00:46:38,873 --> 00:46:39,972
(The doenjang had many charms.)

1114
00:46:39,973 --> 00:46:41,604
not everything being consistent.

1115
00:46:42,203 --> 00:46:44,044
The taste is still in my mouth.

1116
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:46,273
It keeps going and going.

1117
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:47,314
It's really delicious.

1118
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:52,052
(The flavorful doenjang will give new inspirations to Eddie.)

1119
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:53,213
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1120
00:46:53,214 --> 00:46:54,583
Thank you, ma'am.

1121
00:46:54,584 --> 00:46:57,694
(The Country members leave before the sun sets.)

1122
00:46:59,154 --> 00:47:00,564
Isn't a five-day market held?

1123
00:47:00,893 --> 00:47:02,864
- A market?
- A market.

1124
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:04,093
You're right.

1125
00:47:04,094 --> 00:47:07,564
A five-day market opens in Jeongseon today.

1126
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:09,302
Is it "fifth-day?"

1127
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:10,372
- "Five-day." - "Five-day."

1128
00:47:10,373 --> 00:47:11,734
Like the number five.

1129
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:13,473
Five.

1130
00:47:14,274 --> 00:47:15,504
Five fingers.

1131
00:47:15,843 --> 00:47:17,314
Five...

1132
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:20,883
(Why are they heading to Jeongseon Five-Day Market?)

1133
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:23,243
We'll do some grocery shopping.

1134
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:25,682
And sharing them with others seems like a good idea.

1135
00:47:25,683 --> 00:47:27,623
Are you suggesting we hold a party, Yo Han?

1136
00:47:27,783 --> 00:47:30,253
- Invite the neighbors and such?
- That's also a good idea.

1137
00:47:30,254 --> 00:47:31,254
In a way...

1138
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:34,623
They probably don't get a lot of visitors from America.

1139
00:47:34,794 --> 00:47:37,393
And so, I want to make this a special night for them...

1140
00:47:37,734 --> 00:47:39,334
and something they can remember.

1141
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:42,103
I'll use my cooking skills to hopefully give them...

1142
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:43,533
an authentic flavor.

1143
00:47:45,303 --> 00:47:48,504
(They head to the market for the elders' food.)

1144
00:47:49,473 --> 00:47:52,373
(Thinking deeply)

1145
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:55,084
(Thinking)

1146
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:56,614
We...

1147
00:47:56,614 --> 00:47:57,614
(What is he about to say?)

1148
00:47:57,615 --> 00:47:59,983
For dinner, I'm thinking chicken.

1149
00:47:59,984 --> 00:48:01,384
(Chicken?)

1150
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:03,854
- Yes.
- That's a good nice.

1151
00:48:03,953 --> 00:48:04,993
I'm in.

1152
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:07,964
I'm going to stew the chicken.

1153
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:10,063
It won't be fried chicken.

1154
00:48:10,064 --> 00:48:11,393
- I see.
- A stew.

1155
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:14,104
(Thinking hard)

1156
00:48:14,763 --> 00:48:15,763
Doenjang.

1157
00:48:15,764 --> 00:48:17,104
- Doenjang.
- We need doenjang.

1158
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:19,532
We'll use the doenjang that we got.

1159
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:21,142
She gave us amazing doenjang.

1160
00:48:21,143 --> 00:48:22,243
I know, right?

1161
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:24,774
I want to use soy milk.

1162
00:48:25,174 --> 00:48:26,613
- Soy milk.
- We need soy milk.

1163
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:28,483
Soy milk is usually for drinking.

1164
00:48:28,484 --> 00:48:29,783
Is it good when cooked too?

1165
00:48:29,913 --> 00:48:31,084
- It's the best.
- Is it?

1166
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,823
- Got it.
- Doenjang and soy milk.

1167
00:48:34,884 --> 00:48:36,483
Is it a creamy soup?

1168
00:48:36,484 --> 00:48:39,924
Yes. It's a creamy doenjang soup.

1169
00:48:40,694 --> 00:48:43,024
(Si A is trying to picture the taste.)

1170
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:45,463
- Potatoes.
- Okay.

1171
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,593
(A Sung jots down the ingredients.)

1172
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:49,303
Garlic and...

1173
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,473
- Namul.
- With the master's namul.

1174
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:52,932
We have tofu.

1175
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:53,972
(A Sung is focused.)

1176
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,403
- Garlic.
- Ginger.

1177
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:56,972
- Ginger.
- Sesame oil.

1178
00:48:56,973 --> 00:48:58,174
(Typing)

1179
00:48:58,413 --> 00:49:00,484
- I think that's it.
- All right.

1180
00:49:00,843 --> 00:49:01,884
Simple.

1181
00:49:03,953 --> 00:49:06,283
(Something is missing.)

1182
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:08,484
We should make hotteok.

1183
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:10,893
- Tonight?
- Yes.

1184
00:49:11,354 --> 00:49:12,354
Okay.

1185
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:14,263
Let's get vanilla ice cream.

1186
00:49:14,763 --> 00:49:16,964
- I want some kind of nuts.
- Nuts?

1187
00:49:17,093 --> 00:49:19,733
Don't you also put in pumpkin seeds?

1188
00:49:19,734 --> 00:49:20,802
- Yes.
- The stuffing.

1189
00:49:20,803 --> 00:49:22,163
But what if we put...

1190
00:49:23,303 --> 00:49:24,703
the dried persimmons?

1191
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:26,944
- That'll be great.
- Very good?

1192
00:49:27,544 --> 00:49:29,604
I want to try what you make, Kyun.

1193
00:49:30,774 --> 00:49:32,973
(Put your full faith in me today, Yo Han.)

1194
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:35,214
(Today's challenge is to captivate the elders' appetite.)

1195
00:49:35,484 --> 00:49:37,253
(Into the cast iron pot,)

1196
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:38,814
(a good amount of doenjang is added.)

1197
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:40,524
(Squeezing in the light soy milk)

1198
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:43,183
(And he's boiling the chicken inside?)

1199
00:49:45,294 --> 00:49:47,122
(Today's Main Dinner Menu: Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken)

1200
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:48,163
- Yes.
- Yes.

1201
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:52,993
(All of it becomes one with hotteok.)

1202
00:49:53,864 --> 00:49:56,202
(Today's Dinner Dessert: Persimmon Hotteok Ice)

1203
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:57,633
(Will they be able to capture...)

1204
00:49:57,634 --> 00:50:00,174
(the elders' appetite?)

1205
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:04,044
All right.

1206
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:05,614
(Turning)

1207
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:08,343
It's the mountains.

1208
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:10,552
There are also mountains.

1209
00:50:10,553 --> 00:50:12,714
- Are these Taebaek Mountains?
- It's surrounded by mountains.

1210
00:50:19,823 --> 00:50:21,593
Isn't this van comfortable to ride?

1211
00:50:21,993 --> 00:50:22,993
Yes.

1212
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:25,334
Despite the curvy road,

1213
00:50:26,134 --> 00:50:27,263
it feels very stable.

1214
00:50:28,134 --> 00:50:30,273
It doesn't give me motion sickness.

1215
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:31,774
- Because the ride is comfortable.
- Right.

1216
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:34,774
(Melting into the beautiful Taekbaek Mountains)

1217
00:50:35,444 --> 00:50:37,843
(Yo Han's smooth cornering)

1218
00:50:37,973 --> 00:50:40,984
(She's logged out for a moment.)

1219
00:50:41,444 --> 00:50:43,484
(How much longer will it take to get there?)

1220
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:46,083
(When Si A, who was dozing off,)

1221
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,553
(wakes up...)

1222
00:50:48,323 --> 00:50:49,484
We're almost there.

1223
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,823
Gosh, it's a very small town.

1224
00:50:54,163 --> 00:50:55,163
Yes.

1225
00:50:57,433 --> 00:50:58,564
Is this the market?

1226
00:50:58,763 --> 00:51:00,533
- Yes, right here.
- I think so.

1227
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:04,173
(Country members arrive at Jeongseon Five-Day Market.)

1228
00:51:04,174 --> 00:51:06,103
- Thank you for driving.
- We're here.

1229
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,143
Thank you for your patience.

1230
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:09,343
Oh, okay.

1231
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:11,314
- Market.
- That must be it.

1232
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:14,843
Gosh, this is Jeongseon Five-Day Market.

1233
00:51:14,944 --> 00:51:16,214
It's very big.

1234
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:17,854
I've never been to a five-day market before.

1235
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:22,282
(Jeongseon Five-Day Market)

1236
00:51:22,283 --> 00:51:24,293
(It opens on days that end with 2 and 7 every month.)

1237
00:51:24,294 --> 00:51:26,254
(It's the biggest traditional market in Korea.)

1238
00:51:28,163 --> 00:51:32,334
(Korea's traditional market with a warm market vibe from the past)

1239
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:38,203
(As it receives many visitors, it's full of food.)

1240
00:51:41,803 --> 00:51:45,043
(The feeling of affection is a charm of traditional markets.)

1241
00:51:45,044 --> 00:51:46,984
Will they have all the ingredients?

1242
00:51:47,343 --> 00:51:48,343
I think so.

1243
00:51:48,344 --> 00:51:49,714
- Okay.
- Yes.

1244
00:51:49,884 --> 00:51:52,453
It's a huge market.

1245
00:51:55,283 --> 00:51:56,953
- Gosh.
- There are cutting boards too.

1246
00:51:57,223 --> 00:51:59,654
- They look pretty.
- My goodness, that one...

1247
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:02,964
- They look cute.
- Please take a look and buy one.

1248
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:06,793
We should bring a present for Ms. Kwon.

1249
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:08,202
For her? That sounds good.

1250
00:52:08,203 --> 00:52:10,604
I bet she'll like it.

1251
00:52:11,004 --> 00:52:12,004
- Shall we?
- Or teacups.

1252
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:13,302
- That's a good idea.
- Yes.

1253
00:52:13,303 --> 00:52:14,303
(They want to buy a cutting board for Kwon Young Won.)

1254
00:52:14,444 --> 00:52:16,274
(Let's see.)

1255
00:52:16,373 --> 00:52:17,713
Like this one. It's small.

1256
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:18,943
It's very nice.

1257
00:52:18,944 --> 00:52:20,912
Yes, that's very cute.

1258
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:21,943
It's made of olive tree.

1259
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,383
- Really?
- Olive tree.

1260
00:52:23,384 --> 00:52:24,952
Okay, how much is it?

1261
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:26,182
It's 150 dollars.

1262
00:52:26,183 --> 00:52:28,183
It's 150 dollars?

1263
00:52:28,453 --> 00:52:29,884
- Really?
- Really?

1264
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:32,794
(Denying the reality)

1265
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:36,662
Mister, we don't have much money.

1266
00:52:36,663 --> 00:52:38,133
- It's quite expensive.
- It's hardwood, so it's not cheap.

1267
00:52:38,134 --> 00:52:39,263
Right, I could tell.

1268
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:40,633
We don't have money.

1269
00:52:40,634 --> 00:52:43,703
(Carefully, he takes a look inside the wallet.)

1270
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:46,734
- Do we have 150 dollars in cash?
- Is it okay?

1271
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:49,504
I think so, but...

1272
00:52:50,174 --> 00:52:51,174
We'd use it up.

1273
00:52:52,013 --> 00:52:53,943
Otherwise, we can't buy...

1274
00:52:53,944 --> 00:52:55,843
- the ingredients.
- We'll be back.

1275
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:57,713
We need to think. I'm sorry.

1276
00:52:57,714 --> 00:52:59,614
- Do you have a cheaper one?
- We have a budget.

1277
00:53:00,584 --> 00:53:02,523
This one costs 90 dollars.

1278
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:03,722
- Ninety dollars?
- This one?

1279
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:06,093
- Can we buy it for eighty dollars?
- Eighty?

1280
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:07,363
- Okay.
- Okay.

1281
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:08,364
As a present.

1282
00:53:10,194 --> 00:53:11,733
Okay, here's 80 dollars. Please double-check.

1283
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:12,734
Okay.

1284
00:53:15,803 --> 00:53:16,904
Thank you.

1285
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:18,274
It's so pretty.

1286
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:19,734
Okay.

1287
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:22,072
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1288
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,444
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1289
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:26,673
- We should hurry.
- Let's get groceries.

1290
00:53:26,674 --> 00:53:27,682
Yes.

1291
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:28,783
(It's time to buy groceries for real.)

1292
00:53:29,143 --> 00:53:30,912
As we discussed,

1293
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:32,483
- shall we split into two?
- Okay.

1294
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:34,723
You buy ginseng and drumsticks.

1295
00:53:35,123 --> 00:53:36,182
- What we will buy?
- Yes.

1296
00:53:36,183 --> 00:53:37,293
- Ginseng and drumsticks?
- Ginseng and drumsticks.

1297
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:38,823
- We'll buy the rest.
- Okay.

1298
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:41,823
- We're going this way.
- Then let's go that way.

1299
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:43,063
- See you later.
- See you.

1300
00:53:43,064 --> 00:53:44,064
Okay.

1301
00:53:46,864 --> 00:53:48,964
Is this your first time at a traditional market?

1302
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:52,873
No, I've been to markets often. Gwang...

1303
00:53:53,743 --> 00:53:55,742
- Gwangjang Market.
- Gwangjang Market?

1304
00:53:55,743 --> 00:53:58,243
- I see.
- I've been to Namdaemun Market.

1305
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:01,282
This is fun.

1306
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:02,783
(How competent will Eddie be at grocery shopping?)

1307
00:54:04,854 --> 00:54:05,983
What's this? Honey?

1308
00:54:05,984 --> 00:54:07,453
- It's honey.
- It's very...

1309
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:09,223
Don't we need honey?

1310
00:54:09,783 --> 00:54:10,993
Didn't you say that you needed it?

1311
00:54:11,453 --> 00:54:12,453
No.

1312
00:54:12,924 --> 00:54:14,092
We'll take a look around.

1313
00:54:14,093 --> 00:54:15,393
(He's sensitive due to the limited budget.)

1314
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:19,162
- Gosh, marinated crab.
- Would you like some?

1315
00:54:19,163 --> 00:54:20,433
(No, I don't need any.)

1316
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:23,033
(Kyun is firm.)

1317
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:25,674
What is this? It's not ginseng.

1318
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,303
No, it's milkvetch root.

1319
00:54:29,044 --> 00:54:32,774
(A necessary ingredient for today, ginseng)

1320
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:36,544
Excuse me, sir.

1321
00:54:39,953 --> 00:54:41,183
(Is no one here?)

1322
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:42,323
Sir!

1323
00:54:44,694 --> 00:54:46,694
(He's so driven.)

1324
00:54:46,924 --> 00:54:48,323
- Hello.
- Hello.

1325
00:54:49,763 --> 00:54:50,763
Are you not the owner?

1326
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:52,634
(Buzzing through)

1327
00:54:53,064 --> 00:54:54,532
(Embarrassed)

1328
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:55,864
One, two, three.

1329
00:54:55,964 --> 00:54:57,302
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1330
00:54:57,303 --> 00:54:58,573
(We want to see you.)

1331
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:00,073
We're cold.

1332
00:55:01,303 --> 00:55:02,572
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1333
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:04,242
- Hello.
- Hello.

1334
00:55:04,243 --> 00:55:05,243
Hello.

1335
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:06,543
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1336
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:09,143
(The owner of the shop appears.)

1337
00:55:09,243 --> 00:55:11,483
- I didn't know you were calling me.
- We're cold and in a hurry.

1338
00:55:11,484 --> 00:55:12,854
Do you have ginseng?

1339
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:14,984
I have wild-simulated ginseng instead.

1340
00:55:15,424 --> 00:55:16,723
- What type?
- It's not ginseng.

1341
00:55:17,654 --> 00:55:18,923
- Wild-simulated ginseng?
- Yes.

1342
00:55:18,924 --> 00:55:20,293
It was cultivated in the mountains.

1343
00:55:20,294 --> 00:55:21,294
- Really?
- Yes.

1344
00:55:21,295 --> 00:55:23,662
(Ginseng that's grown without pesticides...)

1345
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:26,794
(after planting seedlings in the mountain)

1346
00:55:27,303 --> 00:55:28,763
- Do you approve?
- Yes.

1347
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:30,433
It's really nice.

1348
00:55:30,634 --> 00:55:31,703
Let's buy some.

1349
00:55:32,303 --> 00:55:33,303
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

1350
00:55:33,303 --> 00:55:34,303
(Checking again)

1351
00:55:34,304 --> 00:55:36,573
- It's 45 dollars.
- Okay.

1352
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:37,674
Here you go.

1353
00:55:37,675 --> 00:55:38,912
(They buy wild-simulated ginseng, the first ingredient.)

1354
00:55:38,913 --> 00:55:40,472
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1355
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,483
Thank you.

1356
00:55:41,484 --> 00:55:43,383
(Holding precious wild-simulated ginseng tightly)

1357
00:55:43,384 --> 00:55:44,853
Thank you.

1358
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:46,754
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1359
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:49,883
- As for chickens...
- Can we get three chickens?

1360
00:55:49,884 --> 00:55:51,354
- Sure.
- Whole chickens.

1361
00:55:52,694 --> 00:55:53,694
Give us delicious ones.

1362
00:55:53,695 --> 00:55:56,194
- They're very delicious.
- Thank you so much.

1363
00:55:58,593 --> 00:56:00,262
- Good.
- That's a good one.

1364
00:56:00,263 --> 00:56:02,464
- That's a fat one.
- It looks very strong.

1365
00:56:02,564 --> 00:56:03,973
Physical 100 Chicken.

1366
00:56:06,174 --> 00:56:09,303
(Today's main ingredient: Meaty-looking chicken)

1367
00:56:09,604 --> 00:56:11,043
Is there any part you want to cut?

1368
00:56:11,044 --> 00:56:15,282
Separate the legs from the body.

1369
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:16,513
Okay.

1370
00:56:17,214 --> 00:56:18,214
- Okay?
- Yes.

1371
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,783
- He's a cook.
- I see.

1372
00:56:23,993 --> 00:56:25,223
How shall I cut this?

1373
00:56:25,323 --> 00:56:26,453
Please cut that too.

1374
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:28,423
- Like this?
- Or I can't stand it.

1375
00:56:28,424 --> 00:56:29,524
You can't stand it?

1376
00:56:30,424 --> 00:56:32,694
(He's the type who's committed to his work.)

1377
00:56:33,763 --> 00:56:34,834
- We'd like...
- Yes?

1378
00:56:35,634 --> 00:56:37,674
Shall we buy half pumpkin seeds, half sunflower seeds?

1379
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:39,173
- That sounds good.
- This is five dollars.

1380
00:56:39,174 --> 00:56:40,532
- And...
- This one is better.

1381
00:56:40,533 --> 00:56:41,803
- Okay.
- And...

1382
00:56:42,803 --> 00:56:43,944
Will this be enough?

1383
00:56:44,044 --> 00:56:46,214
Wait, let me check.

1384
00:56:47,114 --> 00:56:49,483
Goodness.

1385
00:56:49,484 --> 00:56:51,053
(A Sung checks each ingredient meticulously.)

1386
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:55,453
May I try some squid?

1387
00:56:56,053 --> 00:56:57,493
(Si A feels a little hungry.)

1388
00:56:57,524 --> 00:56:59,353
Dried squid is quite expensive,

1389
00:56:59,354 --> 00:57:00,354
- Really?
- but I'll give you some.

1390
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:02,262
- Thank you.
- Try it.

1391
00:57:02,263 --> 00:57:03,662
(Foodie Si A appears again at the market.)

1392
00:57:03,663 --> 00:57:05,093
A Sung, do you want some?

1393
00:57:05,493 --> 00:57:07,662
Dried squid? Do we need anything else?

1394
00:57:07,663 --> 00:57:09,003
Thank you.

1395
00:57:09,004 --> 00:57:10,633
- We'll buy these two.
- Okay.

1396
00:57:10,634 --> 00:57:11,803
This is delicious.

1397
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:13,073
We'll take these.

1398
00:57:13,573 --> 00:57:15,044
(What's that?)

1399
00:57:16,473 --> 00:57:18,512
Thank you. Please throw away the receipt.

1400
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:19,513
(Foodie Si A's radar works perpetually.)

1401
00:57:19,714 --> 00:57:21,083
(Glancing)

1402
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:22,183
Goodbye.

1403
00:57:23,413 --> 00:57:24,413
Let's go.

1404
00:57:24,414 --> 00:57:25,614
(I want some more.)

1405
00:57:26,254 --> 00:57:27,384
Stop looking.

1406
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:29,424
- We have a lot to do.
- Okay.

1407
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:33,794
- He told us to get ten, right?
- Yes.

1408
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:35,863
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

1409
00:57:35,864 --> 00:57:37,964
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1410
00:57:38,634 --> 00:57:40,802
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

1411
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:42,004
(They also get dried persimmon.)

1412
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:48,904
The lady was also wearing a vest like that.

1413
00:57:49,643 --> 00:57:50,643
It looks cute.

1414
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:53,044
(The colorful and cute vest catches A Sung and Si A's eye.)

1415
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:54,782
It's nice.

1416
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:55,842
(Eddie is trying on that vest.)

1417
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:56,843
Oh, gosh.

1418
00:57:57,953 --> 00:58:00,783
- For Christmas...
- It'd be nice.

1419
00:58:00,884 --> 00:58:01,884
Eddie, how about...

1420
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:04,823
(It looks nice.)

1421
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:08,763
It feels so warm. It's good.

1422
00:58:09,794 --> 00:58:12,592
Eddie, can you buy me one too? Do you have money?

1423
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,202
- You?
- Yes.

1424
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:15,464
Okay, pick one.

1425
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:19,133
I'll get a matching one.

1426
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:20,134
Okay.

1427
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:21,904
(Yo Han is so cute.)

1428
00:58:22,303 --> 00:58:23,503
Pink is the best for men.

1429
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:24,814
(Pink is the best for men.)

1430
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:27,313
(Yo Han picks out a pink vest.)

1431
00:58:27,314 --> 00:58:29,613
It's somewhat similar to Chanel.

1432
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:30,614
(His opinion is 100 percent subjective.)

1433
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:32,484
(He loves the joke.)

1434
00:58:34,953 --> 00:58:36,154
You look amazing.

1435
00:58:36,254 --> 00:58:38,993
- Do I look okay?
- You look amazing.

1436
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:43,762
- Eddie, I...
- Seriously, but...

1437
00:58:43,763 --> 00:58:45,263
(There's more bromance thanks to the matching vests.)

1438
00:58:46,634 --> 00:58:47,634
You look amazing.

1439
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:50,774
(Yo Han... Actors are indeed different.)

1440
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:53,734
(Eddie, do I look good?)

1441
00:58:53,803 --> 00:58:55,303
- I'll get this one.
- Sure.

1442
00:58:57,073 --> 00:58:58,543
(The regulation team arrives.)

1443
00:58:58,544 --> 00:59:00,243
- Hello.
- Wait...

1444
00:59:00,944 --> 00:59:02,682
Are you getting nice things only for yourselves?

1445
00:59:02,683 --> 00:59:04,552
We're diligently shopping for groceries,

1446
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:05,854
and you're shopping for clothes?

1447
00:59:05,984 --> 00:59:07,822
What you bought looks nice.

1448
00:59:07,823 --> 00:59:09,884
- Right?
- We got matching ones.

1449
00:59:10,254 --> 00:59:11,293
Buy me one too.

1450
00:59:11,294 --> 00:59:13,024
- Okay.
- Please buy me one too.

1451
00:59:13,123 --> 00:59:15,694
(My goodness)

1452
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:17,793
- I want this one.
- That one?

1453
00:59:17,794 --> 00:59:18,893
That'd look good on you.

1454
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:20,564
- We'll buy these.
- Okay.

1455
00:59:20,663 --> 00:59:21,663
Now...

1456
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,134
Ma'am?

1457
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:24,803
How much are these?

1458
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:27,173
The total is 30 dollars. It's 10 dollars each.

1459
00:59:27,174 --> 00:59:28,342
Okay, thank you.

1460
00:59:28,343 --> 00:59:30,842
(He calms down the members.)

1461
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:31,973
Ma'am, you're the best.

1462
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:36,044
- I like it 1,000 percent.
- The thing is...

1463
00:59:36,143 --> 00:59:38,583
His lip color is the same color as the vest.

1464
00:59:38,584 --> 00:59:39,584
Did you match them?

1465
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:40,584
I matched them.

1466
00:59:40,585 --> 00:59:42,984
It makes his lips look sexier.

1467
00:59:43,384 --> 00:59:44,623
Is that so?

1468
00:59:44,723 --> 00:59:47,122
You look like... How shall I put it?

1469
00:59:47,123 --> 00:59:48,123
(Bromance continues after purchasing the vest.)

1470
00:59:48,124 --> 00:59:49,423
(She decides to look away.)

1471
00:59:49,424 --> 00:59:50,464
How shall I put it?

1472
00:59:51,163 --> 00:59:53,162
He looks like Casanova.

1473
00:59:53,163 --> 00:59:54,163
He looks like a player.

1474
00:59:54,763 --> 00:59:57,004
(Eddie plus a vest from the market equal a player?)

1475
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,032
Eddie, I'll wear it all my life.

1476
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:01,044
(They make another precious memory.)

1477
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:03,642
(Country members are content after their shopping.)

1478
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:05,174
See you again.

1479
01:00:06,044 --> 01:00:07,142
Thank you.

1480
01:00:07,143 --> 01:00:08,682
(How will their dinner that they will cook look?)

1481
01:00:08,683 --> 01:00:10,513
We spent the most money here.

1482
01:00:12,814 --> 01:00:15,623
(Eddie's magic starts whenever the sun goes down.)

1483
01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:18,694
(Country members' first party project)

1484
01:00:21,823 --> 01:00:23,093
Let's get started.

1485
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:24,694
By the way, where is everything?

1486
01:00:25,794 --> 01:00:28,104
(At the sound of Eddie's voice looking for ingredients,)

1487
01:00:28,203 --> 01:00:31,174
(A Sung and Si A Sisters bring the ingredients right away.)

1488
01:00:31,473 --> 01:00:32,673
- One, two.
- One, two?

1489
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:33,674
Yes.

1490
01:00:34,174 --> 01:00:36,742
(It's time to plan the party.)

1491
01:00:36,743 --> 01:00:38,714
I'll make the chicken dish.

1492
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:41,583
- You'll help me chop everything.
- Okay.

1493
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:42,984
- Can you make hotteok?
- Sure.

1494
01:00:43,084 --> 01:00:44,084
And then...

1495
01:00:44,984 --> 01:00:46,314
After helping her with hotteok,

1496
01:00:46,513 --> 01:00:49,223
I'll go out and send out the invitations.

1497
01:00:49,323 --> 01:00:50,424
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1498
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:52,552
Around what time should I tell them to come?

1499
01:00:52,553 --> 01:00:56,924
If we start right now... How about 7:15pm?

1500
01:00:57,223 --> 01:00:58,893
- In an hour?
- At 7:15pm?

1501
01:00:59,093 --> 01:01:00,492
We have an hour from now.

1502
01:01:00,493 --> 01:01:01,504
Then...

1503
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:05,703
- Then...
- How many hotteok should we make?

1504
01:01:05,803 --> 01:01:07,803
I don't know. It's for 11 people.

1505
01:01:08,203 --> 01:01:10,404
- About 11 pieces?
- Yes.

1506
01:01:10,643 --> 01:01:13,544
(Their cooking starts in earnest.)

1507
01:01:14,513 --> 01:01:15,843
It's not a Korean dish,

1508
01:01:16,544 --> 01:01:18,553
but I wanted to put some Korean flavor.

1509
01:01:18,714 --> 01:01:21,754
To me, it was an honor to be able to use the cast iron pot.

1510
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:23,654
I'll use my hands...

1511
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:25,893
to cook something new.

1512
01:01:26,294 --> 01:01:28,564
So I really wanted to deliver that for them.

1513
01:01:28,663 --> 01:01:31,134
(An unusual combination of chicken, doenjang, and soy milk)

1514
01:01:31,393 --> 01:01:34,634
(Country Cook's main menu: Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken)

1515
01:01:35,064 --> 01:01:36,133
All right.

1516
01:01:36,134 --> 01:01:37,604
(They start cooking dinner for the elderly in the village.)

1517
01:01:38,734 --> 01:01:41,373
(Prepping matsutake mushrooms first)

1518
01:01:45,174 --> 01:01:47,174
(Emptying out the water)

1519
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,412
Eddie, I'll prepare the vegetables separately.

1520
01:01:50,413 --> 01:01:51,413
Perfect.

1521
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:52,683
Do we have ginger?

1522
01:01:52,783 --> 01:01:53,783
- Ginger...
- Ginger?

1523
01:01:53,784 --> 01:01:55,653
- It should be in a container.
- I'll look for ginger.

1524
01:01:55,654 --> 01:01:57,793
- We have it.
- A big container...

1525
01:01:57,794 --> 01:01:58,893
There it is.

1526
01:01:59,493 --> 01:02:01,322
- Chef, is this enough ginger?
- Yes?

1527
01:02:01,323 --> 01:02:02,493
Yes, that's good.

1528
01:02:02,964 --> 01:02:04,393
Put everything here.

1529
01:02:04,593 --> 01:02:06,793
Chef, should I put...

1530
01:02:06,794 --> 01:02:08,802
all the dried nuts in here?

1531
01:02:08,803 --> 01:02:10,133
A little bit of this.

1532
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:11,302
- Okay, should I chop them?
- Yes.

1533
01:02:11,303 --> 01:02:12,373
- Chop them into small pieces?
- Yes.

1534
01:02:12,473 --> 01:02:13,674
- Okay.
- Perfect.

1535
01:02:13,774 --> 01:02:15,802
How big should I cut it?

1536
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:18,513
The same size as this.

1537
01:02:20,013 --> 01:02:22,584
I can't believe I'm cutting something in front of you.

1538
01:02:23,183 --> 01:02:24,214
I feel so honored.

1539
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:28,024
- The honor is mine.
- Right.

1540
01:02:30,924 --> 01:02:33,993
(Their cooking as a team is going smoothly.)

1541
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:36,424
- Like this?
- Perfect.

1542
01:02:38,093 --> 01:02:40,093
It's like we're opening a restaurant.

1543
01:02:40,493 --> 01:02:43,933
(Ingredients are prepped for Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken.)

1544
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:47,404
We have to make a fire.

1545
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,302
Why don't you finish this?

1546
01:02:50,303 --> 01:02:52,174
- I'll go out and start a fire.
- Okay, perfect.

1547
01:02:53,073 --> 01:02:54,143
Goodness.

1548
01:02:55,243 --> 01:02:57,384
(Gosh, it's cold.)

1549
01:02:57,683 --> 01:02:59,783
(Shall I start the fire?)

1550
01:03:02,553 --> 01:03:05,323
(The cast iron pots are outside.)

1551
01:03:06,723 --> 01:03:08,864
(Looking around)

1552
01:03:09,663 --> 01:03:12,093
(Looking around again)

1553
01:03:13,194 --> 01:03:15,303
(It's harder to start a fire than he thought.)

1554
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:20,203
(Yo Han takes his gloves and heads somewhere.)

1555
01:03:20,834 --> 01:03:21,842
Is anyone home?

1556
01:03:21,843 --> 01:03:22,843
(Kwon Young Won's workplace)

1557
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:25,174
May I get some newspaper from you?

1558
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:26,842
- We don't have any.
- We don't have any newspaper.

1559
01:03:26,843 --> 01:03:28,642
Can you give me any type of paper?

1560
01:03:28,643 --> 01:03:29,713
(He enters without asking for permission.)

1561
01:03:29,714 --> 01:03:30,813
Thank you.

1562
01:03:30,814 --> 01:03:33,484
(He gets cardboard for the fire.)

1563
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:40,123
(Driven)

1564
01:03:41,323 --> 01:03:43,294
(While Yo Han is starting a fire alone)

1565
01:03:43,564 --> 01:03:44,564
Peanuts.

1566
01:03:44,565 --> 01:03:45,662
(Inside, Team Hotteok is brainstorming ideas.)

1567
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,663
Yes.

1568
01:03:47,593 --> 01:03:49,634
- Isn't it savory?
- Shall we toast it?

1569
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:51,633
Okay, after toasting them,

1570
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:52,932
- Just lightly.
- I'll crush them.

1571
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,173
- I need to make them small.
- Yes.

1572
01:03:54,174 --> 01:03:55,174
Okay.

1573
01:03:55,973 --> 01:03:58,742
Usually, I don't toast peanuts.

1574
01:03:58,743 --> 01:04:02,242
It's just to elevate it.

1575
01:04:02,243 --> 01:04:04,683
- That's good.
- To make it fancier?

1576
01:04:05,013 --> 01:04:08,223
Now, you're professional chefs.

1577
01:04:08,584 --> 01:04:09,584
Really?

1578
01:04:09,585 --> 01:04:10,923
Almost.

1579
01:04:10,924 --> 01:04:11,924
Almost?

1580
01:04:13,294 --> 01:04:14,893
Thank you for saying that.

1581
01:04:16,564 --> 01:04:18,033
(Full of confidence)

1582
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:19,393
(Shall I make some hotteok like a real cook?)

1583
01:04:21,964 --> 01:04:23,403
(Hotteok Recipe 1)

1584
01:04:23,404 --> 01:04:26,302
(Stir-fry peanuts, almonds, and sunflower seeds...)

1585
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:29,143
(for hotteok on a frying pan.)

1586
01:04:30,544 --> 01:04:32,413
(But the time is...)

1587
01:04:32,513 --> 01:04:36,213
A Sung, if I put these in now, the sugar will melt.

1588
01:04:36,214 --> 01:04:38,012
- Once they cooled down, - Yes.

1589
01:04:38,013 --> 01:04:41,053
crush the peanuts and mix them together.

1590
01:04:41,424 --> 01:04:43,782
If I have time after sending out invitations,

1591
01:04:43,783 --> 01:04:44,822
I'll do it.

1592
01:04:44,823 --> 01:04:46,853
Otherwise, can you crush the peanuts...

1593
01:04:46,854 --> 01:04:48,892
and mix them with sugar?

1594
01:04:48,893 --> 01:04:49,893
Okay.

1595
01:04:49,894 --> 01:04:52,464
I'll join Team Hotteok when I come back.

1596
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,363
- I'll be back.
- Don't follow any stranger...

1597
01:04:54,364 --> 01:04:55,364
even if he promises to buy you chocolate.

1598
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:57,203
What type of chocolate will it be?

1599
01:04:57,904 --> 01:04:58,973
I'll ask, but that's it.

1600
01:04:59,073 --> 01:05:00,233
- Okay.
- I'll only ask.

1601
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:01,303
You're worrying me.

1602
01:05:01,803 --> 01:05:04,044
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

1603
01:05:06,973 --> 01:05:07,984
Gosh, it's cold.

1604
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,854
(Adjusting her clothes for clean first impression)

1605
01:05:14,053 --> 01:05:15,783
I feel nervous.

1606
01:05:18,654 --> 01:05:19,794
Is it this way?

1607
01:05:24,533 --> 01:05:25,533
Look at that.

1608
01:05:25,993 --> 01:05:27,864
Smoke is rising from the chimney.

1609
01:05:27,964 --> 01:05:30,503
They aren't preparing dinner, are they?

1610
01:05:30,504 --> 01:05:31,504
(Anxious)

1611
01:05:33,203 --> 01:05:34,203
(Advancing Si A sets off.)

1612
01:05:34,204 --> 01:05:37,274
- Excuse me.
- Who is it?

1613
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:39,543
- Hello.
- Who is it?

1614
01:05:39,544 --> 01:05:42,083
- I'm Shin Si A.
- Yes?

1615
01:05:42,084 --> 01:05:43,242
May I come in?

1616
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:44,854
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1617
01:05:45,214 --> 01:05:46,452
(Entering boldly without hesitation)

1618
01:05:46,453 --> 01:05:48,322
- Hello.
- Hello.

1619
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:50,983
- Where are you from?
- We're shooting...

1620
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:54,293
a cooking show with a chef up there.

1621
01:05:54,294 --> 01:05:56,263
Have you had dinner yet?

1622
01:05:56,794 --> 01:05:58,162
- No, not yet.
- Not yet?

1623
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,563
We eat dinner late.

1624
01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:00,633
- Really?
- Yes.

1625
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:02,834
We have a chef from the US.

1626
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:06,932
He's preparing a delicious dinner with local ingredients.

1627
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:09,142
Really? Will we get delicious food if we come?

1628
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:11,314
Yes, of course.

1629
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:14,044
- Then we should go.
- We'll come for delicious food.

1630
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:16,714
If you arrive around 7:20pm,

1631
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:18,512
your food will be hot and ready.

1632
01:06:18,513 --> 01:06:19,883
Thank you so much.

1633
01:06:19,884 --> 01:06:21,182
We'll definitely come.

1634
01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:22,952
- See you soon.
- Okay.

1635
01:06:22,953 --> 01:06:24,524
Nice to meet you.

1636
01:06:25,123 --> 01:06:27,222
- You're so beautiful.
- Me? Thank you.

1637
01:06:27,223 --> 01:06:29,323
- She's so pretty.
- You're also beautiful.

1638
01:06:30,763 --> 01:06:32,092
See you in a bit.

1639
01:06:32,093 --> 01:06:33,233
- See you soon, sir.
- See you.

1640
01:06:33,234 --> 01:06:34,903
We'll come for delicious food.

1641
01:06:34,904 --> 01:06:37,404
Yes, you can look forward to it.

1642
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:40,904
(Heading to the next house after charging her confidence)

1643
01:06:42,104 --> 01:06:43,104
Is it here?

1644
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:45,913
(Is it this way?)

1645
01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:48,282
Let's see.

1646
01:06:48,283 --> 01:06:49,283
(The white is snow, and the black is a path.)

1647
01:06:49,284 --> 01:06:51,413
(Searching houses endlessly)

1648
01:06:54,623 --> 01:06:56,524
(Here's a house.)

1649
01:06:58,854 --> 01:06:59,854
Someone is inside.

1650
01:07:00,593 --> 01:07:02,392
Oh, my goodness.

1651
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,393
(Shining her flashlight inside the house out of excitement)

1652
01:07:03,424 --> 01:07:05,433
They must be watching TV.

1653
01:07:06,634 --> 01:07:07,634
Okay.

1654
01:07:07,635 --> 01:07:08,864
(Okay, let's go for it.)

1655
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:14,104
(Fixing her clothes once again)

1656
01:07:14,604 --> 01:07:16,444
(Knocking)

1657
01:07:17,703 --> 01:07:19,814
Hello, is anyone home?

1658
01:07:20,513 --> 01:07:22,683
(Can't they hear me?)

1659
01:07:24,013 --> 01:07:25,013
Who is it?

1660
01:07:25,183 --> 01:07:27,213
- Hello.
- Hello.

1661
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:28,683
- Hello.
- Where are you from?

1662
01:07:31,623 --> 01:07:33,293
You know the factory up there?

1663
01:07:33,294 --> 01:07:35,463
We're shooting a TV show next to the factory.

1664
01:07:35,464 --> 01:07:36,464
Have you seen...

1665
01:07:36,465 --> 01:07:38,032
- "Culinary Class Wars?" - Yes.

1666
01:07:38,033 --> 01:07:39,162
- You have?
- Yes.

1667
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:40,963
Do you know Chef Edward Lee from that show?

1668
01:07:40,964 --> 01:07:42,633
- Yes.
- Do you know him?

1669
01:07:42,634 --> 01:07:44,033
- The foreigner?
- Right.

1670
01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:47,273
He's on a journey to find flavors of Korea.

1671
01:07:47,274 --> 01:07:48,543
Is that so?

1672
01:07:48,643 --> 01:07:50,143
Have you had dinner?

1673
01:07:50,244 --> 01:07:53,444
- No, not yet.
- Really?

1674
01:07:53,543 --> 01:07:54,642
- Really?
- Yes.

1675
01:07:54,643 --> 01:07:56,814
If it's okay with you,

1676
01:07:56,914 --> 01:07:59,383
would you like to join us for dinner?

1677
01:08:00,984 --> 01:08:03,824
(Please...)

1678
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,523
Okay, sure.

1679
01:08:05,524 --> 01:08:06,623
- Would that be okay?
- Yes.

1680
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,823
We'll serve you stew with ginseng.

1681
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:11,292
Okay.

1682
01:08:11,293 --> 01:08:14,392
I'll bring some homemade liqueur.

1683
01:08:14,393 --> 01:08:15,703
- Homemade liqueur?
- Yes.

1684
01:08:15,704 --> 01:08:18,673
- Did you make it yourself?
- Yes, it's called jandae.

1685
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:22,274
(Suddenly, he gets very talkative.)

1686
01:08:23,444 --> 01:08:26,074
(She listens to his story about the liqueur like she's possessed.)

1687
01:08:26,374 --> 01:08:28,244
I pick all medicinal herbs that grow in the mountains.

1688
01:08:28,343 --> 01:08:30,114
- Are you a ginseng digger?
- Yes.

1689
01:08:31,513 --> 01:08:32,813
It's my first time meeting one.

1690
01:08:32,814 --> 01:08:34,183
(Si A is fascinated.)

1691
01:08:34,284 --> 01:08:36,823
I'll see you later with the liqueur.

1692
01:08:36,824 --> 01:08:38,093
All right.

1693
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:40,323
- Bye.
- See you soon.

1694
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,564
- Okay.
- Get home safely.

1695
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:44,864
Okay, see you soon.

1696
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:48,204
(While Si A is inviting guests without problems)

1697
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:50,664
(At the lodging, on the other hand)

1698
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:52,632
(Prepping chicken for the main dish)

1699
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:55,743
Do elderly women in the countryside...

1700
01:08:55,744 --> 01:08:57,244
eat chicken?

1701
01:08:57,604 --> 01:08:58,813
- Do they like it?
- They will like it.

1702
01:08:58,814 --> 01:09:00,074
- You think so?
- Yes.

1703
01:09:00,414 --> 01:09:02,583
All Koreans like chicken.

1704
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:03,643
Okay, good.

1705
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:06,182
Here's my concern.

1706
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,953
I want to make...

1707
01:09:07,954 --> 01:09:12,193
- a special meal for the old ladies.
- I see.

1708
01:09:12,194 --> 01:09:14,892
- If it's too American, - Or exotic?

1709
01:09:14,893 --> 01:09:16,523
they won't like it.

1710
01:09:16,524 --> 01:09:20,063
I'm trying to strike a balance.

1711
01:09:20,064 --> 01:09:22,833
Yes, you're doing very well.

1712
01:09:22,933 --> 01:09:25,773
Old ladies can't lie.

1713
01:09:25,774 --> 01:09:26,774
Right.

1714
01:09:27,874 --> 01:09:30,773
- When the food is bad...
- They're the strictest judges.

1715
01:09:30,774 --> 01:09:31,814
(Old ladies' comments are the most intimidating.)

1716
01:09:31,914 --> 01:09:36,043
If they scold me, I'll cry.

1717
01:09:36,914 --> 01:09:39,383
(That's hilarious.)

1718
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:41,923
(To serve an unforgettable and special meal for the elderly,)

1719
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:47,324
(he's prepping chicken for the stew with love.)

1720
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,994
Okay, chicken.

1721
01:09:53,364 --> 01:09:55,763
Chicken is Koreans' comfort food.

1722
01:09:55,864 --> 01:09:57,503
- Is it comfort food? Good.
- Yes.

1723
01:09:58,503 --> 01:10:00,432
(One man has been forgotten.)

1724
01:10:00,433 --> 01:10:01,473
Gosh, it's flaring.

1725
01:10:03,274 --> 01:10:04,343
It's flaring well.

1726
01:10:06,213 --> 01:10:08,182
(Flaring up)

1727
01:10:08,183 --> 01:10:09,883
I can't believe I started the fire on my first try.

1728
01:10:10,814 --> 01:10:12,713
I may be talented at this.

1729
01:10:13,654 --> 01:10:16,383
The fire lit up at once.

1730
01:10:16,923 --> 01:10:18,722
(Thanks to Yo Han's outstanding performance)

1731
01:10:18,723 --> 01:10:19,793
It's burning so well.

1732
01:10:21,194 --> 01:10:22,194
I'm coming.

1733
01:10:22,763 --> 01:10:23,892
- Edward.
- Yes?

1734
01:10:23,893 --> 01:10:24,893
I ignited it.

1735
01:10:25,694 --> 01:10:26,694
One-shot.

1736
01:10:27,763 --> 01:10:30,303
- I'm a genius.
- You're very impressive.

1737
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:32,403
- Oh, my gosh.
- Kyun.

1738
01:10:32,404 --> 01:10:34,773
Is this enough water for 11 people?

1739
01:10:34,774 --> 01:10:36,042
- Yes.
- Okay.

1740
01:10:36,043 --> 01:10:38,173
- We need something for this, right?
- Yes.

1741
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:39,444
Just a second.

1742
01:10:42,343 --> 01:10:43,883
(Knocking)

1743
01:10:43,914 --> 01:10:46,153
I wasn't going to come back.

1744
01:10:46,154 --> 01:10:47,582
(Being clingy)

1745
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,682
But such is life... Hello.

1746
01:10:49,683 --> 01:10:51,893
I wasn't going to come back.

1747
01:10:52,593 --> 01:10:56,323
Do you have a big ladle I can use...

1748
01:10:56,324 --> 01:10:58,063
for the cast iron pot?

1749
01:10:58,064 --> 01:11:00,194
- I totally do.
- Thank you.

1750
01:11:00,463 --> 01:11:02,163
- No, the big one.
- No.

1751
01:11:02,164 --> 01:11:03,234
Yes, the big one.

1752
01:11:03,664 --> 01:11:04,703
We have one this big.

1753
01:11:04,704 --> 01:11:06,234
Yes, thank you.

1754
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:10,273
(Suddenly singing "Arirang")

1755
01:11:10,274 --> 01:11:11,303
Thank you.

1756
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:13,173
This one.

1757
01:11:13,643 --> 01:11:15,443
(Singing "Arirang" here?)

1758
01:11:15,444 --> 01:11:18,042
Thank you. I won't come back.

1759
01:11:18,043 --> 01:11:19,753
(Yo Han finishes his "Arirang" show that came out of nowhere.)

1760
01:11:21,053 --> 01:11:23,083
(He goes back to Kyun.)

1761
01:11:23,183 --> 01:11:26,723
Let's go.

1762
01:11:26,893 --> 01:11:28,053
- Kyun.
- Yes.

1763
01:11:28,463 --> 01:11:30,194
This ladle won't work, will it?

1764
01:11:30,963 --> 01:11:32,463
(The ladle is obviously too small.)

1765
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:33,963
- Why?
- So I prepared another one.

1766
01:11:34,904 --> 01:11:38,003
- Here.
- That's perfect.

1767
01:11:38,204 --> 01:11:39,274
- Okay.
- Yes.

1768
01:11:40,234 --> 01:11:42,673
- Then I'm going to start...
- Okay, first.

1769
01:11:43,244 --> 01:11:44,743
Onions and cabbage.

1770
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:45,744
(Let's start cooking Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken.)

1771
01:11:46,074 --> 01:11:47,113
(Add cabbages, onions, mushrooms, garlic, wild-simulated ginseng...)

1772
01:11:47,114 --> 01:11:48,182
(and others in boiling water to make the broth.)

1773
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:50,083
Go.

1774
01:11:50,513 --> 01:11:52,753
I hope they like garlic. I put in a lot of garlic.

1775
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:56,853
- Doenjang and... Okay. Doenjang.
- Yes.

1776
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:57,854
Yes.

1777
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,454
(Today's kick, doenjang aged for 4 years from Ms. Kwon Young Won)

1778
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:00,993
(Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken recipe, step 2)

1779
01:12:00,994 --> 01:12:02,222
(Mix doenjang with the vegetable broth.)

1780
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:03,723
Let's cook chicken.

1781
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,563
- Chicken first?
- Yes.

1782
01:12:05,564 --> 01:12:06,564
(Next is chicken.)

1783
01:12:06,933 --> 01:12:08,433
Drumsticks first.

1784
01:12:09,664 --> 01:12:11,263
Drumsticks take long to cook.

1785
01:12:11,604 --> 01:12:14,003
So we'll add drumsticks first and the rest later.

1786
01:12:14,874 --> 01:12:16,403
- Sesame oil.
- Sesame oil.

1787
01:12:16,404 --> 01:12:18,173
We're not following any recipe.

1788
01:12:18,944 --> 01:12:21,472
I don't know what will happen, but add a bit of makgeolli.

1789
01:12:21,473 --> 01:12:22,913
(He adds makgeolli to the cooking?)

1790
01:12:22,914 --> 01:12:24,882
- Add a bit of makgeolli.
- Good.

1791
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:27,182
Just a bit.

1792
01:12:27,183 --> 01:12:28,324
(Pouring a lot)

1793
01:12:28,654 --> 01:12:30,654
- Let's just put this all in.
- Okay.

1794
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:33,293
(Pouring soy milk?)

1795
01:12:34,253 --> 01:12:36,262
(Adding makgeolli and soy milk?)

1796
01:12:36,263 --> 01:12:37,664
I can already smell it.

1797
01:12:38,534 --> 01:12:40,133
It's nutty.

1798
01:12:41,503 --> 01:12:42,503
Soy milk.

1799
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:46,173
- How is it?
- It's sugar-free, right?

1800
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:47,374
Yes. No sugar.

1801
01:12:48,503 --> 01:12:50,343
(After doenjang, makgeolli, and soy milk comes peanut butter?)

1802
01:12:52,013 --> 01:12:53,744
- You're adding peanut butter?
- Yes.

1803
01:12:54,914 --> 01:12:55,914
Peanut butter.

1804
01:12:55,915 --> 01:12:57,012
(A harmonious party of ingredients of various countries...)

1805
01:12:57,013 --> 01:12:58,042
(in a Korean traditional cast iron pot)

1806
01:12:58,043 --> 01:13:01,853
This is fascinating. I can't imagine the outcome.

1807
01:13:01,854 --> 01:13:03,454
(The cooking has exceeded Yo Han's imagination.)

1808
01:13:03,683 --> 01:13:05,752
You have the answer in your head, right?

1809
01:13:05,753 --> 01:13:07,923
(Try it later.)

1810
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:12,734
Today, I wanted to use soy milk.

1811
01:13:13,164 --> 01:13:16,633
It really just makes it seem more Korean.

1812
01:13:17,234 --> 01:13:20,704
And I used peanut butter for texture.

1813
01:13:21,704 --> 01:13:25,012
And it was weird. I felt bad putting peanut butter...

1814
01:13:25,013 --> 01:13:27,914
in this beautiful, old vintage dish.

1815
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:32,313
(The more you see, the more curious you become...)

1816
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:34,814
(of Edward Lee's mysterious recipe.)

1817
01:13:36,654 --> 01:13:39,954
(How will Edward's Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken taste?)

1818
01:13:40,253 --> 01:13:41,763
(Let's see.)

1819
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:44,194
We need more fire.

1820
01:13:44,864 --> 01:13:46,462
I'll keep it going.

1821
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:47,593
(The fire is getting weaker.)

1822
01:13:48,864 --> 01:13:49,903
I'll be right back.

1823
01:13:49,904 --> 01:13:52,173
(Eddie leaves it to Yo Han and heads back to the kitchen.)

1824
01:13:52,433 --> 01:13:53,503
How is Si A doing?

1825
01:13:55,843 --> 01:13:56,904
I'm sure she's doing fine.

1826
01:13:57,643 --> 01:13:58,774
She's good at everything.

1827
01:13:59,914 --> 01:14:01,413
(Meanwhile, Si A...)

1828
01:14:01,414 --> 01:14:03,814
I'm not a strange person.

1829
01:14:04,883 --> 01:14:05,883
Do you want some snacks?

1830
01:14:05,884 --> 01:14:07,154
(I don't take snacks from strangers.)

1831
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,124
You don't want to.

1832
01:14:09,753 --> 01:14:10,923
You're angry.

1833
01:14:11,553 --> 01:14:12,553
Sweet potato?

1834
01:14:13,654 --> 01:14:15,923
Do you want sweet potato?

1835
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:18,734
I don't have one.

1836
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:21,333
Gosh, I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

1837
01:14:22,404 --> 01:14:23,404
I'm sorry.

1838
01:14:24,064 --> 01:14:26,204
I'll come back later with sweet potatoes.

1839
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:31,814
(Come back with sweet potatoes.)

1840
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:33,172
- Kyun.
- Yes?

1841
01:14:33,173 --> 01:14:34,814
The fire is perfectly lit.

1842
01:14:35,383 --> 01:14:37,583
I'll head out when it's about to die out.

1843
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:39,814
- Okay.
- What shall I do next?

1844
01:14:40,484 --> 01:14:41,513
You know what?

1845
01:14:42,383 --> 01:14:43,524
We need to cook rice.

1846
01:14:44,324 --> 01:14:45,922
- Rice.
- Plain rice?

1847
01:14:45,923 --> 01:14:47,023
- Plain rice?
- Yes.

1848
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,863
Then is that okay?

1849
01:14:49,864 --> 01:14:51,194
It's not a pressure cooker.

1850
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:53,494
- Is this fine?
- It's fine.

1851
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:55,103
- But rice...
- There's no rice.

1852
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:56,163
(But there's no rice?)

1853
01:14:56,164 --> 01:14:57,164
Hold on.

1854
01:14:57,364 --> 01:14:59,533
- Ma'am.
- Hold on, I'll go.

1855
01:14:59,534 --> 01:15:00,534
Where's rice?

1856
01:15:01,473 --> 01:15:02,604
I almost forgot.

1857
01:15:04,404 --> 01:15:06,172
We can't have dinner if there's no rice.

1858
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:07,173
That's true.

1859
01:15:07,374 --> 01:15:09,643
Rice won't take long to cook. About 20 minutes?

1860
01:15:11,013 --> 01:15:13,284
I said I wouldn't come back. This is bad.

1861
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:15,453
I'll be serious this time.

1862
01:15:15,454 --> 01:15:16,454
(He reappears at their workspace when they're about to forget him.)

1863
01:15:20,194 --> 01:15:22,823
(Yo Han is back.)

1864
01:15:22,824 --> 01:15:23,824
Hello.

1865
01:15:23,825 --> 01:15:25,494
(He's back.)

1866
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:27,563
- Are you here for rice?
- Yes.

1867
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,203
We have really delicious rice.

1868
01:15:29,204 --> 01:15:30,833
- Can I have some?
- Okay.

1869
01:15:31,104 --> 01:15:32,104
Thank you.

1870
01:15:33,604 --> 01:15:34,604
- Here.
- Thank you.

1871
01:15:35,374 --> 01:15:37,843
Is this enough for ten people?

1872
01:15:38,104 --> 01:15:39,342
This cooker is too small for ten servings.

1873
01:15:39,343 --> 01:15:40,373
Really?

1874
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:42,083
- I'll cook 1 more time.
- You need 2 rounds.

1875
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:44,713
I'll go back first then come back.

1876
01:15:45,383 --> 01:15:47,914
(See you later.)

1877
01:15:48,053 --> 01:15:49,283
It's cold, so I'll close the door.

1878
01:15:49,284 --> 01:15:51,484
(15 minutes until the guests arrive)

1879
01:15:51,654 --> 01:15:54,093
(Meanwhile, Edward lee...)

1880
01:15:54,223 --> 01:15:56,864
(is checking Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken.)

1881
01:15:57,263 --> 01:16:00,064
(At this moment, he is Dae Jang Geum from Kentucky.)

1882
01:16:00,463 --> 01:16:02,904
(For the dish he is cooking for the first time,)

1883
01:16:03,234 --> 01:16:05,932
(he attends more seriously than ever.)

1884
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:08,173
This needs to be hotter.

1885
01:16:08,904 --> 01:16:10,643
(The stew isn't boiling at all.)

1886
01:16:11,244 --> 01:16:13,574
(Edward becomes impatient.)

1887
01:16:13,973 --> 01:16:16,784
(He kneels down in front of the cast iron pot.)

1888
01:16:20,883 --> 01:16:22,723
(But Korean furnace isn't easy to handle.)

1889
01:16:23,854 --> 01:16:25,694
(Where is Yo Han?)

1890
01:16:26,593 --> 01:16:27,752
(Yo Han is measuring the water for the rice peacefully,)

1891
01:16:27,753 --> 01:16:28,893
(unaware of the fire situation.)

1892
01:16:28,994 --> 01:16:30,423
We have a problem.

1893
01:16:31,164 --> 01:16:32,194
What problem?

1894
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:34,432
(A problem?)

1895
01:16:34,433 --> 01:16:37,704
- We need stronger fire.
- Higher temperature.

1896
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:39,833
And Edward,

1897
01:16:40,003 --> 01:16:41,802
this cooker isn't big enough for ten servings.

1898
01:16:41,803 --> 01:16:44,073
We can't cook for ten people using this.

1899
01:16:44,074 --> 01:16:46,773
I'll cook 5 to 6 servings first.

1900
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:48,314
You need to fill up the rest with your cooking.

1901
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:50,842
- With what?
- With anything.

1902
01:16:50,843 --> 01:16:51,954
Whatever is in your head.

1903
01:16:52,614 --> 01:16:54,753
I'll check on the fire again.

1904
01:16:55,183 --> 01:16:57,284
- The stew needs to boil.
- Okay.

1905
01:16:58,053 --> 01:16:59,092
I know, Edward.

1906
01:16:59,093 --> 01:17:00,593
(Choking up)

1907
01:17:00,893 --> 01:17:04,194
But it won't boil even when I try so hard that I tear up.

1908
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:06,093
It's not boiling.

1909
01:17:06,364 --> 01:17:08,163
Are we fighting?

1910
01:17:08,164 --> 01:17:09,433
(Let's not fight.)

1911
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:11,002
Gosh, the fire...

1912
01:17:11,003 --> 01:17:12,104
(The food's fate lies in Yo Han's hands.)

1913
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:16,204
(Can he make the fire stronger?)

1914
01:17:16,404 --> 01:17:18,203
Can you call Si A?

1915
01:17:18,204 --> 01:17:19,473
Yes, I can.

1916
01:17:20,343 --> 01:17:21,984
This is a big problem.

1917
01:17:23,284 --> 01:17:24,744
- Hello?
- Si A.

1918
01:17:24,843 --> 01:17:26,753
I have urgent news.

1919
01:17:26,854 --> 01:17:27,954
What news?

1920
01:17:28,053 --> 01:17:31,382
- We need to delay the dinner.
- Really?

1921
01:17:31,383 --> 01:17:34,293
We need to change it to 7:45pm.

1922
01:17:34,423 --> 01:17:35,994
Did something happen?

1923
01:17:36,194 --> 01:17:39,093
The fire isn't strong enough.

1924
01:17:39,263 --> 01:17:40,693
(He just laughs.)

1925
01:17:40,694 --> 01:17:42,364
So the stew isn't really boiling.

1926
01:17:42,664 --> 01:17:45,473
I get it. I'll relay the news quickly.

1927
01:17:46,003 --> 01:17:48,803
- Okay.
- I understand.

1928
01:17:51,374 --> 01:17:54,173
What should I do? We must go now.

1929
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:57,582
They could've left their homes. We must be quick.

1930
01:17:57,583 --> 01:17:58,883
(Elders, we're going to meet you again.)

1931
01:17:59,713 --> 01:18:01,382
(The dinner is postponed from 7:15pm to 7:45pm.)

1932
01:18:01,383 --> 01:18:03,124
(Country members have about 35 minutes left.)

1933
01:18:03,223 --> 01:18:04,552
(Stew is not boiling, they need additional dishes,)

1934
01:18:04,553 --> 01:18:05,753
(hotteok is not ready, and the dinner is postponed.)

1935
01:18:05,854 --> 01:18:08,093
(It's a whole lot of mess.)

1936
01:18:08,382 --> 01:18:10,050
(The dinner is postponed from 7:15pm to 7:45pm.)

1937
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:11,851
(Country members have about 35 minutes left.)

1938
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:13,491
(Stew is not boiling, they need additional dishes,)

1939
01:18:13,492 --> 01:18:14,691
(hotteok is not ready, and the dinner is postponed.)

1940
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:17,162
(It's a whole lot of mess.)

1941
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:19,431
(Country Family is facing a crisis.)

1942
01:18:19,702 --> 01:18:22,731
Sometimes you do on food competition shows on TV,

1943
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:24,571
and this was stressful...

1944
01:18:24,572 --> 01:18:26,901
in a different way because these were real people.

1945
01:18:27,572 --> 01:18:30,141
But in the end, it always works.

1946
01:18:32,111 --> 01:18:33,211
Okay.

1947
01:18:33,212 --> 01:18:34,912
(Let's first cook a dish to replace rice.)

1948
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:37,051
- Do you know where the grater is?
- Yes.

1949
01:18:37,452 --> 01:18:39,481
- Perfect.
- Yes?

1950
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,382
Thank you.

1951
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,622
(Let's do this!)

1952
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:47,721
(Grating)

1953
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:50,761
(What is he cooking?)

1954
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:52,231
(They do their tasks in silence.)

1955
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:53,632
(Preparing hotteok and grating potatoes)

1956
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:55,372
(We have no time.)

1957
01:18:55,572 --> 01:18:58,572
(Clenching his teeth)

1958
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,041
(Here comes Eddie's special potato dish recipe...)

1959
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:05,712
(to replace rice.)

1960
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,781
Chili powder?

1961
01:19:07,782 --> 01:19:08,811
(Chili powder?)

1962
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:11,180
(He adds chili powder onto grated potatoes without hesitation.)

1963
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:12,221
Salt.

1964
01:19:12,822 --> 01:19:15,322
- Four eggs.
- Four eggs.

1965
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:17,021
Should we put green onions?

1966
01:19:17,122 --> 01:19:18,661
Yes, we have green onions.

1967
01:19:18,662 --> 01:19:19,662
A little bit.

1968
01:19:19,663 --> 01:19:21,721
(Eddie's potato dish is starting to reveal itself.)

1969
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,961
(Heaps of potatoes and green onions)

1970
01:19:24,962 --> 01:19:26,560
It's potato and green onion pancake.

1971
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:27,801
Potato and green onion pancake.

1972
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:29,502
(It's original!)

1973
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:32,001
Did you find flour?

1974
01:19:32,002 --> 01:19:33,002
No.

1975
01:19:33,003 --> 01:19:35,611
(There's no flour to make a batter.)

1976
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:40,712
(One crisis after another)

1977
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:43,180
All we have is bean powder.

1978
01:19:43,181 --> 01:19:44,452
Bean powder sounds good.

1979
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:47,721
(Bean powder instead of flour. Will it work?)

1980
01:19:48,282 --> 01:19:51,721
(Nervous)

1981
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:53,322
It's delicious.

1982
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:55,021
Is it?

1983
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,561
Let's try adding some of it.

1984
01:19:57,731 --> 01:19:59,002
Sounds good.

1985
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:02,271
(Thanks to A Sung's calm thinking, they make the batter.)

1986
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:05,841
Big or small?

1987
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:07,542
(Catering to the guests' needs)

1988
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,211
- Make it big.
- Big? Okay.

1989
01:20:09,212 --> 01:20:11,141
- Old ladies like big ones.
- They like big ones.

1990
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:13,082
(Okay, I got it!)

1991
01:20:13,511 --> 01:20:15,242
(He starts by pouring savory perilla oil.)

1992
01:20:18,851 --> 01:20:23,191
(With the delicious sizzling sound)

1993
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:24,992
Okay, are you ready?

1994
01:20:25,051 --> 01:20:26,922
- Yes.
- One, two, three.

1995
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:31,092
(Edward absolutely nailed it.)

1996
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:32,400
Bravo.

1997
01:20:32,401 --> 01:20:34,531
(Potato and green onion pancake made with bean powder...)

1998
01:20:34,532 --> 01:20:36,301
(is cooking well.)

1999
01:20:37,872 --> 01:20:40,342
(Is there anything to go with the pancake?)

2000
01:20:41,372 --> 01:20:42,510
What is this?

2001
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:43,941
(He spots something.)

2002
01:20:44,212 --> 01:20:45,941
- Is this namul?
- Namul.

2003
01:20:47,382 --> 01:20:48,881
It's namul made with doenjang.

2004
01:20:48,882 --> 01:20:49,912
(Ms. Kwon Young Won's seasoned Aralia sprouts)

2005
01:20:50,752 --> 01:20:52,050
Why don't we put some namul...

2006
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:53,350
- on top of the pancake later?
- That sounds good.

2007
01:20:53,351 --> 01:20:54,521
Nice.

2008
01:20:56,221 --> 01:20:58,050
(Potato and green onion pancake made with bean powder...)

2009
01:20:58,051 --> 01:20:59,861
(with seasoned Aralia sprouts)

2010
01:21:00,162 --> 01:21:02,230
Potato pancake and hotteok for dinner.

2011
01:21:02,231 --> 01:21:03,292
Okay.

2012
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:08,001
Chicken soup is for tomorrow's breakfast.

2013
01:21:08,002 --> 01:21:09,202
- Okay.
- Tomorrow breakfast.

2014
01:21:09,872 --> 01:21:12,542
- We can deliver it to them.
- Yes.

2015
01:21:14,301 --> 01:21:15,371
This box.

2016
01:21:15,372 --> 01:21:16,872
(This man will decide its fate.)

2017
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:21,281
(He clenches his teeth and tears the boxes.)

2018
01:21:21,282 --> 01:21:22,811
(He continues to tear them.)

2019
01:21:24,452 --> 01:21:25,782
(Byun Yo Han tears the boxes!)

2020
01:21:27,622 --> 01:21:31,622
(I must reignite the flame!)

2021
01:21:31,952 --> 01:21:33,861
(Running out of fuel)

2022
01:21:34,462 --> 01:21:36,991
If there's no more things to burn, can you lend me an ax?

2023
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:38,191
I'll cut my own firewood.

2024
01:21:38,292 --> 01:21:39,701
Thank you.

2025
01:21:39,702 --> 01:21:41,132
(Thankfully, he gets free firewood.)

2026
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:44,002
It stings.

2027
01:21:44,271 --> 01:21:45,641
(Fuel refilled)

2028
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,301
Oh, dear.

2029
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:52,511
(Is it boiling?)

2030
01:21:52,611 --> 01:21:54,610
The water isn't boiling. What should I do?

2031
01:21:54,611 --> 01:21:57,412
This is really tough.

2032
01:21:58,082 --> 01:22:00,081
When we were cooking dinner, I thought...

2033
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,020
we were in for big trouble.

2034
01:22:02,021 --> 01:22:04,121
The fire wasn't strong enough...

2035
01:22:04,122 --> 01:22:05,422
to boil the water.

2036
01:22:05,662 --> 01:22:06,821
The fire...

2037
01:22:06,822 --> 01:22:07,860
(He brings the sad news that the stew still isn't boiling.)

2038
01:22:07,861 --> 01:22:10,332
I added a lot of firewood, but it's still not boiling.

2039
01:22:10,662 --> 01:22:11,761
No.

2040
01:22:11,832 --> 01:22:13,202
It isn't easy.

2041
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,572
- This is bad.
- People are coming.

2042
01:22:15,832 --> 01:22:19,002
Is it boiling a bit? Or not at all?

2043
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:20,901
A bit?

2044
01:22:21,342 --> 01:22:22,342
Not at all.

2045
01:22:22,343 --> 01:22:24,111
(It isn't boiling at all.)

2046
01:22:24,212 --> 01:22:25,270
We're doomed.

2047
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:26,610
The ladies are on their way.

2048
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:28,641
Should we order delivery?

2049
01:22:28,742 --> 01:22:30,452
I'll keep an eye on it.

2050
01:22:30,882 --> 01:22:32,752
Should I bring an induction cooker?

2051
01:22:32,952 --> 01:22:34,252
(Laughing)

2052
01:22:35,721 --> 01:22:38,322
(His lonely fight starts again.)

2053
01:22:38,492 --> 01:22:40,592
(Please...)

2054
01:22:44,931 --> 01:22:47,331
I have no experience in lighting a furnace.

2055
01:22:47,332 --> 01:22:49,600
At one point, I became so desperate...

2056
01:22:49,601 --> 01:22:51,300
that I started putting my ear next to the cast iron pot.

2057
01:22:51,301 --> 01:22:52,301
(Cast iron pot next to my ear)

2058
01:22:52,302 --> 01:22:54,471
Because I wanted to hear the sound of it boiling.

2059
01:22:55,101 --> 01:22:58,842
(A torch to hear the sound of boiling)

2060
01:22:59,882 --> 01:23:01,941
(Please start boiling now.)

2061
01:23:02,181 --> 01:23:03,181
Please.

2062
01:23:03,282 --> 01:23:05,411
(Will it grant Yo Han's wish...)

2063
01:23:05,412 --> 01:23:07,952
(and make the boiling sound?)

2064
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:10,821
It's boiling!

2065
01:23:10,822 --> 01:23:13,122
(He can hear it!)

2066
01:23:13,492 --> 01:23:14,520
It's boiling.

2067
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:17,332
(He was dying to hear this sound!)

2068
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:20,730
(He goes to show off his accomplishment.)

2069
01:23:20,731 --> 01:23:22,701
Kyun, it's boiling.

2070
01:23:22,702 --> 01:23:24,072
- Thank you.
- Yes.

2071
01:23:24,202 --> 01:23:25,770
Kyun, it's boiling.

2072
01:23:25,771 --> 01:23:27,542
(The kitchen crew cheers too.)

2073
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:30,242
(I had faith in you, my brother!)

2074
01:23:30,441 --> 01:23:32,882
(Feeling proud)

2075
01:23:33,511 --> 01:23:36,111
A miracle always happens in the smallest places.

2076
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,082
(Thinking about it again makes him tear up.)

2077
01:23:38,782 --> 01:23:40,720
(Yo Han says a miracle happens at a small furnace.)

2078
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:43,151
- Chef, I'm back.
- Hello.

2079
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,451
- I'll help a lot now.
- Okay.

2080
01:23:45,452 --> 01:23:47,721
And they said they weren't that hungry.

2081
01:23:47,891 --> 01:23:49,831
- Okay.
- So they said it's okay.

2082
01:23:49,832 --> 01:23:51,031
So don't worry.

2083
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:52,430
- But I have bad news.
- What?

2084
01:23:52,431 --> 01:23:54,632
I threw away the hotteok filling.

2085
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,071
Why?

2086
01:23:57,072 --> 01:23:59,172
(This is his first time hearing this.)

2087
01:23:59,202 --> 01:24:00,641
- But why?
- What happened?

2088
01:24:01,072 --> 01:24:02,242
Seriously, why?

2089
01:24:02,342 --> 01:24:04,342
She didn't even tell me until now.

2090
01:24:04,771 --> 01:24:06,511
Things were way too hectic.

2091
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:07,742
(Actually, our ace A Sung...)

2092
01:24:07,882 --> 01:24:10,412
(Do you know where chicken stock is?)

2093
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:11,782
Chicken stock?

2094
01:24:13,221 --> 01:24:14,322
(Helping)

2095
01:24:14,952 --> 01:24:16,292
Can I have a knife?

2096
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:17,891
(Helping)

2097
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:20,922
(She flawlessly assisted Eddie...)

2098
01:24:20,962 --> 01:24:21,962
(Helping)

2099
01:24:21,963 --> 01:24:25,162
(with his never-ending requests for help.)

2100
01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:28,162
(Do this for me.)

2101
01:24:28,332 --> 01:24:30,431
(Even Yo Han's rice cooker he left for the fire)

2102
01:24:31,372 --> 01:24:32,372
(Cooking rice)

2103
01:24:32,372 --> 01:24:33,372
(She quietly took care of it.)

2104
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,002
(Cleaning up)

2105
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:36,171
(She even cleaned up as she went.)

2106
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:37,212
(Washing the dishes)

2107
01:24:37,842 --> 01:24:39,242
(Glancing)

2108
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:42,582
(Please help me mix the hotteok filling.)

2109
01:24:44,752 --> 01:24:46,882
(Where was it?)

2110
01:24:47,252 --> 01:24:49,922
(Her brain went into overdrive.)

2111
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:53,261
(A Sung poured water on sugar instead of the batter powder.)

2112
01:24:54,992 --> 01:24:56,832
(Something feels off.)

2113
01:24:57,391 --> 01:24:59,501
(She uses a sieve to try and salvage it.)

2114
01:24:59,502 --> 01:25:00,502
(She fails.)

2115
01:25:00,702 --> 01:25:01,760
No.

2116
01:25:01,761 --> 01:25:03,572
(The hotteok filling left them forever.)

2117
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:05,901
It's okay A Sung. It's for the better.

2118
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:08,801
I'll do the sugar for hotteok.

2119
01:25:09,172 --> 01:25:12,680
A Sung, why does it feel like a lot of things happened while I was gone?

2120
01:25:12,681 --> 01:25:14,412
It's as always.

2121
01:25:15,242 --> 01:25:16,311
You know what?

2122
01:25:17,252 --> 01:25:18,381
Let's do this.

2123
01:25:18,382 --> 01:25:20,221
I can't see anything. Hold on.

2124
01:25:27,162 --> 01:25:28,361
Sorry.

2125
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:30,861
- Will all of this fit?
- Yes.

2126
01:25:31,162 --> 01:25:34,032
(They finally add the chicken in the boiling stew.)

2127
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:36,771
There.

2128
01:25:36,872 --> 01:25:39,042
We're going to add the last ingredients.

2129
01:25:39,202 --> 01:25:41,371
You're adding pine nuts now.

2130
01:25:41,372 --> 01:25:44,412
(Pine nuts will enhance the subtle and nutty flavor!)

2131
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:46,440
It's not a Korean dish,

2132
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:48,711
but I added things that I know they would like...

2133
01:25:48,712 --> 01:25:50,181
like pine nuts.

2134
01:25:50,551 --> 01:25:52,720
I wanted to put some Korean flavor...

2135
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:54,582
so that they'd feel familiar.

2136
01:25:54,681 --> 01:25:58,221
And hopefully they feel like it's comforting food for them.

2137
01:26:00,361 --> 01:26:02,661
(Stew that captures Chef Eddie's philosophy,)

2138
01:26:02,662 --> 01:26:05,261
(which is to cater to the customers' tastes.)

2139
01:26:06,532 --> 01:26:08,761
I'm worried the chicken is not going to be done.

2140
01:26:09,172 --> 01:26:10,731
- That's my only worry.
- Right.

2141
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:13,372
I can't see.

2142
01:26:13,742 --> 01:26:14,742
Goodness.

2143
01:26:14,743 --> 01:26:16,741
It's really cold today.

2144
01:26:16,742 --> 01:26:17,911
(Two ladies approach from afar.)

2145
01:26:17,912 --> 01:26:19,582
I think today is the coldest.

2146
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:22,452
- Isn't it this house?
- Let it boil more?

2147
01:26:22,882 --> 01:26:24,050
- Two minutes. Three minutes.
- Two minutes.

2148
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:25,181
Shall we wait?

2149
01:26:25,212 --> 01:26:27,181
- Hello.
- Hello.

2150
01:26:27,322 --> 01:26:29,050
- You can come in.
- Okay.

2151
01:26:29,051 --> 01:26:30,051
What is this?

2152
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:31,952
- I made some dumplings.
- Let me carry it.

2153
01:26:32,292 --> 01:26:33,592
(Surprised)

2154
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:34,962
And...

2155
01:26:35,191 --> 01:26:36,260
Are they here?

2156
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:38,031
I think I heard them greet someone.

2157
01:26:38,032 --> 01:26:39,201
I just brought this.

2158
01:26:39,202 --> 01:26:40,331
(She's right. Here come the guests.)

2159
01:26:40,332 --> 01:26:42,401
- It's cold.
- The guests are here.

2160
01:26:42,502 --> 01:26:44,572
My gosh.

2161
01:26:45,072 --> 01:26:47,001
- Hello.
- Hello.

2162
01:26:47,002 --> 01:26:48,301
(They get into their host mode at the sight of the ladies.)

2163
01:26:48,502 --> 01:26:50,371
What's this? Dumplings?

2164
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:51,640
Yes, I made some.

2165
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:52,881
- This is...
- Did you make them yourself?

2166
01:26:52,882 --> 01:26:54,081
I made them myself.

2167
01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:56,050
- Thank you.
- Hello.

2168
01:26:56,051 --> 01:26:59,150
We had a slight accident.

2169
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:00,921
The fire wasn't strong enough.

2170
01:27:00,922 --> 01:27:02,121
- The furnace.
- So...

2171
01:27:02,122 --> 01:27:03,751
it might take a while.

2172
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:07,091
Have a seat first. Would you like tea?

2173
01:27:07,092 --> 01:27:09,462
- Okay, I'll have some.
- Sit here, ma'am.

2174
01:27:09,731 --> 01:27:12,032
(Rushing)

2175
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:14,261
(Good job, Si A.)

2176
01:27:15,662 --> 01:27:17,471
Is your husband not joining us?

2177
01:27:17,672 --> 01:27:18,701
- My husband?
- Yes.

2178
01:27:18,702 --> 01:27:20,301
I didn't ask him to join.

2179
01:27:20,372 --> 01:27:21,800
Is that so? Okay.

2180
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:24,072
- Please wait for a while.
- Okay.

2181
01:27:24,842 --> 01:27:26,010
(You're the best, Si A.)

2182
01:27:26,011 --> 01:27:27,510
(We must hurry!)

2183
01:27:27,511 --> 01:27:28,941
Where is Chef Edward?

2184
01:27:29,382 --> 01:27:30,912
I think he's still outside.

2185
01:27:32,111 --> 01:27:34,651
(The chicken isn't cooked yet.)

2186
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:38,092
(He impatiently stirs it with a ladle.)

2187
01:27:38,351 --> 01:27:40,662
(Please cook.)

2188
01:27:41,162 --> 01:27:43,832
(These two are just waiting for the chicken to cook.)

2189
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:46,361
Okay.

2190
01:27:46,362 --> 01:27:48,361
(Now is the time! Let's take out the chicken.)

2191
01:27:48,832 --> 01:27:50,971
(Is the chicken cooked?)

2192
01:27:56,372 --> 01:27:58,471
(Is it cooked?)

2193
01:27:59,481 --> 01:28:01,211
- It's good.
- Is it okay?

2194
01:28:01,212 --> 01:28:02,412
It's cooked.

2195
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,150
It's great.

2196
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:05,851
(It's finally cooked!)

2197
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:07,322
We did it.

2198
01:28:08,452 --> 01:28:10,020
We have saved the night.

2199
01:28:10,021 --> 01:28:11,520
- We did.
- Let's go.

2200
01:28:11,521 --> 01:28:12,821
(They just need to plate it now.)

2201
01:28:12,822 --> 01:28:14,292
The elders will love it.

2202
01:28:15,191 --> 01:28:17,690
(Moving quickly for the elders who are waiting)

2203
01:28:17,691 --> 01:28:20,502
Mushrooms and chickens.

2204
01:28:20,632 --> 01:28:21,832
It's hot.

2205
01:28:22,702 --> 01:28:24,002
It smells delicious.

2206
01:28:24,872 --> 01:28:26,342
- I'll take this in first.
- Okay.

2207
01:28:26,672 --> 01:28:27,701
(Unimaginable taste, Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken)

2208
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:28,702
Okay.

2209
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:33,882
It's perfect. It's cooked.

2210
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:35,081
Really?

2211
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:37,151
- Yes, just in time.
- It's done.

2212
01:28:37,851 --> 01:28:38,851
(His soul has left his body.)

2213
01:28:38,852 --> 01:28:41,021
Kyun, they brought us dumplings.

2214
01:28:41,151 --> 01:28:42,220
What do I do with these?

2215
01:28:42,221 --> 01:28:45,220
You can either deep-fry or boil them.

2216
01:28:45,221 --> 01:28:47,591
But boiling it will be too much work.

2217
01:28:47,592 --> 01:28:49,930
- We can't. I'll fry it.
- We can't use it.

2218
01:28:49,931 --> 01:28:52,191
- Then fry it in the pan.
- Okay.

2219
01:28:52,462 --> 01:28:54,401
Cook it your way.

2220
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:56,531
- Okay.
- I thought it was over.

2221
01:28:56,532 --> 01:28:59,641
Actually, you do need to boil it in water.

2222
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:01,842
It's fine. I got it.

2223
01:29:02,941 --> 01:29:04,211
- We must hurry.
- Okay.

2224
01:29:04,212 --> 01:29:05,842
- I need this.
- You can cook it Chinese style.

2225
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:08,882
- What is it?
- The lid.

2226
01:29:09,582 --> 01:29:11,311
Something to press with?

2227
01:29:11,782 --> 01:29:13,081
You have to tell us. Think.

2228
01:29:13,082 --> 01:29:14,281
- I don't remember the word.
- Quickly.

2229
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:15,751
Think. You got this.

2230
01:29:15,752 --> 01:29:17,951
I can't even figure out what it is in Korean.

2231
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:19,190
(The only thing they can do right now is laugh.)

2232
01:29:19,191 --> 01:29:20,860
- Tell us what it's for.
- I need to cover this to...

2233
01:29:20,861 --> 01:29:21,991
(I need to cover this.)

2234
01:29:21,992 --> 01:29:23,591
- The lid.
- The lid.

2235
01:29:23,592 --> 01:29:24,961
(The answer is "lid.")

2236
01:29:24,962 --> 01:29:26,502
I'm about to flip my lid.

2237
01:29:28,002 --> 01:29:30,071
(I'm about to flip my lid.)

2238
01:29:30,072 --> 01:29:31,171
- Our guests are here.
- Hello.

2239
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:33,241
- Hello.
- Hello.

2240
01:29:33,242 --> 01:29:34,541
- Welcome.
- Hello.

2241
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:36,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

2242
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:38,471
- You're here.
- Gosh, yes.

2243
01:29:38,842 --> 01:29:40,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

2244
01:29:40,941 --> 01:29:42,510
It's so cold outside, isn't it?

2245
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:44,550
- Yes.
- The food is almost done,

2246
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:46,382
so wait just a moment, please.

2247
01:29:47,021 --> 01:29:48,350
I've never been here before.

2248
01:29:48,351 --> 01:29:49,492
(Full of excitement)

2249
01:29:50,322 --> 01:29:52,151
(I should get myself together and do this.)

2250
01:29:52,422 --> 01:29:57,061
(He places the dumplings on the pan with cooking oil.)

2251
01:29:58,132 --> 01:30:00,032
(He then pours perilla oil over it.)

2252
01:30:00,231 --> 01:30:01,662
(Shaking)

2253
01:30:02,002 --> 01:30:03,770
(When the dumplings start to turn golden on the bottom,)

2254
01:30:03,771 --> 01:30:06,242

2256
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:08,841
Okay. Ready?

(Edward Lee's tip on how to pan-fry dumplings without boiling them)

2258
01:30:09,843 --> 01:30:10,872
Yes.

2259
01:30:12,981 --> 01:30:15,511
(Trap the moisture!)

2260
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:19,521
(Amazed)

2261
01:30:20,382 --> 01:30:21,650
This is how you cook dumplings quickly.

2262
01:30:21,651 --> 01:30:23,992
- Then you don't have to steam them.
- Yes.

2263
01:30:24,822 --> 01:30:26,491
(Handmade pan-fried dumplings...)

2264
01:30:26,492 --> 01:30:28,122
(that are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside)

2268
01:30:36,771 --> 01:30:39,441
(they finished making a mouth-watering dinner.)

2269

I'm Chef Edward Lee from the US.

2270
01:30:47,242 --> 01:30:48,582
Thank you so much for coming.

2271
01:30:49,212 --> 01:30:50,752
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

2272
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:54,221
I apologize that my Korean isn't perfect,

2273
01:30:54,521 --> 01:30:56,252
but I would like to explain the dishes to you.

2274
01:30:56,521 --> 01:30:58,850
This is potato pancake.

2275
01:30:58,851 --> 01:31:00,261
(Potato and green onion pancakes made with bean powder)

2276
01:31:00,462 --> 01:31:02,360
Please eat it with the seasoned Aralia sprouts.

2277
01:31:02,361 --> 01:31:04,360
(A dish that combines the flavors of plain potato and Aralia sprouts)

2278
01:31:04,361 --> 01:31:05,792
Potato pancake and Aralia sprouts.

2279
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:08,501
I think we're supposed to share this.

2280
01:31:08,502 --> 01:31:10,332
He told us to eat it with the seasoned Aralia sprouts.

2281
01:31:10,601 --> 01:31:12,202
Did he slice the potatoes?

2282
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:14,400
- The potatoes.
- Yes, he sliced them.

2283
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:15,501
(The texture of sliced potatoes is alive...)

2284

(in the potato and green onion pancakes.)

Earlier, you gave us potatoes.

2286

Chef Lee has always loved Korean food,

2287
01:31:22,542 --> 01:31:24,412
and I think he was pleasantly surprised by the potatoes.

2288
01:31:24,851 --> 01:31:27,121
He wanted to make something for you with them.

2289
01:31:27,122 --> 01:31:28,680
(Impressed by the Gangwon Province potatoes,)

2290
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:31,551
(he used them to make his own unique dish.)

(Will local elderly love the flavor of it?)

2292
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:39,332
- Try this.
- I'm about to.

2293
01:31:39,832 --> 01:31:41,300
Let's eat.

2294
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:43,632

01:31:50,242 --> 01:31:52,980
(Savoring the food)

2297
01:31:52,981 --> 01:31:54,110
It was good.

2298
01:31:54,111 --> 01:31:55,742
(Nervous)

2299
01:31:55,941 --> 01:31:56,952
This is nice.

2300
01:31:58,782 --> 01:32:01,122
(Foodie Si A takes a bite as well.)

2301
01:32:02,721 --> 01:32:05,492
There's always a time where it's a little nervous.

2302
01:32:06,322 --> 01:32:08,221
I want just everyone to be happy.

2303
01:32:09,061 --> 01:32:10,061
Gosh.

2304
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:15,461
These potato pancakes taste unique.

2305
01:32:15,462 --> 01:32:16,471
Yes.

2306
01:32:18,632 --> 01:32:21,041
(What will the elderly's honest reaction be like?)

2307
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:22,241
I think they used pine nuts.

2308
01:32:22,242 --> 01:32:24,270
We make potato pancakes with sliced potatoes too.

2309
01:32:24,271 --> 01:32:25,671
Right.

2310
01:32:25,672 --> 01:32:27,212
But we usually don't use flour.

2311
01:32:27,441 --> 01:32:29,810
We didn't use any flour.

2312
01:32:29,811 --> 01:32:31,051
What did you use then?

2313
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:33,121
We used bean powder.

2314
01:32:33,122 --> 01:32:34,752
(The answer is "bean powder.")

2315
01:32:35,452 --> 01:32:36,952
- The bean powder over there?
- Yes.

2316
01:32:37,592 --> 01:32:39,561
The chef smelled it...

2317
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:41,860
and said we could use it instead of flour.

2318
01:32:41,861 --> 01:32:44,161
- That's why we used bean powder.
- No wonder it's not chewy.

2319
01:32:44,162 --> 01:32:45,890
The nutty flavor was strong,

2320
01:32:45,891 --> 01:32:47,760
so I wanted to ask.

2321
01:32:47,761 --> 01:32:48,961
The flavor is very nutty.

2322
01:32:48,962 --> 01:32:50,072
Gosh, he's good.

2323
01:32:52,771 --> 01:32:54,242
The texture is nice.

2324
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:57,671
I'm used to using blended potatoes, but the texture is nice here.

2325
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:59,011
It's so good.

2326
01:32:59,242 --> 01:33:00,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2327
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:01,581
(He feels great.)

2328
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:02,680
It's so good.

2329
01:33:02,681 --> 01:33:03,751
(His assistant is proud too.)

2330
01:33:03,752 --> 01:33:05,711
This would be great for breakfast.

2331
01:33:05,712 --> 01:33:07,782
It's simple to eat in the morning.

2332
01:33:08,021 --> 01:33:09,281
Try the dumplings.

2333
01:33:09,282 --> 01:33:11,822
(Si A loves the pancake too!)

2334
01:33:12,351 --> 01:33:13,922
(He keeps reaching for it.)

2335
01:33:14,992 --> 01:33:17,161
(I should try making this myself.)

2336
01:33:17,162 --> 01:33:19,931
And here we have...

2337
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:23,131
Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken.

2338
01:33:23,132 --> 01:33:24,572
(Chicken, doenjang, soy milk, and peanut butter)

2339
01:33:25,172 --> 01:33:28,641
(They used doenjang, but the broth is milky-white and creamy.)

2340
01:33:28,842 --> 01:33:31,872
(An unpredictable combination of Korean and Western cuisine)

2341
01:33:32,342 --> 01:33:34,882
- So it's not doenjang stew.
- They used chicken.

2342
01:33:35,382 --> 01:33:37,551
They said they used doenjang and soy milk.

2343
01:33:37,952 --> 01:33:40,582
(They used my doenjang?)

2344
01:33:41,681 --> 01:33:45,021
(Again, Chef Lee is feeling extremely nervous.)

2345
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:47,860
(I've never seen the chef like this before.)

2346
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:50,592
We hope you enjoy it.

2347
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:53,132
Yes, thank you for the food.

2348
01:33:54,431 --> 01:33:55,601
Goodness.

2349
01:33:58,901 --> 01:34:00,542
(Taking a sip)

2350
01:34:02,572 --> 01:34:04,872
(Anxious and restless)

2351
01:34:05,372 --> 01:34:07,282
This is really unique. I've never had anything like this.

2352
01:34:08,481 --> 01:34:10,550
(Pacing around)

2353
01:34:10,551 --> 01:34:11,851
(Eddie is restless at her words.)

2354
01:34:12,481 --> 01:34:14,650
(He was eating,)

2355
01:34:14,651 --> 01:34:16,251
(but then he stops and glances over.)

2356
01:34:16,252 --> 01:34:18,252
Why isn't he eating with us?

2357
01:34:18,391 --> 01:34:19,991
I don't know. Here they come.

2358
01:34:19,992 --> 01:34:21,962
(Why are you standing over there?)

2359
01:34:22,292 --> 01:34:24,231
(Eddie is too nervous to sit down.)

2360
01:34:27,002 --> 01:34:29,702
(But the elderly are eating without a word.)

2361
01:34:30,271 --> 01:34:33,241
(Do you not like Soy Milk Likes Doenjang Chicken?)

2362
01:34:33,242 --> 01:34:36,172
Goodness. I don't know what you used, but it's very nutty.

2363
01:34:36,872 --> 01:34:38,572
(Very nutty?)

2364
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:41,111
It's amazing.

2365
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:43,782
Thumbs up.

2366
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:46,111
Is it good? Gosh.

2367
01:34:46,452 --> 01:34:47,452
(She's relieved.)

2368
01:34:47,453 --> 01:34:49,752
What did you use? It's very nutty and tasty.

2369
01:34:50,021 --> 01:34:51,690
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

2370
01:34:51,691 --> 01:34:52,721
It's really good.

2371
01:34:52,992 --> 01:34:55,221
I've never had anything like this. It's good.

2372
01:34:55,361 --> 01:34:58,161
It's not really doenjang stew, and the flavor is very nutty.

2373
01:34:58,162 --> 01:34:59,931
- It's so good.
- Thank you.

2374
01:35:00,931 --> 01:35:03,100
I didn't know chicken goes well with doenjang.

2375
01:35:03,101 --> 01:35:04,431
Right.

2376
01:35:04,702 --> 01:35:06,640
We would have never imagined.

2377
01:35:06,641 --> 01:35:08,471
- This is my first time trying it.
- When else would we eat this?

2378
01:35:08,742 --> 01:35:10,741
- Where else would we eat this?
- There's nothing like it.

2379
01:35:10,742 --> 01:35:12,271
This is my first time trying something like this. It's so good.

2380
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:14,511
You must have worked hard to make us good food. Thank you.

2381
01:35:14,811 --> 01:35:17,551
- Right.
- Thank you.

2382
01:35:18,082 --> 01:35:20,452
- This was my first time making it.
- It's so good.

2383
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:23,122
- This was his first time making it?
- Yes.

2384
01:35:23,252 --> 01:35:24,491
They used pine nuts too.

2385
01:35:24,492 --> 01:35:26,761
I thought it was cheonggukjang, but they're all pine nuts.

2386
01:35:26,861 --> 01:35:28,060
These are pine nuts.

2387
01:35:28,061 --> 01:35:30,292
Yes, Kyun put in pine nuts.

2388
01:35:30,492 --> 01:35:31,730
He put a lot of thought into this...

2389
01:35:31,731 --> 01:35:33,901
and used mostly Korean ingredients.

2390
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:36,971
He chose each ingredient carefully.

2391
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:42,672
So the doenjang stew was very nutty,

2392
01:35:42,901 --> 01:35:45,141
and the chicken gave the broth a plain flavor.

2393
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:49,282
So it was a combination of extremely nutty and plain flavors.

2394
01:35:50,681 --> 01:35:55,651
I wanted to use your doenjang.

2395
01:35:55,752 --> 01:35:59,350
It was an honor to be able to use it.

2396
01:35:59,351 --> 01:36:00,422
Gosh, thank you.

2397
01:36:00,792 --> 01:36:01,821
(It's an honor for me too.)

2398
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:03,261
It's so nutty and nice.

2399
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:05,430
Thank you.

2400
01:36:05,431 --> 01:36:08,461
(Today's main dish impressed everyone.)

2401
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:12,132
They're all famous actors and celebrities.

2402
01:36:12,271 --> 01:36:13,441
Yes, I know.

2403
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:16,871
I recognized that they were actors and celebrities right away.

2404
01:36:16,872 --> 01:36:18,311
(He won Best Male Lead at the 2024 Seoul Global Movie Awards.)

2405
01:36:18,641 --> 01:36:19,741
(A rising star who won her part in "The Witch: Part 2, The Other One")

2406
01:36:19,742 --> 01:36:20,941
- It's so good.
- Are you not going to eat this?

2407
01:36:21,582 --> 01:36:23,411
I recognized you right away.

2408
01:36:23,412 --> 01:36:24,412
Thank you so much.

2409
01:36:24,413 --> 01:36:25,480
I recognized right away that you put...

2410
01:36:25,481 --> 01:36:28,020
a lot of effort into your hair today.

2411
01:36:28,021 --> 01:36:29,051
(The atmosphere is warm and friendly.)

2412
01:36:32,122 --> 01:36:33,221
It's so good.

2413
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:37,331
You have Korean features.

2414
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:38,360
Yes.

2415
01:36:38,361 --> 01:36:39,730
I'm originally Korean.

2416
01:36:39,731 --> 01:36:40,731
- You're Korean?
- He's Korean.

2417
01:36:40,732 --> 01:36:42,060
You should have just said you were Korean, then.

2418
01:36:42,061 --> 01:36:43,100
- He's Korean.
- He's visiting Korea.

2419
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:44,331
His mom and dad are Korean.

2420
01:36:44,332 --> 01:36:46,901
You're Korean. You're not a foreigner.

2421
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:49,100
(I see.)

2422
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:52,911
- I was born in the US, - Yes.

2423
01:36:52,912 --> 01:36:54,842
but I'm Korean.

2424
01:36:55,181 --> 01:36:58,412
So I want to learn more during my time in Korea.

2425
01:36:58,782 --> 01:37:02,782
What I thought was that if I learn about Korean food,

2426
01:37:03,391 --> 01:37:05,752
I can get to know the Korean people better.

2427
01:37:06,151 --> 01:37:08,891
So that's my mission.

2428
01:37:10,332 --> 01:37:11,332
(He's touched.)

2429
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:15,101
We're so honored that we got to eat food made by such a famous chef.

2430
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:17,031
Gosh, it's nothing.

2431
01:37:17,032 --> 01:37:18,201
- It's such an honor.
- Thank you.

2432
01:37:18,202 --> 01:37:21,140
We're even more thankful that you enjoyed the food.

2433
01:37:21,141 --> 01:37:23,041
- It was so good.
- We really enjoyed the food.

2434
01:37:23,042 --> 01:37:24,711
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

2435
01:37:24,712 --> 01:37:26,810
Thank you so much for the food.

2436
01:37:26,811 --> 01:37:28,110
(The dinner was a precious experience for everyone.)

2437
01:37:28,111 --> 01:37:31,681
Today... It was a special thing for me.

2438
01:37:32,382 --> 01:37:35,981
They feel happy, and they feel love.

2439
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:39,452
Not just the food, but we shared a memory,

2440
01:37:39,761 --> 01:37:42,361
and we had blasts.

2441
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:46,532
And hopefully this is something that they will remember for a long time.

2442
01:37:47,162 --> 01:37:51,571
We made new dishes together in the kitchen,

2443
01:37:51,572 --> 01:37:54,242
and it felt like we were presenting them to the others.

2444
01:37:54,542 --> 01:37:57,172
So when they enjoyed the food,

2445
01:37:57,611 --> 01:37:59,242
I felt twice as proud.

2446
01:37:59,882 --> 01:38:01,480
Thank you so much.

2447
01:38:01,481 --> 01:38:03,611
(Thank you again for accepting our invitation.)

2448
01:38:03,952 --> 01:38:04,980
(The special dinner is over.)

2449
01:38:04,981 --> 01:38:06,422
We have to go up the street.

2450
01:38:07,351 --> 01:38:08,452
I'm so full.

2451
01:38:09,082 --> 01:38:11,452
(He slaps his stomach out of satisfaction.)

2452
01:38:12,252 --> 01:38:14,061
Thank you so much for the food.

2453
01:38:16,162 --> 01:38:17,760
(Their guests return home.)

2454
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:19,261
- Let's gather around for a second.
- We did it.

2455
01:38:19,361 --> 01:38:21,331
- Today was a success.
- We all really...

2456
01:38:21,332 --> 01:38:23,632
- worked so hard today.
- Oh, my gosh.

2457
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:24,832
Oh, my gosh.

2458
01:38:25,301 --> 01:38:26,371
- Chef.
- We did it.

2459
01:38:26,372 --> 01:38:27,400
- You're the best.
- Thank you.

2460
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:28,871
- Thank you. No.
- You are the best.

2461
01:38:28,872 --> 01:38:30,211
You guys did everything.

2462
01:38:30,212 --> 01:38:31,841
- We made it.
- You did everything.

2463
01:38:31,842 --> 01:38:33,212
- We did it.
- Thank you.

2464
01:38:33,382 --> 01:38:34,412
Thank you all for your efforts.

2465
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:38,111
(They applaud each other in encouragement for working hard.)

2466
01:38:38,582 --> 01:38:40,051
I was sitting on the floor for too long.

2467
01:38:40,882 --> 01:38:42,151
Your legs must be sore.

2468
01:38:42,721 --> 01:38:45,051
He was rushing around all evening.

2469
01:38:46,252 --> 01:38:47,760
- Gosh, thank you for your efforts.
- It was nothing.

2470
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:48,761
The ice cream was so good.

2471
01:38:48,762 --> 01:38:50,532
Thank you for your efforts.

2472
01:38:51,361 --> 01:38:52,832
I'm happy you're here.

2473
01:38:54,431 --> 01:38:58,032
(Eddie lies down right away.)

2474
01:38:58,901 --> 01:39:00,901
Gosh. Goodnight, cameras.

2475
01:39:01,572 --> 01:39:02,771
Goodnight.

2476
01:39:04,311 --> 01:39:05,311
Goodnight.

2477
01:39:05,312 --> 01:39:06,341
Please insert burned-in subtitles...

2478
01:39:06,342 --> 01:39:07,882
that I put a blanket over the camera.

2479
01:39:08,681 --> 01:39:09,711
Goodnight.

2480
01:39:09,712 --> 01:39:10,712
(We did.)

2481
01:39:12,611 --> 01:39:14,422
(The lights go off at the house.)

2482
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:18,051
(Another day of the trip is coming to an end.)

2483
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:20,750
(The chef who cooks with meat makes a shocking statement.)

2484
01:39:23,859 --> 01:39:26,420
(Meat is unnecessary!)

2485
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:28,329
(Gosh)

2486
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:30,698
(Gosh, it's good.)

2487
01:39:30,699 --> 01:39:31,699
(I'm so happy.)

2488
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,799
(He's eating...)

2489
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,399
(and eating some more.)

2490
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,939
(He's not putting his spoon down.)

2491
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,739
(This flavor feels familiar.)

2492
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,040
(Wait.)

2493
01:39:42,041 --> 01:39:43,170
(Isn't it...)

2494
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,210
(They finally found it.)

2495
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:49,710
Oh, yes.

2496
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:53,920
(Mom...)

2497
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:57,319
(What is the food that made him cry out for his mom?)

2498
01:39:57,989 --> 01:40:00,930
(Teach us how to cook!)

2499
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:03,800
(Eddie's cooking class is open for the elderly.)

2500
01:40:05,229 --> 01:40:06,930
(We came to learn from the American chef.)

2501
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:10,170
(The grandmas look intimidating as they make their entrance.)

2502
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,899
(What is this?)

2503
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:14,109
(This grandpa is showing off his strength by kicking.)

2504
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:18,779
(He is exuding masculinity as they enter the house.)

2505
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,380
(Laughing)

2506
01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:24,279
(He's fully prepared with his masculinity and adorableness.)

2507
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:27,050
(The dish we're going to make today is gnocchi.)

2508
01:40:27,149 --> 01:40:28,350
(Potato gnocchi)

2509
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:30,159
(What?)

2510
01:40:30,489 --> 01:40:32,118
(What is that?)

2511
01:40:32,119 --> 01:40:34,729
Tell them it's important to go fast.

2512
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:38,760
(He's throwing instructions at them in English.)

2513
01:40:39,399 --> 01:40:40,670
(Gosh, I missed the step.)

2514
01:40:41,229 --> 01:40:43,899
(The elderly are confused as it's in English.)

2515
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:45,899
(Are you ready for the next step?)

2516
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:47,439
(Slow down.)

2517
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:48,439
(Calm down, Chef.)

2518
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:51,479
(You're moving on too quickly!)

2519
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:54,180
(The elderly are flooding him with complaints.)

2520
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:56,550
(Hosting a cooking class is not easy.)

2521
01:40:56,949 --> 01:40:58,549
(Will he be able to successfully finish...)

2522
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:00,920
(his first-ever cooking class?)

2523
01:41:01,464 --> 01:41:03,464
