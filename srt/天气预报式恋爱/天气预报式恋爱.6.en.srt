187
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,730
I didn't go because I didn't want to see you.

188
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,020
Got it?

189
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,820
Hey.

190
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,540
Let's play one-on-one then.

191
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,840
Darn it.

192
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,770
Damn it!

193
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,700
Hey, am I your "human sleeping pill"?

194
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,160
You should've told me

195
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,160
that you just wanted to get some sleep.

196
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,270
Since high school, 
you've just regarded me as a pushover, right?

197
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,990
I've been a fool who had no clue about that...

198
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,650
It's not like that.

199
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,570
If you don't want to play basketball, don't.

200
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,990
And don't be ridiculous 
barging into and staying at my house.

201
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,780
Next time, just be honest.

202
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,040
Just say that you want to use me.

203
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,690
Hey.

204
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,480
Oh.

205
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,740
Was it easier the second time?

206
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,340
Hey, Lee Dohyun.

207
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,120
Get out of my house before I kill you.

208
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,260
Pan Dongwook.

209
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,119
Jerks like you who play with other people's feelings...

210
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,140
disgust me.

211
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,940
Don't you think you should stop skipping classes?

212
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,170
You could use your own advice.

213
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,100
I guess I should.

214
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,430
What?

215
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,710
I like it.

216
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,030
What?

217
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,910
Well...

218
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,030
The Saffron pink fabric softener.

219
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,860
I like the scent.

220
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,280
Right.

221
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,920
I see.

222
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,130
[School infirmary, Lee Dohyun... human sleeping pill]

223
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,870
Hey.

224
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,960
Do you want to go to the internet café later?

225
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,340
I have plans.

226
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,950
With who?

227
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,510
Lee Dohyun from Class 3.

228
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,170
You've been hanging out with him a lot.

229
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,940
Are you guys dating or something?

230
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,680
I just want to sleep with him.

231
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,630
You're nuts.

232
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,100
[In the next episode]

233
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,680
Was the plan you had

234
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,860
with Pan Dongwook?

235
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,840
How did you know?

236
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,740
But, it's over.

237
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,330
Do you like Lee Dohyun?

238
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:18,980
Yes.

239
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,770
That was a quick response.

240
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,590
Do you know where Lee Dohyun is?

241
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,450
Why should I tell you?

242
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,770
Ever since high school,

243
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,580
you just run away from Lee Dohyun when things go south.

244
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,010
Shut up.

245
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,820
Don't you dare say one more word.

246
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,500
If you're going to leave, 
at least explain everything to Dohyun before that.

247
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,950
Lee Dohyun.
