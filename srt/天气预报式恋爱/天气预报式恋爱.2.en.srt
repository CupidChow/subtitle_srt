I said look at me.

186
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,570
Are you so nice to everyone?

187
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,020
-No.
-Then why are you so nice to me?

188
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,740
So? You don't like it?

189
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,850
Hey, what are you doing?

190
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,300
Don't speak.

191
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,740
You...

192
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,290
Weird.

193
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,680
I have something to ask you.

194
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,620
Live with me.

195
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,780
What?
