1
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:02,103
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,061
I told you not to put that dress on her.

3
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,562
Who cares?

4
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,440
She'll beat you up
even when you saved her life,

5
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,692
so you have to be careful. Okay?

6
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,487
Hey, are you all right?

7
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,740
You shouldn't move around.

8
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,033
She's a nursing major.

9
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,202
She got you medicine
and sutured your wounds.

10
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,412
You should go to the hospital right away.

11
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,998
Where am I?

12
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,042
This is my place.

13
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,300
Where are you going? You can barely walk.

14
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,970
Too much time has passed.
Tae-sul must've been caught.

15
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,013
No.

16
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,101
-Mr. Han!
-Mr. Han!

17
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,186
-Give us a statement!
-Mr. Han!

18
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,730
This has been on the news since yesterday.

19
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,108
QUANTUM & TIME'S CEO HAN TAE-SUL
EXPECTED TO RETURN TO OFFICE SOON

20
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,526
He seems to be doing fine.

21
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,378
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

22
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,260
-Move.
-She said you shouldn't move around.

23
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,304
At least say thank you
for saving your life.

24
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,931
Thanks. Out of my way.

25
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,032
Here, have a taste. Come closer.

26
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,747
-Mom!
-Seo-hae! You're home.

27
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,416
I smell something delicious.
What are you making?

28
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,417
Are you hungry?

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,377
-Yes.
-Stir-fried sausage with vegetables!

30
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,463
Try it.

31
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,216
It's good, right?

32
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,095
-Don't eat too much of it.
-Okay.

33
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,354
Oh, you woke up. You should eat something.

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,524
Come on. Have a seat.

35
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,279
You guys too. Sit over there.

36
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,502
I think my brother likes you a lot.

37
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,880
He looked after you the whole time.
He's not the type of jerk to do that.

38
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,886
Gosh, you brat.

39
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,097
You just eat and never help me.

40
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,141
Don't get married. I don't want
someone's precious son to suffer.

41
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,520
Seriously, Mom? Are you really my mom?

42
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,230
Don't worry. I'm a misogamist.

43
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,233
I won't get married.
I'll just live with you forever.

44
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,444
What is a misogamist?

45
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,488
It means I don't believe in marriage.

46
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,739
Are you a misogamist too?

47
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,451
See? No one wants to get married
these days.

48
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,121
Hey, you can't get married.
It's not by choice.

49
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,747
Look who's talking.

50
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,333
Enough! Let's eat.

51
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,171
Mom, you'll cook for me every day, right?

52
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,757
You think I'm your chef or something?
Goodness.

53
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,093
Come on! Everything you make
is so delicious.

54
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,886
-Please?
-It's the cooking app.

55
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,763
You can delete it. Just cook for me.

56
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,433
-Gosh. No way.
-How can I help you? Mom!

57
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,768
-Who are you? Go away.
-The dishes?

58
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,771
Mom! I'll help you a lot.

59
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,356
-Gosh.
-So cook for me every day.

60
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,649
-Please?
-Goodness, hey!

61
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,778
Take good care of our little girl.

62
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,037
Mom! No!

63
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,665
Mom!

64
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,046
Mom!

65
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,506
Mom!

66
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,399
Here.

67
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,786
Should I have gotten lemon tea instead?

68
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,125
Are you feeling better?

69
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,128
-Yes, thanks.
-You're welcome.

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,261
Oh, I won the lottery
with the numbers you gave me.

71
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,107
Darn it.

72
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,193
That day,
you suddenly disappeared like that.

73
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,032
So I had no choice
but to just come home on foot.

74
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,702
And I found out that Mr. Muk died.

75
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,372
He's the owner of the restaurant.

76
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,083
They said he took his own life,

77
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,335
but he'd never do that.

78
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,505
I got a bad hunch.

79
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,675
That's when I saw
the jerks who broke into my room.

80
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,969
The men from the Control Bureau.

81
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,680
I could tell instinctively.

82
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,182
-They were looking for me.
-Damn it.

83
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,476
They were going to kill me.

84
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,332
QUANTUM & TIME'S CEO HAN TAE-SUL
EXPECTED TO RETURN TO OFFICE SOON

85
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,130
If Han Tae-sul opened the suitcase,
they'll kill him.

86
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,309
So I went to a crowded place and hid,
crouching on the ground.

87
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,939
I resented you a lot back then.

88
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,942
I thought about
how I crossed paths with you

89
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,197
and let you ruin my life.
I thought I was screwed.

90
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,411
But that moment,

91
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,123
I found the lottery numbers
you had marked.

92
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,761
-I was scared of the Control Bureau.
-Okay.

93
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,263
So I hesitated for a moment.

94
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,435
But I went to buy a lottery ticket.
I figured I had nothing to lose.

95
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,028
MU MART

96
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,661
Huh? I'm sorry, sir.

97
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,746
-Our machine is broken.
-What?

98
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,555
Is your lottery machine working?

99
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,348
-Yes.
-Thank goodness!

100
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,315
Darn it. This can't be true.

101
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,200
Here! I got it!

102
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,999
Okay, that's 1,000 won.

103
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,211
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

104
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,881
The funds raised will be used

105
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,134
for various welfare
and public service projects

106
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,387
for low-income families
and the underprivileged.

107
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,972
I see the balls tumbling.

108
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,308
The first lucky number. What will it be?

109
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,310
It's 21.

110
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,104
Let's find out the second number
that will come after 21.

111
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,522
It's 16.

112
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,570
The next lucky numbers are 27 and 37.

113
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,989
Now, the fifth…

114
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,240
Number one.

115
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,826
-Wow.
-What will the sixth number be?

116
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,703
THE 913TH DRAW

117
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,499
Number seven.

118
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,085
Please let it be seven.

119
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,962
-Seven!
-Oh, it's seven.

120
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:30,963
"Seven"?

121
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,591
Now, we'll draw the bonus ball
for our second prize.

122
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,225
That's how I won the lottery.

123
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,269
I won 2.8 billion won.

124
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,314
I paid off my debt.
Then I bought a house and a car.

125
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,053
But it didn't feel right.

126
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,392
It's been over a week

127
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,727
since CEO Han Tae-sul
of Quantum & Time got shot,

128
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,313
but the police haven't even been able

129
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,483
-to identify the suspect yet.
-I thought you'd come back to find him

130
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,319
if they didn't have the suspect
in custody yet.

131
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,031
So I went to the hospital
where Han Tae-sul was staying.

132
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,827
I camped out there for about three days.

133
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,079
But no one came.

134
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,881
Wow, look at this huge mansion.

135
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:01,011
Damn, they're not at the hospital
nor at his place.

136
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,432
Darn it! Where are they?

137
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,309
Starting that day,

138
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,188
I waited in front of his house
except when I went to the bathroom.

139
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,033
Huh?

140
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,838
What are they doing?

141
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,585
Damn it.

142
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,394
You and Han Tae-sul
seemed all lovey-dovey together,

143
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,314
so I didn't want to help you,

144
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,317
but I thought I should return the favor.

145
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,361
That's why I followed you.

146
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,660
Get in!

147
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,330
Cool car, wasn't it?

148
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,457
It can go from zero to a hundred
in 4.4 seconds.

149
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,501
We outran them like this!

150
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,298
Oh, here. I didn't feel comfortable
returning this to you at home.

151
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,226
Are you an NIS agent?

152
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,352
No.

153
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,233
How did you know the lottery numbers?
Is it really rigged as they say?

154
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,694
You don't need to know.

155
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,822
What about Han Tae-sul?
What happened to him?

156
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,907
You don't need to know.

157
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
Gosh, you say that all the time.

158
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,996
I need to know what's going on
to be able to help you.

159
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,331
It's okay. I don't need your help.

160
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,838
You see, I know nothing about you.

161
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,882
So your name is Gang Seo-hae?

162
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,179
That's a pretty name.
Can I call you Seo-hae?

163
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,973
No.

164
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,312
Then I'll just call you "Sis."

165
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,024
-Why?
-Well, you're older than me.

166
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,066
I was born in 1997.

167
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,860
I was born in 2012.

168
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,403
What?

169
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,990
Never mind. Don't call me anything.

170
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,493
-Why not?
-Because you'll never see me again anyway.

171
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,372
Hey, why so serious?
You don't need to bear it on your own.

172
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,500
I don't want to put anyone in danger.

173
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,629
They say only those who can accept help
can help others.

174
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,131
-You know that saying, right?
-No, I don't.

175
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,093
Gosh, you can't even walk properly.

176
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,387
I'm going to help you.

177
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,182
-Hey.
-Let's say you were right.

178
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,808
If Han Tae-sul got caught,

179
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,477
how will you save him on your own?

180
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,980
I'll figure it out.

181
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,277
I'm heading back in.

182
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,288
Hey, even if you keep refusing my help,

183
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,456
I'm going to help you.

184
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,249
Okay, Sis?

185
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,877
-Hey.
-Oh, right. Here.

186
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,551
I saw the scar on your wrist.

187
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,805
Use that to cover it
and think of me when you see it.

188
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,031
Thank you so much for saving my family.

189
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,076
I'll return the favor for all my life.

190
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,262
SEPTEMBER 9, WEDNESDAY

191
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,438
Save my number.

192
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,898
Call me if anything happens, okay?

193
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,983
Okay.

194
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,917
Hello?

195
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,003
Mom?

196
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,882
Sorry? Hello?

197
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,551
Speak up, please.

198
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,162
Was it a prank call?

199
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,456
Wrong number, I guess.

200
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,171
Mom, why are you crying?

201
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,718
What? Did something get in my eye?

202
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,512
That's odd. What's wrong with me?

203
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,516
Daddy's home!

204
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,851
Dad!

205
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,978
My gosh, Seo-hae.

206
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,190
-You're late.
-I know.

207
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,566
Dad, look at this.

208
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,693
I drew this.

209
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,154
Let's see. Wow, this is impressive!

210
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,949
-Isn't it great?
-It looks awesome, doesn't it?

211
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,368
This is you. This is me, and this is Mom.

212
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,081
Why is your mom as tall as I am?
I'm much taller.

213
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,050
-Run.
-What?

214
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,386
Exchange all of your money
and go abroad with your family.

215
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,471
What are you talking about?

216
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,933
A war will break out on October 31.
Everyone will die.

217
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm from the future.

218
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,939
There's a time machine.
We call it the uploader.

219
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,526
Han Tae-sul invented…
I mean, he will invent it.

220
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,238
Some people came here
through the uploader to kill him.

221
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,699
It'll lead to a nuclear war
that will kill everyone.

222
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,159
So I must stop it.

223
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,997
You saw it, remember?
I flickered and almost disappeared.

224
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,832
It's a side effect of time travel.

225
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,376
It means I don't have much time left here.

226
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,965
What are you talking about?
This is so random.

227
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,552
Is this a hidden camera prank
or something?

228
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,804
I'm serious.

229
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,935
So you knew the winning numbers
because you're from the future?

230
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,104
Yes.

231
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,568
For real? You're not lying?

232
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,997
Then what should I do?

233
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,124
I can't just pack up
and leave the country.

234
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,126
Follow me.

235
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,754
-Be quiet.
-Why did you bring such a small bag?

236
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,632
-It's in the trunk. Quiet!
-Gosh, this is so sudden.

237
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,344
-You should've listened to me.
-Okay! Be quiet, please.

238
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,970
My goodness.

239
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,264
What about the valuables?
Did you pack them all?

240
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,016
Where are we going out of the blue?

241
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,935
I'll tell you later.

242
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,313
Where do we go now?

243
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,245
Don't move.

244
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,043
Don't move.

245
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,504
I'm faster than you.
I'm sure you know that.

246
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,798
Go get your boss.

247
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,763
Where's your boyfriend?

248
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,556
Keep talking if you want to get shot.

249
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,854
Goodness!

250
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,941
Look who's here. It's good to see you.

251
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,528
My gosh.

252
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,912
By the way, where's Mr. Han?

253
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,791
Did you two break up?

254
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,045
Oh, dear.

255
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,008
Have a seat.

256
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,638
Had I known you'd come here voluntarily,

257
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,724
we would've quit looking for you two

258
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,268
and just watched the store.

259
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,730
These kids went everywhere
to track the two of you down.

260
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,489
Do me a favor, and I'll give you the key.

261
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,952
Well, what's this key for?

262
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,204
Don't annoy me. I won't repeat myself.

263
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,420
It's the one you're after,
the key to the safe.

264
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,797
I'm not like Tae-sul. I don't lie.

265
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:26,219
I thought you were a close-minded loner,
but you know how to negotiate.

266
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:30,515
All right. Tell me what you need
and give me some time to think it over.

267
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,900
What do you need?

268
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,068
First,

269
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,071
help three people
leave the country safely.

270
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,406
Who are they?

271
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,867
You don't need to know.

272
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,912
The Control Bureau might come after them.

273
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,831
Help them leave the country safely
as soon as possible.

274
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,708
Can you do that?

275
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,505
What else?

276
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,881
Next…

277
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,177
I can't reach Tae-sul.

278
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,932
Goodness, why are you telling me this?

279
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,309
Maybe he doesn't want to talk to you.

280
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,519
He got caught.

281
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,989
QUANTUM & TIME'S CEO HAN TAE-SUL
EXPECTED TO RETURN TO OFFICE SOON

282
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,783
He's doing fine.

283
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,701
That's not him.

284
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,956
Have you ever seen this jerk
voluntarily thanking anyone?

285
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,756
The one you saw on TV is fake.

286
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,926
You're right.

287
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,971
That jerk certainly isn't the type
to thank anyone. Gosh.

288
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,015
Help me save Tae-sul.

289
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,112
She's right. They've blocked everything.
No phone or Internet.

290
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,157
The weird thing is,
it's not blocked from the inside.

291
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,658
It's blocked from the outside.

292
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,743
Looks like he's locked in there.

293
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:17,831
Hey.

294
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,500
So?

295
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,336
Apparently,
he hasn't left the house for days.

296
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,088
It's surrounded by security guards.

297
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,924
A guy's in there. What was his name?

298
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,718
Ed?

299
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,635
-Eddy Kim.
-Yes.

300
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,345
Only he is allowed to go in.

301
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,265
Really?
Then there's nothing we can do, right?

302
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,183
Forget it.

303
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,851
But you promised.

304
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,897
I never get involved in dangerous stuff.
Safety comes first.

305
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,857
Fine.

306
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,403
Hey! You impatient little brat.

307
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,072
-You said you couldn't do it.
-When did I say that?

308
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,991
I just said safety comes first.

309
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,038
Then how about this?

310
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:02,459
We'll help him out a little
to escape from the house.

311
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:07,172
After that, you can rescue him
or do whatever the heck you want.

312
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,381
What do you say? Good?

313
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,718
-But how?
-Is it a good plan or not?

314
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,762
Okay.

315
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,848
All right. Hey, that thing.

316
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,350
What thing?

317
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,518
The thing we can shoot!

318
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,812
-For real?
-Won't it be dangerous?

319
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,024
If we go ahead and use it,
the higher-ups will flip out.

320
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,525
She'll hand over the key!

321
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,073
Even if we do all sorts of crazy things,
nothing will change anyway.

322
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,036
Hey.

323
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,997
We can upload items to his house
from the future.

324
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,207
What? How?

325
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,750
Things he'd need, for example.

326
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,254
We can send it to a safe PO box and
store it until sometime in the future.

327
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,007
-We'll send it back to the present.
-To the exact location?

328
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,678
Yes, up to one gallon,
which equals approximately 3.7 liters.

329
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,598
It's 100 percent accurate up to the size
of the smallest mailing box.

330
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,394
The accuracy rate is inversely
proportional to the amount of data,

331
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,146
so the accuracy rate drops
when you transport people.

332
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,525
Complicated colors or structures
increase the failure rate.

333
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,943
Hey, that's enough.

334
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,194
Look here.

335
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,406
If you have anything to send to Mr. Han,
hand it over.

336
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,784
Anything that can help him
escape from the house.

337
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,538
If you don't have anything,
we'll send things like guns or grenades.

338
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,383
Goodness. What is this?

339
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,052
Isn't this an EMP?

340
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,181
Why are you even carrying this around?

341
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,475
Not this.

342
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,354
Do you have a picture
of the two of you together?

343
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,774
Something memorable.

344
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,737
-Why?
-So he can know who the sender is, okay?

345
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,781
When he sees this,
he'll know that it's from you.

346
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,052
Look. Hey, look at this.

347
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,597
How lovely.

348
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,890
Got a death wish?

349
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,729
Hey, if there's something to tell him,
write it on the back.

350
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,162
I'M A MISOGAMIST TOO

351
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,755
I used to be a misogamist too.

352
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,599
-That's mine!
-Let go! You don't own this.

353
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,815
We have to enclose an object like this.

354
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,195
When the cup breaks,
we'll know that it has arrived.

355
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,781
Take this to the post office.

356
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,825
Make sure it arrives at his house
by 10 p.m.

357
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,743
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

358
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,786
Yes, sir.

359
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,497
It'll arrive at 22:00,
so I'll start downloading now.

360
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,251
If all goes well, the cup will fall
at his house at 22:00 sharp.

361
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,211
The rest will arrive five seconds later.

362
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,797
By the way,

363
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,717
who's holding him captive there?

364
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,137
Sigma.

365
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,559
I'm just curious.
Let me ask you something.

366
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,480
Why on earth are you doing this?

367
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,402
What? To stop them
from inventing the uploader?

368
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,195
Is that it?

369
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:05,243
Then why do it the hard way?

370
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,038
If I were you, I'd just kill Han Tae-sul.
Then it'd all be over, right?

371
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,709
What?

372
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,170
You think you can change the future?

373
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:21,092
You know that you can't change anything,
don't you?

374
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,972
Nothing will change,
no matter what you do.

375
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,020
The package will arrive in 15 seconds.

376
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,984
Then why do you want the key so much?

377
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,780
We can change the future.

378
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,702
Sure, I hope that's the case.

379
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,830
I can change it.

380
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,583
Downloading now.

381
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,213
Four, three,

382
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,508
two, one.

383
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,430
It has arrived.

384
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,311
This isn't mine.

385
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,437
I'M A MISOGAMIST TOO

386
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,688
What?

387
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,693
-Get him!
-What? Turn the lights on!

388
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,404
Tae-sul!

389
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,572
Han Tae-sul!

390
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,241
Darn it!

391
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,724
NO CALLER ID

392
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,187
Han Tae-sul got out.
He's headed to the tool market.

393
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,940
The tool market.

394
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,949
-Hey.
-Yes?

395
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,410
About Han Tae-sul…

396
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,663
Gosh, this will make me
sound like a loser.

397
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,333
What's your relationship with him?

398
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,336
Nothing.

399
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,214
Then be my girlfriend.

400
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,675
Why should I?

401
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,637
Let's leave the country together.

402
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,431
There will be a war. Why stay here?

403
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,558
-Ask that man to get another ticket.
-No.

404
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,186
Why not? Because of your family?

405
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,063
No.

406
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,815
Then what's the reason?

407
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,401
Because of that jerk, Han Tae-sul?

408
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,324
Do you like him?

409
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,651
-Is that a real rifle?
-No, it has rubber bullets.

410
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,029
Can it kill someone?

411
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,826
-Do you want to try?
-No, I'm good.

412
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,003
Hey, Sis!

413
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,425
I'll wait for you here.

414
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,166
CEO HAN TAE-SUL'S RETURN
TO MANAGEMENT POSITION UNCLEAR

415
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,294
How did things get so messed up?

416
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,413
Spread out and find him.

417
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,472
Damn it.

418
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,696
Darn it. Where did he go?

419
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,870
What is he doing?

420
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,596
Darn it.

421
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,439
UNKNOWN CALLER

422
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,361
-Hello?
-Hello? Is it you, Seo-hae?

423
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,530
-Is that you?
-Yes.

424
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,991
Hey.

425
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,994
Are you okay?
Did you manage to escape that day?

426
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,914
Yes. I saw the news.
You seemed to be doing fine.

427
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,374
Me?

428
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:12,837
I'm telling you this because you should
adjust to the modern society.

429
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,048
You shouldn't believe everything
the media says.

430
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,592
The world isn't that honest.

431
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,851
-What's going on?
-Seo-hae, listen carefully.

432
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,104
You're the only person I can trust

433
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,024
whether from the past, present, or future.

434
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,817
I ran away from home,

435
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,862
and I'm in huge trouble right now.

436
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,489
-Can you help me?
-Where are you?

437
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:45,036
I'm at Hannam Tool Market.

438
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,291
I'm a bit busy right now, though.

439
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,003
What? What are you doing?

440
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,838
I'm just busy.

441
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,173
You can't do this to me!

442
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,092
-Get down.
-What?

443
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,470
-I said, get down.
-What?

444
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,319
Hello? Seo-hae?

445
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,699
What the heck?

446
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,791
What was that?

447
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,161
Why are you here? You said you were busy.

448
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,290
What can I do? You said
I was the only one you could trust.

449
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,126
What happened to you?

450
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,546
And what are you wearing?

451
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,465
Oh, this?

452
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,885
-Forget it. Come on, let's go.
-Hey, wait.

453
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,055
Are you really Seo-hae?

454
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,642
-What are you talking about?
-Well…

455
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,229
For the past few days,
they kept telling me that you're fake.

456
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,482
So I don't know who to trust anymore.

457
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,656
Are you all right?

458
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,327
I'm sorry,

459
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,998
but I can't tell what's real
and what's fake anymore.

460
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,167
What if you're…

461
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,298
It is me. I'm here.

462
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,343
Look. It's me, right?

463
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,351
Let's go.

464
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,031
Hey, you're back. Here.

465
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,039
Hop in. Wait!

466
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,832
She has to sit in the front.

467
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,420
-What do you want?
-Darn it. You sit in the front then.

468
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,015
By the way, where are we going?

469
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,600
To Asia Mart.

470
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,727
Why?

471
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,187
I need to hand over the key.

472
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,232
-What?
-I had to get you out of there.

473
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,858
Still, we can't give him the key.

474
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,404
You got another idea?
They helped us get you out.

475
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,156
I get that, but still…

476
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,492
We can't hand it over to those jerks.

477
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,619
Jeez.

478
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,080
It's cold. Turn on the heater.

479
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,665
Don't touch it. I'll do it.

480
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,335
Where is it?

481
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,214
It's right here. The fan button.

482
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,010
What is this car?

483
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,638
I see. A discontinued model.

484
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,266
Did you buy it secondhand?

485
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,018
Gosh, this seat is so uncomfortable.

486
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,939
Jeez. Why are you dropping the honorifics?

487
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,360
Who is this guy?

488
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,487
Me? The person who saved you.

489
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,989
When did you save me?

490
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,991
If you have a problem, get out.

491
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,493
-How old are you?
-Be quiet, both of you.

492
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,000
Darn it.

493
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,210
It's cold in here.

494
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,608
-Go inside.
-Wait…

495
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,748
Thanks for everything. Get going now.

496
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,666
Send your mom and sister my regards.

497
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,045
Come with us.
You can't keep living like this.

498
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,713
Get going. Your family is waiting.

499
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,090
-No, I'll help you.
-I said, go.

500
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,011
This isn't your fight.
If you stay with me, you'll die.

501
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,848
-How do you know that?
-This isn't something you can do.

502
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,975
Go.

503
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:28,003
WARNING
TOP SECRET

504
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,051
Goodness.

505
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,262
Welcome.

506
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,807
Hey, give me the key.

507
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,895
Hey, is this really okay?

508
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,650
Goodness.

509
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,320
I met your brother.

510
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,322
What?

511
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,244
You're putting Tae-sul in danger.

512
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,123
This is my last warning.
If I ever see you again,

513
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,834
I'll kill you.

514
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,130
You don't care whether he dies or not
if you can save the world,

515
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,299
but it's the opposite for me.

516
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,845
As long as I can save Tae-sul,
I don't care what happens to the world.

517
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,431
I always thought it was odd.

518
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,100
Why did he put the blueprint
in the safe and lose the key,

519
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,518
knowing how dangerous it is?

520
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,148
If someone manages to open the safe
and obtains the blueprint,

521
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,859
you'll become useless and face danger.

522
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,948
I'll tell you what's in this safe.

523
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:42,953
At some point in the future,

524
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,749
Mr. Han will invent the uploader,
which will save all of us.

525
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,585
And the original blueprint

526
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,046
is in this safe.

527
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,355
If I were Han Tae-san,

528
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,358
I'd never keep something so important
in a safe.

529
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,026
Then what?

530
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,278
If the blueprint is gone,

531
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,739
you'll be the only person
who can build the uploader.

532
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,033
No one will be able to kill you.

533
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:30,209
If I were your brother,
I'd keep it with me,

534
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,295
even if I have to be on the run forever.

535
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,063
There's nothing inside the safe.

536
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,075
What the…

537
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,375
TO TAE-SUL

538
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,379
"To Tae-sul."

539
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,109
Tae-san.

540
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,111
It's his handwriting.

541
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:46,743
To Tae-sul,

542
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:51,081
if you're reading this letter,
it means you've opened the safe.

543
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,834
The blueprint is safe with me.

544
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,754
You'll be safe
as long as I keep this with me.

545
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,631
No one can harm you.

546
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,636
I'm doing fine. For real.

547
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,306
So don't worry about me.

548
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,568
If you're still beating yourself up
for what happened that day, don't.

549
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,696
Brothers fight all the time.

550
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,157
I'm really okay.

551
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,411
But I really miss you

552
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,039
from time to time.

553
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,250
I want to sit down with you

554
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,377
and laugh and chat with you
like the old days.

555
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,465
Is the future

556
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,510
really unchangeable?

557
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:50,349
If everyone is going to die,

558
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:55,187
and if that means you could die too,

559
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,607
what should I do?

560
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,444
I made up my mind.

561
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,531
I'm going to save you.

562
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,744
Tae-sul, I hope you make a choice
that you won't regret.

563
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:15,958
I believe the outcome will be good
when good choices are accumulated.

564
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,877
As you know, I'm not that smart.

565
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,171
That's the only way I can look at it.

566
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,549
You'll do better than I did.

567
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,761
Live your life to the fullest
with no regrets.

568
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,597
And don't look for me.

569
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:36,019
We'll meet again someday.
I believe that we will.

570
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,273
I miss you, Tae-sul.

571
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,192
I love you.

572
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,635
I figured out who Sigma is.

573
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,180
He was right next to us all along.

574
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,449
HAN TAE-SAN

575
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,577
DON'T LOOK FOR YOUR BROTHER
IF YOU DO, YOU'LL DIE

576
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,854
Tae-san wasn't hiding after all,

577
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,483
nor was he on the run.

578
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,235
Hey.

579
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,489
Those photos

580
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,866
weren't photos of me.

581
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,828
He was looking for Sigma.

582
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,667
Mr. Han,
what the hell are you talking about?

583
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,586
Guys.

584
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,014
Where's the blueprint?

585
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,351
My brother has it.

586
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,649
What? I kept my promise.
I gave you the key.

587
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,070
Be honest if you want to strike a deal.

588
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,573
If you want to trick me,
you should be smarter about it.

589
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,077
You brats, how dare you try to dupe me?

590
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,290
Hold on! What's that sound?

591
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,504
The Control Bureau is here!

592
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,464
I called them.

593
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,529
Hey, go lock the door!
Hurry up, you punks!

594
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,371
What? You told me to be smarter.

595
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,040
Turn around.

596
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,876
You too. Now!

597
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,423
Well, you're pretty smart after all.

598
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,391
Put your hands up!

599
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,226
-Put your hands up!
-Put your hands up!

600
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:08,899
Arrest them.

601
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,281
-Start searching.
-Yes, sir.

602
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,325
Where's the back door?

603
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,873
-Where is it?
-Outside and to your left.

604
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,919
-You brat.
-Don't follow us. Let's go.

605
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,921
Hey, you're so cool.

606
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:31,880
I know.

607
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,967
Make sure you never run into me again
in this lifetime, both of you.

608
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,886
Will do. Stay healthy, Mr. Park.

609
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,930
All right, thanks.

610
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,607
Bingbing, is the generator on?

611
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,444
You stay here.
Keep the doors locked, okay?

612
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:55,946
What about you?

613
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,867
Those jerks from the Control Bureau
will leave quietly once they catch me.

614
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,078
Hey.

615
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:06,081
You must not turn off the downloader.

616
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,582
Okay?

617
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,877
Do you understand?

618
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,465
-Boss, wait!
-Let go!

619
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,093
Lock the doors.

620
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,096
Do not leave this room, no matter what.

621
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:22,889
Okay?

622
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,100
Yes.

623
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,893
All right.

624
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,448
Goodness.

625
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,120
I have to go back in there.

626
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:48,290
Don't come out.

627
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,798
Jeez, you guys are so loud!

628
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,342
Goodness.

629
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,940
Here! I'm right here. My goodness.

630
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:17,193
Must you cause all this ruckus?

631
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,446
What a crowd.

632
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:24,659
Okay, all right. My goodness.

633
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,541
I have my hands up.

634
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,721
Jae-sun, you know which gate it is, right?

635
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,348
Yes.

636
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,475
I think it's that way.

637
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,654
Jae-sun, why are you standing there?

638
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,613
Come on.

639
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,916
Sorry, Mom. Go without me.
Go-eun, take good care of Mom.

640
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,000
And take this.

641
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,460
-Jae-sun.
-Jae-sun!

642
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,088
-Jae-sun.
-Jae-sun!

643
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,255
Son!

644
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,177
-Good morning.
-Hi. How are you feeling?

645
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,138
Good.

646
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,058
Breakfast is ready. Come and eat.

647
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,226
Okay.

648
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,320
Tae-sul.

649
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:28,199
There's a sniper,
so don't try anything funny. Sit down.

650
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,602
You seem to be doing well.

651
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,229
I already cut that wire.

652
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,110
You can't make calls,
and there are no security guards.

653
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,784
I just have some questions for you.
That's why I'm here.

654
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,661
Who is Sigma?

655
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,290
If you refuse to answer,

656
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,503
I will take away everything you have,
one by one.

657
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,298
Then I'll rip them to shreds,
so you'd better answer.

658
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,382
Who is Sigma?

659
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,639
As of this moment,

660
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,433
you're removed from the Quantum & Time
board of directors.

661
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:39,020
Tae-sul, that is not something
you can decide on your…

662
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,899
By the time this is over,

663
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,485
Tae-sul won't be able to recover
because of the drugs.

664
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,822
-I got a locked ward prepared for him.
-What about Eddy?

665
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,366
He thinks it's just a treatment.

666
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,036
The only thing on his mind
is taking over the management rights.

667
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,290
It's a short conversation,

668
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,960
but three counts of legal violation
are mentioned.

669
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,628
Instigating unlawful confinement.

670
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,339
Violating the Medical Law
and the Capital Markets Act.

671
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,258
How did I record this?

672
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,594
Well, when I almost died here that day,

673
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,139
I put my earpiece on the floor.

674
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,777
I'll ask you one last time.

675
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,906
If you refuse to answer again,
Seo-jin will go to jail.

676
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,201
Who is Sigma?

677
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,247
When and how did Sigma approach you?

678
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,252
From the very beginning.

679
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,213
Do you remember the day we first met?

680
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,466
What?

681
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,801
The investment briefing?

682
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,887
Sigma came to see me a month before that.

683
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,805
He had this medicine

684
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,309
that could cure my wife,
who was on the verge of death.

685
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,645
I thought it was complete nonsense.

686
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,314
However,

687
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,233
she really woke up.

688
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,404
And he told me to invest in your company.

689
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:20,371
What about Tae-san?
What happened to my brother?

690
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,583
He said Tae-san was getting in his way,

691
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,337
-so he should be put in a mental ward.
-Darn it!

692
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,175
Where is this jerk now?

693
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,303
No idea. I really don't know.
I had no choice.

694
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,639
You must have a way of contacting him!

695
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,557
He contacts me only when he needs me.

696
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,272
Tae-sul.

697
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,276
I'm sorry.

698
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,904
Where is the chairman?
He said he'd be here.

699
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,239
I can't reach him.

700
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,587
We're short on time, so let's begin.

701
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,339
We asked all of you to be here today

702
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,593
because we have
an important announcement to make.

703
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,720
Is it about Mr. Han Tae-sul?

704
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,265
Is it true that something happened to him
last night?

705
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,894
You can ask questions later.
I'll read this aloud first.

706
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,606
"Due to CEO Han Tae-sul's absence,

707
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:14,193
his position has practically been
left vacant for a while now,

708
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,404
which is weakening
the company's competitiveness

709
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,281
and making our shareholders anxious.

710
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,784
Hence, we have decided to appoint

711
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,537
a new leader.

712
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:34,422
The board has come to the conclusion
that I will fill in

713
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,842
Mr. Han's virtually vacant position…"

714
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:41,012
-It's Han Tae-sul!
-What's going on?

715
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,140
-What?
-He's here.

716
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,600
-What?
-It's Han Tae-sul.

717
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,436
Jeez.

718
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,564
You're the CEO now?

719
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,691
That's cool. Congratulations.

720
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,652
Tae-sul.

721
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,696
Just a moment.
I have an important announcement as well.

722
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,413
This is being broadcast live, right?

723
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,832
I have something to say.

724
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,126
Well,

725
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,505
Tae-san.

726
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,384
Han Tae-san.

727
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,262
You're watching this, right?

728
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,807
I know we'll meet again.

729
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:30,520
Stay safe until that day, okay?

730
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,192
I miss you.

731
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,867
And the other person who's watching this.

732
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:50,456
Yes, you. Sigma, you jerk.

733
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,668
Don't hide like a coward.

734
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,337
Show yourself, you wimp.

735
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,174
Actually, never mind.

736
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,553
You just stay put,

737
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,639
because I will find you.

738
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,804
Now, it's getting interesting.

739
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,473
Hello?

740
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,351
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.

741
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,034
Honey.

742
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,787
I'm sorry.

743
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,708
This happened because I'm incompetent.

744
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,239
Come on.
All this fuss over just one death?

745
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,325
What will they do
when 50 million people die?

746
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,234
I can't understand
why she has to go through all this

747
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:12,278
just to save someone like you.

748
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:13,904
How do you know Tae-sul?

749
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,906
He has to make something for me.

750
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,952
I said I'd help you find your brother,
not Sigma.

751
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,328
I have to risk my life.

752
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,290
I have to tell Han Tae-sul

753
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,417
not to meet him.

754
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,336
You wanted to know

755
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,214
what the future looks like, right?

756
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:36,052
Enjoy it when you can.
Everything's going to burn down soon.

757
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,305
"Sigma." Now I know what it means.

758
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:44,351
