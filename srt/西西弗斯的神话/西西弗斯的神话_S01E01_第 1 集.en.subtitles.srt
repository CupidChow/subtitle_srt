1
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,103
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,959
Seo-hae, wake up.

3
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,004
Seo-hae.

4
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,132
Dad.

5
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,344
Time to go. It's your turn now.

6
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,283
Anything that weighs over 30kg
is not allowed in.

7
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,828
Microbial substances, living creatures,

8
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,956
and explosive materials are not permitted.

9
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,000
We assume no responsibility
and shall not be liable

10
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,211
for any injury, death, and accidents

11
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,046
that occurs during your trip.

12
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,427
-Form a line.
-You must get tested before you board!

13
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,638
-Move forward!
-Put your belongings in your suitcase.

14
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,056
-You may go.
-Move forward!

15
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,016
Let's meet again, alive and well.

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,476
-Move forward.
-Move forward!

17
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,980
-You, over there. It's this way!
-Hey, move it.

18
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,618
Let's go together, Dad.

19
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,038
I don't think I can go with you.

20
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,586
Tell me what I told you.

21
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,088
First, when you arrive.

22
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,592
When you arrive!

23
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,051
"Start running."

24
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,721
Do not let anyone catch you,
no matter what.

25
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,182
If you get caught,
just don't say anything.

26
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,394
Just pretend you can't talk. Okay?

27
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,773
Yes. But let's go together--

28
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,691
Second.

29
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,570
Hurry up!

30
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,617
"Do not trust anyone."

31
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,746
You never know who's your ally
and who's your real enemy.

32
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,625
Don't trust anyone. No one. Okay?

33
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,503
-Okay.
-Good.

34
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,839
What was the third thing?

35
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,509
Come on.

36
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,221
-Number 250811!
-Coming!

37
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,266
Quick. What was it?

38
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,938
"Han Tae-sul."

39
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,651
Han Tae-sul.
Stay away from him at all costs.

40
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,988
You must not cross paths with him.
Don't even talk to him, okay?

41
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,990
Then what about Mom?

42
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,117
What if she dies?

43
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,623
We all die in the end.

44
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,463
But I can't leave you alone here, Dad.

45
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,642
When you get there,
you'll find lots of good food

46
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,852
and all of your favorite fruits.

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,814
Real fruit, not the canned ones.

48
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,733
So just go.

49
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,361
Eat everything you want.

50
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,530
And do whatever you want.

51
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,617
Just enjoy your life.

52
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,330
Promise me.

53
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,000
-Number 250811!
-Coming!

54
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,545
Promise me.

55
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,839
If you don't, I won't let you go.

56
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,060
Let's go.

57
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,107
Catch her!

58
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,891
Darn it.

59
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,270
Hey! You, come here.

60
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,898
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

61
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,983
You call this ramyeon?

62
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,153
Are you blind? Look at this.

63
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,906
The noodles turned completely soggy.

64
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,368
How dare you make me eat this trash?

65
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,787
You eat this.

66
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,748
What? You can't either, can you?

67
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,086
I want you to scarf it down
and make me a new one. Okay?

68
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,587
Hey.

69
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,881
The new one will taste the same.

70
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,467
Where are we now?

71
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,887
We're 10,000m above the ground.

72
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,182
The low air pressure
lowers the boiling point.

73
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,228
That's why your noodles taste bad.
Didn't you learn in science class?

74
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,647
Who are you?

75
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,084
HAN TAE-SUL, QUANTUM & TIME

76
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,133
They took my picture
when I was at the lab,

77
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,926
so I don't look that good.

78
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,887
Next month, you'll see
my Hawaiian-themed photos.

79
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,725
If you give me your contact information,
I'll send them to you.

80
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,228
Have you been to Hawaii?

81
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,896
No.

82
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,107
Me neither.

83
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,776
-Why do you ask?
-You know…

84
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,572
If I ever fall in love with someone,
I want to take her there.

85
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,202
Just saying.

86
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,456
So just thank her for the noodles
and finish it.

87
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,459
Hey!

88
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,755
I don't want to.

89
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,722
In that case,
this evening or tomorrow morning,

90
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,808
"rude ramyeon guy"
will be all over the Internet.

91
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,979
Are you blind? Look at this.
The noodles turned completely soggy.

92
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,732
How dare you make me eat this trash?

93
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,774
Damn it.

94
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,568
You eat this.

95
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,779
Thank you.

96
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,866
Excuse me. May I have a glass of water?

97
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,451
Coming right up.

98
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,703
Your number too.

99
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,976
But she's not your type.

100
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,187
I have to say

101
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,398
these first-class seats
are super comfortable.

102
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,401
I'm really proud of you, little brother.

103
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,905
And the quality of this wine is top-notch.

104
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,115
You should have a glass too.

105
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,537
You see, Tae-sul,
there's this article I read.

106
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,791
If the brain is stressed all the time
like yours is…

107
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,167
What was that?

108
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,585
Right, adrenaline.

109
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,213
The body produces it,
which weakens the immune system.

110
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,798
I read it in the newspaper.

111
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,719
Hey, Tae-sul.

112
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,013
I'm talking to you. Look at me.

113
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,724
Are you mad at me or something?

114
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,601
Why are you ignoring me?

115
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,563
Because…

116
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,900
you're dead.

117
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,946
Here's your water.

118
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,937
Stay seated.

119
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,773
-Fasten your seat belts.
-Don't worry. It must be some turbulence.

120
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,150
Stay seated.

121
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,038
What's going on?

122
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,335
Got it.

123
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,176
Please fasten your seat belt.

124
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,137
We're experiencing some turbulence…

125
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,598
-…at the moment.
-Your seat belt, please.

126
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,683
Please return to your seats

127
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,810
and keep your seat belts fastened.

128
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,654
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

129
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,869
Captain.

130
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,121
Captain!

131
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,390
Stewardess!

132
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:16,850
Are you okay?

133
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,994
Tae-sul.

134
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,704
Tae-sul!

135
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,956
Han Tae-sul!

136
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,076
Sir, wake up. Sir!

137
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,289
Hey! Wake up, sir!

138
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,337
Wake up!

139
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,264
What is going on?

140
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,267
Someone just…

141
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,646
Right over there.

142
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,529
Captain.

143
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,615
Captain!

144
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,332
Please stay in your seats!

145
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,883
What are you doing?

146
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,761
Can't you tell?
I'm trying to fix the plane.

147
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,555
With that?

148
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,973
During World War II,

149
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,933
they used this to fix aircraft.

150
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,160
I told you.

151
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,597
Let's see.

152
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,516
It's hovering around 150.
It's about to stall!

153
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,475
Hold on.

154
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,647
The power's out
only for the control panel.

155
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,066
Can you make a safe landing
if I get it running again?

156
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,984
What?

157
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,444
Can you?

158
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,445
Yes.

159
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,157
We're at 20,000 feet above sea level now.

160
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,659
That means we've got
3 minutes and 30 seconds.

161
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,626
Let me know every 30 seconds. Okay?

162
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,294
Hurry!

163
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,766
Thirty seconds down.

164
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,975
Okay.

165
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,436
I'm going to divert the current
using a magnet.

166
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,063
It's…

167
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,150
Okay, let's go.

168
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,784
What are you doing?

169
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,536
You can't break that thing!

170
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,247
There's a magnet in this panel.

171
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,167
Here it is. Do you need this now?

172
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,210
We're going to crash!

173
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,926
This is nerve-wracking.

174
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,850
All right, let's see.

175
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,728
Which one's broken? Hold on.

176
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,273
Another 30 seconds down.
Only 2.5 minutes left.

177
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,235
This is the one.

178
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,695
Do you have a lighter?

179
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,994
SEUNG-BOK

180
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,330
Hey. Hey, look!

181
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,456
What?

182
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,793
Jeez, this prick. I'm busy right now.

183
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,295
I need to take this call.

184
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,380
Hey, Seung-bok.

185
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,883
Where are you now? I couldn't reach you!

186
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,720
-The board members are angry.
-It's been hours.

187
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,763
Why isn't he coming?

188
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,683
This is Mr. Han. I got a hold of him.

189
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,232
You'll get fired if you keep missing
the board meeting and causing trouble.

190
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,859
Who can fire me? It's my company.

191
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,361
Anyway, where are you now?

192
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,280
Me? On an airplane.

193
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,032
Airplane…

194
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,908
Then how did this call get through?

195
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,703
The plane's falling now.

196
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,954
What?

197
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,169
I'm not in the mood for jokes right now.

198
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,255
I'm serious.
You can get a signal at lower altitudes.

199
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,215
You said you couldn't reach me earlier.

200
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,925
That's enough.

201
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,012
You need to call 911 or the airport now.

202
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,849
Air Koreana JH007, arriving from Saipan.

203
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,893
The plane's about to crash in Seoul.

204
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,479
We're flying below 10,000 feet
at the moment.

205
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,731
And the current speed is 100 knots.

206
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,567
Captain! The captain's dead.

207
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,153
And the copilot. He's not doing well.

208
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,279
He's confused.

209
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:48,200
There was a 10cm-wide hole
on the window here, but I've taped it up.

210
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,993
I'm fixing the electrical system now.

211
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,044
So? Where's Mr. Han right now?

212
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,462
How much longer must we wait?

213
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,714
He's on his way now.

214
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,467
You rascal.

215
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,261
If this is a joke, I'm going to kill you.

216
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,931
Give me that.

217
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,560
His nonsense is getting out of hand.
What? "The plane is falling"?

218
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,812
You rascal.

219
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,358
BREAKING NEWS: AIR KOREANA JH007
STALLING OVER SEOUL, OUT OF CONTACT

220
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,401
Hey, Tae-sul.

221
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,905
Are you lying to me
after seeing this on the news?

222
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,117
Seriously?

223
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,583
Look. Isn't this cool?

224
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,044
Hey.

225
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,630
You're out of your mind.

226
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,801
Contact Air Koreana now!

227
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,885
Right now!

228
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,971
Hey, Seung-bok.

229
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,348
Start recording what I say.

230
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,517
Record this call!

231
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,186
Why should I record it?

232
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,563
Just do it! Are you ready?

233
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,943
Yes, ready. Speak.

234
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,736
I, Han Tae-sul,

235
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,407
will liquidate all my savings, stocks,
certificates of deposit,

236
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,118
and real estate properties
except for the penthouse

237
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,705
and donate half of it
to a foundation which I'll set up.

238
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,165
Come up with a name for it.

239
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,376
The other half will be put toward
the company's R&D funds.

240
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,336
And my stock options

241
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,422
will be transferred
to every Quantum & Time employee,

242
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,049
excluding the executives.

243
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,552
What in the world are you talking about?

244
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,220
My last words, Seung-bok.

245
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,638
You can have the penthouse.

246
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,015
Are you crazy?

247
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,518
Do you want more?
Take my Lamborghini and Porsche too.

248
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,189
And give my Maybach,
Range Rover, and 63 AMG

249
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,065
to my bodyguard, Yeo Bong-seon.

250
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,151
Tell him I appreciate his hard work.

251
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,945
That's it.
The plane will crash in 50 seconds.

252
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,281
Stop recording.
Did you hit the stop button?

253
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,577
I did.

254
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,371
Hey, this is just between you and me.

255
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,415
I won't say it twice, so listen carefully.

256
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,544
The password for the safe in
my dressing room at the penthouse. 1-0-0…

257
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,965
It's 100811.

258
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,343
August 11? The day we got listed?

259
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,929
Destroy all the research documents inside.

260
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,098
And there's something I have to tell you.

261
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,977
Remember your girlfriend
back in university? What was her name?

262
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,396
The mean one? Yu-ri.

263
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,397
Right, Yu-ri!

264
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,441
I'm the one who went to Wolmido with her.

265
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,445
I was reminded of her
because this feels like the Apollo Disco.

266
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,615
I'm sorry, buddy.
I wish you all the best, idiot!

267
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,538
Han Tae-sul, you…

268
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,380
Breaking news.

269
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,549
Air Koreana JH007 was scheduled to arrive…

270
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,302
-Mr. Han is on his way here.
-…at Incheon Airport from Saipan…

271
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,096
-…at 2 p.m. today.
-Come on.

272
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,183
But the control tower lost communication
with the aircraft at 1:53 p.m.

273
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,769
-He's on that flight.
-Fire Services has been dispatched…

274
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:06,064
-…in case the plane crashes.
-On that plane?

275
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,315
-The aircraft's location…
-What?

276
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,359
-…is currently being monitored.
-Why is he running late?

277
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,280
-The CEO of Quantum & Time, Han Tae-sul…
-Nonsense!

278
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,241
-…is one of the confirmed passengers.
-What?

279
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,053
Time's up.

280
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,097
Let's get ready.

281
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,034
You'll die without any safety equipment.

282
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,494
Really?

283
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,913
Then I can see you again.

284
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,959
The plane will crash!

285
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,294
No.

286
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,546
I won't let that happen!

287
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,425
The CEO of Quantum & Time, Han Tae-sul,
who was in critical condition,

288
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,677
regained consciousness this morning.

289
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,596
On the 15th of last month,

290
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,183
CEO Han Tae-sul managed to fix
Air Koreana JH007

291
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,935
when it was about to crash
due to an electrical problem

292
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,897
inside the flight deck
while making its way

293
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,732
to Incheon Airport from Saipan.

294
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,402
-He saved the lives of 261 passengers.
-The authorities believe it was caused…

295
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,779
-…by a bird strike.
-We're seeing…

296
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,699
countless social media posts
wishing him a quick recovery.

297
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,035
His nicknames on the internet included

298
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,662
"Sexy Brainiac"
and "Engineering Heartthrob."

299
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:54,375
CEO Han Tae-sul plans to move back home
and keep receiving medical treatment,

300
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,545
but Quantum & Time is refusing
to give detailed comments

301
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,549
on his current condition,
which is only sparking more curiosity.

302
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,761
CEO Han Tae-sul,
who had been in critical condition

303
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,763
since the plane crash last month,

304
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,683
miraculously regained consciousness
and was discharged today at 12 o'clock.

305
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,186
He took the world by storm
with the launch of Q20.

306
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,814
-But the company's ambition…
-You can go in now.

307
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,732
…now faces a crisis.

308
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,735
Quantum & Time is going to hold
a conference this August.

309
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,071
It is unclear
whether CEO Han will attend or not.

310
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,449
-But sources say that he will…
-Hurry, this way.

311
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,035
-…work from home until he recovers.
-It's not that heavy.

312
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,081
The authorities believe
the JH007's electrical problem

313
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,208
was caused by a bird strike,

314
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:39,963
a collision between an airborne animal
and the aircraft.

315
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,591
They're examining
the black box recordings at the moment.

316
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,604
I told them not to use that photo.

317
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,650
Go to our PR team's office
and rip that photo to pieces.

318
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,735
Hey, Bong-seon.

319
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,363
You must be disappointed.

320
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,950
My Maybach and Range Rover
could've been yours.

321
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,535
No, sir.

322
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,453
No?

323
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,248
You fool.

324
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,669
"Dear CEO Han Tae-sul."

325
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,753
Goodness.

326
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,591
Lee Hae-na, a first grader
from Nakmin Elementary School,

327
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,342
wants to marry me when she grows up.

328
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,887
What do I say in my reply?

329
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,139
How about this?

330
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,643
"Dear Hae-na.
By the time you can get married,

331
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,147
my telomeres would be so short

332
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,400
that my cells probably
wouldn't be able to divide anymore.

333
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:46,029
So I suggest you find
someone with healthier cells."

334
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,907
-Come again?
-You don't get it?

335
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,034
Then how about this?

336
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,494
"Dear Hae-na. By then,

337
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,289
I'll start receiving my pension."

338
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,042
Good one, right?

339
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,175
Why did you turn it off?

340
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,178
What's wrong?

341
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,848
You punk, you're sulking again.

342
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,017
Is this because of the Wolmido incident?

343
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,560
I shouldn't have told you.

344
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,356
I didn't even hold her hand. Trust me.

345
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,242
"Board Resolution.

346
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,161
If CEO Han Tae-sul

347
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,706
continues to harm the company's…"
What is this?

348
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,125
It was approved when you were dead.

349
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,753
When I was dead?

350
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,546
I said you were declared brain-dead.

351
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:50,259
Hey, I was just getting some rest
because I was exhausted

352
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,470
after saving 261 precious lives,

353
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,056
and the board tried to oust
the founder of the company?

354
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,684
This is why I begged you
to attend the board meetings.

355
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,728
Why do you keep causing trouble?

356
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,355
What trouble did I cause?

357
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,775
Did the plane crash because of me?

358
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,193
Why did you go to Saipan?

359
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,404
-To get some air.
-Without a word?

360
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,697
Why do I have to tell you?

361
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,666
Risperidone, amisulpride,
diazepam, zolpidem.

362
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,209
I'm not an idiot.

363
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,670
You drug addict, listen to me.

364
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,755
Things are different now.
The company has grown.

365
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,424
Be more responsible!

366
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,552
The livelihoods of 100,000 people
depend on you,

367
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,637
so stop taking those pills
and get therapy.

368
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,848
What if I don't?

369
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,183
Tae-san's dead.

370
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,103
You bastard.

371
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,022
It's been hard for me too.

372
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,607
I know you and Tae-san were close.
That day--

373
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,818
Hey, shut up and get lost.

374
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,778
Stop taking pills and get therapy.

375
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,613
If not, I can't help you anymore.

376
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,534
Han Tae-sul,
can you please snap out of it?

377
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,369
You weren't like this.

378
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,787
I was always like this.

379
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,915
You can act all messed up,
but I know you're better than this.

380
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,168
You risked your life
to save all those people.

381
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,836
Not everyone can do that.

382
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,171
Are you kidding me?

383
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,381
I don't care if they died or not.

384
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,967
All I did was fix what was broken.

385
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,761
That's all. Who cares?

386
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,239
It's been a month
since the accident took place.

387
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,532
How have you been?

388
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,285
Pretty okay.

389
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,997
Do you have trouble sleeping
or get flashbacks of the accident?

390
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,665
No, I don't.

391
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,335
How much sleep did you get last night?

392
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,213
I didn't sleep last night.

393
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,423
-Why not?
-I couldn't fall asleep.

394
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,926
Seo-jin.

395
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,679
Stop interrogating me
and just prescribe me some pills.

396
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,729
I can't just give you
a prescription anymore.

397
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,357
The company wants your counseling reports.

398
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,527
"The company"?

399
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,738
I think you're forgetting something here.

400
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,907
I'm the CEO of that company.

401
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,617
Mr. CEO,

402
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,745
you have to stay for the full session

403
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,831
for me to write this report.

404
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,165
"Report"?

405
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,750
Hold on.

406
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,628
Does that mean you're spying on me?

407
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,381
Please sit down, Mr. CEO.

408
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,716
I want us to be clear
about this one thing.

409
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,303
You dumped me. Right?

410
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,975
You secretly went to the Maldives
with that sexy idol singer.

411
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,393
That's why I dumped you.

412
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,103
Precisely.

413
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,987
Do you still see things?

414
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,155
Nope.

415
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,159
Promise me you'll prescribe me
those pills if I cooperate.

416
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,537
Tell me about your brother.

417
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:09,208
Your relationship with him
and how you felt about him.

418
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,463
I don't remember.

419
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,259
I heard the two of you
didn't exactly get along

420
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,511
before he passed away.

421
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,180
You guys had a big fight.

422
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,640
What happened?

423
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,560
Nothing happened. Let's stop here.

424
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,061
Just give me those pills.

425
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,189
They're only a temporary fix.

426
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,193
What was the last encounter
with your brother like?

427
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,321
Do you…

428
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,990
regret what happened that day?

429
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,873
Tae-sul!

430
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,709
Tae-sul!

431
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,051
CONGRATULATIONS
QUANTUM & TIME LISTED ON NASDAQ

432
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,552
Your hard work has paid off.

433
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,430
You just need to get rich now.

434
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,809
Congratulations.

435
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,771
Tae-sul!

436
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,149
Tae-sul!

437
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,778
Tae-sul!

438
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,531
I'll make it quick. Tae-sul!

439
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,325
-Hold on.
-You can't go in.

440
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,535
Tae-sul!

441
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,330
I'm his brother.

442
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,041
Just a second. I'm his brother.

443
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,876
Don't we look alike?

444
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,003
-Hold on.
-You can't go in.

445
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,921
Let go of me.

446
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,674
I told you that I'm Tae-sul's brother.

447
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,801
It's okay. I'm sorry.

448
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,054
-Tae-sul.
-What is it?

449
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,306
Sorry. It's an emergency.

450
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,186
I saw them.

451
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,938
Remember what I told you?

452
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,523
-Tae-san.
-I'm serious.

453
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,733
They were holding a suitcase--

454
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,819
Did you drink again?

455
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,115
A little. But that's not why
I'm telling you this.

456
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,950
Tae-sul. The director needs you.

457
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,952
Tae-san. How are you?

458
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,537
I'll be right in.

459
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,545
Stop rambling and go home.
I'll call you later.

460
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,672
-This is an important--
-This is important too.

461
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,965
It concerns you as well.

462
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,718
We're not the only ones in this world.

463
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,096
People who aren't from this world
are living among us.

464
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,097
Even now!

465
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,890
They're hiding somewhere, watching us.

466
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,225
Tae-san, please.

467
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,601
Enough of this crazy talk!

468
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:36,063
Listen to me. They're looking for you.

469
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,524
-Why are you doing this?
-Believe me, please.

470
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,609
They're looking for you.
They'll keep coming.

471
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,403
Who's coming? And from where?

472
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,946
That's not important. Remember--

473
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,657
All right, let's hear a few words
from Mr. Han Tae-sul,

474
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,784
who we're all so proud of.

475
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,161
Mr. Han.

476
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,079
Mr. Han?

477
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,247
Did you hear that?

478
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,084
My company got listed today
and we secured some investments.

479
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,420
-Tae-sul--
-You're a shareholder too.

480
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,884
Take this. I'll call you tomorrow.
Let's talk then.

481
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,845
-Come on. Take it.
-This isn't about money, you know.

482
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,056
It won't take long.
Just spare me five minutes.

483
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,142
I know you went through a lot,
but must I put up with this forever?

484
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,936
-I'm just--
-I'll repay you for everything, so--

485
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,939
No. I'm just so worried about you.
What if something happens--

486
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,650
Tae-san! If you really care about me,

487
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,778
drop this and just go home.

488
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,868
-Hey, let's step out for a moment.
-Seriously, enough!

489
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,745
-I'll explain outside.
-I'll call you!

490
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,664
-No, our phones are tapped!
-For God's sake!

491
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,970
Jeez.

492
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,140
Tae-sul.

493
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,978
Wait, Tae-sul. Tae-sul!

494
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,856
Tae-sul.

495
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,858
-Mr. Han.
-Tae-sul.

496
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,276
Say a few words.

497
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,713
Thank you. I'm truly grateful.

498
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,676
I couldn't have made it this far

499
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,346
without the help I received
from so many people.

500
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:37,393
And I'd like to personally thank
one person in particular,

501
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,021
the chairman of the board,
who's right next to me.

502
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,398
Please give him a big hand.

503
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,597
Are you all right?

504
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,433
Yes, I'm fine.

505
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,717
Got the counseling report. Well done.

506
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,844
Make sure you attend
the remaining sessions.

507
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,597
I expect to see you
at the management meeting tomorrow.

508
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,003
Who in the world is that?

509
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,382
Are you insane?

510
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,593
What's wrong with you?

511
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,263
Come with me.

512
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,640
Come on, you punk!

513
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,517
Bong-seon! Wait a second.

514
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,190
Let go of him. I think I know him.

515
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,277
Are you all right?

516
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,115
The plane will crash!

517
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,494
It's you.

518
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,371
The copilot on that flight.

519
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,874
What happened? Who did this to you?

520
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,836
The Control Bureau.

521
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,880
Are you

522
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,800
on their side?

523
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:17,970
What?

524
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,599
That was not a bird.

525
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,268
I saw it.

526
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,061
What exactly did you see?

527
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,236
The suitcase.

528
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:35,904
What?

529
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,202
We're experiencing some turbulence
at the moment.

530
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,581
Please return to your seats
and keep your seat belts fastened.

531
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,419
What's that?

532
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,808
A suitcase?

533
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,365
What is that?

534
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,326
Is that a man?

535
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:22,719
Tae-san.

536
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,390
Tae-san!

537
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,918
You punk. There should be more.

538
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,381
You're not blind, right?
Then take a good look.

539
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,300
Can't you see? 30,000 won is missing.

540
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,844
-I didn't take it.
-You little rat.

541
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,346
Don't hit me, please.

542
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,348
Shut your mouth, you little thief.

543
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,101
I didn't steal it.
You collected all the cash yourself.

544
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,937
-I know nothing about it.
-Jeez, this punk.

545
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,647
I really know nothing about it.

546
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,195
You little…

547
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,700
Hey.

548
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,786
Tidy up everything before you leave, okay?

549
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:37,044
GOOD FORTUNE

550
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,517
It's not 30,000 won.

551
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,894
It's 50,000 won.

552
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,026
Come on. Money doesn't grow on trees.

553
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,695
I'm struggling to pay my rent here
and pay off my debt.

554
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,533
I told you that I'll send it.

555
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,827
Jeez. Okay, got it.

556
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,247
How's Go-eun?

557
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,791
Again?

558
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,669
Okay.

559
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,046
Yes! I said okay.

560
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,967
I'm doing fine here,
so just worry about yourself.

561
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,637
Yes, bye.

562
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:36,603
Damn, I'll never get out of this hellhole.

563
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,655
Those damn stray cats.

564
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,205
You scared me.

565
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,916
What are you doing?

566
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,878
Can't you speak Korean?

567
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,592
Are you Chinese?

568
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,845
Are you Japanese?

569
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,235
Please don't kill me.

570
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,825
Food.

571
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,251
-Police.
-Are you the police?

572
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,379
A suspicious-looking woman
just came to this restaurant I work at.

573
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,090
Please calm down and give us more details.

574
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,801
She speaks Korean,
so I don't think she's a foreigner.

575
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,095
But she's a bit weird.

576
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,765
Give us more details
of what she looks like.

577
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,644
I think she's wearing pajamas.

578
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:02,564
And no shoes. She showed up
with a suitcase and nothing else.

579
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,815
And she's…

580
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,278
No way.

581
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,801
-The 911th draw generated…
-Keep eating.

582
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,844
-…sales of 89.3 billion won.
-I'm just going to watch this.

583
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,430
The total prize was 21.1 billion won.

584
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,932
There were ten winners in total,

585
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,768
and each winner received 2.11 billion won.

586
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,814
In 2020, Lollo accumulated

587
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,732
809.4 billion won in total.

588
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,025
Congratulations, everyone.

589
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,488
I envy those lucky rascals.

590
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,243
The draw has begun.
The first lucky number is five!

591
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:04,126
Let's find out the second lucky number.

592
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,086
The second number is 21.

593
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,300
Let's check the third lucky number now.

594
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,177
Twenty-two.

595
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,014
It's the number right after 21.

596
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,307
Number 22.

597
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,102
-The machine is still running.
-Eight?

598
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,229
Now, I wonder
what the fourth number will be.

599
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,773
The next number is eight.

600
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,448
-Is this from last week?
-Now…

601
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,658
We'll unveil the fifth lucky number.

602
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,035
-What will it be?
-It's 18.

603
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,080
It is 18.

604
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,629
Now, let's find out the sixth number.

605
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,007
THE 912TH DRAW

606
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:58,889
Is it 38?

607
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,309
It's 38.

608
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,313
Now, we'll draw the bonus ball
for our second prize.

609
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,029
Ten?

610
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,867
It's ten.

611
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,578
The 912th draw…

612
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,956
-How did you know?
-CEO Han Tae-sul…

613
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,001
who had been in critical condition
since the plane crash last month,

614
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:31,671
miraculously regained consciousness
and was discharged today at 12 o'clock.

615
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,674
He took the world by storm
with the launch of Q20.

616
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,427
-But the company's ambition…
-How did you guess those numbers?

617
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,845
…now faces a crisis.

618
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,222
-Han Tae-sul.
-Quantum & Time is…

619
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,224
going to hold a conference this August.

620
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,226
It is unclear
whether CEO Han will attend or not.

621
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,977
But sources say that he will…

622
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,738
What was that?

623
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,076
What?

624
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,958
Where did she go?

625
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,675
What in the world is going on?

626
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,711
You're up.

627
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,010
My suitcase.

628
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,386
Look, it's right there.

629
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,113
You suddenly passed out.

630
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,620
Here. I believe
you enjoyed this yesterday.

631
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,164
Peel it before you eat it.

632
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,791
It tastes even better.

633
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,626
Here.

634
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,848
What were you doing?

635
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,684
Running away?

636
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,652
Is there anything else you need?

637
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,738
If not…

638
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,949
Can you have a look at this?

639
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,416
Han Tae-sul.

640
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,333
What?

641
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,963
Han Tae-sul of Quantum & Time. Call him.

642
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,738
-Sir.
-What?

643
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:29,868
Here it is.

644
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,591
Thanks. Did they hand it over right away?

645
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,510
Yes, they handed it over
as soon as I said you asked for it.

646
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,012
Tell them I said thanks.

647
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,514
But they did ask why you needed it.

648
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,727
I was just curious.

649
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,104
That's what I told them.

650
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,399
-Good job. Go home.
-I'll get going, then.

651
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,567
Bye.

652
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,537
12 MILES TOWARD GYEONGSANGNAM-DO
16,525 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL

653
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,341
Gimpo.

654
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,303
Sir!

655
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,728
Sir, where are you going?

656
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,606
Bird-watching.

657
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,191
But, sir,

658
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,610
the VP asked me to make sure
you attend the meeting.

659
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:31,448
Hey, have you ever been in a plane crash?

660
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,158
It's extremely traumatizing.

661
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:36,119
It's hard for me
to even be around people now.

662
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,205
Even my doctor said
I need some alone time.

663
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,123
You know?

664
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,750
-I do know, but--
-See you later.

665
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,795
Grab a bite or something.

666
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,922
All right. Have a safe trip.

667
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,407
SEUNG-BOK

668
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:43,079
THE MEETING'S STARTED. WHERE ARE YOU?

669
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,048
Do you regret what happened that day?

670
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,010
Enough. Just give me those pills.
How many times must I ask you?

671
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,638
You're just trying to avoid it,
but it won't help you in any way.

672
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,892
I'm saying this because
I'm worried about you as your friend.

673
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,145
You'll ruin yourself.

674
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,860
I'm sure your brother
wouldn't want to see you doing this.

675
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,863
Please.

676
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,657
Relax and open up
when you're here at least.

677
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,742
"Regret"?

678
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,119
Do I regret it?

679
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,334
I do.

680
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,003
Since that day,

681
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,633
there hasn't been a single day
that I didn't think about it.

682
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,719
When I'm eating, taking a shower,

683
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,056
when I'm driving
or even lying in bed at night,

684
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,807
it pops into my head.

685
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,312
He died on the spot.

686
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,690
The body was quite damaged,
so you might not recognize him.

687
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,388
-Tae-san.
-He had this backpack with him.

688
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,099
Is this your brother's?

689
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:25,032
KIMCHI RAMYEON

690
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,988
I shouldn't have been so harsh that day.

691
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,824
I shouldn't have kicked him out.

692
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,370
I should've at least
given him a warm send-off.

693
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,997
I should've called him right away.

694
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,000
I should have said,

695
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,504
"He's my brother,"
proudly in front of everyone.

696
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,715
That's what I should have done.

697
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:27,637
I laugh and chat with strangers
as if they're my best friends,

698
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,263
but as for my brother,

699
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,517
I never even had a chance to thank him.

700
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,729
Had I known that would be the last time…

701
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,607
If I knew…

702
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,405
I'd do anything

703
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,659
to go back to that day, even just once.

704
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:53,579
But I can't.
I know that it can't be undone.

705
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,874
I just…

706
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,503
I just wish he could come back.

707
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,714
That's all. I miss my brother.

708
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,801
I miss him like crazy.

709
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,887
What do you expect me to do?

710
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,722
Just get over it

711
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,516
and move on?

712
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,393
It's easier said than done.

713
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,645
How's that even possible?

714
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,440
So, please…

715
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:26,779
Just prescribe me those pills.
Help me, Seo-jin.

716
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,699
This pain is killing me inside.

717
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,096
We love our customers!

718
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:56,142
This is customer service agent Lee Eun-ji
at Quantum & Time.

719
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,643
You can talk now.

720
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,646
I need to speak to Han Tae-sul.
It's urgent.

721
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,942
Ma'am, do you mean you have
a complaint to bring to our attention?

722
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,111
No, I need to speak
to Han Tae-sul directly.

723
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,779
I understand, ma'am.

724
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,658
However, I cannot transfer this call
to our CEO at the moment.

725
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:16,412
I'll transfer you to the customer service
so you can leave your feedback.

726
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,125
Hello, this is Han Tae-sul
of Quantum & Time.

727
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,169
Han Tae-sul?

728
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,716
Quantum & Time is always waiting
for our customers' precious feedback.

729
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,219
Listen to me carefully.
There are people who are watching you.

730
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:35,181
Whether it's a suggestion or a complaint,

731
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:39,143
we're here to listen to everything
you have to say.

732
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,187
Please leave your message after the beep.

733
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,773
They're coming to get you.

734
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,483
Run. If you're caught, you'll die.

735
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,486
They're a lot scarier than you think.

736
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:49,403
Don't

737
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,238
trust anyone.

738
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,505
REPORTER KIM GYU-HYEON

739
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,052
Hello, Mr. Kim.

740
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,223
I'll tell you the details in person.

741
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,726
No.

742
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,395
I haven't told the company yet.

743
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,648
Right, by that intersection.

744
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,650
I know where it is.

745
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,237
Then I'll see you later.

746
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,130
DO NOT OPEN THE SUITCASE!
(CALL HAN TAE-SUL!) TAKE IT AND RUN?

747
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,051
The suitcase.

748
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,220
Do not open the suitcase.

749
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,946
Don't open it.
If you do, we're all doomed.

750
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,075
Just wait for me.

751
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,410
We'll meet soon,
so do whatever it takes to--

752
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,371
All right. Thank you very much
for your feedback.

753
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,208
Your words of encouragement
and constructive feedback

754
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,711
are always immensely helpful
to all of us at Quantum & Time.

755
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,380
We hope you have an excellent day.

756
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,882
We love all our customers.

757
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,427
Han Tae-sul?

758
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,179
Han Tae-sul.

759
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,302
Hey, can you smile a little?

760
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,181
Are you that excited?

761
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,561
How did you prepare all this?
It must have cost a lot.

762
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:11,355
Thank me later.
Repay me for the rest of your life.

763
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,524
Okay, I will.

764
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,163
What's the password?

765
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,790
-Your birthday.
-Why, of all things?

766
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,709
All of my passwords are your birthday.

767
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,862
Tae-san. Was that really you?

768
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:24,613
-This is impossible.
-What's with all these photographs?

769
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:27,241
-Did you get married?
-I don't even know this woman.

770
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:29,201
You married someone you don't even know?

771
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,870
Who are you? Are you a ghost?

772
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,956
Please spare me. Just this once!

773
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:37,459
It's the Control Bureau.

774
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,044
What?

775
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,380
-We have to go.
-Go where?

776
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,923
They'll kill you since you were with me.

777
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:43,966
I'm not going.

778
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:45,718
Unbelievable.

779
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,553
Illegal immigrants running around
in broad daylight?

780
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:49,305
I'm not going to die today.

781
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,514
Did you bring it?

782
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,891
Then you should've called me.

783
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,811
-I'm from the Immigration Office.
-Who are you guys?

784
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:57,313
What's important

785
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,897
isn't "where."

786
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,483
-Who are those guys?
-The Control Bureau.

787
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,944
Those guys are ruthless.

788
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:07,823
Once they catch you,
you'll never get back home alive.

789
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,827
If you want to know what's going on,
just do as I tell you.

790
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,329
Come with us.

791
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:14,872
"Run."

792
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:17,583
Let me go. Let go of me, you punks!

793
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,921
