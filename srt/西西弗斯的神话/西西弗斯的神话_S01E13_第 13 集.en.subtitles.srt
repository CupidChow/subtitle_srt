1
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,978
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:09,569
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

3
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:17,160
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

4
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,667
Han Tae-sul!

5
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,545
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

6
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,797
What's going on?

7
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,299
The Control Bureau is here.

8
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,472
So they're openly working together now?

9
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,189
Seo Won-ju?

10
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,109
You remember me now?

11
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,115
I'm disappointed.
I've never once forgotten you.

12
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,285
I'm sorry. You weren't exactly memorable
back in school.

13
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,288
I thought you'd remember me,
even just vaguely.

14
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,082
We were quite close.

15
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,919
I'm not sure about that.
I don't recall us being close.

16
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,588
As I recall, you just followed me around.

17
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,301
It's all in the past,
so don't be so hurt by it.

18
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,306
Anyway, I think
we have a lot of catching up to do.

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,226
So you should've come alone, you prick.

20
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,356
Fire a warning shot.

21
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,695
Snipers! Keep your head down.

22
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,323
-Should we move in, sir?
-No, I'll go in alone.

23
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,576
Yes, sir. The snipers will cover you.

24
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,952
What's the plan again?

25
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,621
You go in and talk to them.
When they're cornered,

26
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,873
we'll take care of them.

27
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,711
So where are you?

28
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,882
Where are you now?

29
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,804
He hung up.

30
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,728
HONESTY, DILIGENCE, SERVICE

31
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,777
Tae-sul.

32
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,741
Where are you hiding?

33
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,912
Are you here?

34
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,415
Here I come.

35
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,668
I'm coming to get you!

36
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,212
When I catch you, you're so dead!

37
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,049
I sound scary.

38
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
Hide well.

39
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,473
Hey, we won't get caught today, right?

40
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,767
-No idea.
-What?

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,852
If we get rid of Seo Won-ju fast,
we'll win.

42
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,855
But what if someone's there waiting for us
to catch us?

43
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,232
That's possible.

44
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,816
Let's get out of here first.

45
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,768
That bastard!

46
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,437
Targets spotted in Class 1-3.

47
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,147
Class 1-3!

48
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,194
How come you remember him only now?
You've met him.

49
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,780
How was I supposed to remember
something from years ago?

50
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,573
Right, you lack social skills.

51
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,784
-Damn it.
-Han Tae-sul.

52
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,041
Watch out!

53
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,305
ARCHIVE ROOM

54
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,988
Oh, boy.

55
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,658
Tae-sul!

56
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,078
You really haven't changed one bit.

57
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,125
When you consider someone
a loser or an idiot,

58
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,046
you wipe the person from your memory
not to waste your brain capacity.

59
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,924
To you, everyone else is like an extra.

60
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,177
Passerby One, Two, Three.

61
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,721
Student One, Two, Three.

62
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,558
But you know what?

63
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,896
There might be someone that matters
among them.

64
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,400
Someone you're meant to be with…

65
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:06,115
or an evil bastard who will end the world.

66
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,162
That's why

67
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,625
you should never mistreat anyone.

68
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,795
That's my point.

69
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,760
Sir, what would you like us to do?

70
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,971
We just stick to the plan.

71
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,809
-This is insane.
-Why did we come in here?

72
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,937
This was the only place we could hide.
It was all blocked.

73
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,190
-You went to this school!
-Yes, I did.

74
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,610
I transferred schools a lot,
so I got confused.

75
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,448
Darn it.
I don't think we can pull this off today.

76
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,036
Calm down, Seo-hae.

77
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,080
If we wait, we'll get caught.

78
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,222
-Are you ready?
-No.

79
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,183
Yes.

80
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,688
They can't kill you,
so they won't shoot right away.

81
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,356
I'll go out first.

82
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,990
You'll go out first, then what?

83
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,785
What's wrong?

84
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,788
It's just odd.

85
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,707
What is?

86
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,710
Why aren't they coming in?

87
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,142
They can just barge in,
but they're waiting.

88
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,102
Why?

89
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,896
Good point.

90
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,901
Could it be…

91
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,990
Maybe last time…

92
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,701
We came out.

93
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,497
That's why they're waiting.

94
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,790
Because future events shouldn't change.

95
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,104
Seo-hae.

96
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,407
I always wanted to do this
at a moment like this.

97
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,121
-Hey, it's not the time to--
-Shush.

98
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,708
Just a moment.

99
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,296
Stay still for a moment.

100
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,148
Year 2020…

101
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,611
October 28.

102
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,949
Current time is…

103
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,245
-It's 15:50.
-What are you doing?

104
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,207
Current time, 15:50.

105
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,212
Well, there was a man named
Stephen Hawking.

106
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,257
He's best known for his discovery
called "Hawking radiation."

107
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,092
You see, black holes…

108
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,303
Never mind.

109
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,639
Anyway, he secretly organized a party

110
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,685
under the premise
that time travel was possible.

111
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,439
Then he wrote an invitation
and spread it all over the country.

112
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,817
And he threw a party at that exact time.

113
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,070
He thought that
if there really was a time machine,

114
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,907
people would see the invitation
in the future and come to the party.

115
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,955
You mean, someone in the future
might see this and come to your rescue?

116
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,749
Yes.

117
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,755
Why aren't they coming out?

118
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,597
Excuse me.

119
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,648
HAN TAE-SUL

120
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,693
GANG SEO-HAE

121
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,327
HELP US

122
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,914
"On October 28, 2020, at 15:50.

123
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,001
Han Tae-sul and Gang Seo-hae,
trapped here and in danger.

124
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,544
Help us."

125
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,339
It's done.

126
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,758
And? Did anyone come?

127
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,051
What?

128
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,308
-What was that?
-Hey, what's going on?

129
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,810
We're trying to find out…

130
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,939
Gosh, what is happening?

131
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,898
Hush.

132
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,406
Our snipers are all… We're getting sniped!

133
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,790
It's dangerous. We should leave.

134
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,096
I guess it worked.

135
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,182
-What?
-Someone came to help us.

136
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,826
It changed. I wonder who came.

137
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,288
Sir.

138
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,460
Mr. Han!

139
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,808
Who's this?

140
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,728
Come to the east exit.
I'll wait for you in the car.

141
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,537
What? That's my car.

142
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,509
Get in.

143
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,636
Bong-seon?

144
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,480
-Yeo Bong-seon.
-Sir.

145
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,397
Gosh, you…

146
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,112
Hey, what happened?

147
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,991
Bong-seon!

148
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,581
Bong-seon, are you all right?

149
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,083
I'm fine.

150
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,761
Does this use electricity?

151
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,847
No, kerosene.
It's smuggled into the country.

152
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,689
Why are you helping us?

153
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,442
Because of the war.
How will you stop it from happening?

154
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,284
Why did you try to save Han Tae-sul
at PEXCO?

155
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,829
-Me?
-You told him to get down

156
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,414
just before the shot was fired.

157
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,083
I got shot and fell
into a vegetative state.

158
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,419
I've been pretty pissed about it
ever since.

159
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,880
So tell me the truth or go home.

160
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,052
Come on, tell me.

161
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,599
I found a letter.

162
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,604
It said I should go to Busan
and that Tae-sul would be sniped.

163
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,275
It also said the past and the future
keep on repeating

164
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,360
and that I must stop the war this time.

165
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,778
Who sent the letter?

166
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,406
Someone you can trust?

167
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,160
Who sent the letter?

168
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,038
Me. I found it in my grave.

169
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,125
-Where?
-At Mapo Hospital.

170
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,128
North of the Hangang Bridge,
near the army camp.

171
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,130
Are we good now?

172
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,007
Then why did the war break out again?

173
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,012
I'll stop it this time.

174
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,931
"This time"?

175
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,180
I don't know what's going on
in the countryside.

176
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,933
Metropolitan areas
are under Sigma's control.

177
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,069
The thugs that were after you
also work for Sigma.

178
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,448
They won't let you get on the uploader.

179
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,786
Then what do we do?

180
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,998
Follow Subway Line 5
all the way to Achasan Station.

181
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,916
There's an uploader bunker underground.

182
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,972
I'll show you the underground passage
to the uploader.

183
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,640
But why?

184
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,686
Because this girl saved my boss.

185
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,815
-You're not coming with us?
-No.

186
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,735
-Why not?
-Because I'm dead there.

187
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,030
I couldn't protect Mr. Han.
Going back would be pointless.

188
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,322
But still.

189
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,533
Some jerks will tail you.

190
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,452
I'll stall them, so hurry.

191
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,576
Everyone came down here
when the war broke out.

192
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,162
In emergencies,

193
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,582
subway stations were used
as air raid shelters.

194
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,961
"Emergencies"? What does that mean?

195
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,841
Like when a disaster hits unexpectedly.

196
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,175
What's an air raid shelter?

197
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,179
Oh, it's like our bunker.

198
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,889
I see.

199
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,386
Most of them would have died.

200
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,723
They had nothing to eat or drink.

201
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,122
What about you?

202
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,041
I had some earlier.

203
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,523
No.

204
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,986
The radiation level is too high downtown.

205
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,873
Want to hear a story?

206
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,132
It was a long time ago,
before you were born.

207
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,011
When your mom wanted to have a kid,

208
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,764
I was against it.

209
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,183
Seriously?

210
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,561
Even just taking care of myself
felt like a struggle.

211
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,482
So having children and raising them…

212
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,194
I didn't think I could do it.

213
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,246
But my whole world changed
the moment you were born.

214
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,582
No matter how stressed I am,

215
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,377
the moment I hear you call me Dad,

216
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,171
all my stress melts away.

217
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,680
You taught me
the true meaning of happiness.

218
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,520
Thanks to you, I can smile every day.

219
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,861
You've given me such joy, but I haven't
been able to do the same for you.

220
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,071
I've always felt so bad about it.

221
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,908
Cops get paid peanuts, you know.

222
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,370
What does that mean?

223
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,374
It means the pay is low.

224
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,543
I see.

225
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,674
When I couldn't do the things
other parents do for their kids,

226
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,884
I felt heartbroken.

227
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,055
"What if she does poorly in school,
just like me?

228
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,975
What if she can't get a job
and feels dejected?

229
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:38,356
What if she shows up with some weirdo
one day and says he's her boyfriend?"

230
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,442
Come on.

231
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,528
I was always worried.

232
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:53,747
But I guess I was much happier back then
despite all the worries.

233
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,217
It's all my fault.

234
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,263
Why is it your fault?

235
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,727
Seo-hae, promise me one thing.

236
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,188
What?

237
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:24,486
Even if you get there safely,
do not meet Han Tae-sul, ever.

238
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,871
Let's go.

239
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,569
ACHASAN

240
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,580
He said it's underground.

241
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,874
If we get surrounded there,
we're finished.

242
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,627
It's over there.

243
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,382
We should spread out.

244
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,442
Dad!

245
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,954
Dad, are you all right?

246
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,705
I'm fine. Just go!

247
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,144
I'll meet you there!

248
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,932
If it weren't for the war,

249
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,018
we wouldn't be in this mess.

250
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,609
Go.

251
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,778
I said, go!

252
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,049
Let's go.

253
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,463
-Are we at the right place?
-Not sure.

254
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,149
There's water here.

255
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,693
Dad, what is this place?

256
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,487
A swimming pool.

257
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,996
Let's get out that door.

258
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,084
-There's no water to drink out there.
-Don't let it get to you.

259
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,508
So I said, "Han Tae-sul!

260
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,018
Is it the girl or the world?"

261
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,939
Then that idiot broke into tears.

262
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,818
Seo-hae. Gang Seo-hae!

263
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,659
Hands up! Put your hands up!

264
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,327
Drop your guns!

265
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,123
-Drop your guns!
-Drop your guns.

266
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,231
Look who's here.

267
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:21,869
I used to hate crowds and traffic jams.

268
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,038
There are no cars in the future.

269
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,707
Hey, are you all right?

270
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,169
Don't mind me.

271
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,048
I won't last long. I wasn't feeling well
when I was crossing over.

272
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,136
When I woke up,

273
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,515
I learned the country no longer exists
because of the war.

274
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,601
It happened so suddenly.

275
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,855
At first, I resented you a lot.

276
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,440
I'm sorry.

277
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,027
Later on, I found out

278
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,739
that you fought against Sigma

279
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,826
and kept me on life support.

280
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,166
So I retraced your steps.

281
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,086
From your home and office

282
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,255
to your elementary school.

283
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,383
That's where I found it.

284
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,886
Your message.

285
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,227
Sir.

286
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,812
Yes.

287
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,649
Don't fight.

288
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,445
You can't beat Sigma.

289
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,074
I saw graves. Yours and that girl's.

290
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,203
I know.

291
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,913
Run away.

292
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,167
This time, I won't die.

293
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,754
You know,
there's no problem that I can't solve.

294
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,806
Sigma knows everything.

295
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,810
What will happen,
even when and where it'll take place.

296
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,897
Gosh.

297
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,025
Bong-seon.

298
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,446
Do you really want to beat Sigma?

299
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,698
Of course.

300
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,076
Even if you'll die?

301
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,963
What's this?

302
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,512
Use it as a last resort.

303
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,473
Open it when you have no other option.

304
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,860
How beautiful.

305
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,574
I wanted to see this again.

306
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,455
Mr. Han.

307
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,630
I'll be off, then.

308
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,883
Bong-seon.

309
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,598
Bong-seon! Hey!

310
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,354
Bong-seon.

311
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,231
Bong-seon!

312
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,528
Darn it.

313
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,934
Jae-sun, Mom wants you to bring
a lot of gochujang and doenjang.

314
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,145
They're at Korean supermarkets.

315
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,480
But they're expensive here.

316
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,315
All right.

317
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,402
-Did you buy the eyebrow razor yet?
-Oh, right. Not yet.

318
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,654
Hey! I told you to bring it.

319
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,906
I can't find it here.

320
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,201
What do girls here use
to shape their eyebrows?

321
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,037
And get me every cushion compact
and lip tint that you see.

322
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,581
Okay.

323
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,583
You're coming, right?

324
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,460
Yes, of course.

325
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,045
When are you coming?

326
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,094
-Are you staying there because of her?
-No, I have to do something.

327
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,846
Jae-sun, can I give you a word of advice?

328
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,181
No, don't.

329
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:56,060
Since I'm a girl too,
I can tell she has no feelings for you.

330
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,311
I never asked.

331
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,897
She's not interested in you at all.
You know, right?

332
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,943
You keep hitting on her,
so she gets awkward and feels bad for you.

333
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,237
That's why she can't
flat out turn you down.

334
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,656
You're making her uncomfortable.

335
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,493
Gosh, you little brat.
Can you stop being so blunt?

336
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,705
So stop bending over backward for her.
Just come to the US, you idiot.

337
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,416
Something might happen there.

338
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,960
What? How do you know?

339
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,921
The Embassy warned
all the American citizens to return

340
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,381
because there may be a war.

341
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:32,721
Mom's here. If she sees your face,
she'll make a huge fuss again.

342
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,182
Book a flight right away
and send me a screenshot.

343
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,184
If you don't, you're so dead.

344
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,686
CALL ENDED

345
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,274
-What happened? Reinstall the program.
-Can you check this?

346
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,110
-Check for a short circuit.
-Yes, sir.

347
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,997
It worked last time.

348
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,000
They're making a huge fuss about this!

349
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,964
Mr. Han got rid of all the relevant data.

350
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,051
But you guys made this with him,
so you can do it again!

351
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,220
There are 70 of you!

352
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,100
Tae-sul did this all by himself.

353
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,353
He designed it all on his own!

354
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,274
When he was only 15, with a pencil!

355
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,822
What? What's your problem?

356
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,576
Why don't you do it yourself
if you need it so urgently?

357
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,123
Stop yelling. Just do it yourself.

358
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,834
Tae-sul.

359
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,420
Oh, maybe you can't.

360
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,269
Hey, why are you here?

361
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,729
Sir.

362
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,622
It's been a while.

363
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,374
I came to see you one last time.

364
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,963
QUANTUM & TIME FAILS
HIGH MOLECULAR TRANSPORT EXPERIMENT

365
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,007
Did you drink?

366
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:02,681
I first met Tae-sul
when I was preparing for my postdoc.

367
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,436
I overheard the professors' conversation
in the lab.

368
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,981
They talked about a student
who got in through early admission

369
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,819
and whose dissertation was approved
as soon as he got in.

370
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,237
You see,

371
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,159
it took me eight years.

372
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,706
Do you know what is
the best decision I've ever made?

373
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,962
Working with Tae-sul when everyone else
hated him and was jealous of him.

374
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,800
Believing him when no one else took him

375
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,594
seriously.

376
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,014
What are you trying to say?

377
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,227
I'm not trying to say anything. I'm just…

378
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,063
a little exhausted.

379
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,496
Come to think of it,

380
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,875
you and Tae-sul almost got married.

381
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,881
I don't think
I can handle anything anymore.

382
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,510
I don't want to do anything.

383
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,139
Do you want to beat Tae-sul?

384
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,149
Last time, you asked me
what was really happening.

385
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,945
If you want to know, come with me.

386
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,031
But remember.

387
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,075
Once you decide to come with me,

388
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,620
there's no going back.

389
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,928
OCTOBER 28, 2020
AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, SNIPERS…

390
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:20,944
Mr. Han.

391
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,363
I'll be off, then.

392
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,866
Bong-seon! Hey!

393
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,332
GANG DONG-GI

394
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,091
Hello?

395
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,637
I looked up that man, Seo Won-ju.

396
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,014
He's not even in the system anymore.

397
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,432
I see.

398
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,560
So I asked our information division
to look further into it.

399
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,856
He'd applied for registration of
an artist name for copyright registration.

400
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,359
What's that name?

401
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,029
It's Seo Gil-bok.

402
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,365
GANG DONG-GI

403
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,868
Seo Gil-bok?

404
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,829
SEOUL GANGBUK POLICE STATION

405
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,916
MOST TRUSTED POLICE
FOR SAFEST GANGBUK

406
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,129
Jeez, he's here again.
He practically lives here.

407
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,394
The victim said
you shouldn't expect any leniency.

408
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,562
STATEMENT
SEO GIL-BOK

409
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,440
So you're a painter.
That's why you're so expressive.

410
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,609
Your comments are so catchy.

411
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,946
Hey, think about how stressed out
the victim must be.

412
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,198
You posted malicious comments
for seven years!

413
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,326
It's more than 5,000 sheets of A4 paper,
you jerk!

414
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,620
Think about celebrities' suicides.

415
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,831
Posting malicious comments is like murder!

416
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,293
I'm sorry.

417
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,088
"I didn't like the way
Han Tae-sul looked at me."

418
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,049
Oh, do you know him personally?

419
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,432
-Yes.
-Hey.

420
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,475
Even I know who Han Tae-sul is.

421
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,936
Everyone in the country does.

422
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,523
Do you have any mental issues?

423
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,443
Go get a medical certificate.

424
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,570
It could be a mitigating factor.

425
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,655
I'm sorry.

426
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,954
You've been posting hate comments
about him since 2013.

427
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,582
I see you were released
with a warning in 2016.

428
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,753
This time, Han Tae-sul said
no leniency whatsoever.

429
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,632
So this case will go to trial.
You might get a jail sentence.

430
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,511
If you don't want that,
submit a letter of apology.

431
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,941
I apologize.

432
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,612
I've been continuously posting
malicious comments

433
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:13,158
about Quantum & Time CEO,
Mr. Han Tae-sul, since 2013.

434
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:18,789
I didn't stop even after being caught
and released with a warning in 2016.

435
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:24,086
I did it because of my personal grudge
and misunderstanding.

436
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,130
I apologize for damaging

437
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:31,301
Mr. Han's reputation
and hurting his feelings.

438
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,220
Mom!

439
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,930
I regret my actions.

440
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:39,768
I was jealous of Mr. Han Tae-sul
for becoming so successful,

441
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,979
wealthy, and popular at such a young age.

442
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,109
That's why I posted
such malicious comments about him.

443
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,863
I regret my petty, childish actions.

444
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,078
I sincerely apologize.

445
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,665
Unlike Mr. Han Tae-sul,
I did poorly in school.

446
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,625
I apologize for my incompetence.

447
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,712
I apologize to the judge

448
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,090
as well as to my mother.

449
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,971
I should have known
how to fix a falling airplane

450
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,598
and how to make a lot of money
like Han Tae-sul does.

451
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,934
I'm sorry for not being able to do so.

452
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,229
I'm truly sorry.

453
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,524
I'm sorry that

454
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,403
I'm not as capable as Tae-sul is.

455
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,865
Those eyes…

456
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,326
Don't look at me like that.

457
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,997
I'm sorry for being born in this world.

458
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,128
I'm sorry things didn't go as planned.

459
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,590
I'll make sure everything goes
without a hitch from now on.

460
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,803
It's okay.
We were going to lose them soon anyway.

461
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:02,976
I'll always win in the end,
regardless of how the process changes.

462
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,899
Wait, is the package
supposed to arrive today?

463
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,738
My gosh, I've always wanted to do it.
It'll be fun!

464
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,364
What's the date today?

465
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,910
-It's October 29.
-Right.

466
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,956
You see,

467
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,586
I thought this misery would end if I died.

468
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,633
So I looked up ways to do it.
Hanging yourself is the cheapest.

469
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,219
Funny, right?

470
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:42,140
Rich folks can buy guns or drugs
and die gracefully.

471
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:46,019
But poor people have to think about
the cost to die.

472
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,567
Although I had decided
to take my own life,

473
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,031
I was still scared.

474
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,248
HARDWARE STORE

475
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,629
CHARCOAL BRIQUETTES

476
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,143
So I was going to

477
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,231
just give up if I came across

478
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,943
even just one person

479
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,238
who told me not to die.

480
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,742
In hindsight,

481
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,496
if anyone tried to talk me out of it
back then…

482
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,082
Your total is 17,500 won.

483
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:54,713
Then maybe the world
wouldn't have fallen to pieces.

484
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:10,896
How's it going?

485
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,481
It's strange.

486
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,191
What is? Everything's working fine.

487
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,820
The downloader is open,
but no one has come in the past 48 hours.

488
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,780

489
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,785
Oh, I see one coming.
What are the coordinates?

490
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,333
It's here.

491
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,252
-Our store.
-What?

492
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,216
What's going on?

493
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,387
No idea.

494
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,506
What?

495
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,135
-This is it?
-I guess so.

496
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,570
-Wait. Let's not open it.
-Go away.

497
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:55,375
Everything from the future is mine,
you punk.

498
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,680
Gosh!

499
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,727
What is this?

500
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,271
Damn…

501
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,919
Don't look at me like that.

502
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,564
I'm sorry.

503
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,692
I really am.

504
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,862
I'm truly sorry.

505
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,610
Damn it…

506
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,428
Hello?

507
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,973
Didn't you get my message?

508
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,851
I was preoccupied with something.

509
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,145
Your painting's been just sold.

510
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,272
What?

511
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,279
What painting?

512
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,739
Remember your self-portrait? That one.

513
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,910
Didn't you say the exhibition was over?

514
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,538
Yes, but someone contacted us

515
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,582
wanting to purchase it.

516
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,421
Hello?

517
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,548
Hello?

518
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,427
Hello?

519
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,433
Gil-bok?

520
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,439
This person is famous.
I'm sure you know him.

521
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,028
Who is it?

522
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,741
You know Quantum & Time CEO, right?
Mr. Han Tae-sul.

523
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,456
Hello? Are you there?

524
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,786
Han Tae-sul.

525
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,208
Seo Won-ju, hands up and on your knees.

526
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,670
What?

527
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,931
Hands up and on your knees!

528
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,015
What the hell?

529
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,478
I'm sorry, Tae-sul!

530
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,356
I was out of my mind
when I posted those mean comments.

531
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,403
-What's he talking about?
-No idea.

532
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:37,615
Hey, Tae-sul.
I heard you bought my painting.

533
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,033
I bought it to find you.

534
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,910
Let's finish this quickly.

535
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,878
Wait!

536
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,172
We have no hard feelings towards you now,

537
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,759
but we must do this because of the things
that you'll do in the future.

538
00:59:57,468 --> 01:00:01,598
Tae-sul, this is a prank, right?

539
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,475
You know,
I even wrote a letter of apology.

540
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,644
I'll never do it again. I'm really sorry.

541
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:19,532
What's wrong?

542
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,203
-I just saw something weird.
-What did you see?

543
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,789
Something's wrong.

544
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,550
Give me that. I'll do it.

545
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,809
-Tae-sul, please…
-Shut it.

546
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:55,777
JAAE HOSPITAL
INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM

547
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,208
This is Jaae Hospital.
You wanted to bring me here?

548
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,919
-There's a gathering.
-What gathering?

549
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,838
Simply put, it's like

550
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:19,258
a gathering of people
who have control over Korea.

551
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,677
Something like that.

552
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,846
-At this hospital?
-Yes.

553
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,184
I clearly warned you

554
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,437
that there's no going back.

555
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:35,858
Follow me.

556
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,188
What are you doing? Come on.

557
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,626
My point exactly!

558
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:39,005
Prime Minister Kim!
Stop worrying about what others think.

559
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,131
It shows.

560
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,591
Yes, sir.

561
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:45,178
We'll just argue a little
and reconcile at the end.

562
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,096
They already know the plan.

563
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,891
Jeez. I should have become an assemblyman

564
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,185
and made you the Prime Minister instead.

565
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,313
Goodness.
You insisted on taking it up yourself

566
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,607
because it's the highest position!

567
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,735
I didn't know
I'd have no real power to do anything.

568
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:13,998
Wait, isn't that the Prime Minister?

569
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,833
Yes.

570
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,879
The Minister of Economy and Finance.
The Minister of Land.

571
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:23,674
I thought Assemblyman Kim
and Assemblyman Hong were on bad terms.

572
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,348
Jeez.

573
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,143
Oh, come on.

574
01:03:56,749 --> 01:04:00,127
-Let's see it.
-Come on!

575
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,129
-Hey, come on.
-I need a break.

576
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,723
PACIFIC SAURY

577
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,897
We must make sure
no one's looking at the sky

578
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,025
when the missile hits.

579
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,572
They have to be busy fighting that
they won't even know what killed them.

580
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,615
Like fireworks.

581
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:33,494
You see them going off, but no one knows
where they're coming from.

582
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:38,291
Boom.

583
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,252
I'll make sure everyone here
can watch it in the best seats.

584
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,797
You missed it last time
because you were all in jail.

585
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,591
So you have to see it this time.

586
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:50,887
What missile?

587
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:57,184
Does this mean
everything Tae-sul said was true?

588
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,812
Who's that guy?

589
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:02,982
Sigma.

590
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,571
Dr. Kim, I was waiting for you.

591
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,364
I'm sorry I'm late.

592
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,035
-Is everyone here?
-Mr. Park isn't here yet.

593
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,495
He's been expelled.

594
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,832
Dr. Kim, I see that you brought a friend.

595
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,835
-What's his name?
-He's Eddy Kim.

596
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,339
Right, Eddy Kim.

597
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,133
Eddy, you're the one making the uploader.

598
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:31,969
I'm honored to meet you.

599
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,180
Welcome him with a big hand.

600
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,658
140 JUNGGYESAN, SEOUL
GANG SEO-HAE

601
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,744
Do we have to take this to her?

602
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,871
Can't we tell her to come pick it up?

603
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,499
I need to see what's happening!

604
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,334
The temperature is lower today.

605
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,919
You clueless brat.

606
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:07,004
With his visit to the US fast approaching,

607
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:11,509
the President held a cabinet meeting
and asked every minister

608
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:15,054
-to make sure all government affairs…
-Jeez, shut up.

609
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,597
Same thing over and over.

610
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:24,438
Hey, Bingbing.
Want to hear an interesting story?

611
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,821
People say that
every public official is a thief.

612
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,157
The Prime Minister,
the Deputy Prime Minister,

613
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,618
all the ministers, and assemblymen.

614
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,788
Actually, it's true.

615
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:46,460
They're all from the future.
The advance team.

616
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:51,882
We were in jail,
so we managed to stay healthy.

617
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:55,678
Those bastards were all behind bars.

618
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,973
They're all despicable thieves,
I'm telling you.

619
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,933
Gosh.

620
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,439
What?

621
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,859
It's just that you said they're thieves.

622
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:13,112
That's right, those thieves.

623
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:16,782
Everyone.

624
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:21,162
There's something you need to see.
Put it on.

625
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:48,064
-That's Tae-sul.
-Stay seated.

626
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,525
I told you. There's no going back.

627
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:55,613
That's me.

628
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,079
I really thought I was going to die
at that moment.

629
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,332
Oh, boy.

630
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,965
Tae-sul, why are you doing this to me?
Please stop.

631
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,550
Be quiet.

632
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,267
Are you all right?

633
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:49,041
That's enough, Mr. Han. All right?

634
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,176
Well, how have you been?

635
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,566
That time, I was just too flustered.

636
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,027
I think you blabbered on about
how you found me,

637
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,070
but I can't remember.

638
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,574
Why are you all quiet?

639
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:26,453
Just because.
It's nice to hear your voice.

640
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,499
Can I ask you how you found me?

641
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,793
Your painting.

642
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:37,298
I'm the one who bought
the only painting of yours that sold.

643
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,259
I see!

644
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:44,430
They gave me your address as soon as
I said I wanted to donate some money.

645
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,347
Oh, I see.

646
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,058
But don't get the wrong idea.

647
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:51,145
I didn't buy it because I liked it.
And the reviews were bad.

648
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:55,524
Tae-sul, who are you talking to?

649
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,609
Be quiet.

650
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:01,197
I showed your painting
to various art critics

651
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,034
to see how good you are as an artist.

652
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,996
I have their feedback on my phone now.
Want to hear it?

653
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,706
You're probably curious.

654
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,339
I'll read them out to you one by one.

655
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,051
"Frankly,
it isn't a well-executed painting.

656
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:25,763
The quality of the canvas
and the oil paint is top-notch,

657
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:28,140
but the brushstrokes look pretty clumsy.

658
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:32,269
Using high-quality supplies is important,
but this artist needs more practice."

659
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,479
You need more practice.

660
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,148
Are you talking about me?

661
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:39,944
"The colors are too simple.
The painter doesn't know how to use light.

662
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,487
He's not a professional artist.

663
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,198
He's probably just someone
with an art degree."

664
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:46,492
Stop. That's enough.

665
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,244
"The concept isn't bad.

666
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,329
He depicted his imagination in detail."

667
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,540
But it's not your imagination.
You painted what you saw.

668
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,751
So this one doesn't count.

669
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,755
There's more. "It's kitschy."

670
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:02,174
Well, that means it's not good.

671
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,053
"I'm not trying to belittle the work,
but it looks like something

672
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,848
you'd see at a barbershop."
He's clearly belittling it.

673
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,268
"I think he worked hard on it."

674
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,519
It's the only compliment.

675
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,980
I said, stop.

676
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:20,526
What's going to happen if I shoot you now?

677
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,361
Will the future you disappear?

678
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:27,491
You can't shoot me.
That's why I'm here, alive and well.

679
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,118
Oh, really?

680
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,288
Then let's see what happens.

681
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,290
I heard you met your brother.

682
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,341
Let me put it simply.

683
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,220
If he's hiding somewhere in his past,

684
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,223
his body must be somewhere in the present.

685
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:01,608
I'm sure my boys are
taking good care of him.

686
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,487
If you spare me now,

687
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,781
you can go back to the past and bring him,

688
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,743
like you did with that girl.

689
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:13,370
What's wrong?

690
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:16,874
Right, there's another reason
you shouldn't kill me today.

691
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,083
If you shoot me now,

692
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,045
the girl will disappear as well.

693
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,213
Can you really do it?

694
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,720
I mean, are you sure you're ready?

695
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,974
To part with her and never see her again?

696
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:40,064
You still have lots of time left.
You need to say a proper goodbye.

697
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:44,985
As for me,
you can kill me next time you see me.

698
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,073
Tae-sul.

699
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,909
Tae-sul, don't listen to him.

700
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:54,328
This is our only chance.

701
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:58,957
If you shoot me now,
you'll be left with nothing.

702
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,336
Everything and everyone you love
will vanish.

703
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,923
So today…

704
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,635
Just protect me, all right?

705
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:17,309
Hey, what's going on?

706
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:41,458
Seo-hae, let's just leave.

707
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,835
What?

708
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,713
Let's just leave.

709
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:51,176
My gosh!

710
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,099
What are you doing here?

711
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:01,061
My, look at that.

712
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,482
That jerk, Sigma, looked so sly
even when he was young.

713
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,568
What are you doing here?

714
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:12,281
Me? Oh, to deliver this package.

715
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:13,782
Bingbing, hand it over.

716
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,952
We downloaded it an hour ago.

717
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,705
It came to our store.

718
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:24,751
Well, I was going to just ignore it.

719
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,378
But I figured

720
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,631
it would be important to you, so…

721
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:33,469
What is it?

722
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,744
What happened?

723
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,921
Seo-hae, no.

724
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:52,297
Move.

725
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,841
-Seo-hae.
-I said, move.

726
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:56,760
-Calm down.
-Move, now.

727
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:58,679
Calm down, please.

728
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,099
What did you do to my dad?

729
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:04,893
-What?
-What did you do to my dad?

730
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:08,063
Seo-hae, put the gun down. Put it down!

731
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:09,565
What did that bastard say?

732
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,192
Why are you acting like this?

733
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,904
Let's just go. There's another chance.

734
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,699
No. There isn't another chance.

735
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:23,453
Hey, you two!
You're all playing into Sigma's hands.

736
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,165
Damn it.

737
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,209
Hey, drop your gun.

738
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,047
-What are you doing?
-Drop it!

739
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,343
If that prick dies,
I'll never see my family again.

740
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:39,553
Shut up.

741
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:40,679
Stop!

742
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:41,930
You stop!

743
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,476
Do you really think
he will spare your brother?

744
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,689
He killed my dad.

745
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,986
See? What did I tell you?

746
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:58,864
In just a few days,

747
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:02,743
a war will break out
and kill 50 million people,

748
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:05,662
yet everyone only cares
about their own families.

749
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:10,292
This is why there can never be
a fair society in this country.

750
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,629
-Right?
-Yes, totally.

751
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,339
You're absolutely right, sir.

752
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,488
Seo-hae, listen to me.

753
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:41,823
Please.

754
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:44,618
Not today.

755
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:47,454
Please,

756
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,581
Seo-hae.

757
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,463
Please.

758
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,184
Was it today?

759
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,692
Please, Seo-hae.

760
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,652
Seo-hae, where are you right now?

761
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,447
I didn't do anything.

762
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,031
She left of her own accord.

763
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:09,911
I remember now.

764
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,414
Let go of me, will you?

765
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:15,625
Seo-hae's going to die
because of Han Tae-sul.

766
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,794
You'll die if you go alone.

767
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:20,881
Everything that happens from now on
will be as I planned.

768
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,925
Why don't you try fighting that?
You bastard.

769
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:27,846
-Don't go. Please.
-I'm sorry, Seo-hae.

770
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:32,934
