Hey! Get up. Are you okay?

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,051
You shouldn't be…

7
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,518
What? Why does he have
a photo of Tae-sul and me?

00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,896
Hey.

Who are you?

00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,368
What?

-What's that sound?
-What's wrong with you?

If you want to die,
don't drag others with you!

66

-What happened?
-Why did you do that?

67
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,256
Why did you do it?

68
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,261
I see you've become reckless just because
you've been doing well these days.

69
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,679
What will you do tomorrow?

70
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,098
The higher-ups will sue you
for breach of duty!

What will you do, you jerk?

72
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,980
-What is it?
-Sir, look at the news!

73
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,525
The strongest country in the world,
the United States, has been attacked.

74
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,611
Korea's stock market is at risk as well.

00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,781
The composite stock price index
dropped by 12.01% today.

It's the biggest drop ever.

77
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,162
-As many as 621 sectors of stocks dropped.
-What happened?

78
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,207
-Another 591 sectors dropped in KOSDAQ.
-What's going on?

79
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,586
-Only 11 sectors have risen in the market.
-What should we do?

80
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,630
-This is insane.
-It's complete chaos.

81
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,475
This is perfect!

82
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,979
I hope things will continue like this!

85
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,040
I really respect you, sir.

86
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,921
I'm really grateful that I met you.

87
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,257
You're my savior.

88
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,842
I promise

89
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,054
to serve you well from now on.

90
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,393
-Help me meet someone.
-Who?

91
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,313
Kim Han-yong. He's an IT investor.

92
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,564
IT?

93
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,485
That bubble burst already.
There's nothing to gain from it.

94
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,783
It burns easily.

95
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,831
Money burns easily.

96
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,917
But people don't.

97
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,086
What?

98
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,677
Hello, Mr. Kim.

99
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,179
I'm Kim Dong-hyeon. Please have a seat.

100
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,018
I don't know what this is about,

101
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,188
but I came here
because you kept begging me to meet you.

102
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,649
I'm busy.

103
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,693
If you have something to say,
make it quick.

104
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:23,993
Sir!

105
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,288
He's a bit picky about food.

106
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,747
What are you doing?

107
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,934
I heard your wife is sick.

108
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,566
Was it ALS or something like that?

109
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,752
-What is it?
-Medicine.

110
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,216
She could die any moment.
There's nothing to lose.

111
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,138
Who the hell are you?

112
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,850
Mr. Kim, is this some kind of a joke?

113
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,020
No, of course not.
Sir, there's no cure for ALS.

114
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,772
-It's incurable.
-Not yet.

115
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,655
Try it and contact me if you need more.

116
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,699
Let's go.

117
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,802
That crazy jerk.

118
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,058
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

119
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,728
You must be tired.
You should've just gone home.

120
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,868
-Mom.
-Honey.

121
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,622
Mom!

122
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,293
Honey!

123
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,881
Mom, can you recognize me?

124
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,467
It's me, Seo-jin.

125
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,886
Oh, my gosh.

126
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,514
Honey!

127
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,783
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

128
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,663
Han Tae-sul.

129
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,831
Invest in him.

130
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,542
Invest in your name with my money.

131
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,795
Why do you want to invest in him?

132
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,383
He has to make something for me.

133
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,181
The medicine will lose its effect
in about a month.

134
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,311
If you obey me, I'll give you more.

135
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,815
-Keep in touch.
-I will.

144
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,496
Hold on.

145
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,624
-Excuse me.
-I'm his brother. Just a second.

146
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,768
Take it.

147
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,644
This isn't about money, you know.

148
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,855
It won't take long.
Just spare me five minutes.

149
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,025
I know you went through a lot,
but must I put up with this forever?

150
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,736
-I'm just--
-I'll repay you for everything, so--

151
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,530
I'm just so worried about you.
What if something happens--

152
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,366
Tae-san! If you really care about me,

153
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,327
drop this and just go home.

154
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,168
-Hey, let's step out for a moment.
-Seriously, enough!

155
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,378
-I'll explain outside.
-I'll call you!

156
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,839
-No, our phones are tapped!
-For God's sake!

157
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,768
Jeez.

158
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,063
Tae-sul.

159
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:32,319
Wait, Tae-sul. Tae-sul!

160
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,988
Tae-sul.

161
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,118
Tae-sul.

162
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,703
Tae-sul, wait.

163
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,672
Darn it.

164
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,934
You. It's you, right?

165
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,185
You!

166
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,063
It's you, right?

167
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,399
Who are you?

168
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,863
What have you done to Tae-sul? Huh?

169
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,744
You!

170
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,415
Let go of me!

171
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,376
Let me go!

172
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,381
What have you done to Tae-sul?
Let go of me!

173
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,017
It's been listed now, so you'll earn
at least ten times the investment.

174
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,352
Gosh!

175
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,979
This is amazing.

176
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,231
Aren't you happy?

177
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,234
Come to think of it,
I've never seen you smile.

178
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,240
My life has been so successful
since I met you.

179
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,451
Thank you.

180
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,453
The CEO recruitment will go well.

181
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,371
By the way,

182
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,458
my wife is pregnant.

183
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,377
They said it's a boy.

184
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,512
I've always wanted to ask.

185
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,140
How do you know all this?

186
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,358
Gosh, the view is amazing.

187
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,320
Enjoy it when you can.

188
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,282
Everything's going to burn down soon.

189
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,368
What?

190
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,788
Everyone's going to die soon.

191
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,540
Everyone.

192
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,847
SEPTEMBER 20, 2020, PRESENT DAY

193
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,037
QUANTUM & TIME'S CEO HAN TAE-SUL
YOUNG FOUNDER, RICHEST STOCK MILLIONAIRE

194
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,471
Hello? Honey.

195
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,057
Listen to me carefully.

196
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,936
Go to the airport right now
and leave the country.

197
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,479
Take Seo-u with you.

198
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,232
I don't have time to explain. Hurry.

199
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,444
I'll leave soon too.

200
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,865
I have to tell Han Tae-sul

201
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,992
not to meet him.

202
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,910
Okay.

203
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,398
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

204
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,077
-Let's talk for a minute.
-Okay. Hang on.

205
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,249
This is a facial recognition program.

206
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,961
It was made for the military.
It can even find faces from 20 years ago.

207
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,715
But I can't find him.
Who in the world is he?

208
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,884
A millionaire? A politician?

209
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,637
I'm sure he's some kind of big shot.

210
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,431
Why can't I find him?

211
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,602
I got it.

212
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,149
Tae-san took a bad photo.
Look, it's totally out of focus.

213
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,984
That's why I can't find him.

214
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,073
Would he be in his Forties? His fifties?

215
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,866
Or his thirties?

216
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,036
-He's definitely a man, right?
-Tae-sul.

217
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,789
Hey. How tall does he look to you?

218
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,709
How would I know that?

219
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,587
Let's say he's about 175cm.

220
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,469
Go over there.

221
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:58,478
The PEXCO conference hall,
the second-floor maintenance room,

222
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,398
the bathrooms and the lobby.

223
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,526
There are 317 security cameras in total.

224
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,196
Even if I only check the day
of the shooting, it's 24 hours.

225
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,701
What is it? Are you worried
about the Control Bureau?

226
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,287
Let those jerks come.

227
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,542
Didn't you say
you have something to tell me?

228
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,757
What is it?

229
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,053
What's the matter?

230
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,806
Stop this. It's too dangerous.

231
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,268
If the Control Bureau comes, stay hidden.

232
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,063
I'm pretty influential,
so they can't harm me that easily.

233
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,192
That's why I was so confident.
We'll be safe for now.

234
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,068
-It's not that.
-Then what?

235
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,987
I meant looking for Sigma.

236
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,781
-What about it?
-You almost died last time.

237
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,241
Me? When?

238
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,326
Come on.

239
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,246
What's with you?
You said you wanted to stop the war.

240
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,497
We must catch him then.

241
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,167
If you don't make the uploader,
there won't be a war.

242
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,169
That's why they're after you.

243
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,379
Just don't do anything.

244
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,797
Okay. Fine.

245
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,342
Speaking of the uploader,

246
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,676
where is it?

247
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,597
You used that to come here.
We can just go find it.

248
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,474
-I don't know.
-Try to remember.

249
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,184
Don't change the subject.

250
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,146
I'm going to find Sigma
even if I have to risk my life.

251
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,857
If we fail, there will be a war again.

252
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,692
Then everyone is going to die.

253
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,527
Don't you care about that?

254
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,737
No.

255
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,783
How can you be so selfish?

256
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,326
I didn't do anything.

257
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,246
If I were you, I'd stay hidden
until everything is resolved.

258
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,540
I told you I'd protect you.
Don't you feel guilty?

259
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,792
Why would I feel guilty?

260
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,127
Everyone will die because of you,
even my mom--

261
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,046
I didn't do anything yet!

262
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,635
That jerk's been hovering around me
the whole time.

263
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,512
He mocked me behind my back.

264
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,515
He's fooled me and my brother
all this time.

265
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,268
So how can I forgive him?
I'll catch him and--

266
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,645
This is exactly what he wants you to do.

267
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,774
I said I'd help you find your brother,
not Sigma.

268
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,484
-It's the same thing.
-No, it's not!

269
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,236
If you keep going after Sigma…

270
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,078
You'll die if you do.

271
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,920
October 31.

272
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,048
It's the day you die.

273
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,971
There's a lot of time left.

274
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,993
I got him!

275
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,795
HUGE HEDGE FUND INVESTMENT LOSS
DUE TO U.S. TERROR ATTACK

276
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,683
Your fan's here. Give him a wave.

277
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,726
Sis!

278
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,897
My mom and Go-eun arrived safely.

279
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,358
Are you going somewhere?
I'll give you a ride.

280
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,112
You said the war breaks out
on October 31, right?

281
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,989
What do I do now?

282
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,450
-I told you to leave.
-Come on.

283
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,078
-I can't just leave, you know.
-Leave.

284
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,538
Hang on.

285
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,921
Be careful, okay?

286
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,049
You could've died last time
if I hadn't saved you.

287
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,969
So be careful.

288
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,853
What?

289
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,324
Jeez, that lunatic.

290
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,131
Right. Here.

291
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,389
It's the man who was with Sigma.

292
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,057
His name's Kim Dong-hyeon.

293
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,851
He started as a fund manager

294
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,311
and became a millionaire.
He's a legend in the field.

295
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,690
Remember the 9/11 attacks in 2001?

296
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,984
He made it big with put options back then.

297
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,570
Put options…

298
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,989
To put it simply,

299
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,784
he already knew
that something huge was going to happen.

300
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,915
So you're going to find him
and ask who Sigma is?

301
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,961
No, he died in an accident last week.

302
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,562
Be quiet!

303
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,151
Just remember one thing
when you question them.

304
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,029
"Everything they say is a lie."

305
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,365
How are illegal entrants
different from us?

306
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,453
They have information.
They're from the future.

307
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,749
-Right.
-If they say it'll rain tomorrow,

308
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,502
you can't tell if it's true or not.

309
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,587
That's their weapon.

310
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,674
You can't tell if they're lying.

311
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,384
I see.

312
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,724
What happened?

313
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,102
He was making such a fuss
that we had to tie him up.

314
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,392
It's an honor to have such a famous person

315
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,227
here with us.

316
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,939
You've grown a lot.

317
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,983
You too.

318
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,486
He's grown a lot.

319
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,198
Park Hyeong-do.

320
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,493
You were in a holding cell
after getting arrested for murder,

321
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,662
and avoided a nuclear war.

322
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,038
How lucky.

323
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,625
As for your family…

324
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,255
Wow.

325
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,048
She's pretty.

326
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,175
Should we pay her a visit?

327
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,726
If you cooperate with us,

328
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,687
we won't play any cheap tricks.

329
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,188
Jeez.

330
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:47,405
We're working in the same field, you know.

331
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,241
Cut me some slack.

332
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,168
Hey.

333
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,210
You.

334
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,339
I can

335
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,635
find your family too.

336
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,266
You jerk!

337
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,480
What about Han Tae-sul?

338
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,816
He's poking around here and there.

339
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,196
He drew a bit of attention
at the press conference.

340
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,950
If we act rashly,
people will start talking.

341
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,327
That's what he intended.

342
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,039
-What about the girl?
-She's still with Han Tae-sul.

343
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,083
We're still keeping an eye on them.

344
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,920
Leave Han Tae-sul alone for now.

345
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,590
What?

346
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,468
Nothing, sir.

347
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,515
I repeat. Leave Han Tae-sul alone.

348
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,517
We'll only keep an eye on him for now.

349
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,269
Get the girl instead.

350
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,774
Grab her when she's away from Han Tae-sul
and take her into custody.

351
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,109
That'll be all.

352
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,036
What?

353
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,476
I'm sorry I asked you to meet me
so suddenly.

354
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,978
It's all right.

355
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,442
Do you know who this person is?

356
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,696
He came to our house twice,

357
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,451
when we first moved here
and again last week.

358
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,911
-Last week?
-Yes.

359
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,999
Right there.
He sat there and argued with my husband.

360
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,545
After he left, my husband left saying
he needed to go somewhere.

361
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,297
And then…

362
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,262
Do you remember his name
or any other details about him?

363
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,555
Anything is fine.

364
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,474
No, I don't.

365
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,893
My husband didn't say anything about him.

366
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,063
It's all right. Take your time to think.

367
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,651
The painting.

368
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,278
"The painting"?

369
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,616
He gave us a painting
as a present when we moved in.

370
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,701
He said he painted it himself.

371
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,248
I covered it up because it looked awful.

372
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,180
That crazy jerk.

373
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,184
You wanted to know

374
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,686
what the future looks like, right?

375
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,900
He killed my husband, didn't he?

376
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,724
Why did we come here?

377
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,352
The painting.

378
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,774
It'll take at least a month
to draw such a huge painting.

379
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,736
He wouldn't have gone wandering around
when he's in hiding.

380
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,239
I'm sure he drew it where he was staying.

381
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,117
You can find where it is
with that painting?

382
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:07,373
See the Trade Tower over there?

383
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,334
And those four red lights?

384
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,005
That's the Finance Center.

385
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,424
From here, those two buildings
are the same height.

386
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,721
They're 229 meters and 206 meters.

387
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,432
He was looking up,

388
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,520
so the angle would be eight degrees…

389
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,355
Nine degrees?

390
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,265
Are you sure it's this building?

391
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,158
It's here.

392
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,618
Are you sure?

393
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,246
Probably.

394
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,834
Promise me one thing.

395
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,795
Don't do anything dangerous.

396
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,965
If you think something's going to happen,
hide behind me. Okay?

397
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,343
Hey. I'm good at that.

398
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,220
Don't joke around.

399
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,889
All right.

400
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,644
What? Hang on.

401
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,561
What is it?

402
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,701
It looks like it was never even touched.

403
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:14,959
No way.

404
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,158
That's the smell of oil paint.

405
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,077
Over there.

406
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,511
This is the right place.
He drew the painting here.

407
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,828
Hang on.

408
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,961
"Sigma."

409
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,132
Now I know what it means.

410
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,177
Sisyphus.

411
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,306
He is an eternal sinner
in Greek mythology.

412
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,645
He pushes a boulder up a mountain

413
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,939
only to see it roll down.

414
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,901
Then he pushes it up the mountain again,

415
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,612
and it rolls back down. Again and again.

416
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,867
He receives eternal punishment. Forever.

417
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,371
What was he punished for?

418
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,444
-That jerk!
-Darn it!

419
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,332
You jerk!

420
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,210
Hey!

421
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,099
You.

422
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,771
Hi.

423
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,817
You came to find me yourself?

424
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,903
You were taking too long.

425
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,452
Run, Tae-sul!

426
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,581
You jerk!

427
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,978
Seo-hae!

428
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,354
Hang in there.

429
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,688
What happened to Sis?

430
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,942
Why aren't you answering me?

431
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,819
She cut her palm.

432
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,530
And she has bruises here and there.

433
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,450
I gave her first aid,

434
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,827
and she's asleep now.

435
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,167
What are you doing?

436
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,128
I'm upset as well right now.

437
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,964
I can't understand
why she has to go through all this

438
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,925
just to save someone like you.

439
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,635
If you can't, don't.

440
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,011
You jerk.

441
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,307
-Stop.
-You stop.

442
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,227
She keeps getting injured because of you!

443
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,772
Hey. She risked her life to come here

444
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,774
to save her mother.

445
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,151
Do you think she'll even listen to me?

446
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,197
And talk to her yourself
instead of doing this to me like a coward!

447
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,490
You tell her.

448
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,659
I want to tell her too,

449
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,665
but she won't listen to me.

450
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,208
You don't know what that means.

451
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,210
I guess she doesn't want to listen to you.

452
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,256
Darn it.

453
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,110
HUGE HEDGE FUND INVESTMENT LOSS
DUE TO U.S. TERROR ATTACK

454
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:16,732
"Gang Seo-hae."

455
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,706
Look forward. Good.

456
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,708
Hold the handles tightly.

457
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,419
Good.

458
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,340
Seo-hae, you're doing great!

459
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,929
-Don't let go, Dad.
-I won't. I'm holding you.

460
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,097
-Don't let go.
-Okay. I won't.

461
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,107
Dad, you're lying, right? Come on.

462
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,693
No, I'm still holding on.

463
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,614
-Really?
-Of course.

464
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:06,949
I'm going to look back.

465
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,245
-Don't look back!
-You should've caught her!

466
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,288
-My goodness.
-Are you okay?

467
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,707
-You should keep looking forward.
-Does that hurt?

468
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,418
-Are you okay?
-It's okay.

469
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,047
I'm going to let go now.

470
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,924
-Okay.
-I'll let go now.

471
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,178
Good job.

472
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,015
You're doing great!

473
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,225
You're the best!

474
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,186
-Seo-hae, you're so good!
-She did it.

475
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,900
-You're doing great, Seo-hae!
-You're doing great!

476
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,118
Happy birthday, Seo-hae.

477
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,494
-My present?
-Yes.

478
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,204
Thanks, Mom.

479
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,122
Open it.

480
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,625
-It's a cell phone!
-Do you like it?

481
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,731
September 30.

482
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,443
SEPTEMBER 30, SUNDAY

483
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,947
It's her birthday today.

484
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,342
Happy birthday, Seo-hae.

485
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,896
Giddyup!

486
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,944
What a nice view.

487
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,367
I came here with my parents
when I was little.

488
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,037
I think the last time I came
was when I was nine.

489
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,873
I didn't get to ride this
because I was less than 140cm tall.

490
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,213
People had to wait two hours to ride this.

491
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,260
But now there's nobody here.

492
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,482
Shoot, Gang Seo-hae.

493
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,443
Shoot it.

494
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,376
Darn it.

495
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,331
What took you so long?

496
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,708
I went hunting.

497
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,642
Are you okay, Dad?

498
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,687
Yes, I'm fine.

499
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,023
You don't look okay.

500
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,526
Let me see.

501
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,152
It's fine.

502
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,863
-Let me see.
-Come on.

503
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,870
When did you get hurt?
Is it the gunshot wound from before?

504
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,207
Did you take antibiotics?

505
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,967
It's okay. I don't need it.

506
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:16,479
It's late. Where are you going?

507
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,815
To the hospital.

508
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,899
No!

509
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,236
It's too dangerous.
You can't go there on your own.

510
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,240
If I don't go and you die,

511
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,617
I'll be on my own anyway.

512
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,040
Seo-hae.

513
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,294
Wait. Gang Seo-hae!

514
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,995
One, two…

515
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:19,454
"Antibiotics."

516
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,049
Hands up!

517
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,433
Turn around!

518
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,145
No! Don't move!

519
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,564
You told me to turn around.

520
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,317
Should I turn around or not?

521
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,862
Turn around.

522
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,250
Hands up.

523
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,546
Where are the antibiotics?

524
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,217
My dad's hurt.
I'll leave quietly with the medicine.

525
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,762
Please.

526
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,975
The fridge behind you.

527
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,395
The second shelf.

528
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,535
Three pills a day.

529
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,252
Inject it into his vein.

530
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,673
Thank you.

531
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,679
No!

532
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,974
No…

533
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,008
Darn it.

534
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:31,521
Catch her!

535
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,591
Stop!

536
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,201
Pull back.

537
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,667
Gosh, that startled me.

538
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,297
My back hurts.

539
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,722
I slept all day.

540
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,408
What is this?

541
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,290
"Dear Seo-hae,

542
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,042
Happy birthday."

543
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,624
By the time you read this, I'll be dead.

544
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,295
Don't be surprised.

545
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,299
What you're looking at right now
is yourself.

546
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:51,015
Listen carefully.
There is something we must do.

547
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,602
Take the uploader and go to the past.

548
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,229
Save Han Tae-sul.

549
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,901
If he lives, the war can be stopped.

550
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,612
Only you can do this.

551
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,449
Protect him from Sigma.

552
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,094
Han Tae-sul?

553
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,930
Don't ever lose him.

554
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,768
Whatever happens, overcome it.

555
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,022
You can do it.

556
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,484
Please protect the person I love.

557
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,119
-You said you hate amusement parks.
-But it's your birthday.

558
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,288
Are you Sigma?

559
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:40,165
What will you do with Sigma?

560
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,836
I'll fix it since I ruined everything.

561
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,422
The girl or the world?

562
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:49,091
I'll walk out of here tomorrow afternoon.

563
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:53,470
You're not the CEO anymore.
You're nothing.

564
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,305
It seems like a normal hospital.

565
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:58,434
Basement Level Four.
Seo-hae is here right now.

566
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:00,894
I hear this shot makes you disappear

567
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:02,855
like a ghost.

568
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,402
