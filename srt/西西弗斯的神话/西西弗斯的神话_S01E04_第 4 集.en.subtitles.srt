AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,550
Look what I've got!

00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,866
"SPRING DAY"
BTS

4
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,098
Nice!

5
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,106
CHOOSE THREE FLAVORS

6
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,376
Thirty-eight centimeters…

7
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,006
ICE CREAM!

8
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,624
Did you find any batteries?

9
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,046
No, everything's taken already.

10
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,758
Same here. We should look somewhere else.

11
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,093
Okay.

12
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,928
I'll see you at Exit 2.

13
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:09,846
Okay.

14
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,709

16
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,072
Let's finish up quickly and go eat.

17
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,577
Hurry up.

18
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,376
What's your number?

19
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,253
Around 250,000.

20
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,509
We arrived pretty early.
Theirs are around 10,000.

21
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,389
Downloads are difficult,

22
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,392
so there's only a ten percent chance
of success.

23
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,729
And even if they come over,

24
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,773
half of them get caught
by the Control Bureau.

25
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,611
That means there's only
a five percent chance of surviving

26
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,112
and settling down in Korea.

27
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,949
But they still risk everything
to come over to this side.

28
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,535
Do you get it now?

29
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,414
Han Tae-san came here through that.

30
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:29,170
But on the way here,
something went wrong with the downloading.

31
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,385
Are you okay?

32
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,638
No.

33
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,391
It happens the first time.

34
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,685
Did he take the medicine?

35
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,063
-Tell him not to vomit in the van.
-Goodness.

36
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,401
All right. Stop it.

37
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,236
That's enough. Stop it.

38
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,866
I'm done talking, so give me the key.

39
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,788
Can I go there and watch them?

40
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,625
Them? What's there to see?

41
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,256
Fine. Have a look and give me the key.

42
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,841
Okay.

43
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,978
If Tae-sul does anything dumb,
just shoot him.

44
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:28,979
Yes, sir.

45
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,867
Hey.

46
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,537
-What?
-What is that?

47
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,998
-Atropine.
-Why are you using that?

48
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,543
They're taught to run
as soon as they arrive.

49
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,131
Why do they come only in their underwear?

50
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,218
They need to transfer the least amount
of information to prevent errors.

51
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,554
What's in that suitcase?

52
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,181
Stuff they want to bring.
Stuff that could be money.

53
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,559
You said they need
the least bit of information.

54
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,770
They can't come empty-handed.
They need money to survive.

55
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,148
Right. But…

56
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,818
What if someone's future self comes here?

57
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,946
Won't there be any issues
if it's the same identity and information?

58
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,993
Their bodies and memories get mixed.

59
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,954
And eventually, one side disappears.

60
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,500
Are they flirting or what?

61
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,467
But why are you taking all their stuff?

62
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,429
-Are you complaining?
-No, I'm not.

63
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,139
Do you have my phone?

64
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,309
-What?
-I'm just asking if you have it.

65
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,312
Yes. I have it. So what?

66
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,938
Nothing.

67
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,691
Hey, Hayby. Send my location to Seung-bok.

68
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,775
Location sent.

69
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,365
-We found him.
-Really?

70
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,117
Got it.

71
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,537
Han Tae-sul's phone is on.

72
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,788
He's nearby!

73
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,543
You're not supposed to inject
atropine in the neck.

74
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,669
It's for the thighs.

75
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,008
Hey! Go get him!

76
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,694
Hey.

77
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,576
Hey!

78
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,376
You idiot. Catch him at least.

79
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,419
Hurry up and get him!

80
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,389
It's the Control Bureau!

81
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,768
Darn it.

82
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,895
Let's go.

83
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,115
Hurry up!

84
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,326
That jerk.

85
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,664
ASIA MART

86
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,839
I have to get out of here.

87
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,179
Han Tae-sul.

88
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,223
Help me.

89
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,684
I know where your brother is.

90
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,687
-What?
-Han Tae-san.

91
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,025
I'll tell you where Tae-san is.
Just help me.

92
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,744
Get up. Come on.

93
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,212
How could she just run away by herself?

94
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,298
Hey. You really know
where my brother is, right?

95
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,759
You'd better not be lying.

96
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,804
What?

97
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,348
Darn it!

98
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,103
It's good to see you again, Mr. Han.

99
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,191
You're right. We should become friends.

100
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,822
Go!

101
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,576
-Get them!
-Hey!

102
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,931
Hey, it's an electric car.

103
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,439
Wait.

104
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,816
Damn it, it's stuck.

105
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,411
Get in. Hurry.

106
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,755
Hold on. The registration certificate.

107
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,007
The registration certificate.

108
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,219
Okay, 39572.

109
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,055
It's 39572.

110
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,683
I need the ID and password.

111
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,812
But I don't have that,
so I'll install an app first,

112
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,023
enter the VIN,

113
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,318
and log in through the manufacturer's
website database.

114
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,705
-Excuse me.
-"Sign in." It's not working.

115
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,666
Hang on. We don't have time,
so I'll make a new app.

116
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,710
Open the Amacs text editor.

117
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,135
The Perl script.

118
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,679
-Mr. Han.
-What?

119
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,973
-The woman.
-What?

120
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,519
That little…

121
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
People are watching. Put it away.

122
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,314
Catch her.

123
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,115
Hey! Stop fighting and come over here!

124
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,832
Come on. Work!

125
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,167
Why isn't it working?

126
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,092
Come on. Work.

127
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,510
It's working!

128
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,724
Go! Hurry!

129
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,394
"Go"? You want us to go?

130
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,855
-Hurry up!
-Get them!

131
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,773
"Go"? Darn it!

132
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,654
Get them!

133
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,956
Goodness. We finally got you.

134
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,214
Yes. We couldn't catch Han Tae-sul,

135
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,175
but we caught the girl who kidnapped him.

136
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,554
Okay. We'll bring her there right now.

137
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,438
Hi.

138
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,608
Hi.

139
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,735
Where did Han Tae-sul go?

140
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,279
I don't know.

141
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,489
Where did he go?

142
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,783
I don't know.

143
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,580
You're not going to talk?

144
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,791
Why did you approach him?

145
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,132
Tell me. Why did you approach him?

146
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,888
If you don't talk, I'll kill you.

147
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,475
I'm not going to die today.

148
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,562
That nonsense again?

149
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,858
All right. Let's see if that's true.

150
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,752
Didn't I tell you to hurry?

151
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,838
How could you just abandon me?

152
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,965
You ran away on your own too!

153
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,216
We're even now, then.

154
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,760
Come on.

155
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,580
I'm home.

156
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,967
Why haven't you eaten?
I'm already busy as it is.

157
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:32,851
All you have to do is press one button.
Why can't you do it yourself?

158
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,146
What does it say?

159
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,191
I can't read it.

160
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,526
Give me that.

161
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,323
Over 240? Before eating?

162
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,828
Mom, did you eat ramyeon again?

163
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,997
No, I didn't.

164
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,791
Mom.

165
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,502
The doctor told you to eat

166
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:02,214
only multigrain rice and vegetables
because of your complications.

167
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,260
But it tastes awful.

168
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,807
Don't be ridiculous.
Do you want to become blind?

169
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,974
Eat up.

170
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,229
I'm going to die anyway.

171
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,068
Then just starve to death!

172
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,822
Where are you going? You just got here.

173
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,408
I'm on duty today.

174
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,661
Son!

175
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,459
I'll see you later.

176
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,005
Whatever.

177
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,696
Lieutenant,
can't you just get automatic tickets?

178
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:10,907
The thing is,

179
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,161
a mutual friend of mine

180
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,372
won the lottery by choosing
the same numbers on ten tickets.

181
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,709
That's impossible. Come on.

182
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,712
It's true.
Lots of people won that way recently.

183
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,011
HOME

184
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,439
-Aren't you going to answer it?
-She always says the same thing.

185
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,192
"I can't see well." Stuff like that.

186
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,860
How is she these days?

187
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,530
Same as usual. She doesn't watch her diet.

188
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,200
I hate her.

189
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,704
Still, don't treat her like that.

190
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,041
You should do better, Hyeon-gi.

191
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,293
You'll regret it later
when your mother is gone.

192
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,711
Just like I did.

193
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,756
Be good to her while you can.

194
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,884
I will.

195
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,096
A robbery at 201, District A.

196
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,059
Thank you. Bye.

197
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,277
We're heading there.*

198
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,784
-Why is in this neighborhood?
-My goodness.

199
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,619
-What should we do?
-The cops are here.

200
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,079
It's okay. They're here.

201
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,331
-Excuse us.
-It's the cops.

202
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,625
What happened, ma'am?

203
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,628
Some guy appeared just in his underwear!

204
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,047
He must be a pervert!

205
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,465
Could he be a flasher?

206
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,551
Which way did he go?

207
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,972
That way!

208
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,932
It's so scary.

209
00:25:59,015 --> 00:25:59,849
Go.

210
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,559
-How can he do that?
-All right.

211
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,270
Please calm down.

212
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,480
When exactly did you see him?

213
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,607
I think it was about 30 minutes ago.

214
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,734
You said it was an hour ago.

215
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,987
-Oh, right.
-What did he do after that?

216
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,614
He just ran that way!

217
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,412
Did you find him?

218
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,956
No.

219
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,562
Oh, my gosh!

220
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,527
Excuse me, sir!

221
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,029
Water!

222
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,073
Get up.

223
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,992
Get up!

224
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,953
Water.

225
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,123
Sir, where did you get this?

226
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,833
You stole it, right?

227
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,010
Just come with me to the station.

228
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,727
Sir. You have the right to an attorney,
and the right to defend yourself.

229
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,189
-You may request a review--
-Water!

230
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,106
Water.

231
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,026
All right. Fine.

232
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,158
I got the suspect.

233
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,119
-Did he get him?
-He got him!

234
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,750
Good work. Let's wrap up and have dinner.

235
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,094
Just bring him out.

236
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,887
Lieutenant!

237
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,725
Hyeon-gi!

238
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,811
Hyeon-gi, what are you doing?

239
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,314
Everything is going to end now.

240
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,692
Help me.

241
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,653
Come on.

242
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,573
What's going on?

243
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,826
What?

244
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,246
We'll take care of this.

245
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,374
-Who are you?
-Please answer this call.

246
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,295
Hello?

247
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,923
Let him go!

248
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,685
All right.

249
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,565
I'll call you back when we're done.

250
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,528
-Hyeon-gi, come on out. Let's go.
-Officer Jung will come with us.

251
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,948
-What's this about?
-We need to do some further investigation.

252
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,255
-Cover his eyes.
-What?

253
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,843
Sir, a text came from Tae-sul
early this morning.

254
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:28,933
Hello.

255
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,936
This is our vice president, Eddy Kim.

256
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,854
Hello.

257
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,483
Eddy, he's from
the National Intelligence Service.

258
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,777
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

259
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,075
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed
to reveal my exact position.

260
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,747
I heard Mr. Han
contacted you this morning.

261
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,749
-Yes.
-Did you report it to the police?

262
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,002
No, I can't trust them.

263
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,462
Good thinking.

264
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,964
And you spoke to him on the phone?

265
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,092
No, just a text. He sent his location.

266
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,804
If you didn't talk to him yourself,

267
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,640
how can you be sure
that it was him who sent it?

268
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,769
No one except Tae-sul
can turn on that phone.

269
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,236
Whether I talked to him
or got a text from him,

270
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,446
it doesn't change the fact
that he was there.

271
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,657
-We have to send someone--
-Mr. Kim.

272
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,994
I know you're feeling impatient right now.

273
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,081
I'm sure you're anxious.

274
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,458
Could you show me that text?

275
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,335
Of course. Just a minute.

276
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,713
MESSAGES

277
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,471
NO MESSAGES

278
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,057
Wait.

279
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,726
But I got a message. I definitely got--

280
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,687
When you're feeling anxious,

281
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,731
you may believe
you got a message when you didn't.

282
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,483
No, that's impossible.

283
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,401
Sir.

284
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,237
I will go now.

285
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,906
-Okay. I'm sorry for bothering you.
-It's fine.

286
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,450
-Wait--
-Eddy.

287
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,172
Keep tracking Han Tae-sul's phone.

288
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,508
And hijack every signal that it transmits.

289
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,093
All right.

290
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,435
The number you have called
is not available.

291
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,812
-Leave a message--
-Why isn't he picking up?

292
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,730
Darn it!

293
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,196
What's the date today?

294
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,283
-August 19.
-It's August 19, 2020.

295
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,786
Excuse me.

296
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,831
You said you know where my brother is.
Where should we go?

297
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,293
Imun-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, 192…

298
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,296
Just go to Sinimun Station, Exit 2.

299
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,716
Does that mean my brother's in Imun-dong?

300
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,552
No, I have to stop by somewhere first.

301
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,179
Come on!

302
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,604
What are you playing at?

303
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:23,149
I'm taking you with me because
you said you know where my brother is!

304
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,860
-Just go there first.
-Where is he?

305
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,403
I have to go there first!

306
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,115
You're driving me nuts.

307
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,451
Fine. I'll take you there.

308
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,578
You'd better tell me when we get there.

309
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,915
Hey, you.

310
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,085
Are you really from the future?

311
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,712
Yes.

312
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,506
Is that how you predicted
the shooting in Busan?

313
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,843
-Yes.
-And what's with the downloader?

314
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,179
I coded that in 2001.

315
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,474
There are uploaders in the future.

316
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,477
I don't know how it works,
but it's like a copy machine.

317
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,814
They copy stuff
and send it to the other side.

318
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,275
They go inside a huge machine.

319
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,068
It's a quantum teleporter.

320
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,363
It teleports objects
by controlling the time value.

321
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,494
That's what I demonstrated
at the conference.

322
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,832
But controlling the time of humans

323
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,626
or other objects
with a huge amount of information

324
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,212
is technically impossible.

325
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,381
I'm not sure,

326
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,800
but it was around 2021
when the uploaders appeared.

327
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,969
What the heck?

328
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,889
Why are they coming here?

329
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,141
The success rate
is only about five percent.

330
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,935
And what's with
that radiation detector or something?

331
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,354
Are they getting exposed
to radiation on the way?

332
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,276
Hey, stay away from me.
Stick to that side.

333
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:36,032
Then if my brother got into that accident

334
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,242
after arriving here on an uploader,

335
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,412
he really is alive right now.

336
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,708
-Yes.
-He won't die if he doesn't come back.

337
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,048
Then I should find him
and tell him to never come.

338
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,721
And what's with that wedding photo?

339
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,516
Are we going to get married?

340
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,101
How am I supposed to know?

341
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,938
It can't be true.
We could've just taken a photo.

342
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,898
I'm sorry, but you…

343
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,901
Darn it.

344
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,569
You're not my type.

345
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,906
-You're not my type either.
-I don't want to get married.

346
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,866
Fortunately, now that we know,

347
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,120
let's agree not to get married
in the future.

348
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,747
Why don't you want to get married?

349
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,251
Never mind.
Just be quiet and stick to that side.

350
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,838
-You're annoying.
-I'm way more annoyed than you.

351
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,674
Why are you here, then?
Is it like some crazy TV show?

352
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,426
Is there some secret behind your birth?
Am I your dad?

353
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,139
-Shut up.
-Okay. What a relief.

354
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,598
I was nervous for a second.

355
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:46,978
Over here.

356
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,455
What's this?

357
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,292
Goodness.

358
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,379
What's all this?

359
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,623
Mom!

360
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,126
I'm home.

361
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,511
You're here.

362
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,237
Who are they? Are they your colleagues?

363
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,532
What took you so long?

364
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,379
I'm sorry.

365
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,048
I'm a bit late.

366
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,567
HWA RAMYEON

367
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,618
What the heck is he doing?

368
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,248
Mom.

369
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,168
You said you wanted
some ramyeon last night, right?

370
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,754
I did.

371
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,672
Let's have some ramyeon.

372
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,551
You told me not to.

373
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,014
It's just a little. It's okay.

374
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,767
Eat up.
It won't taste good if it gets soggy.

375
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,895
You should give some to our guests.

376
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,564
It's okay. They already ate.

377
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,068
Hurry up before it gets soggy.

378
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,177
Is it good?

379
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,721
Yes, it's good.

380
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,359
I had this every day when you were young
because we had no money.

381
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,363
I'm used to this taste now.

382
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:12,868
Mom.

383
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,956
I even added rice cakes, your favorite.

384
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,126
Here.

385
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,928
It's so good.

386
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,176
You want to know why they come here?

387
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,931
It's because of regret.

388
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,820
BOARD MEMBER: EDWARD KIM

389
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,873
AUGUST 15, 2020

390
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:45,336
THE VOTE HAS BEEN APPROVED,
CONFIRMING CEO HAN TAE-SUL'S DISMISSAL

391
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,700
They come here because of regret.

392
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,331
Even when they know they
can't change anything,

393
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,377
they think,
"Why didn't I do that back then?"

394
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,672
The thought torments them every night.

395
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,468
That's what regret is.

396
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,142
Mom. I'm sorry.

397
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:47,690
I was always harsh to you

398
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,776
and I didn't let you eat what you wanted.

399
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,947
I always came home late,

400
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:00,160
and I always left you at home alone.

401
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,956
I'm so sorry.

402
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,709
I know.

403
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,295
It's all right.

404
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,382
Mom.

405
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,344
I missed you so much.

406
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,181
I know.

407
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,930
Mom. Rest well.

408
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,187
I love you so much, Mom.

409
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,570
Mom.

410
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,080
Mom.

411
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,430
So?

412
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,892
What about you? What did you regret?

413
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,522
Listen carefully.

414
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,024
You may already know,
but they're trying to kill you.

415
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,151
Like who? The Control Bureau?

416
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,571
Everyone. Especially Sigma.

417
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,073
"Sigma"?

418
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,373
"Sigma"?

419
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,251
Busan was only the beginning.
They'll keep chasing after you.

420
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,046
Why are they trying to kill me, though?

421
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,216
I'm not sure, but…

422
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,304
It's probably because
you invented the damned uploader.

423
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,558
-Me?
-I came to protect you.

424
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,143
And whatever happens,

425
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,062
I'm going to stop you
from inventing the uploader.

426
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,439
Why?

427
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,027
Tell me later.

428
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:48,912
Thank you.

429
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,206
The address.

430
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,928
You won't like what you'll see there.

431
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,098
Just give me the address.

432
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,477
Promise me one thing.
Don't go to the second floor.

433
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,686
The study.

434
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,273
And you. Don't go outside.

435
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,150
There's a sniper.

436
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,279
My first mission was to kill you.

437
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,658
Who were you working with?

438
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,202
The Control Bureau.

439
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,954
I'm really sorry.

440
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,249
I did things that
I shouldn't have done to you.

441
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:35,876
I'm sorry.

442
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,760
It was August 27.
There was some kind of party.

443
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,806
JONGNO-GU, SEOUL

444
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,237
I found them.

445
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,040
I see Han Tae-sul
and two illegal entrants.

446
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,177
That's the chairman's house.
What happened--

447
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,428
Wait.

448
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,617
-Hold fire!
-Hold!

449
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,911
Hold fire!

450
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,704
Capture them alive.

451
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,027
Hey! Over here!

452
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,997
It's over now! Surrender!

453
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,168
What are you doing?

454
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,462
I was thirsty.

455
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,924
Do you want some?
Is there no coke in the future?

456
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:25,772
The boiling point of this butane gas
is -1 degrees.

457
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,357
What are you on about?

458
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:34,448
If I do this,
it stays in this bottle as a liquid.

459
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,490
And…

460
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,189
Let's go!

461
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,486
Hey!

462
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,614
The Control Bureau…

463
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,618
Run. Take the car.

464
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,130
No matter what I do

465
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,383
from now on,

466
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,969
forgive me.

467
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:42,474
That's the only way you can win.

468
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,439
Sir!

469
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,408
Let's go.

470
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,872
What's going on? Report!

471
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,917
We lost communication.
Second unit, going in.

472
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,387
That one!

473
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,475
Hey! Seat belt!

474
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,096
They got away.

475
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,764
Find them, then!

00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,577
-Rewind that.
-Yes, sir.

479
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,840

I found it.

485
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,488
Block the routes and get a drone there.

486
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,103
-It's a drone.
-What? A drone?

487
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,107
Here they go again.

488
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,693
But how did they know our location?

489
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,529
They know everything.
This happened in their past.

490
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,072
My smartphone.

491
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,617
My GPS was on!

492
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,379
-That was so close.
-Go faster!

493
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,514
Move aside!

494
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,895
Hey! Watch out!

-Why don't you drive, then?

496
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,157
-I can't!
-Why? Can't you drive?

497
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,743
You can shoot guns
and you can climb down a building,

498
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,910
but you can't drive?

499
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,997
Are there no cars in the future?
Or are they all self-driving cars?

500
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,999
-Stop talking and just drive!
-Hey.

501
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:39,252
I don't know what your world is like,
but this is a civilized society.

502
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,755
We don't chase people in cars
or shoot guns!

503
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,199
I get it. Just drive properly.

504
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,578
What just happened?

505
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,996
-What is this?
-Who did this?

506
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,667
You're attracting everyone's attention.

507
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,086
Is this a game to you?

508
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,964
Clean up the scene!

509
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,092
Keep the internet and media quiet,

510
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,301
and send more drones!

511
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,481
What the heck? They're chasing us again!

512
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,441
One, two.

513
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:48,196
Three, four. There are four of them now.

514
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,489
Those jerks!

515
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,991
They're using my taxes on stuff like this?

516
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,496
We've blocked their escape route.

517
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,124
-Start cornering them.
-Yes, sir.

518
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,215
Where did they go?

519
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,008
Go faster! Hurry!

520
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,676
Shut up. I'm trying my best.

521
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,855
Hey, watch out!

522
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,151
Duck!

523
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,293
Wait.

524
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,337
-What?
-Darn it!

525
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,005
Hold on tight!

526
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,606
We can't just keep running.

527
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,233
Get out and fight them, then!

528
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,694
Hey!

529
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,656
-Turn the car around.
-I can't!

530
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,033
-Turn it around.
-I can't turn it now!

531
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,580
Hang on. It's 50km/h now.

532
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:06,834
Ten meters. One, two…

533
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,396
Move!

534
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,782
Hey! Put your seat belt--

535
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,460
Good work.
Now, put your seat belt back on.

536
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,839
You too, for turning the car around.

537
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,048
It's nothing.

538
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,723
I'm sure there was one more.
Where did it go?

539
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:28,875
Get lost.

540
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,649
Did you block their escape route?

541
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,692
Yes, sir.

542
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:15,046
Yes, I understand.
But where did the orders come from?

543
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,508
How can you not know?

544
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,135
Why do we have to block
a road that's under construction?

545
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,804
Hello?

546
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,142
-Sir.
-Any news from Officer Jung?

547
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:31,521
-No, not yet.
-Where did he go?

548
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,482
-What did you find?
-It's a robbery and murder suspect.

549
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,069
We're doing all this for one robber?

550
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,696
Did he rob the Blue House or what?

551
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,282
It says it was just a normal house.

552
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,785
REQUEST TO BLOCK SUSPECT'S ESCAPE ROUTE

553
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:46,828
Hey, what is this?

554
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,539
This is Hyeon-gi's address.

555
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,962
What's going on?

556
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,887
-Stop that car.
-Contact the Center! Hurry!

557
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,143
-Hey, look ahead!
-Ahead?

558
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,690
Stop chasing us, you jerks.

559
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,359
Get lost, you assholes!

560
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,862
Stop the car!

561
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,614
-Plate number--
-Stop the car!

562
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,659
Plate 5816! Hey!

563
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,828
Hey! Contact the Traffic Center! Hurry!

564
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,164
Contact the Center. Page them.

565
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:41,048
Are they really going to keep chasing us?

566
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,390
What are you waiting for? Speed up.

567
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:59,692
-Go faster!
-This car can't go any faster!

568
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,952
-What's that over there?
-What?

569
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,079
-Over there.
-There?

570
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,290
What? Is the road cut off?

571
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,043
-Stop the car!
-Hey!

572
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,045
-Stop the car!
-How can I?

573
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,105
This is insane.

574
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:41,150
What happens if we get caught
by the Control Bureau?

575
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,568
Do you really want to know?

576
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,488
No, I was there for a short while.
It wasn't good.

577
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:48,241
They're all coming out. Let's go.

578
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,117
-What?
-Get out.

579
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,666
Those jerks.

580
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:57,917
Darn it.

581
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,339
What are you doing?

582
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,132
-Take that off.
-What?

583
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,845
Take it off. Leather absorbs water.
You might not be able to swim.

584
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,471
You want to jump?

585
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:11,848
Do you have any other ideas?

586
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,433
Mr. Han!

587
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,310
Come with us.

588
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,689
The wind is pretty chilly.

589
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,067
It'll just get tougher for you
if you keep stalling.

590
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:26,779
You're right.
It's so windy, I might fly away!

591
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,242
Hey, take off your bag.

592
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:33,953
What are you doing?

593
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,913
-What?
-If you just jump, you'll die.

594
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,874
-You need to think.
-Think about what?

595
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,001
The water won't be cold
this time of the year,

596
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,795
so you have to stretch out your legs
and fall vertically.

597
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,797
-How much do you weigh?
-Why do you ask?

598
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,674
-I need to calculate.
-No way.

599
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:49,510
-Okay, let's say you weigh about 55kg.
-It's 50kg.

600
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,889
What? 50kg? Why are you so skinny?
You need to eat more.

601
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,558
If you drop from this height,

602
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,643
you'll go six to seven meters underwater.

603
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,313
The current will be fast,
and you won't see anything.

604
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,815
You won't know which way is up.
So what I mean is,

605
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:06,944
don't let go of my hand.

606
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,665
They won't be able to run away,
so don't shoot. Capture them alive.

607
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,792
Run, on the count of three.

608
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,462
One.

609
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:28,507
Two.

610
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,177
Three!

611
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,040
Find them!

612
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,194
Dear Seo-hae,

613
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,071
Happy birthday.

614
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:37,535
By the time you read this, I'll be dead.

615
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:44,166
Don't be surprised.
What you're looking at is from yourself.

616
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,672
Listen carefully.
There is something we must do.

617
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,426
Take the uploader and go to the past.

618
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,303
Save Han Tae-sul.

619
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,641
If he lives, the war can be stopped.

620
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,727
Only you can do this.

621
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,751
Han Tae-sul.
Stay away from him at all costs.

622
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:31,130
You must not cross paths with him.
Don't even talk to him, okay?

623
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:14,882
A police officer of all people.
Even worse.

624
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,177
Where am I?

625
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:22,223
The Control Bureau.
It's sort of like the Immigration Office.

626
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:26,769
She broke into your house,
stole your gun and car, and ran away.

627
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,022
After contacting an illegal entrant,
Han Tae-sul evaded our pursuit

628
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:33,776
and ran into 250811 in Busan.
He ran away with her help.

629
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,903
You said you won't let me
make the uploader.

630
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,238
Does it have to do with it?

631
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,073
There will be a war.

632
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,034
Everyone will die.

633
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,913
All sorts of mysterious people
will continue to try to kill me.

634
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,541
You're in danger too. Right?

635
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,376
Then let's go our separate ways.

636
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,545
How can I go back?

637
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,340
You're the only person I know
whether from the past, present, or future.

638
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:58,884
-You can't do it on your own.
-No thanks.

639
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,220
I prefer working alone.

640
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,980
