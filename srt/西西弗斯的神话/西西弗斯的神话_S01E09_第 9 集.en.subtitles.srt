1
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:01,936
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:38,973
Hey.

3
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,684
You woke up.

4
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,144
Hey.

5
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,233
I'm sorry. I know you told me to hide.

6
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,403
By the way,

7
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,781
you hurt your hand.

8
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,991
I disinfected the wound, but are you okay?

9
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,871
Of course. A wound like this
is no big deal in the future.

10
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,252
-What about that jerk?
-He got away. And Sigma too.

11
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,712
I'm getting my guys
to gather some intel on him.

12
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,050
Then do we dig around Kim Dong-hyeon?

13
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,886
No.

14
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,513
Then what?

15
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,392
Even if the world falls to pieces,
we should take a rest today.

16
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,810
Why all of a sudden?

17
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,645
Because it's your birthday.

18
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,778
Gosh, have you forgotten who I am?
I'm Han Tae-sul.

19
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:38,032
Hey, I invented a time machine
and even found Sigma.

20
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,869
Of course I'd know your birthday.

21
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,833
Happy birthday.

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,002
Why don't I take you somewhere?

23
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,588
Where?

24
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,593
HAN TAE-SAN

25
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,265
-Are you having fun?
-Yes.

26
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,975
Then it's all good.

27
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,198
-What are you staring at?
-What? Nothing.

28
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,951
You said you hate amusement parks.

29
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,661
Are you having fun?

30
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,329
Yes.

31
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,872
Then it's all good.

32
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,877
Mom!

33
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,593
What is it?

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,720
Never mind.

35
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,973
Wow!

36
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,864
Hey, what are you doing?

37
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,075
-Why not?
-I'm not wearing that.

38
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,328
There's nothing in the future.

39
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,622
No people, no food.

40
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,625
My mom passed away during the war,
and my dad…

41
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,462
I've never done things like this.

42
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,756
What does that have to do…

43
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,386
Jeez, give me that.

44
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,604
Why are you laughing?

45
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,566
What?

46
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,944
You actually put it on? Are you an idiot?

47
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,323
-Hey!
-Why take it off? It looks cute.

48
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,452
Roar.

49
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,720
Tae-sul!

50
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,248
Who are we waving at?

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,585
Oh, gosh!

52
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,173
Why do people ride that thing?

53
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,050
Let's ride the pirate ship after this.

54
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,135
-No way.
-Why not?

55
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,888
Go experience a plane crash,
and we'll talk.

56
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,432
It's the most thrilling ride ever.
You go ahead.

57
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,768
No. What if something happens
when you're alone?

58
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,606
Fine, let's do it.
I guess I'll just faint two more times.

59
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,152
By the way, what will you do with Sigma?

60
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,907
All of a sudden? That's so random.

61
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,661
I had my guys find out who lives there.

62
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,872
Be it his real identity, face,
or even a receipt from a store.

63
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,291
Even a small clue will help us find him.

64
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,169
Then what?

65
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,549
I'll fix it

66
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,761
since I ruined everything.

67
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,391
My brother, you, your family, me,

68
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,477
and all those people.

69
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,314
So if we manage to find him,
I'll fix everything.

70
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,151
After all, it's what I'm good at.

71
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,114
I'm curious about something though.

72
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,283
Let's say we beat Sigma.

73
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,577
Then what will happen to you?

74
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,121
Will you disappear like you did last time?

75
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,082
Because there's no uploader,
and you're from the future?

76
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,418
Probably.

77
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:47,967
Here.

78
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,847
I booked a pool villa in Hawaii
for November 1.

79
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,435
I'd say we deserve a vacation
if we save the world from a nuclear war.

80
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,689
-November 1?
-That's right. November 1.

81
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,316
But why are there two tickets?

82
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,612
You don't think I deserve a vacation?
I've been through a lot too.

83
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,324
What's with that look?
What are you thinking?

84
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,451
Hey, open it up and see.

85
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,786
I booked two separate villas.

86
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,040
And I can't believe
you already finished your churro

87
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,502
when we're having a serious conversation.
It was well over 45cm.

88
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,922
Goodness.
Stay put, and don't cause any trouble.

89
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,175
-Where are you going?
-To get coffee.

90
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,134
I want ice cream.

91
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,012
Hey, didn't you say earlier

92
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,680
that I shouldn't be left alone?

93
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,767
It's right there. I can see it from here.
Hurry up.

94
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,019
Where does all the food go into?

95
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,563
Try living on canned food for 15 years.

96
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,901
Hurry. The parade begins at three.
Let's watch it after the pirate ship.

97
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,853
Ice cream! I want ice cream!

98
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,731
Ice cream? You already finished that?

99
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,275
Mom!

100
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,860
No. You already had a churro.

101
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,822
And you have to have dinner
when we get home.

102
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,700
-No!
-Gosh. I said, no ice cream.

103
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,787
Hi, honey.

104
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,789
Mom!

105
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,250
-Mom!
-Gosh, okay. Hold on.

106
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,796
Here, sweetie.

107
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,048
See that ice cream stand over there?

108
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,508
-Yes.
-Go get one.

109
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,886
Hello?

110
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,014
When will you be here?

111
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,810
What? It's Seo-hae's birthday today!

112
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,397
I understand that work is important,
but still…

113
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,569
I don't know. You tell her yourself.

114
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,870
Excuse me. Could you pick those up for me?

115
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,581
-Sure.
-Gosh.

116
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,175
Which flavor?

117
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,843
I want the vanilla flavor.

118
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,180
Vanilla, Mango, Chocolate, Pistachio,
Strawberry…

119
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,849
-Which flavor?
-Vanilla, please.

120
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,685
-Sure. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

121
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,979
Thank you.

122
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,815
Vanilla, Mango, Chocolate…

123
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,862
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want to go first?

124
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,572
Thank you.

125
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,575
-My gosh.
-Thanks, Mom.

126
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,203
You're the best, Mom! This is so awesome.

127
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:07,124
One strawberry, please.
With the syrup and sprinkles on top.

128
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,751
Sure, no problem.

129
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,961
I'll get the exact same thing.

130
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,296
Sure.

131
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,345
Hi, Dad. When will you be here?

132
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,556
It's boring here without you.

133
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,519
No way. Next time? When?

134
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,938
You have to come with me next time, okay?

135
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,900
Okay. Promise! I love you too.

136
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,989
Why are you staring at me like that?

137
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:44,120
Well, it's just that you remind me a lot
of someone I know.

138
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,290
Your name is Seo-hae, right?

139
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,084
How did you know?

140
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,003
I know everything because I'm a genius.

141
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,923
Are you here
because it's your birthday today?

142
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,475
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

143
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,025
Oh! I have the exact same necklace.

144
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,320
What a coincidence. My gosh.

145
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,203
Miss, are you all right?

146
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,750
Thank you.

147
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,044
Great, thank you.

148
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,591
Mister, have we met before?

149
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,178
No, not yet.

150
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,726
NO CALLER ID

151
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,483
Mr. Han Tae-sul?

152
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,819
My gosh, you surprised me.

153
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,198
You even broke into my place.

154
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,158
And I thought you were a gentleman.

155
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,612
Are you Sigma?

156
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,989
The headband looked great on you.

157
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,786
-Where are you?
-Do you want to meet me?

158
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,623
Of course I do.
Stop hiding like a rat and show yourself.

159
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,135
Is it the girl or the world? Pick one.

160
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,763
What's this nonsense about?

161
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,892
I want to meet with you now,
but just the two of us. That girl…

162
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,562
What was her name again?

163
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,772
That's right. Seo-hae.

164
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,400
You see, that girl…

165
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,987
I reported her to the Control Bureau.

166
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,493
What's wrong, miss?

167
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,619
Are you okay?

168
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,673
Yes, I'm fine.

169
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,395
You can either go there and save her

170
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,814
or come here to meet me.

171
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,318
Just pick one.

172
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,697
Catch me to avenge your brother
and save the world from war,

173
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,283
or go save the girl.

174
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,492
The choice is yours.

175
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,831
The girl or the world?

176
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,713
Get her!

177
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,145
Seo-hae!

178
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,438
Get her!

179
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,738
Seo-hae!

180
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,450
Seo-hae!

181
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,911
Seo-hae!

182
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,330
Seo-hae!

183
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,918
Seo-hae!

184
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,547
-No!
-My gosh! No!

185
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,476
Gosh.

186
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,025
-Mom.
-My daughter… Seo-hae!

187
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,035
Mom…

188
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,293
Mom!

189
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,676
Let go!

190
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:54,972
No!

191
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,189
Seo-hae!

192
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,652
Seo-hae!

193
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,320
Seo-hae!

194
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,741
Seo-hae!

195
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,535
-Seo-hae!
-Mom!

196
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,539
Seo-hae! Thank goodness.

197
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,332
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

198
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,677
Seo-hae!

199
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,431
Seo-hae! Stop!

200
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,975
Stop!

201
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,511
Hey, Seo-hae!

202
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,809
OCTOBER 31, 2020

203
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,734
Seo-hae.

204
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,529
Seo-hae.

205
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,782
Close the window. It's unsafe.

206
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,497
Mom, where are we going?

207
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,627
Where are we going?

208
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,088
Do you have your seat belt on?

209
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,799
Of course I do. Where are we going?

210
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,510
Well…

211
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,014
-To your aunt's.
-Aunt's house? Really?

212
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,350
Does that mean
I can skip my English lesson today?

213
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,018
Yes, you can.

214
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:05,936
Awesome!

215
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,481
Oh, right. Seon-u wanted

216
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,026
to come over after the lesson today.

217
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,822
Call now and say you can't hang out today.
Tell your friend to go home.

218
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,325
I spoke to Seon-u earlier on the phone.

219
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,828
Come here.

220
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,543
Everything will be fine.
We still have some time…

221
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,257
Honey.

222
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,693
Mom, I think I passed the job interview.

223
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,531
Yes! They only asked
what I was prepared to answer.

224
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,951
How about some chicken and beer
this evening?

225
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,288
-Hey, look.
-What's that?

226
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,638
MOM

227
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,975
APPLICANT ID CARD

228
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,560
Dad, wake up.

229
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,230
Dad!

230
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,983
Dad!

231
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,736
Dad, wake up.

232
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,323
Dad.

233
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,576
Please save my dad.

234
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,999
Dad! Open your eyes!

235
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,554
Mom!

236
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,189
Honey.

237
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,026
Hold on tight.

238
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,455
My gosh.

239
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,412
It's okay, Seo-hae.

240
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,581
Seo-hae.

241
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,211
Seo-hae, are you all right? Seo-hae.

242
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,463
-Gang Seo-hae!
-Yes?

243
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,010
Nothing bad will happen to us,
so don't worry.

244
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,428
Just keep your eyes closed.

245
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,310
Mom! Where are you?

246
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,187
Seo-hae!

247
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,399
Are you all right? You're not hurt?

248
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,152
Are you not hurt?

249
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,448
-Seo-hae, are you all right?
-Dad.

250
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,450
-Are you okay, honey?
-What about you?

251
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,995
-Let's go.
-Is that a gun?

252
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,957
Get up, quick. Let's go.

253
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,797
Ye-ji!

254
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,007
Ye-ji!

255
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,767
-Ye-ji! Sweetie, come with Daddy.
-No! Get off of her!

256
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,936
-Come on, Ye-ji.
-Hey, what are you doing?

257
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,562
-Ye-ji.
-No!

258
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,023
-Get yourself together!
-My gosh.

259
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,319
-Ye-ji!
-Damn it!

260
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,283
-Come here.
-Ye-ji!

261
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,034
Ye-ji!

262
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,542
Ye-ji!

263
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,481
Dad, where are we going?

264
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,736
Dad! I want to go home.

265
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,988
-We can't.
-Why not?

266
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,449
Wait.

267
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,159
Honey.

268
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,126
Has it gone off already?

269
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,337
No, not yet.

270
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,173
If it was a nuke, we'd be ablaze now.

271
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,176
Let's go.

272
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,483
Honey, wait here for a moment.
I'll go look.

273
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,533
It's okay. You must have been scared.

274
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,035
-Seo-hae.
-Yes?

275
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,747
From now on,
you must stay strong no matter what.

276
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,041
No matter what happens, okay?

277
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,418
Ye-ji!

278
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:39,217
-Ye-ji, sweetie.
-No!

279
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,639
Give me back my daughter!

280
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,985
What the hell?

281
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,363
Mom! Are you all right, Mom?

282
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,157
What's your deal? You jerk!

283
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,762
Honey.

284
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,598
Honey, are you okay?

285
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,851
Honey!

286
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,353
Mom…

287
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,856
-Hold on.
-Come on. Let's go.

288
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,984
We'll find some medicine
when we get there.

289
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,865
-Run!
-Hurry!

290
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,670
SHELTER

291
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,048
Just a second.

292
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,353
What's wrong?

293
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,271
SHELTER

294
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,113
Why won't it open?

295
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,913
-It's working.
-Yes.

296
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,089
Honey, just a little more.

297
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,717
-Go on in. Go!
-Let's go inside.

298
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,559
AUTOMATIC SWITCHGEAR

299
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,980
Darn it.

300
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,405
What's wrong? Is it stuck?

301
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,324
We only have three minutes left.

302
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,201
Can't we just go in?

303
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,829
That one door inside
won't protect us from the radiation.

304
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,914
Hang on.

305
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,594
Mom?

306
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,934
AUTOMATIC SWITCHGEAR

307
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,281
Seo-hae.

308
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,202
I have to step outside to close the door.

309
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,247
But if I do that,

310
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,251
I won't be able to come back in.

311
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,212
No. Don't go, Mom.

312
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,007
Seo-hae, look at me.

313
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,468
I'm smiling, right?

314
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:14,182
I'm so glad that you've made it here
safe and sound, Seo-hae.

315
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,227
Listen carefully, Seo-hae.

316
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,189
There will be a lot of
tough challenges ahead.

317
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,402
The world as we know it no longer exists.

318
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,240
There's nothing to make you smile,
and there's no clean air.

319
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,077
No yummy food and no friends.

320
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,246
But don't give up, no matter what.

321
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,917
Never give up.
You must get through it, okay?

322
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,672
You must live even if it's so unbearable
that you don't want to go on.

323
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:53,388
I'm just going on a long trip,
somewhere far away.

324
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,223
That's a lie!

325
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,767
No, it's true.

326
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,979
I've been to the future,

327
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,065
and I know that we'll meet again.

328
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,693
You see,

329
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,279
when you're all grown up,

330
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,450
I'll be there to see what an inspiring,
beautiful lady you've become.

331
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,202
I promise.

332
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,588
And…

333
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,217
I love you.

334
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,682
Honey!

335
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,187
What are you doing?

336
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,314
Just let me do it.

337
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,398
No.

338
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,695
You know I can't hold out much longer--

339
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,696
Stop!

340
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,281
Think about our daughter!

341
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,953
We promised each other
that we'd only think about Seo-hae.

342
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,955
Honey.

343
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,918
I'm so happy that I made it here
with the two of you.

344
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,507
Take good care of our little girl.

345
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,260
Keep her safe
and make sure no one ever hurts her!

346
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,267
Eun-hui…

347
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,941
Mom! No!

348
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,236
Mom!

349
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,155
Mom…

350
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:21,410
Mom!

351
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,748
Mom, don't…

352
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:30,920
Mom, please don't do it. Mom!

353
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:35,341
Mom!

354
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,845
Mom!

355
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,722
Mom!

356
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,728
Mom!

357
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,191
Honey!

358
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:51,626
SEPTEMBER 30, 2020
PRESENT DAY

359
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,278
Come out.

360
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,156
Show yourself!

361
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,951
Show yourself! Now!

362
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,912
Uncuff me. Let me go!

363
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,081
You jerks!

364
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,960
Uncuff me. Now!

365
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,379
Show yourself. Uncuff me!

366
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,674
Show yourself. Hey!

367
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,219
You'd better uncuff me. Come out!

368
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,845
Hey!

369
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,103
Hey!

370
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,729
That little…

371
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,482
Come out! Show yourself!

372
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,780
Come out. Now!

373
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,326
Uncuff me. You'd better uncuff me now!

374
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,161
-Wait outside.
-Pardon me?

375
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,496
I said, wait outside.

376
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,668
According to our rules, you can't
interrogate her as she killed your mother.

377
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,130
No. I caught her,
so let me interrogate her, sir.

378
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,215
You bastards!

379
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,385
-Uncuff me!
-Sir!

380
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,595
Let go. Let me go!

381
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,056
Sir!

382
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,351
Hey! Uncuff me!

383
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,313
Damn it…

384
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:47,158
My, we finally meet like this.

385
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:54,457
The success rate of crossing over here
is less than ten percent, right?

386
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,668
You'd probably think
it's because of the machine malfunction,

387
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,337
but that's not the reason.

388
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,798
Behind your eyes,
there's the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

389
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,633
It controls the biological clock.

390
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,888
The FOS proteins take in
the circadian rhythm

391
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,639
and give us a sense of time.

392
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,685
The mutation of the genes
that are involved in this process

393
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,688
determines the success of time travel.

394
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,986
This shot causes mutations
of those very genes

395
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,821
and breaks down the FOS proteins.

396
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,159
Let me put it simply.

397
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,121
Once this is injected,

398
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,750
it'll start breaking down
the downloaded folks into atoms.

399
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:41,170
So eventually, you'll end up
floating around in that state.

400
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,404
Two more injections, and you'll
completely disappear like a ghost.

401
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,949
So you'd better answer my questions.
Do not lie.

402
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:10,991
We know everything.

403
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,828
Gang Seo-hae.

404
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,373
Born in Seoul on September 30, 2012.

405
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,918
Your parents are Lieutenant Gang Dong-gi
and Lee Eun-hui, right?

406
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,675
Good. Why did you approach Han Tae-sul?

407
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,431
What are you two up to?

408
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,602
On the last day,

409
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,438
something happens, right?

410
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,984
You said you guys know everything.

411
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,653
So why ask me?

412
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,230
Get in there!

413
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,568
Hey, Seon-ho.

414
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,321
Seon-ho, get up.

415
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,450
Are you all right, Seon-ho?

416
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,661
Are you okay? Hey, look at me.
Are you all right?

417
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,704
Um Seon-ho!

418
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,915
-Open your eyes.
-Are you okay?

419
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,340
Hey! Anybody there?

420
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,260
You Control Bureau jerks!
Is anybody outside?

421
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,637
Hey!

422
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,890
Seon-ho!

423
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:01,894
Seon-ho!

424
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,364
Be quiet!

425
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,874
What time is it now?

426
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,127
-What?
-I asked you what time it is, you idiot.

427
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,973
I don't do deals
with you Control Bureau jerks.

428
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,060
But I'll make an exception today.
Here's an enticing offer.

429
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,897
I'll walk out of here

430
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,233
tomorrow afternoon.

431
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,069
You're insane.

432
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,988
You'll attempt a jailbreak?

433
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,533
A jailbreak? Of course not.

434
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:01,287
I don't go against laws or rules.

435
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,124
I bet you're dying to know
how I'll get out of here.

436
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,625
Listen carefully.

437
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,962
This door will open wide.

438
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:14,758
Then I'll get my boys
and walk out of here.

439
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:20,431
As soon as I leave this cell, I will kill
every single one of you that I see.

440
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,141
But you see…

441
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,769
I will spare you.

442
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:27,980
You're crazy.

443
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,816
You're right. I'm crazy.

444
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,403
But when someone helps me out,
I always return the favor.

445
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:41,035
See that guy who's passed out over there?
He's got a kidney problem.

446
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,120
So he has to take his medicine on time.

447
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,041
I'm sure you guys found the pills
in his inner pocket when we got here.

448
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,709
Bring those pills.

449
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,295
You've clearly lost your mind.

450
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:56,759
Yes, I've lost my mind.
Before I completely lose it and kill you,

451
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,928
go get those pills.

452
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,601
If he doesn't take them soon,

453
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,646
he'll die.

454
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,317
Hey, just swallow this. Here.

455
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,654
Here's your pill. Swallow it.

456
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,239
Just swallow it.

457
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,501
Good.

458
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,379
Thank goodness.

459
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:34,481
Gosh. Are you going to
keep wasting time like this?

460
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,316
-What?
-Aren't you going to look for her?

461
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,609
Look for her? How?

462
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:41,280
Will this thing tell you where
they took her if you keep staring at it?

463
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,908
I guess you don't know about them.
They even have guns!

464
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,495
Oh, is that right? I didn't know.
Thanks for telling me.

465
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,208
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to look for her.

466
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,295
You can keep staring at that thing.

467
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,504
Get back here.

468
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,674
Come on, quick.

469
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:09,600
Hey, which bridges over the Han River
have subway tracks on them?

470
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,101
The Dongho Bridge and…

471
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,396
Cheongdam Bridge, Dongjak Bridge…

472
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,441
That's it. Why do you ask?

473
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:18,942
Are you sure?

474
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,737
Yes!
I worked as a food deliveryman for years.

475
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,697
I didn't ask that.

476
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,367
My starting point…

477
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,330
was around here.

478
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,422
-Your destination is 48km away.
-Turn it off.

479
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,551
It was 48km away
from the final destination.

480
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,054
We drove nonstop for 30 minutes.

481
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,060
After crossing the Dongho Bridge…

482
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,149
OGEUM

483
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,903
-Apgujeong.
-After passing Apgujeong…

484
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,666
Was there a baseball game in Jamsil
on August 14?

485
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,421
There was. Doosan versus KT.

486
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,299
Doosan won.
They turned the tables in the ninth.

487
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,802
There must've been a lot of noise.

488
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,887
After that…

489
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,978
"Immigration Control Bureau"?

490
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,941
Aren't you going a bit overboard
with immigrant management?

491
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,361
They're dangerous.

492
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,243
I also remember hearing some sirens.

493
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,954
-From police cars?
-No, it sounded different.

494
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,334
An ambulance. Any hospitals in the area?

495
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,795
Asan Medical Center is here.

496
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,297
And…

497
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,388
This must be it, Jaae Hospital.

498
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,141
Why?

499
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:18,729
Kim Seo-jin used to work here.
This hospital is run by our foundation.

500
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,832
Sir?

501
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,587
How is it going on with the MSIT?

502
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,174
As I've mentioned,
the R&D team isn't thrilled.

503
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,092
They need more time to change the plan.

504
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,554
But it's already been days.
I want the report by this afternoon.

505
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,974
I don't care about anything else.
We just need to wrap this up nicely.

506
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,559
What about the assemblyman?

507
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,520
He's working on new bills
that will affect the project.

508
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,022
They'll be proposed soon.

509
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,732
Our R&D team is also--

510
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,777
My gosh.
Look at you working hard, Seung-bok.

511
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:12,616
What's this? Quantum & Time can function
just fine without me after all?

512
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,827
Hello. I suppose you're all doing well?

513
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,998
What's going on here?
You're all looking much better now.

514
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,541
Is it because I'm gone?

515
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,086
You were never around from the beginning.

516
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,213
How did you get in?

517
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,174
What do you think? I'm the one
who designed the security system.

518
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,425
Why are you here?

519
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,053
I need you to write an official letter.

520
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,349
My gosh, you even have a nameplate now?

521
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,270
Seung-bok, you've finally made it big.
You're a CEO now.

522
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,317
QUANTUM & TIME
CEO EDWARD KIM

523
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,485
VISIT TO SPONSOR JAAE HOSPITAL

524
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,444
Why are you going there?

525
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,738
To sponsor them.

526
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,824
Just send the money.

527
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,286
You know I'm not the type
to do good deeds in secret.

528
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,539
You never came to the funeral.

529
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,916
What? Whose funeral?

530
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,877
You heartless jerk, have some decency.

531
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,380
The chairman was like a father to us.

532
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,799
You couldn't have come this far
without him.

533
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,552
Oh, him.

534
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,346
The man who locked my brother up
in a psychiatric ward

535
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,516
and made me look like a lunatic
to confine and torture me?

536
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,934
Hang on a second.

537
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,063
Weren't you also in on it?

538
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,735
What are you doing?

539
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,948
Why are you glaring at me like that?

540
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,949
I'm the victim.

541
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,577
Why do you need to go to Jaae Hospital?

542
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,037
-Because Seo-jin is there?
-No.

543
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,290
She was really devastated.

544
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,127
You can't do this to her.

545
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,338
Isn't it the other way around?
She can't do this to me.

546
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,341
You too, you conniving bastard.

547
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,473
-Hold on. What are you doing?
-You bastard…

548
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,684
Is it okay to exercise violence
because you're the CEO now?

549
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,061
I should record this as evidence.

550
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,022
You've come a long way.

551
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,023
-Goodness.
-Damn it.

552
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,530
You crazy jerk.

553
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,743
Leave. And don't ever come back.

554
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,661
You're not the CEO anymore.

555
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,873
You're nothing here.

556
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,708
Right.

557
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,253
Okay.

558
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,450
Did you see him?
Did you get what you needed?

559
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,118
Yes.

560
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,455
You're empty-handed.
Don't you need an access card to get in?

561
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,966
What? What is it?

562
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,885
Darn it. You're too tall.

563
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,518
You look too kind because of those eyes.

564
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,562
Try to make them look mean.

565
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:32,524
Try your best.
Make them look mean and obnoxious.

566
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,655
Oh, that's it! But lose the double lids.

567
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,410
That's it. You look just like him now.
This right here…

568
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,954
-What are you doing?
-Look! Let me fix your hair.

569
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,874
-My hair is my everything.
-You need to do the side part!

570
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,710
-Do you have hair mousse?
-Who uses hair mousse these days?

571
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,463
JAAE HOSPITAL FLOOR PLAN

572
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,548
Image.

573
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,634
Look.

574
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,262
It seems like a normal hospital.
But in the basement…

575
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,517
Basement level one, two, three,

576
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,353
and four. Basement level four.

577
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,606
It's the only floor
without communication cables.

578
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,857
What does that mean?

579
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:18,320
Those jerks… No wonder
I couldn't get a signal on my phone then.

580
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,237
What?

581
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,742
NO SERVICE

582
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,330
That's the place. They're all in on this.

583
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,166
This must be where Seo-hae is right now.

584
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,276
It's been a while.

585
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,111
Pardon me?

586
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,823
Oh, I didn't know we have met before,
Mr. Kim.

587
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,120
"This makes me sad.
Remember the New Year's party?

588
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,748
I guess you don't remember me
because I wasn't the CEO."

589
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:16,002
Gosh, this makes me sad.
Remember the New Year's party?

590
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,506
I guess you don't remember me
because I wasn't the CEO then.

591
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,883
My gosh, that's not true.

592
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:26,471
Mr. Edward Kim. I remember you, of course.

593
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,181
I doubt you do.

594
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,476
Gosh, it's just because
you look so much younger today.

595
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:39,150
All those hidden camera pranks teach us
that people believe what they want to see.

596
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,652
So be confident.

597
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,489
"I'm visiting our subsidiaries
now that I'm officially the CEO." Go.

598
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,827
I'm visiting our subsidiaries
now that I'm officially the CEO.

599
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,161
I see.

600
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,080
-Yes.
-Don't forget the eyes.

601
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,009
This way, please.

602
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:13,018
This is where
comprehensive checkups take place.

603
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:17,647
Over 50 patients can be examined at once.

604
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,317
-After you.
-Thank you.

605
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,280
Where are you now?

606
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,199
The wing for medical checkups.

607
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,370
-Pardon?
-Sorry?

608
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,916
I'm due for a full checkup.

609
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,045
You can come anytime, sir.

610
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,005
Should we schedule it today?

611
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:45,175
-No, it's okay.
-All right, then.

612
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,470
You're pretty quick-witted.

613
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:53,308
Take Elevator 13
and go to Basement Level 4.

614
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:57,187
I think you passed the elevator just now.

615
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,898
Pretend you're going to the washroom.

616
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,609
Wait, where's the washroom?

617
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,111
-This way, please.
-No, it's okay.

618
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,572
I did see one downstairs on our way up.

619
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,657
Right, there's one on every floor.

620
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,744
-Okay. I'll be right back.
-Sure.

621
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,747
Sorry, please excuse me.

622
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,097
ELEVATOR

623
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,810
Are you in?

624
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,604
I'm in front of the elevator.

625
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,565
All right. Remember what you need to do
with the flash drive?

626
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:47,779
Here. Take this to the server room
on Basement Level Four.

627
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,948
-It's plug-and-play.
-What?

628
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,783
Plug it into the main computer.

629
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,201
Just plug it in?

630
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,120
Yes. It'll reboot the entire server

631
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,331
so the building can be controlled
from the outside…

632
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,041
Just go there and plug it in.

633
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,253
That's simple. What do I do after that?

634
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,381
We'll save Seo-hae.

635
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,760
Just plug it in and save Seo-hae.

636
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,888
Wait.

637
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,935
What? Where did it go? Hold on.

638
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,478
What is it? What's wrong?

639
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,439
Did you lose it?

640
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,651
There it is.

641
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,862
You little… Jeez.

642
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,142
DOOR NOT IN USE

643
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,144
It says the door is not in use.

644
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,230
Hold on.

645
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,138
Jeez! That scared me. Gosh.

646
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,766
I got in.

647
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,267
Do the iris scan.

648
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,144
Where is it?

649
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,791
Wear these contact lenses.

650
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,711
They'll get you into
all the restricted areas in the hospital.

651
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,131
-Gosh.
-Careful! Or I have to make another one.

652
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,135
Stand in the middle.

653
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:01,848
Gosh, that scared me.

654
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,810
Nice.

655
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,885
DANGER
ISOLATION AREA

656
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,136
I got in.

657
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,597
Then go down the stairs and make a right.

658
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,484
What on earth is this place?

659
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:18,049
Darn it. It's that way.

660
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,344
What are you saying?

661
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,342
Damn it. I'm sick of this.

662
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,266
-How's it going?
-That girl's stubborn. She won't talk.

663
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,227
They crossed over,
knowing it could cost them their lives.

664
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,186
They fear nothing.

665
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,397
Gosh! Those filthy rats.

666
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,649
They make me feel like
I'm exposed to radiation.

667
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,568
It doesn't spread through air.

668
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,154
Who knows? It worries me.

669
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,364
Did you get anything from the brokers?

670
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,409
They're even worse.
They laugh when they get beaten up.

671
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,871
Damn, we went through hell
because of those jerks last time.

672
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,415
This time, they're playing dumb
and denying everything.

673
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,835
We could've finished it in one blow
but got screwed over.

674
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,004
Damn it.

675
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,415
I didn't kill her.

676
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,961
What?

677
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,339
I didn't kill her.

678
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,634
I didn't kill anyone.

679
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,642
My mom…

680
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,438
did nothing wrong.

681
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,649
Same here.

682
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,197
Hey! Get out of there!

683
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,699
-Jung Hyeon-gi!
-Have you lost your mind?

684
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,785
-Get out of there!
-Open the door!

685
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,043
I hear this shot

686
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,379
makes you disappear

687
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,465
like a ghost.

688
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,724
I heard it hurts.

689
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,601
Whether I killed your mother or not,
it no longer matters to you.

690
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,023
You're trying to kill me
not because you hate me.

691
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:04,066
But because you hate yourself.

692
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,360
Your regrets are driving you crazy,

693
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,946
so you're taking your anger out on me.

694
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,449
Shut up.

695
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:28,633
I think I'm in the server room now.

696
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:32,178
Good. Then find the mainframe server
and plug in the flash drive.

697
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,472
Come again? Main… What?

698
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:37,850
The mainframe server. Take a good look.

699
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,769
But there's a lot of stuff here.

700
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,479
Look for the one

701
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:45,024
with insanely tight security.

702
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,902
Anyone would know
that it's the most important one there.

703
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:09,590
I got it open,
but there's a lot of stuff inside.

704
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,050
Of course, you fool.

705
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:15,262
You'll find the control unit
somewhere in the middle.

706
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,557
It looks like a laptop. With a handle.

707
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,231
-Did you find it?
-Yes.

708
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,942
I'll just plug it in first.

709
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:30,236
Be careful.
Don't plug it in the wrong spot.

710
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:39,328
I did it. But something's popped up
on the screen.

711
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,290
Yes, I see it.

712
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,251
Well done. Now get out of there.

713
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,128
Just leave this here?

714
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,587
Gosh.

715
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,172
Okay, I'll get out of here.

716
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,216
Yes, just leave it there.

717
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,385
It's my turn now.

718
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,567
FIRE ALARM

719
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,428
-What is going on?
-Hurry! Run!

720
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,854
JAAE HOSPITAL

721
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,238
What's going on?

722
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,413
-Find out what's going on!
-Yes, sir!

723
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:51,961
Situation Room, what's going on? Hey!

724
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:55,256
Stop that!

725
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,423
-You rats!
-Stay put!

726
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:11,981
He's here.

727
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:14,859
What?

728
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,194
He's here.

729
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:07,203
Security system error.

730
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,915
Why is Seo-hae's name here…

731
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:11,874
on a wanted poster?

732
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,294
Dad…

733
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:17,838
What's going on with Tae-sul?

734
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,506
You don't have to know that.

735
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,301
There's no cure for her.

736
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:23,844
How can I save Seo-hae?

737
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:24,845
Just shoot me!

738
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,389
Agnes.

739
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,517
Ask that woman how to save her.

740
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:38,067
