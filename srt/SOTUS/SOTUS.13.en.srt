00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,280
The hazing activities depicted in this series,
“SOTUS the Series”
have been exaggerated for entertainment purposes.

2
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Hey,

3
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,600
we’ve been working on this paper for like 3 hours already.

4
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,480
I need to entertain myself with something now.

5
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
Tuta!

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
Let’s go drink!

7
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,640
Good idea! I have a new dance move to show off.

8
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,720
Go for a drink?!

9
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,160
How about I’ll write off both of your names from our team’s paper?

10
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,440
Tuta, you should pay more attention to the paper.

11
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,840
Otherwise, I’ll write off your name from our team’s paper.

12
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,000
Got it!

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,280
Wasn’t it you who asked me to go drink, you jackass?

14
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,920
Hey, Arthit.

15
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,520
Are you okay?

16
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
You look like a corpse.

17
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,520
What? I’m okay.

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,400
So? How much have we done so far? Let me help…

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,240
You should try to pull yourself together first.

20
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,800
By the way,

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,360
P’Tum called me last night.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,400
He asked me to be a photographer at his wedding.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
Woah!

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,600
He did that because he believes in your photography

25
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,680
or he just cannot afford a professional photographer.

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
He believes in my photography.

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,720
Wow, you are so full of it.

28
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,240
Wake up and get real.

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,280
Writing off Tuta’s name...

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
You are just a piece of crap.

31
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,680
You mean Prem?

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
No, that’s for you!

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,760
By the way, how do you guys go to the wedding

34
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,000
It’s no-brainer.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,960
You have a car, right?

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,720
I’m talking to you. Yeah, it’s you.

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,560
So you come and pick all of us up.

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,640
Me?

39
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,040
Yeah. You had the honor to do good.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,560
Let’s do so.

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,440
You pick up Bright first, then Tuta and Prem

42
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
And you come pick me up later.

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,040
It’s okay. I can wait

44
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,680
Knot, that means…

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,080
I’ll be picked up first

46
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
so don’t be late.

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,880
It’s you who’s always late.

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,760
Me?

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,720
I should go back to my paper.

51
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
I don’t know what you mean by that.

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,960
But if it’s the same as I had in mind.

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,400
Yes, I do.

54
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,440
Missed calls (9)

55
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,800
19 – P’Tum & P’Fon’s Wedding

56
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,400
Maple: I’ll pick you up in about an hour.

57
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,960
I don’t feel like going…

58
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Got it..!

59
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,480
You are going to P’Tum and P’Fon’s wedding, right?

60
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,720
Knot

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,280
Yeah, what’s up?

62
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,360
Hey, Arthit.

63
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,800
Are you done?

64
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,680
Yeah, I’m coming down. Wait a sec.

65
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,840
We are waiting for you down here.

66
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,720
What is he doing?

67
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,520
How the hell should I know?

68
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,560
We’re going to be late.

69
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,760
And I’m the MC for crying out loud.

70
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,840
Go get him, Prem

71
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,280
There he is.

72
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,960
Woah…you dress up like you walk out from a Korean drama.

73
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,080
You must think you are really handsome in this.

74
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,760
Of course I am, man.

75
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,760
I’m handsome.

76
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,720
And you?

77
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Are you going to celebrate Chinese New Year?

78
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,280
Why are you wearing this traditional Chinese jacket?

79
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,040
You look like an old man in China town or something.

80
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,400
What’s wrong? The Chinese new year is coming

81
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,720
Even in this, I look more handsome than you.

82
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Okay, we’re even.

83
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey, Arthit.

84
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,560
Move your ass into my car already.

85
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,520
Okay, dude. Let’s get going.

86
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Is this how people hop on a car?

87
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,120
No, that’s wrong.

88
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
P’Ple, sawasdee krup

89
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
Sawasdee ja.

90
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,760
Give me a sec. I need to look up the direction from the GPS

91
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,320
I’ve never been there.

92
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,360
P’Ple krup.

93
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,960
In this uni, do you have a boyfriend here?

94
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,200
I did but we broke up.

95
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,040
Which faculty is your ex in?

96
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,960
He’s from the same faculty.

97
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,960
You’ve already met him.

98
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,600
Who is he? May I know?

99
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,000
Well…It’s P’Bright.

100
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,200
P’Bright, really?

101
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
I never heard about this.

102
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,120
You two don’t look like you were dating before.

103
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
In fact, not many people know about us.

104
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,680
Well, can I ask you further?

105
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,040
Shoot.

106
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,840
How long has it been since you broke up with P’Bright?

107
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,560
We broke up when I went abroad for Work & Travel program.

108
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,520
Since you and P’Bright are in the same faculty,

109
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,480
you can’t avoid running into him from time to time.

110
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,440
Wasn’t it hard to get over him?

111
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,280
I’ll get over him eventually.

112
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,000
We have to move on in life.

113
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,480
And another thing is…

114
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,560
We are not in the college just to date someone.

115
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,960
You are right.

116
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,480
Love is always beautiful.

117
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,520
Though the ending could hurt you sometimes.

118
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,880
At P’Fon’s wedding,

119
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,280
I’m sure you will meet P’Bright there.

120
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,040
What will you do?

121
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,760
I will avoid him if possible.

122
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
If I have to face him, I will just smile at him.

123
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,640
That’s what I do when I run into him at the uni.

124
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
I got the direction now.

125
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,200
Shall we go?

126
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,280
Thank you.

127
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,040
Are you tired?

128
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
I’m still good.

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,800
Here they are. Those rascals.

130
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,400
Sawasdee krup.

131
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,040
It’s unbelievable that you get to have the big day too.

132
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,320
You look handsome.

133
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,280
P’Tum, P’Fon, sawasdee krup.

134
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,000
Congrats!

135
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
Let’s take a picture together.

136
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,080
Prem, take a picture for us.

137
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,200
Prem, take a picture for us.

138
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
Let’s have a group shot first.

139
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
We can have a group shot first then you can go do your duty

140
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,920
All right, smile.

141
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,760
Okay, go take a picture now

142
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Yeah, balance it up

143
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,480
Smile!

144
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,280
Congratulations!

145
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,760
Congrats, bro.

146
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,280
I want to hold a baby now.

147
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,800
Can you make it happen?

148
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,720
You can count on me.

149
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,080
Easier said than done.

150
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,120
It will come in two months.

151
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,840
Sawasdee ka.

152
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,320
My junior mentors are here.

153
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Come here. Let’s have a group shot.

154
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,440
we don’t have a group photo with both 0062 and 0206 student line yet.

155
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,400
Let’s have one right now. Let’s take a group shot.

156
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,360
Please stand here, P’Tum.

157
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,880
Stand to both side equally.

158
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
Squeeze in. Come closer.

159
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,920
Ready? 3..2..1

160
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,640
Beautiful.

161
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,520
One more shot.

162
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,560
Please smile.

163
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,360
3..2..

164
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,360
Okay, now let’s get inside.

165
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,760
Thank you.

166
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,160
Kongpob.

167
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,720
Yes?

168
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,560
Uh….

169
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,280
Are you doing okay?

170
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,400
I am.

171
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,680
This wedding reception is beautiful. Don’t you think?

172
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Yes.

173
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,480
And the red dress code actually suits the wedding well.

174
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,080
But it’s a bit difficult to get red attires.

175
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
The best I can do is this red tie.

176
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,120
P’Arthit krup…

177
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,360
I know this makes you feel uncomfortable.

178
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
But if you have to fake your feeling

179
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,080
you don’t really need to do this.

180
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,280
If you keep doing this,

181
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,480
it’s like you are giving me hope.

182
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,240
Hey, Arthit

183
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,800
Why are you standing out here?

184
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,120
Come on. Let’s get inside, man.

185
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,600
Listen

186
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,920
I feel excited for P’Tum and P’Fon.

187
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,640
But the best of the best is…

188
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the food in this reception.

189
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,400
I really want to take them home to my aunt and my mom.

190
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,960
Damn you, Bright. Stop being a freeloader for once.

191
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,840
I will take your pictures and show to P’Tum.

192
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,240
That’s all?

193
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,720
Yeah, that’s all.

194
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,600
Sorry, dude.

195
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,840
Don’t be a snitch.

196
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,960
Please take a moment and watch the wedding footage together.

197
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Please make a round of applause for the video footage.

198
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
How was it?

199
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,680
I’m sure many of you know or hear about their story.

200
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,160
But since we are here, would you like to hear from them again?

201
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,640
All right.

202
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,880
Let’s interview the bride and the groom

203
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,000
how it all began.

204
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,960
how they fell for each other

205
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
and how they met.

206
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160
All right, bro.

207
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,080
Can you share us how you met her?

208
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,600
Well, when I was a third-year student, I was the leader of the hazing

209
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,520
And Fon was the leader of the nursing team.

210
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,280
That year, our hazing was really grueling.

211
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,200
Many first years passed out.

212
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,840
When I went to the nursing room,

213
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,280
Fon would jump on me and bash me

214
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,120
She went “Hey, why were you so tough on the juniors?”

215
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,320
She said she would report me to the dean.

216
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,120
She threatened to expose us.

217
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,080
So I was really mad at her at the time.

218
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,440
But I heard that she was impressed by your punch line.

219
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,480
What did he say to you?

220
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,040
He said “You are this fierce. Who would want you to be his wife?”

221
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,200
And now…

222
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,040
I’m becoming his wife!

223
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Well, we had a lot of fights.

224
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,920
None of us would want to give in first

225
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,120
But next thing we know,

226
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,000
we cannot live without each other.

227
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,840
Hey, Bright!

228
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
You’re crying?!

229
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,000
I’m not.

230
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,800
I just got dirt in my eyes

231
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,360
All right. I believe you can feel the love they have for each other now.

232
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,840
Lastly, may I ask you all to join the toast for tonight’s wedding

233
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,920
Would you please lift up your glasses?

234
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Let’s make a toast to the bride and the groom.

235
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,440
We wish them everlasting happiness.

236
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,600
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

237
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,400
Hey, I’ll be right back.

238
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,800
Bye bye, see you later.

239
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,560
Good luck and take care.

240
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,880
We have to go now.

241
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,960
All right. Thank you.

242
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,640
Take care.

243
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,800
P’Fon, do you know where P’Tum is?

244
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,160
Oh, he’s gone to the restroom

245
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,160
The restroom?

246
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,680
Yeah.

247
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,880
Hey, bro.

248
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,480
Hey, Ai-oon.

249
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,160
Here. I have something for you.

250
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,880
What is it?

251
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,600
You don’t need to give me the cash gift. I don’t mind.

252
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
Why don’t you open and read it?

253
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,920
I can’t believe a guy like you would give me a card

254
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,280
Thanks.

255
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,560
Well…

256
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,360
I really don’t know what to give to you

257
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,560
Someone told me…

258
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,040
the real gift is actually the message inside.

259
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,880
if we write it from our heart,

260
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,080
the receiver will sure be happy

261
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,040
And also

262
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,840
it’s kind of romantic.

263
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,400
Romantic, you say?

264
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
I’m sure those lines are from a girl.

265
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
You are secretly seeing someone and don’t tell me?

266
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,600
You are making a progress.

267
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
It’s not what you think, really

268
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,000
In fact, I really have no idea…

269
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
…what it is between me and that person.

270
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,760
Well, bro…

271
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,600
Can I ask you something?

272
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,680
What?

273
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,160
Go ahead.

274
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,280
When you are with P’Fon, are you happy?

275
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,560
Yeah, I am.

276
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
What’s with the question?

277
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,640
Someone told me…

278
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,080
if you are with the right one

279
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,560
you will be yourself.

280
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,080
You will be happy.

281
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,680
But if you are with someone that makes you feel uncomfortable,

282
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,480
or suffering…

283
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,160
It means…that person is not meant to be with you.

284
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,480
Is this right, bro?

285
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Listen to me carefully, Ai-oon.

286
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,320
When I’m with Fon,

287
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,520
I don’t always feel happy.

288
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
We fight a lot.

289
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
And you know what?

290
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,560
This morning, we also picked up a fight

291
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,800
about our wedding cake.

292
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,240
But I and Fon have been through a lot of things together

293
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,120
we were mad at each other. We were happy and sad together.

294
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,520
We even fought so hard that we cried sometimes.

295
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,880
And I also know that…

296
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,080
…there’s still a lot to get through with her.

297
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,440
But I would still choose to be with her anyway.

298
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,520
You know why?

299
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,160
Because Fon has changed me to the person who I have never been.

300
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,600
And…how can you be sure…

301
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,240
that I and that person can go back to where we used to be?

302
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,000
What if we can never be the same again?

303
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,560
What should I do?

304
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Is the relationship between you and that person the same now?

305
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,400
Listen, Ai-oon,

306
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,360
when some sort of feelings happens to you,

307
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,080
it’s hard to revert it.

308
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,360
The only way is…

309
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,160
you need the time to heal it.

310
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,360
But you can’t just let the time pass by without doing anything.

311
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,840
Instead, you can use this time to do what you and that person really want to do.

312
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,280
Just go think over this thoroughly.

313
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,200
Fon is looking for me.

314
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,560
I have to send off the guests.

315
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,200
I talk to you later

316
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,480
I have to go now. Good luck.

317
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,840
Wait a minute, bro.

318
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,040
What now?

319
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,600
So…

320
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,840
what is this feeling I have right now?

321
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,040
What?

322
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,320
How the hell would I know?

323
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,520
You must figure it out yourself.

324
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Don’t use your brain.

325
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,920
Use your heart.

326
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,840
If you cannot figure it out yet,

327
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,480
you don’t need to worry.

328
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,360
Just screw it

329
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,840
And do whatever you like to do.

330
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,040
You are the friggin’ head hazer

331
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,440
Live up to that.

332
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,080
Come on.

333
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,640
I really have to go now.

334
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
See you

335
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,440
See you

336
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,640
Hey, Arthit.

337
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,880
Where the hell have you been?

338
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,000
We are waiting for you only.

339
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
Have you seen the first year junior?

340
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,160
The first year who?

341
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,760
Ah, do you mean Kongpob?

342
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,840
He’s just left.

343
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,240
He’s probably still at the front door.

344
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,800
Hey, wait a minute.

345
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,160
Are you going home with us?

346
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,920
Go home on your own, then.

347
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,920
What’s wrong with him?

348
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,280
What are you doing out here, P’Arthit?

349
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,360
Are you sure you don’t want to go back with me?

350
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,160
Yes. Don’t worry.

351
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,560
Get home safely, okay?

352
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,920
What are you doing out here, P’Arthit?

353
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,400
You’re still here?

354
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,720
Yes, I don’t feel like going home yet.

355
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,960
Are you hungry?

356
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,120
I am hungry.

357
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Would you like to keep me company?

358
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,120
follow me.

359
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,520
I would like a super-size egg noodle in spicy soup.

360
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,760
Can I have a rice noodle in clear soup with meatballs?

361
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,040
A rice noddle in clear soup with meatballs.

362
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,360
Here you go. Super-size egg noodle in spicy soup

363
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,800
And rice noodle in clear soup with meatballs.

364
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,120
You like meatballs, don’t you?

365
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,840
Yes.

366
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,440
Take them.

367
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,080
Why are you doing this?

368
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,400
What are you talking about?

369
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,720
You really don’t know or you pretend that you don’t?

370
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,000
Just eat. It’s getting cold.

371
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,520
♬ Though we cannot say it that we love each other. ♬

372
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,720
♬ ‘Cause we know people may not like it when they know. ♬

373
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,360
♬ No matter how strong our feelings for each other is. ♬

374
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,720
[Kongpob, student ID 0062. May I?]

375
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
[I just make you my wife.]

376
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,800
[They say, what belongs to your lover is also yours.]

377
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,720
♬ ‘Cause everything is already good as it is. ♬

378
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,440
[Why are you still here?]

379
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,240
[To clear the plate for you.]

380
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,080
Kongpob...

381
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,280
Are you tired?

382
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,240
No.

383
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,840
Honestly,

384
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,960
Aren’t you tired at all?

385
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,760
You have to chase after me like this.

386
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,320
And you have no clue where I’m heading to.

387
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,760
or when I will stop.

388
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,800
Even though, I don’t know what lies ahead of me.

389
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,160
Be it far or near…

390
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,840
I still want to be there for you, P’Arthit

391
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
But you know, right?

392
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,320
that I’m a guy and you are also a guy.

393
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,960
Yes.

394
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,520
And you also know, right?

395
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
That I’m your senior.

396
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,040
And you are my junior.

397
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,440
Yes, I know.

398
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,160
And you know, right?

399
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,120
That I like to drink pink milk.

400
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,640
And you know, right?

401
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,880
that I can be incredibly stupid sometimes.

402
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,520
I can be really selfish

403
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,400
I whine a lot.

404
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
I get annoyed easily

405
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,040
I’m just a laid-back kind of guy.

406
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,920
I can wake up really late at any day

407
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Even you know all of these

408
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,440
Can you accept who I am?

409
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,720
Yes, I can.

410
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,360
What about you?

411
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,080
Can you accept me?

412
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,920
I don’t know you well enough, Kongpob.

413
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,720
But I want to know you more.

414
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,640
What do you mean?

415
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,880
♬ Just know it in our own heart. Just the two of us is enough. ♬

416
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,040
♬ It’s more than love. No words could ever express. ♬

417
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,960
That’s my answer.

418
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,000
Hold on, P’Arthit.

419
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
I didn’t hear your answer loud enough

420
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
Can I have it one more time?

421
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,560
Hell no!

422
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,160
What’s the rush?

423
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,920
What now?

424
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,160
Stop it!

425
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,040
I can’t seem to retain anything I read.

426
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,200
Any advice?

427
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,640
Eat the seaweed. It has iodine.

428
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,520
It helps you remember things better

429
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,080
Really?

430
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,080
Can I have all?

431
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
You are so into it.

432
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,480
Hey, Kong

433
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,600
What’s your plan today?

434
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,880
I have to return the books to the library.

435
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,240
Then, I just go back to my dorm

436
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,520
I don’t have class in the afternoon.

437
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,360
Hey, guys.

438
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,920
I just hung up with Wad.

439
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,520
He said our Calculus midterm scores had been posted.

440
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,000
It’s on the bulletin board near the elevators.

441
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,680
Wanna go check it out together.

442
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,640
Yeah

443
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,160
Why don’t we go there now? Let’s go

444
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,560
Get your stuff.

445
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,040
Hello.

446
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,920
Listen, May.

447
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,200
The Calculus midterm scores have been posted.

448
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,200
If you are busy, I can check it for you.

449
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,320
Ah, okay. I’ll see you then.

450
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,320
All right then. Bye.

451
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,000
Well well well.

452
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,400
What?

453
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,320
You called her.

454
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
So?

455
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,640
He’s cute when he’s blushing

456
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,760
What are you guys doing here?

457
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,240
We are checking our Calculus scores

458
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,440
Why don’t you line up in an orderly fashion!

459
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,720
You probably forgot what I had told you about being orderly!

460
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,040
Do you want me to teach it all over?!

461
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,600
First years! Get in the line. Go!

462
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,680
Are you being possessed by the Hazer ghost?

463
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,520
You scare the hell out of them.

464
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,960
Well,

465
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,640
this is how I do well.

466
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,280
I don’t know what else I can do.

467
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,640
P’Arthit,

468
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,840
you indeed scared the hell out of us.

469
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,000
We almost fell in the line like you had ordered

470
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,520
So? How are the scores of the juniors in our major?

471
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,800
Well, it seems the students from our major failed the least.

472
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
The top scorer is from our major too.

473
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,280
Awesome.

474
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,200
You all deserve to be our Industrial major juniors.

475
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,120
Like you did well when you hazed and disciplined them.

476
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,280
They could all pass their exams.

477
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,440
What’s it got to do with the hazing?

478
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,520
You don’t know?

479
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,800
Our hazing is meticulously organized for them, right?

480
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,840
Going forward,

481
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,680
even they have to wade through water

482
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,960
fire or even the sea.

483
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,120
I’m sure they manage to get through them all.

484
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,240
Because our hazing is tougher.

485
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,200
Actually, I want to try becoming a hazer too.

486
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,920
Hey, are you sure about that?

487
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,240
I am.

488
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,960
Listen! I saw Prof. Suda getting in the elevator.

489
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,280
We’re screwed!

490
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,640
If we are late, she will lock us out!

491
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,840
Really? Let’s go!

492
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,880
Hold on, P’Arthit

493
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Please study hard, P’Arthit.

494
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,840
Hi, N’Arthit.

495
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,440
Your usual drink, right?

496
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,720
Well, I would like an iced coffee for today

497
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,240
Okay.

498
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,720
I’ll come back for it.

499
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,640
Excuse me.

500
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,720
Can I have a chicken basil..

501
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,960
No, I want a minced pork omelet with 2 eggs on rice.

502
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,560
Okay.

503
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,440
Is my drink ready?

504
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,080
Kongpob…

505
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,880
You are getting your dinner here?

506
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,160
Um.

507
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,680
Oh yeah? How’s your Calculus score?

508
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,560
Not too bad.

509
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,000
In fact, if this is too hard for you,

510
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,920
you can study Economics instead.

511
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,600
It’s your dream, right?

512
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,120
If you want to get transferred to that field

513
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
I don’t think it’s wrong to do so.

514
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,840
I can study Economics in my postgrad

515
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
But now, I’m not going anywhere

516
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,880
Because I like…

517
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,200
…it here

518
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,520
Here’s your pink milk, N’Arthit.

519
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,440
I didn’t order that

520
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,240
And who ordered this?

521
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,840
I did.

522
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,800
Hey, Kongpob

523
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,360
I have something to return to you.

524
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,320
Give me your palm.

525
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,600
Take care of it for me.

526
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,280
I’ll take care of it with all of my heart.
