00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,520
The hazing activities depicted in this series,
“SOTUS the Series”
have been exaggerated for entertainment purposes.

2
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,840
Where have you been?

3
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,640
P’Ple 0062

4
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,640
Kong.

5
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,560
Kong.

6
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
Kong, you dumbass.

7
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Your phone.

8
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, I’ve got to take this.

9
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
Go ahead.

10
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,520
Are you sure you’re okay?

11
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,600
I am.

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,200
You don’t look like you are.

13
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,840
You’ve been zoning out like a dog.

14
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,560
I think you should go get a cup of coffee or something.

15
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,880
We’re good here.

16
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Can I go too?

17
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Tew, don’t try to get away.

18
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,080
Have you finished your paper?

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
Fine, I’m not going, then.

20
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,880
I know what you are thinking.

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
Hello, P’Ple.

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
Yes.

23
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,000
Sorry, I missed your call earlier.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,920
No worries.

25
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,160
I just want to know how you are going to P’Tum & P’Fon’s wedding.

26
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,800
Do you want me to give you a ride?

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,840
Ah, I thought of going there by taxi.

28
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,760
But…

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,000
I would love to go with you

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,480
Okay. I’ll pick you up then.

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,200
All right. Thank you.

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,360
Hey, P’Knot.

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,240
Sawasdee krup

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
I have something to impose on you.

35
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,480
Can you wait for me here for a sec?

36
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,800
Can I ask you to pass these to P’Arthit?

37
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
Sure, no problem

38
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
Thank you.

39
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
Hey, May.

40
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Check this out.

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,920
Your love horoscopes…

42
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,520
The person you have admired secretly will show interest in you.

43
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh my god.

44
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,080
I can’t believe it can be this accurate.

45
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,120
Today, I saw P’Yatch and P’Arthit at the canteen.

46
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,480
I caught them checking me out.

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,360
Get real, Maprang.

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,280
You spilled your drink at the canteen and made a scene there

49
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,760
So everyone was looking at you.

50
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,200
That’s what I thought too.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,040
Don’t believe in something like this, trust me.

52
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
The horoscopes in magazines are usually overrated.

53
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,840
But not this one.

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,480
They say the horoscopes from this magazine are very accurate.

55
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,560
Anyhow, let me check your horoscope.

56
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,720
You were born in February.

57
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
So you are Aquarius.

58
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
Aquarius…

59
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,160
Oh my goodness.

60
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,920
This is unbelievable.

61
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,960
Didn’t you say you were not interested in this?

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,840
I’m just curious what they say about my zodiac.

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,240
It’s not that I’m going to believe it.

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
Really?

65
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,040
You are so obvious.

66
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,360
Fine, let me read it for you.

67
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,960
Listen to me carefully, Khun May.

68
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,160
The Aquarius people who are single

69
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,760
you will meet your soul mate who is someone close to you.

70
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,880
That person will be hanging around you

71
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,640
so this is the perfect time to confess your feelings.

72
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,080
If you own a personal item with sky blue color,

73
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,240
your chance of luck will get even higher.

74
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,760
Your soul mate has a title of the University’s Moon.

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,200
He is handsome, smart, clever and perfect.

76
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,880
And his initial is…

77
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,680
K.

78
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,920
That’s actually from me.

79
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,400
Come on.

80
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,040
Are you out of your mind?

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
You must have gone crazy.

82
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,920
How much info have you got for your paper?

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
Okay. Okay.

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
I’m going back to it now.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,080
All right. I’m going to get more books for this.

86
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
Wanna come with me?

87
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,480
No, I haven’t finished what I’ve got here. You go ahead.

88
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,760
What a lazy girl.

89
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,320
Fine, I’m going alone.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Hey, I think the luck is on my side.

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
I got the topic A for my paper.

92
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,480
I can sense that the “A” grade is coming on my way.

93
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,160
Yeah, you are a fortunate bastard.

94
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,400
Grab that “A” okay?

95
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,560
Why? You are jealous of me, aren’t you?

96
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,240
Oi, Khun Kong.

97
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,400
Help me, please?

98
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
I got the topic F.

99
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,040
If you don’t help me, I will get an “F” grade for sure.

100
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,680
Fine, I’ll help you.

101
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,400
Hey Kong,

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,560
which topic did you get?

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,040
I got the topic C.

104
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,520
C?

105
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
That’s the hard one.

106
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,120
But it’s you so it’s not that hard, I guess

107
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,160
Okay, I think I should get more references.

108
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,360
I’m sure something is wrong with Kong.

109
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,720
I guess so.

110
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,000
I think he’s heartbroken.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,320
Heartbroken?

112
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,080
It’s unlikely.

113
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,120
Don’t forget that he was crowded as the Moon of the university.

114
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
So?

115
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,560
Not every people likes the Moon of the university, you know?

116
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Some people may like a second-rate guy like me.

117
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,560
There are those kinds of people too?

118
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,480
Hell yeah.

119
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,560
By the way…

120
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
What about you and that gal?

121
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,360
Is there a progress at all?

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,800
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,840
Go back to your paper.

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,600
Come on. I know you are blushing.

125
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,680
I could just smack your bang out of your head.

126
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,120
Hey, Kongpob.

127
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,280
Which topic did you get?

128
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,520
I got the Chemical Bond topic.

129
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Oh, it’s the same as mine.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,640
Why don’t we work on this together?

131
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,360
We could get it done faster.

132
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,480
Um…

133
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,640
But I’m afraid that I may slow you down.

134
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,560
Come on. It’s two people working together.

135
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Okay…let’s do this.

136
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,560
How much info have you got so far?

137
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
Not much. What about you?

138
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,000
I think I got half of it already.

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,760
I’m finding the rest half.

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,040
Really?

141
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,720
Then it’s me who needs your help.

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,520
Can I sit with you?

143
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,320
Let me help you carry these.

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,680
It’s that way.

145
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,440
Do you have someone that you like?

146
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,000
Hey, Kong.

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,040
Where are you going?

148
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,920
I’m going to sit with May.

149
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,360
We got the same topic.

150
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,920
If you go, who will help me here?

151
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,520
M is useless.

152
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,320
Do what you can first.

153
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,720
I’ll come back and help you with the rest.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,960
Can I sit with you?

155
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,520
How much money should we give P’Tum as a wedding gift?

156
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,800
Can we go dutch?

157
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,720
Well…

158
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,000
I’m running short of money now.

159
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,760
I have prepared a wedding gift for him.

160
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,280
You’ll get him a gift?

161
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,840
No wonder you are his favorite junior.

162
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,600
Well, is it okay to give 20 baht as a cash gift?

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
20 baht?

164
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,600
Yeah.

165
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,760
You are so pathetic.

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,880
Why?

167
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,080
He’s your senior.

168
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,360
only 20 baht, really?

169
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,560
I’m short of money.

170
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,520
This is hard.

171
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,320
Anyway, Arthit. I’m heading out first.

172
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,520
If you are sleepy, why don’t you go home and rest?

173
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,040
You look really drowsy, you know?

174
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,960
Why sitting here and zoning out like you are filming an MV?

175
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
All right, then. See you.

176
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,000
Hey, you are leaving?

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,880
See you, man.

178
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,640
Hey, Arthit

179
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,120
Take these. Your stuff.

180
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,800
How did you get hold of them?

181
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,440
Kongpob asked me to give them to you.

182
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,600
How did he have your books at the first place?

183
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,920
It’s nothing that is matter. Really.

184
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,120
I would like to have an Americano, please

185
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,680
Knot,

186
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,200
is Americano good?

187
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah, it is.

188
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,280
Excuse me.

189
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,760
Can we have one more Americano, please?

190
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
normally, you don’t drink coffee.

191
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,240
Not today. I want to try something new.

192
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,200
So yeah.

193
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
What’s going on with you and that junior?

194
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,440
Which junior?

195
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
Kongpob.

196
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,800
Why did he have to ask me to give you these books?

197
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,160
Why didn’t he return them to you himself?

198
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,360
How the hell should I know?

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
Listen, Arthit.

200
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,160
You can tell me anything, you know?

201
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,800
We are friends.

202
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,680
Yeah, I know.

203
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,240
But there’s no reason to put up argument with that junior.

204
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
Listen, Knot

205
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,680
You really don’t have to worry about me.

206
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,160
Lately I just…

207
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
have some personal problem to deal with.

208
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,120
Personal problem?

209
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,120
You can let it out to me as well.

210
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,440
Well…

211
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,920
A junior is having a crush on me.

212
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,680
And I don’t know what I feel about that person.

213
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,200
I can’t say that I don’t like that person

214
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,160
But I’m not certain that I like that person either.

215
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,560
Well, I don’t really know what to do.

216
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,760
I’m confused.

217
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,400
I’m just confused.

218
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,000
Thank you.

219
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Hey, Knot.

220
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,360
How can you drink this shit?

221
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,880
It’s so damn bitter.

222
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,720
What?

223
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,920
What about you?

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Your favorite drink, the pink milk, is sweet as hell and you can gulp it down.

225
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,120
Cause I like it.

226
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,680
Yeah. It’s because we like it, right?

227
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,440
You don’t always need reasons to like something, you know?

228
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,280
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

229
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
Come on. Shake off your stress.

230
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,800
Come play football with us.

231
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,480
M, why don’t you go play football with Oak?

232
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,680
I’m tired.

233
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,200
Actually, I was about to say that to you too.

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,040
What the hell is wrong with you guys? Seriously.

235
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,320
Fine.

236
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,120
Hey, Kong.

237
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,720
Yes?

238
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,200
I want to ask you something

239
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,960
What is it?

240
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,920
Well…

241
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,360
Well…

242
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,040
Well what?

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
How’d your paper go?

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,720
It’s almost done.

245
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Is this really the question you want to ask me?

246
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,000
We are friends.

247
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,000
Be straight with me if you have something in your mind.

248
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,360
If it’s something I can say,

249
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,720
I’ll say it to you.

250
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,680
Well…

251
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,320
Do you have someone you like yet?

252
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,920
I do.

253
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
What about you?

254
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,200
I also do.

255
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
But I don’t think she likes me.

256
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,120
How do you know that she doesn’t like you?

257
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Have you asked her?

258
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,000
Not yet.

259
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Why don’t you ask her?

260
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,480
What if someone has a crush on you

261
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,520
but you don’t like her?

262
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,720
Will you tell her straightforwardly that you don’t like her?

263
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,320
I think I will.

264
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
I don’t want to lead her on.

265
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,840
What if she is someone you find it’s hard to reject,

266
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,280
what will you do?

267
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,120
I would probably…

268
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,960
…distance myself from that person.

269
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,520
That’s the thing.

270
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,680
Cause I don’t want the relationship between me and her to change.

271
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,920
If I confess my feelings to her,

272
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,320
but she doesn’t like me back,

273
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
She may avoid me.

274
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,560
And I don’t think I can live with that.

275
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,760
So it’s better not to make her dislike me from the get go.

276
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,720
Yeah, you are right.

277
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Sometimes…

278
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
if we keep our feelings to ourselves,

279
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,120
we may not have to lose the person we like at all.

280
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,320
So…

281
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,520
is this the thing that has been stressing you out?

282
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
Um..

283
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,600
and also other things.

284
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,400
By the way, who is the girl that you like?

285
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,280
You don’t need to know.

286
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,400
What about you? Whom do you like?

287
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,960
You don’t need to know too.

288
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,640
I’m heading out first.

289
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,040
Take care, pal.

290
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,600
Are you okay, May?

291
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,880
Where does it hurt?

292
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,760
I’m okay.

293
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,480
Can you get up?

294
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,160
I think you get an ankle sprain.

295
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,360
Can you get up?

296
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,440
I’ll take you to the infirmary.

297
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,800
This sucks, right?

298
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,840
You have to waste your time on this instead of spending it on your paper.

299
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,080
My paper is almost done.

300
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,520
You helped me so much at the library.

301
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,240
Does it still hurt?

302
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,760
It’s really okay.

303
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,240
The pain is quite far from where my heart is.

304
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,800
Let’s try to move this a little.

305
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Oh, sorry.

306
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,600
Does it hurt badly?

307
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,640
It’s hurt a bit at the ankle.

308
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,600
I’ll put it down slowly.

309
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,160
How is it going?

310
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Let me take you home.

311
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,160
Hey, it’s okay.

312
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
It’s getting better now.

313
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,800
You don’t need to take me home.

314
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,040
I’m good on my own.

315
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,160
Just sit here.

316
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,800
You are this hurt.

317
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
How could you go home by yourself?

318
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,200
I said I was going to take you home, didn’t I?

319
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,200
I don’t want to impose on you.

320
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,720
You don’t.

321
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,720
I’m happy to help you.

322
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,120
Uh…Kong.

323
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,640
Yes?

324
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,560
I have something to tell you

325
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,800
I think…

326
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,240
I like you.

327
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,640
May…

328
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
I’m sorry

329
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,800
But I have someone that I like already.

330
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
You know what? It’s all right.

331
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,920
I just want to let you know.

332
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,880
But May, I…

333
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
Well then, I’m heading out first.

334
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,040
I have to go see Maprang.

335
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
Aren’t you going to say anything?

336
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,600
You can console me or something.

337
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,440
Uh…

338
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,880
Well I…

339
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,520
I don’t know what to say.

340
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,240
I should say something that is witty.

341
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,720
But I cannot come up with any.

342
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,920
So I better say nothing.

343
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,960
Well, that’s not cool at all.

344
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,160
Yeah.

345
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,080
I’m not the male lead in this.

346
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,680
I’m just an extra.

347
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,280
That alone is far from being cool.

348
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,400
But for this extra…

349
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,280
just get to be there for the female lead,

350
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,080
that makes him happy enough.

351
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,920
Didn’t you say you could not come up with the witty sayings?

352
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,680
Was that witty already?

353
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,560
Uh…M

354
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,480
Can I ask you this?

355
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,400
Do you like me?

356
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,600
I think I do.

357
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,880
Thank you.

358
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
But I’m not ready for this yet.

359
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,240
You are going to be okay, right?

360
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,080
I understand.

361
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
I have been waiting this long.

362
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,360
It doesn’t hurt to wait a little longer.

363
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,400
Really?

364
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Well…

365
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
you don’t have to like me back,

366
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,200
just don’t change.

367
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,520
And that saying is considered witty too

368
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,920
Oh? It is?

369
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,360
Yeah.

370
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,080
Is it witty really much?

371
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,480
Not bad.

372
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,280
Give me your palm.

373
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,760
Why do you return it to me?

374
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,760
I don’t.

375
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,360
I just want you to take care of it.

376
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,520
You can just drop me your order. You may have to wait a bit but you’ll get it for sure.

377
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,400
Iced coffee.

378
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,040
Pink milk.

379
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,520
Hi, Arthit.

380
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,800
Your usual, right?

381
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,840
Yes. I’ll come back for it later.

382
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,040
All right

383
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,560
I want chicken basil with sunny side egg.

384
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,800
Is my pink milk ready?

385
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,760
Here you are.

386
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,840
Oh, this is not yours.

387
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,720
It’s for this young man. He’s here before you.

388
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,480
I didn’t get to tell you that I run out of pink milk

389
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,400
Is it okay to have something else for now?

390
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,120
It’s okay

391
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,280
I’ll let this person have it.

392
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,560
I’ll come back later.

393
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,080
All right, then.
