1
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,880
With the overwhelming feedback from the fans of Sotus the Series

2
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,520
​either Thai fans or international fans.

3
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,720
​Today, we will take you to the backstage of the series.

4
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,200
and see the journey of this series from the beginning

5
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,320
​how everything was begun

6
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,520
that made these two guys become one of the hottest drama couples today.

7
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
​The first-year students,

8
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,840
how many people are there in your class year?

9
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,760
​I don’t know.

10
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,520
​You don’t know?

11
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,040
​This is just a basic information.

12
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,400
​If I ask you,

13
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,640
​you must know!

14
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,920
​I never count.

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,360
My name is Singto, Prachaya Ruangroj.

16
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
​I play the role of Kongpob.

17
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,880
​Kongpob
​Prachaya Ruangroj

18
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,440
The first-year students,

19
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,920
​where are your nametags?

20
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,680
​Answer louder!

21
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,760
​My name is Krist, Perawat Sangpotirat

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
I play the role of P’Arthit.

23
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,240
​Arthit
​Perawat Sangpotirat

24
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,920
​At the first few acting workshops, we were a bit awkward

25
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
​since we didn’t really know each other well.

26
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
​Not just with P’Singto but also with other fellow cast members.

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,640
​I was a bit nervous when I met them for the first time.

28
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
​I was too afraid to start a conversation

29
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,560
​I wasn’t sure they would want to talk with me.

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,800
​But after we got to work together,

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
​all of us became close

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
​we played around like a troop of monkeys

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,440
​we were really playful.

34
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,640
And now we meet almost every day.

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,000
​I met them more often than my own family.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
​Yeah, something like that.

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,120
​At the first few acting workshops,

38
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,120
​honestly speaking, I was shy to a certain degree.

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,880
​But since I know he’s also a junior from my uni,

40
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,160
​I found that everything went more smoothly.

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
​We got along well when acting.

42
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,680
​Well…

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,560
​take good care of yourself.

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,680
​Have some rest if you are tired.

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
​I’m tired.

46
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,760
​But if you say you love me now.

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,520
​My tiredness will be gone

48
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,680
​How can I say that?

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,120
​Don’t be joking

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,360
​Are you really not going to say it?

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,480
​At first, I originally cast for the role of P’Arthit.

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,520
​but during the audition, I was asked to try out Kongpob’s role.

53
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,760
​And I got a callback for Kongpob’s role.

54
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,120
​With all that,

55
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,120
when we went to the acting workshop and I had to play Kongpob

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,200
​I didn’t get the clear picture of Kongpob’s character.

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,440
​Like…what is Kongpob thinking, what makes he say something like that

58
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,240
​But Krist knows what Kongpob is thinking

59
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,520
​So I went to him…

60
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,880
​“Krist, do you have any idea what he is thinking.”

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,960
​So it was like we took turn to ask

62
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,480
​what P’Arthit is thinking, what Kongpob is thinking

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,720
​We asked such questions back and forth in the first few acting workshops.

64
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
​I felt shy with P’Singto on the casting calls only.

65
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,840
​On the 2nd casting calls, I met him

66
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,480
​I didn’t realize that we both got a callback.

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,040
​So I felt shy at the first few times

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,320
​on that second casting calls, they gave us the scripts to act, right?

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
Yes

70
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
And it’s the Rama VIII bridge scene.

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,720
​Yeah

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,160
​and I didn’t understand a thing.

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,840
​I didn’t know Arthit. I didn’t know Kongpob.

74
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,640
​It was myself acting that role.

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,560
​So I got shy and awkward.

76
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,640
​Because that was myself, not the role of Arthit.

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,320
​I didn’t understand the role yet at the time.

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,640
There was an acting learning session that I had to make my acting partner shy

79
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,480
​That lesson made us…

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,840
​not feel shy toward each other when acting together

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,960
or feel the least

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,680
It’s like the training of suppressing our shyness, right?

83
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,760
Yes.

84
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,320
For example, we had to press our foreheads against each other.

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,600
Like this…

86
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,960
In fact, we can stare at each other all day.

87
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,480
Yes,

88
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,720
we were trained to be hazing seniors.

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
So we must pass this kind of test.

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,600
We were trained to be man and wife.

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,160
To put it simply…so we can easily stare at each other all day

92
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,200
Let’s skip to the next topic

93
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,600
The highlight of the series is the line “I just make you my wife.”

94
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,680
It’s from the first episode.

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,760
He throws that line into my face

96
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,360
It’s the scene that many novel fans are crazy about.

97
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,200
So many people are looking forward to it.

98
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,160
And how many times we acted this scene during the workshop?

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,520
Over 100 of times but every single time we act

100
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,920
we had to make it like the first time.

101
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,720
We must not act like we know what it’s coming.

102
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
Yes, and that’s the hardest part

103
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
we had to go over so many times just for that scene.

104
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,200
How the hell do you do that?

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,720
I just make you my wife.

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,960
I just make you my wife.

107
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
I just make you my wife.

108
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,600
I just make you my wife.

109
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,320
They say, what belongs to your lover is also yours.

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,040
If I can make you my wife,

111
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,840
your gear badge is also mine.

112
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,440
We were asked to switch our roles, right?

113
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
During the acting workshop,

114
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,640
we switched the role so that we understood the emotions of the acting partner. K: Yes, yes.

115
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,760
We had to switched the role.

116
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,480
I played the role of Kongpob and P’Singto played the role of P’Arthit.

117
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,960
Show us now.

118
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,640
Tell me now, Kongpob.

119
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,680
If I decide not to give you this gear badge,

120
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,560
what can you do?

121
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,360
I’ll just take it from you.

122
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,640
What did you just say?

123
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,600
If you don’t want to give me the gear badge,

124
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,240
I have to take it from you.

125
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,600
How the hell do you do that?

126
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,560
I just make you my wife,

127
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,720
They say, what belongs to your lover is also yours.

128
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,120
If I can make you my wife,

129
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,800
your gear badge is also mine.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,400
You son of a…

131
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,880
He’s so fierce.

132
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
My head almost fell off.

133
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,800
Do you understand how I felt now?

134
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,520
That day you grabbed my neck so many times

135
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Kongpob,

136
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,480
are you tired?

137
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,600
Well, the Rama VIII bridge scene

138
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,760
we don’t think it’s difficult, right?

139
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,000
Not at all.

140
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,600
Yes, we could pull that scene out just fine.

141
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,120
Right?

142
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,000
We just had to come to a decision

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,480
how to pull the tie so that we didn’t lose our balance.

144
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,360
And we also tried to find the way to have our kiss look the most realistic.

145
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,680
We worked out the way to pull the tie

146
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,200
so that our head didn’t smash against each other

147
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,440
and to halt at the right position.

148
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,160
So we were like how should we do...

149
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,240
Very easy.

150
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,720
It wasn’t that hard.

151
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,480
Well, it turned out to be the scene that wasn’t too challenging.

152
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,800
We rehearsed during the acting workshop for that scene many times too.

153
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,880
You do know that you are my junior.

154
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,560
I know.

155
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,080
And you do know that I like pink milk.

156
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,080
And sometimes I whine.

157
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,640
I can be really stupid.

158
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,840
I get annoyed easily and flip out.

159
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,160
I get upset easily.

160
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,480
I feel like I want to know you more.

161
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,000
I can’t stand to watch.

162
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh we just hugged. Okay.

163
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,240
I don’t know you well.

164
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,640
But I want to know you more.

165
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,760
What do you mean, P’Arthit.

166
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,600
Don’t!

167
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,480
Something like that.

168
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,840
This is just the beginning.

169
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,120
Let’s find out more how things go.

170
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,440
Stay tuned!

171
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,960
Now, let’s hear which scenes in the series they are impressed.

172
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,160
The scene that I’m impressed?

173
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,560
To me, I like the beach scene.

174
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
We went to Rayong.

175
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
There’s initiation ceremony.

176
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
There are the star bridge tradition,

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
many camping activities,

178
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,720
with obstacle stages and all that.

179
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,320
I like when I told Kongpob to go into the sea

180
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,120
to cool down his head.

181
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
Right? Your head is hot, right?

182
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Are you sure that you can do anything?

183
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
Then, go there at the sea alone.

184
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,120
Your head is hot, right?

185
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,520
Why don’t you cool it down in the sea?

186
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,840
Go!

187
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,040
I like it because…

188
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,520
I had to rush and rescue him.

189
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,480
It was kind of fun.

190
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
Throughout the series, that scene is the most physical demanding.

191
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,720
It’s the only action scene that I enjoy.

192
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,880
I had to run and pull you out from the sea, right?

193
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,360
Yes.

194
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,840
Would you like to know if I felt the same?

195
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,640
Did you have fun? It was fun, right?

196
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,760
I inhaled a lot of water.

197
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,480
Oh really?

198
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,640
Okay, go.

199
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,400
hold on, wait a sec.

200
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,600
Set. Action!

201
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,560
Kongpob, are you okay?

202
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,040
You can’t die on me.

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,320
Set and Action!

204
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,680
Kongpob, are you okay?

205
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,480
You can’t die on me.

206
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,080
The choke on the camera was real.

207
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,720
No acting on that scene.

208
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,440
Was it salty?

209
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,280
It was salty, right?

210
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,160
You better ask if I get a sore throat or not.

211
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
But it was real fun.

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,520
It was the scene that I had to act like

213
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,120
I was freaked out. I was like…

214
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
Gosh!

215
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,200
Not because he is Kongpob.

216
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,040
It’s the burdened feeling of a senior who holds responsibility of a junior’s life.

217
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,440
It was fun. I really like that scene.

218
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,480
What about you?

219
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
What about me?

220
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,160
The scene that impresses me the most…

221
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
Actually, there are many of them that I like

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,080
Yeah, there are plenty of them.

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,800
If we talk about the character,

224
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,640
I like the University Star Contest.

225
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,760
If we talk about the whole series overall,

226
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,120
I like the wrist tying ceremony scene.

227
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,440
You mean the ceremony we performed in the field?

228
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah, right here.

229
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,680
I find the ceremony sacred.

230
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,440
Sacred?

231
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,040
And it made me feel like…

232
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,000
we once participated in the ceremony, right?

233
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,840
So, I felt related to the ceremony a lot.

234
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,000
You can relate to it, right?

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It was like, yeah the hazing ritual has finally ended.

236
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,360
It’s the closure of something we have been endured.

237
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,720
So I’m really impressed by that scene.

238
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,080
And where was I?

239
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,480
You should ask yourself that question.

240
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Ah, P’Arthit was not at the wrist tying ceremony, was he?

241
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,760
Where was he?

242
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,360
He was at the back of the grand stand weeping

243
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,800
So Kongpob missed the ceremony.

244
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,640
He was running around looking for P’Arthit.

245
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,480
You were crying like a baby.

246
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,840
I see. I’m okay with whatever you want to call me.

247
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,520
The most difficult scene for me?

248
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Well, it’s probably the scene where I had to run 54 laps of around the field

249
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,640
You were tired?

250
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,440
Tiredness is one reason.

251
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,280
I was soaking wet too.

252
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,400
I was not only tired but wet.

253
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,480
And I had to get into character

254
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,640
And I had to act like I was annoyed by Kongpob.

255
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,920
And I had to keep on running

256
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,520
I was tired and fell down

257
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,040
I kneeled down on my knees like I had no energy left

258
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,160
but I must get back up.

259
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,400
There were many emotions I had to deliver.

260
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
And Kongpob kept bugging me.

261
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,160
So that scene is difficult in terms of delivering my emotions.

262
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,920
It’s like I must get into character.

263
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
Get up, man.

264
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,960
It’s all right. You are almost there.

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
Arthit, you can do it.

266
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,280
Cut!

267
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,120
Actually, every scene is hard.

268
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,960
Especially when all senior roles were together.

269
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,560
It was really really hard.

270
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,600
Because…

271
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,240
we always play around.

272
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,640
Seriously, we are just a bunch of troublemakers.

273
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,440
Except me, other people are

274
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,200
What? You are actually the gang leader.

275
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,560
No.

276
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,480
Like P’Aof

277
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,640
I’ve got to say that he is incredible.

278
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,680
P’Aof and also Gunsmile

279
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,280
they are really prankish. They like to bug me.

280
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,200
I should call it a physical bullying actually.

281
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,240
They like to kick and hit me.

282
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,880
If they saw me sleeping, they drew pictures on my face and body.

283
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,160
It’s really tiring.

284
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,680
The scene with all the seniors was really exhausting

285
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,920
There was one time…

286
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,440
I was about to get into my action

287
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,200
well I was waiting for the camera to roll

288
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,760
and the signal to start

289
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,720
Gunsmile brought a sharpie.

290
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
He told ICE to grab hold of me.

291
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,720
Then he lifted up my shirt and drew pictures all over my body.

292
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
And that was just a minute before the shooting.

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,680
When the director said “Action”

294
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,520
I must hide everything and got myself ready.

295
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,400
I had to go out there and act and no one knew what happened

296
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,360
It was so exhausting to contain my composure.

297
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,200
It was really hard to keep my composure.

298
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,560
As we were always ready to jump on other people.

299
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,760
If the camera was pointing at me alone

300
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,880
the rest of them would stay at the back of the camera

301
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,280
and began to tease me

302
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,720
Like taking off pants and shirts and then dancing

303
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,600
to make me lose my composure something like that.

304
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,880
It was so exhausting and hard to contain myself when we filmed together.

305
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,400
He didn’t talk about himself at all

306
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,160
what he also did behind the camera.

307
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,400
I was just sitting there and waiting for you.

308
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,440
Give me a break.

309
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,280
Yeah, I was just sitting.

310
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,400
Come on. You must read the scripts for me but you were like

311
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Really?

312
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,360
All of you.

313
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,240
Did I do that?

314
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,880
The camera was on me for a close up.

315
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
And the whole first-year actors and hazing crew actors

316
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,040
were goofing around behind the camera.

317
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,520
I hardly contained my composure.

318
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,240
My head was totally spinned.

319
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,800
That’s why I say all the scene are hard.

320
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,080
The more people, the harder.

321
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,800
And action.

322
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
Come on.

323
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,160
Stop it. I beg you.

324
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,560
The scene that I got shy the most?

325
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,120
It’s the Thank you party scene.

326
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,160
Many things happened in that scene.

327
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,040
Everything.

328
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,480
And the kiss scene is there.

329
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,920
And I’ve got to tell you that the kiss was…

330
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,680
It was the first kiss of the series.

331
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,640
Of the filming.

332
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,960
According to the storyline, the Rama VIII bridge scene comes first.

333
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,080
But for the kiss scene, the one on the rooftop was filmed first.

334
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,560
So the scene on the rooftop is the first kiss between us.

335
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,120
It’s literally the first kiss.

336
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,880
So many things were going on that day.

337
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,160
The scene was purely shy feelings, to a great deal of extent.

338
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,040
Really really shy.

339
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,800
I saw that your earlobes were red

340
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
They were.

341
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,280
They were red indeed.

342
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,320
It’s the kiss scene. The kiss!

343
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,120
So I couldn’t help getting shy.

344
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Didn’t you tell me you were not shy?

345
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,480
Seriously, the kiss part is not difficult.

346
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,280
The moment we kissed is not difficult at all

347
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,360
But the moment we had to lean in is.

348
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
We had to slowly lean in

349
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,840
Yes, closer and closer.

350
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,040
It’s difficult. But when we reached there, the hardest part is over.

351
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,960
Can’t we sit closer than this?

352
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,680
It’s too far, right?

353
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,280
That scene is the one we got truly shy.

354
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,400
the most.

355
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,960
Yes, because we must get shy for real.

356
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,520
We have to act like we are really shy.

357
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,720
Well, I don’t want to come on too strong.

358
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,840
Yeah, but you didn’t seem to let go too easy. Seriously.

359
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,680
It was short. Very short.

360
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,120
I just nibbled a bit then released.

361
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,560
You just keep nibbling and nibbling.

362
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,320
And he said he went easy on me already.

363
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,120
Not only P’Arthit and N’Kongpob.

364
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,640
Other cast members were all perky and misbehaving too.

365
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,000
3…4

366
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
What scene is this?

367
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
P’Aof is the show stealer.

368
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,160
Yes, he’s the show stealer.

369
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,280
His lines in the series are actually not many.

370
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,800
And he refused to follow the scripts he got.

371
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,080
He created his own.

372
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
He has his own impromptu.

373
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,360
Like when P’Tuta asked. What is it?

374
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,080
About dating. Have you ever been in a relationship?

375
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,920
how many girlfriends have you had so far?

376
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,560
In what level of relationship do we have to have to call them “girlfriends”

377
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,880
Well, if we count those one-night stands, I have like hundreds of them.

378
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,680
Hundreds of them?

379
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,280
You should seek doctor advice now.

380
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,640
Seek doctor advice.

381
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,360
That line was really hilarious when he said

382
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,600
At the time, it was really hilarious.

383
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
It was not in the scripts.

384
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
He improvised that line himself.

385
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,400
He could play the role of P’Bright as if it was himself.

386
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,680
Snore loudly, okay?

387
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,000
Usually, I get on people’s nerves all the time.

388
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,920
When I was on the set

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,560
and the lead actor, Krist

390
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,240
he’s the type of person who gets on people’s nerves as well.

391
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,000
So he could respond to my gags swiftly.

392
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,680
Let’s say that whenever all hazer seniors are together…

393
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,600
there was nothing that is decent in that shooting scene.

394
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,280
Just full of (crap)

395
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,520
misbehaving people. Yeah, that.

396
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,000
Like when the camera was pointing at me only,

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
There would come right away, Gunsmile was right here.

398
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,560
And Krist was right there.

399
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,920
They just danced ridiculously

400
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,120
while I had to look stern.

401
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,800
They tried to make me lose my composure and get NG.

402
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,360
Gunsmile?

403
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,200
Arthit, you do it.

404
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
Wishing them good luck?

405
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,040
Hurry up.

406
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,320
Stop squeezing my butt please.

407
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,640
if we compare him with a car

408
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,480
he has more horsepower than others.

409
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
He has this extra energy.

410
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,480
Even though we had been working from 6 a.m. until midnight

411
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,920
Gunsmile would still be active as he always is.

412
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,880
His energy wasn’t decreased even one bit.

413
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,000
I acted with Fluke.

414
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,440
He is…

415
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,680
He is a lovely person.

416
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,520
but…

417
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
most of the time, we couldn’t understand what he says.

418
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,360
He’s a quiet and reserved person.

419
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,200
Just like the role he’s got in the series.

420
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,760
The character is just like him.

421
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,880
If I have to choose a character in the series to date,

422
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,520
who do I choose?

423
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,040
Well if it’s for dating, then the character must be a female character, right?

424
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:26,960
But the one that is the most adorable, I think it’s Wad character.

425
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,920
Wad is a rough guy

426
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,840
and later he…

427
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,520
well, personally, I like someone whose manner can be changed.

428
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,600
I like someone who feels comfortable to pay respect to others.

429
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,400
And Wad can change himself for that.

430
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
He used to be a stiff and cold person.

431
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
Then he changed to a sensitive person.

432
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,200
He’s cute when he’s quiet and have few words to say.

433
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
It was fun in every scene actually.

434
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,560
Whenever I appeared, I got to piss at someone.

435
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,120
It was real fun.

436
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,000
Wad appeared and get moody.

437
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,240
Actually I used to be an anti of SOTUS system.

438
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,960
I didn’t like SOTUS, just like Wad.

439
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,400
But..

440
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,240
But later I found that there is some good in this system.

441
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,320
Like it is said in the screenplay,

442
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,880
it helps bond juniors and seniors

443
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,760
it helps maintain the traditions

444
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,560
and also many things…

445
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
that are beneficial to us.

446
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,840
I asked you nicely, didn’t I?

447
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Why do you have to bring my mother into this?

448
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
I can’t remember my lines.

449
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,720
It’s “What do you want?”

450
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,640
Start from the top.

451
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,240
Fluke is somewhat a special person.

452
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,720
He’s from another world.

453
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,520
You have to clear your mind before you go talk to him.

454
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,760
You must not overthink when talking to him.

455
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,960
Don’t overthink

456
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,200
or try to think along.

457
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Just listen to him.

458
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,920
Don’t try to understand him.

459
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,120
You don’t need to get anything from his talks.

460
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,600
Make some conversations and leave it all there.

461
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,800
You talk to him just to maintain the relationship with him.

462
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,040
We once looked for him so that the shooting could start.

463
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,840
And he was just outside reading a book.

464
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,880
There was a time when Fluke was reading a book.

465
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,520
I asked “Hey, what are you reading?”

466
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,680
“It’s the life after death, man”

467
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,480
And he would elaborate the valuable points he gets from the book in details.

468
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,280
And it would last more than 2 hours.

469
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
Oh, just now…

470
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
What happened?

471
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,520
We talked and it was funny

472
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
I laughed and stepped back and hit the locker.

473
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,080
With whom?

474
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
I was laughing with Gunsmile.

475
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
And he is someone you shouldn’t involve with.

476
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,760
Or you get cursed like me.

477
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,040
I played and stepped back to the locker.

478
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,840
Let me see.

479
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,960
Then I lie down on the floor as it hurts.

480
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,680
People thought that I was pretending to get hurt.

481
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,160
Because I was good at acting.

482
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,320
So no one believes that I got into an accident.

483
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,200
Does it hurt badly?

484
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,600
Yes, but no one believes me

485
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,040
Action, P’new is sleeping.

486
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,320
I was speechless.

487
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,760
After I finish and it was supposed to be P’New’s turn to speak.

488
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,840
But he was silent.

489
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,880
So I turned to him and said “P’New”

490
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
He was sleeping.

491
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,240
Like he was soundly sleeping, you know?

492
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,000
And we got the signal “Action”

493
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We always see him either sleep or eat.

494
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,320
I must warn you not to mess with the sunlight in Thailand.

495
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
Normally I wear the short with sleeves this long

496
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,560
but the sleeves of this SOTUS’ shirt is this short.

497
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,080
Look at the sunburn.

498
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,200
You can clearly see the tan line.

499
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,320
If you don’t believe, here’s another proof.

500
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,680
Look at the tan line.

501
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,840
P’New is the person that…

502
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,480
Not sure if he is afraid of the sunlight or not.

503
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,040
But a whole bottle of sunscreen.

504
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,600
He can use it up

505
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,880
in one day.

506
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,400
One bottle of sunscreen in one day.

507
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,800
He applies it on his skin all the time.

508
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,880
like coating a generous amount of cement

509
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,280
I’m sure even a bullet can’t get through his skin.

510
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,000
He keeps on applying it all day,

511
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,240
every hour seriously.

512
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,240
I think…

513
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,560
you like me.

514
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,880
No, I don’t!

515
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,160
Not that line yet.

516
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,800
I mix it up again, ain’t I?

517
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,400
Damn right!

518
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,760
Well, we also wonder about their relationship off camera.

519
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,680
Why don’t we hear it from other cast members?

520
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,080
I saw them for the first time on the Brahmin rite day for the series.

521
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,920
And while we were in this room,

522
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,760
I had this idea that Krist secretly liked me.

523
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,560
His eye contact was strange. But that could be in my head.

524
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,280
Then I saw him with Singto.

525
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,760
And I thought they could be an item.

526
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,160
But in the end, after they worked together and got close.

527
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,480
They could set apart the work life and the personal life.

528
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,720
They can separate those. And I find them lovely to do so.

529
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,560
P’Krist and P’Singto are already close.

530
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,200
They knew each other before the series.

531
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,160
How should I put this?

532
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,400
it’s like there’s no empty space between them.

533
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,920
When they are together, they are like

534
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,840
brothers and friends who care for each other.

535
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,440
Off camera, they usually tease each other.

536
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,560
They seem to enjoy pestering each other all the time.

537
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,320
P’Singto likes to pull Krist’s cheek

538
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,680
and Krist will be like “Hey, what are you doing?”

539
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,480
Yeah, something like that.

540
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,440
They like to pull a prank on each other

541
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,440
either on camera or off camera

542
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,600
Look at the camera. It’s right here.

543
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,440
Hold onto my waist.

544
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,920
P’Krist sleeps all the time.

545
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,160
Seriously, if he’s free, he will sleep.

546
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,480
And on the few first time we met, he sang all the time.

547
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,840
Yeah, he likes to sing and sleep all the time.

548
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,680
I had a lot of scenes with P’Singto.

549
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,840
He is really serious when it comes to work.

550
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,360
He makes his mind clear before acting in any scene.

551
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,120
Every time, be it a minor scene or a big scene

552
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,480
And before getting into action

553
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,800
he would go over his lines and make sure he memorizes them all.

554
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,120
He is like… what do you call..

555
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,200
he rehearses the lines with me all the time.

556
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,960
So I’m impressed that he works really hard.

557
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,600
But what I want to gossip about him is this.

558
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,800
He is a game addict

559
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,480
Really really much.

560
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,800
Our conversation starts with a game topic.

561
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,760
What are you doing?

562
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,680
Playing a game.

563
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,520
I look like a game addict?

564
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,480
Is he a game addict?

565
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,520
definiately

566
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,720
So the previous break, we were so done.

567
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,600
We shouldn’t mess with them.

568
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,040
We wonder if we ever step on their feet.

569
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,760
why did they seem to enjoy getting back at us?

570
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,080
They seem to love us a lot.

571
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,280
Anyway, thank you all the cast members who are so lovely.

572
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,680
I want to ask them

573
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,720
They have burned our ears down.

574
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,680
After all this time, we can’t get you to love us?

575
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,560
Now, let’s hear P’Arthit and Kongpob

576
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,880
answer the questions that their fans ask.

577
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,960
Yes, here’s the first questions, P’Singto.

578
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Yes.

579
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,680
If you can choose to play other roles in Sotus the Series

580
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,840
the character in the series.

581
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
that’s not your own role.

582
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,000
Which role do you want to take? Why?

583
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,120
I want to try the role of “M”

584
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,040
M?

585
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,920
Yes.

586
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,440
Why? Do you want to end up with May?

587
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,840
No, I think M’s character is…

588
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,600
Is it a good idea to stand next to May?

589
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
She’s a tall girl.

590
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,080
No, actually I have the same height as May.

591
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,360
Oh, I see. I see.

592
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,760
Yeah. I do.

593
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,760
Got it. Got it.

594
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,040
Okay, you want to play the role of M.

595
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,120
Yes, because M’s character is seemed to…

596
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,720
I don’t know…his character is pretty intriguing

597
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,800
Ah, intriguing character.

598
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,360
He has a crush. It’s a one-sided love.

599
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,160
And I want to play the role of May.

600
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,080
So he has a crush on me.

601
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,320
How does this sound?

602
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,000
I must have the upper hand

603
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
I must answer something that gives me an advantage, right?

604
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,400
If Kongpob doesn’t give the gear,

605
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,080
what else does Kongpob want P’Arthit to take care of?

606
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,000
Take care of his heart?

607
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,040
Take care of his tummy

608
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,000
It’s itchy, he needs someone to scratch an itch

609
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Scratch like this. [Note: Krist makes a joke by playing on words in Thai.]

610
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,800
Go laugh at this gag of yours alone in the field.

611
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,640
All right, what would you like P’Arthit to take care of?

612
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,800
Don’t say your heart.

613
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,320
It’s too cliché. It’s getting old.

614
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,280
If it’s not the gear, what will it be?

615
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,760
Not only you have rained on my parade,

616
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,160
You have also taken away my answer.

617
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,080
Come on. Don’t say the heart.

618
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,960
Well, I may ask him to keep…

619
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,680
Your dorm’s key?

620
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,440
All right. What is it?

621
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,520
How about a necktie?

622
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,640
A necktie?

623
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,400
So I can use it as an excuse.

624
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,000
“P’Arthit krup, I left my tie in your room.”

625
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,560
“You don’t see me with the tie

626
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,000
because I forgot it in your room.” something like this.

627
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
So you want me to tie you a tie?

628
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,880
Or you want to come get it at my dorm?

629
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,960
I go get it at your dorm.

630
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,120
Don’t you have a phone? You can just call me to bring it to you.

631
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,480
Let’s hear the next question.

632
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,080
Kongpob wants to make Arthit his wife.

633
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,200
What about Arthit?

634
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,880
What does Arthit want to do with Kongpbo?

635
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,600
Make him his wife too!

636
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,080
I want to be the hubbie.

637
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,320
I want to be the hubbie for once.

638
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,760
Can’t I? Let’s switch the role.

639
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,120
Normally, we call it by rock scissors paper game.

640
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,800
Well, Kongpob wants to make me his wife, right?

641
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,920
I want to make him his wife too.

642
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,560
It’s like Star Wars. Do you know what I mean?

643
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,880
The sword fight.

644
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,320
Let’s move on to the next topic.

645
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,560
Yeah, that’s my answer.

646
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,400
I want to make Kongpob my...

647
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,280
fine, my hubbie then.

648
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,120
Why do I have to be the wifey?

649
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,720
All right, there’s another question for us.

650
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,440
Kongpob, have May returned your eraser yet?

651
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,520
May…

652
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,480
when will you return my eraser?

653
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,960
I have been waiting for too long.

654
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,240
You will never get it.

655
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,360
I have it with me.

656
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,480
Yes, I used it up already too.

657
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,440
How did you get hold of it?

658
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Well, I asked for it from May.

659
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,960
And she gave it to you?

660
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,760
I told May…

661
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,520
“Go away, he already turned you down. Go.”

662
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,840
Krist krup.

663
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,000
Your nickname, The Emoticon Face Hazer

664
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,080
Where is it from?

665
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,400
Can you show us now?

666
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,640
No can do.

667
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,440
You have to.

668
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,720
This is a very special episode.

669
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,640
Really?

670
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,520
I just can’t. It can be done only once.

671
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,320
At that scene, P’Aof snored.

672
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,720
And I got really annoyed so I made such expression

673
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,360
And the nickname, Dancing Hazers.

674
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,800
What is it?

675
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
How do you get that name?

676
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,080
Perhaps, those hazers like to dance.

677
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,400
But not me, I can’t dance.

678
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,720
Please show the VTR now.

679
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,600
And see who leads the dance.

680
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,560
For the questions from audiences.

681
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,840
There’s one question that I like.

682
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,240
What is the meaning of “The first year who loves to flirt.”?

683
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,720
I have no idea how they got that name too.

684
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,240
It’s just a false claim. It’s simply a misunderstanding.

685
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,400
Because among the first-year roles, no one knows how to flirt.

686
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,240
Not even one, right.

687
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,120
Not even one.

688
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Well, I gave him my gear.

689
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,000
He has the symbol that represents my heart.

690
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,920
I don’t know what he thinks.

691
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,560
I’m shy but yeah. I have made a move

692
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,360
But I also have a duty…

693
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,800
of your boyfriend too

694
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,360
Your heart is completely melt.

695
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,080
Well, to the fans who has been following Sotus the Series from the beginning

696

697
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,000
I once was just a hazer in my uni and known by a handful of people.

698
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,360
now I’m a hazer in the series that became known by many people.

699
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,200
Now more and more people know me.

700
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,480
The amount of people who know me have increased tremendously.

701
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,120

702
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,840
They love me and want to support me.

703
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,520

706
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,480
and brought me food.

707
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,720
