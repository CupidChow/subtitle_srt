1
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,960
Hold your friends’ shoulder. Go!

2
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,160
Seriously, what do we get from those gathering activities?

3
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,640
Like our study is not hard enough.

4
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,880
Why do they need us to waste time on such things?

5
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
Why do we have to join?

6
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
I couldn’t be bothered.

7
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,240
Hey guys,

8
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,680
How many more times do I have to tell you how to do this properly?

9
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,960
Actually, it was almost okay.

10
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,400
But please be more enthusiastic.

11
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,280
All right. Try again.

12
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,040
We are engineer. Here we go. 3…4

13
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,480
Right now,

14
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,120
I heard that many freshmen are not going to join the freshmen activities.

15
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Actually, we all know this and have seen it on Facebook and other social networks.

16
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,680
A freshman tried to avoid my eye contact too.

17
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
I doubt they have a crush on me.

18
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,560
I think you need a mirror.

19
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,520
Why don’t we just grab their neck to the gathering?

20
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,360
Take it easy, Prem.

21
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,600
By the way, that pretty face junior. What’s his name?

22
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,240
I’m about to bring that up too.

23
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
How could you let that boy do that to you?

24
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
I already punished him according to our rules.

25
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,600
What else do you want me to do?

26
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,800
Fuck the rules!

27
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,640
It’s so clear that we can’t control them.

28
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,720
You must be harsher to him.

29
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,800
It’s too harsh already.

30
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
Teachers are keeping a close watch on our activities.

31
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,520
Come on. Calm down, you guys.

32
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,320
We can just teach them something with reasons.

33
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
That should be okay.

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,440
I agree.

35
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,200
I think those freshmen don’t understand what we are trying to do here.

36
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,520
Those brats can’t be taught with reasons.

37
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,520
Drink this and chill yourself down. You are boiling.

38
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
Listen, Arthit.

39
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,680
If something like that happens again, you show them who’s the boss.

40
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,960
Don’t let them cross the line like that.

41
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,960
We are their seniors.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,520
They are just juniors.

43
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,520
Thanks, man.

44
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,880
Hey, Wad.

45
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Why do you look so furious at those third-year seniors?

46
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,160
I often involved in a fight with seniors when I was in high school.

47
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
They started first.

48
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,200
They ganged up me with 3-5 friends of them.

49
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,960
I got suspended from school for that.

50
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
I think I’m taking off first.

51
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
I don’t know if those guys will stop drinking easily.

52
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Take care of the bill for me.

53
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,200
Money. Money.

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,840
I have only 20 baht.

55
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,320
Take just this first.

56
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,000
I’ll pay you back later.

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
This is all my dad gave me.

58
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,760
Where’s Wad?

59
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,160
He already went back.

60
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,800
This is from Wad and me.

61
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,920
You should look up to him.

62
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,080
You should too, you rarely come to class and hang out with friends.

63
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,280
Hey, Kong.

64
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,760
I want to ask you something.

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,840
Why did you say that you would make P’Arthit your wife that day?

66
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,200
What else could I do?

67
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,640
He was being harsh to me first.

68
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,920
You keep getting on those seniors’ nerves.

69
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,320
And we have to get the consequences by your act.

70
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,520
Those seniors are so damn scary.

71
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,000
Why do you have to be scared?

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
They are human like us.

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,680
Perhaps, they are not human.

74
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,560
Then what are they?

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,400
They are spirits of the seniors who can’t get reborn.

76
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,440
So they are stick around and haunt freshmen year after year.

77
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,360
Have you guys heard about the haunting general classroom building?

78
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,960
Is there such a story?

79
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,200
They say people keep hearing a moaning sound from the general classroom at night.

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,480
You don’t believe this, right?

81
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,800
Let me tell you the whole story.

82
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,680
A senior forgot his lecture note in a classroom.

83
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,960
So he went back in the building to find his note at night alone.

84
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,760
When he got in there, he heard a moan from a room.

85
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,840
So he decided to open the door to see.

86
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
There he found a man.

87
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,280
That senior asked that man

88
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,280
“Are you okay?”

89
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
That man slowly turned to the senior.

90
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
And walked toward the senior.

91
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,760
Closer and closer.

92
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,000
That man’s face was soaked with blood.

93
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
And the best of all,

94
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,280
that man suddenly yelled

95
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
“Be silent! How many students are there in your year class?”

96
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,120
“Keep your head down.”

97
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,040
I should just smack you, man.

98
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,240
He’s dead but he’s still hazing?

99
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,840
Didn’t you say you had a lot of assignment to do?

100
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
And you wanted to skip the gathering, didn’t you?

101
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,840
And what is this?

102
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,960
Well, we are stressed out a bit from the study so we are here to drink and relax.

103
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,520
You are under a lot of stress, aren’t you?

104
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,720
Then, the more the merrier, right?

105
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,760
Totally agree.

106
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
Hey, Mr.

107
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,480
They are trashed like a dog.

108
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
Your stress should be gone now.

109
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,080
Go! Go home!

110
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,840
Take care of your friends too.

111
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,400
Those two are helpless

112
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,480
Wake up. Go.

113
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,520
Arthit,

114
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,480
Let me talk to the freshmen today.

115
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,800
I have something to tell them.

116
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,360
Today, I want to talk about showing respect to your seniors.

117
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,800
But I let P’Prem coach you about it.

118
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,080
As we got enrolled here before you.

119
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,880
So we have experiences,

120
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,440
knowledge,

121
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,440
and the viewpoints much more than you.

122
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,560
That means what you should have and give to your seniors

123
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,000
is “respect.”

124
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,640
This morning!

125
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,480
A first year walked pass me and didn’t pay respect to me by a Wai.

126
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,880
If you know that I’m talking about you, stand up

127
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,520
I have asked and no one wants to admit.

128
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
Then you all stand up

129
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
I said STAND UP!

130
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,960
Everyone, sit and stand

131
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,800
Keep doing it until someone admits.

132
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,280
Go.

133
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,120
1..2..3

134
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,840
Are you talking about me?

135
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,000
The rest, sit down.

136
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
Why didn’t you Wai me?

137
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,920
I asked you. Why didn’t you Wai me?

138
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,160
Are you dumb?

139
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,760
Why do I have to Wai you?

140
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,680
I’m your senior.

141
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,560
You must pay respect to me by a Wai.

142
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
A Wai?

143
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,600
What do I owe you?

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,280
Why do I have to do that to you?

145
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,440
I’m older than you.

146
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,520
You must Wai me!

147
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,040
If I Wai you,

148
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,120
it will end everything, right?

149
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,120
So I’ll just do it to cut the crap!

150
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,960
Damn right!

151
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,240
You must Wai me now!

152
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Is this how your family teach you to Wai?

153
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,520
They taught me right.

154
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,280
But they told me to do that to the one I respect.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,320
But for the person like you, this is more than enough.

156
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,000
Do you want to f-k with me?

157
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
Enough.

158
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,680
Get the hell out of here now.

159
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,280
Get out.

160
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Fine. I’m going.

161
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,560
Do you think I want to be here?

162
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,480
Get the hell out of here.

163
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,600
If any of you don’t like this, just go.

164
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Everyone, keep your head down

165
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,360
Kong, why don’t you walk out with Wad?

166
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,200
I want to know what they will do next.

167
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,880
Seriously, is this the time to be nosy?

168
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
All right.

169
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,880
Call me if anything.

170
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,960
What did Wad say?

171
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,800
Is he coming to work with us?

172
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,760
He said he’d rather work alone at his dorm

173
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,640
Well well. He’s probably still moody.

174
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,840
He should not have picked an argument with P’Prem like that.

175
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,400
Yeah. But I think the seniors are being unreasonable too.

176
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,480
But it won’t get this worse if one of them steps back.

177
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,640
The one who should step back must be the younger one after all.

178
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,440
Why?

179
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Why can’t those seniors give in to us?

180
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,800
It shouldn’t even become a question.

181
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Why do they do that? They are seniors

182
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,040
But we also deserve to be respected.

183
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,760
The mutual respect isn’t the matter of seniors or juniors

184
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,480
Hold on, Kong.

185
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,920
You too.

186
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,360
Can’t you give in to the seniors for once?

187
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,880
You don’t need to provoke them every time.

188
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
He’s right.

189
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,200
In the end, it’s us who get the consequences.

190
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,080
And you? Yeah, you get the consequences too.

191
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,480
Why do you still keep looking for troubles?

192
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,280
I would like to say something as the head of the hazers.

193
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,640
Prem, I think you crossed the line today.

194
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,040
You can bawl those freshmen out,

195
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,320
but you can’t use your anger on them.

196
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,440
Do you expect me to pamper that freshman?

197
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,440
And didn’t you see how disturbing he looks?

198
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,280
Do you want me to kneel down and beg him?

199
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,480
The more we go easy on those juniors, the more they are undisciplined.

200
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,160
We don’t have to go easy on them.

201
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,720
But it’s not right to throw a fit at them like that.

202
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,400
Not throwing a fit?

203
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,760
How to haze without throwing a fit?

204
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,760
Do you think they will listen to what we tell them?

205
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,840
Cool down, man.

206
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,480
You are boiling again.

207
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,840
Prem,

208
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,680
I’m okay to have you stand out there in front of the gathering.

209
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,160
But you are not allowed to discipline the juniors.

210
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,400
Was I so wrong?

211
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,720
Yes, you were.

212
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,680
You were definitely wrong this time, Prem.

213
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,600
Listen to me.

214
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
We are dealing with a new generation of young people

215
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,400
We need to adapt the approaches.

216
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
We must learn these along with the juniors.

217
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,320
It’s not like we can’t be wrong just because we are older.

218
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,720
I also admit that I went too far on the first day.

219
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,520
I hope you can look back at your own action too, Prem.

220
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Sawasdee, P’Deer.

221
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,920
I heard everything.

222
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,120
Arthit, What the hell are you doing?

223
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,320
How could you let so many freshmen skip the activities like this?

224
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,880
And this is not the first time

225
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,480
But we have done our best under that circumstance.

226
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,160
Are you sure you have done your best?

227
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
I want to ask all of you to have a fix with me.

228
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,120
This evening, there are many friends of yours skip this freshman gathering.

229
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,400
I want to know the reason.

230
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
Can any of you answer me?

231
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,440
You, stand up.

232
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,320
Where’s your name tag?

233
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,880
I forgot it.

234
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,880
You forgot it?

235
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,880
Do you think I give you the name tag as an accessory?

236
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
I’ve told you…

237
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,440
how important the name tags are to all of you.

238
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,440
The name tags will let your fellow freshmen and your seniors know who you are.

239
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,960
But you don’t bring it with you.

240
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,240
Does this mean you don’t want us to know you?

241
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
No, it’s not.

242
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,760
Then it means that your friends know you well enough

243
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,880
so you decide to leave it behind.

244
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,920
Well, let me prove it

245
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,960
and see if your friends really know you well.

246
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,800
Everyone, raise your head.

247
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,960
Look at this friend of yours.

248
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,400
Any of you know him?

249
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,360
Anyone?

250
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,960
No one hangs out with him or what?!

251
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,480
His name is M.

252
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,360
Who answered that?

253
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,520
It’s me.

254
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,200
0062, Kongpob.

255
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
Do you really know this man?

256
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,480
Yes.

257
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,280
Give me your ID card.

258
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,120
What is his real name?

259
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,280
Kathawuth.

260
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,920
His birthdate.

261
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,360
December 12, 1998.

262
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,560
His home address.

263
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,640
180 Asadang Rd.,

264
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,440
Wang Burapapirom sub-district,

265
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,200
Pranakorn district,

266
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,760
Bangkok 10200

267
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,200
His ID number.

268
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,120
1100 800 951 669

269
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,480
Did he eat the friggin’ civil registration or what?

270
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,400
Take it back.

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,240
It seems you know him really well.

272
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,680
But I want to know if you know other freshmen as good as your friend.

273
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
Everyone, flip your name tags face down.

274
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,960
Student ID 0023, stand up!

275
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
What is her name?

276
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,560
Maprang.

277
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,640
Student ID 0075.

278
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,000
Tew.

279
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,320
Oak.

280
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,160
Fai.

281
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Naew.

282
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,880
Praepailin.

283
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
Student ID 0151.

284
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,520
Stand up!

285
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,040
What is her name?

286
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
I asked you “what is her name?!”

287
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
Give me your name tag.

288
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,360
I have already told you…

289
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
why I gave you these name tags.

290
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,760
Because I want you to pay attention to your friends.

291
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,480
But you can’t even remember her name.

292
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
If this thing is meaningless to you,

293
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,480
then you don’t need it.

294
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,600
Take this to your heart

295
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,080
This shows that you don’t care your friends well enough.

296
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,960
Arthit won this round.

297
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
That’s all from me today.

298
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,840
I hope the next time we meet,

299
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,680
you all have the name tag with you.

300
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,120
But if you think you know everyone of you well enough,

301
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,680
don’t bother to put it on.

302
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,600
I’ll look forward to what you will do.

303
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,520
Do you understand?

304
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,360
Yes.

305
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,800
Look.

306
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,120
I don’t think it ends yet.

307
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
I’m sorry.

308
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,000
What’s your name?

309
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,680
My name is May.

310
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,680
Here, take this.

311
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,640
But…

312
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,800
Kongpob!

313
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600
What are you doing?

314
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,640
I’m giving my name tag to her.

315
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,120
What for?

316
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,160
Who told you to do this?

317
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,320
No one.

318
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,080
But I couldn’t remember her name.

319
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,920
It’s my fault.

320
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,560
I have to be responsible for this.

321
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,920
But you know, right?

322
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,440
If you give that to her, you won’t have your own name tag anymore.

323
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
And you also know, right?

324
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,960
If you don’t have the name tag,

325
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,520
I consider that you are breaking the year class’ rules.

326
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,000
I do know it.

327
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,000
Good.

328
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,800
We’ll see.

329
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,400
Haven’t you ever learned about unity at all?

330
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,560
People keep skipping this freshman gathering.

331
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,040
And you are always late in getting in the line when you are here.

332
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,160
You are never ready when you are told to do something.

333
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,000
Even I’m giving you a discipline now, you are still not ready.

334
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,800
You never know about the word “unity”?

335
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,040
Or you don’t bother to take this word to your brain.

336
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
It’s all right.

337
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,880
If you don’t know it,

338
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
let me take this opportunity to teach you.

339
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,520
But I must warn you first

340
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,160
for my teaching approaches…

341
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,840
if you think you are weak,

342
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,640
or it’s beyond your physical limit,

343
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,960
feel free to leave.

344
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,320
Good

345
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,720
I must applaud your spirit here.

346
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,880
But spirit alone is not enough!

347
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,480
Raise your head and look at my friend back there.

348
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,520
Do you see my friends over there?

349
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,920
You all must run and get in line in front of them within 3 minutes.

350
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,560
If you can’t make it,

351
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,240
You will be punished with the amount of overdue time.

352
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,760
Why are you still sitting looking all dumb?

353
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,160
The time is running.

354
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,040
Go!

355
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,760
Quicker!

356
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Too slow!

357
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,120
Hold your friends’ shoulder!

358
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,600
1..2...3

359
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,680
Line up!

360
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,000
Too slow!

361
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,720
Everyone, hold your friends’ shoulder.

362
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,200
Sit and stand 100 times.

363
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,760
Go.

364
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,200
Sit and stand 100 times. Go.

365
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,400
1..2..

366
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,280
67..68..69

367
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,680
70..71..72..73

368
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,480
The nurse staff, please come in!

369
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,760
What’s wrong with her?

370
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,000
She’s hyperventilating.

371
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,320
Don’t lay her down.

372
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,960
Get a bag and have her breathe into it.

373
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,400
If she’s not getting better, take her to the infirmary.

374
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,680
A paper is fine. Hurry.

375
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,240
What are you looking at?

376
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,200
I told you, right?

377
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,800
If you think it’s beyond your physical limit,

378
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,360
please step out.

379
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,440
I can’t be responsible for your life.

380
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,800
If anything happens again,

381
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,760
I’ll let you struggle like that.

382
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,520
And your fellow freshmen will be punished instead of you.

383
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
All right.

384
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,440
I’m gonna call it a day.

385
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,440
I hope you learn more about the unity now

386
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,000
But don’t ever forget it.

387
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,960
If you forget it,

388
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,320
I’ll teach it from the top.

389
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,800
Dismiss!

390
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,360
Are you okay?

391
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,720
I’m okay.

392
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,240
What’s wrong with him?

393
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,760
He hurts his leg.

394
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,520
Sit down first.

395
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,480
Let me check it.

396
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,040
Apply a pain relief balm for a few days should do.

397
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,080
But I’m out of the balm now.

398
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,680
I’ve already asked my friend to buy it.

399
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Can you wait?

400
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,760
By the way, Kongpob. It’s great to see you here.

401
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,960
My friend wants to talk to you about the faculty’s star contest.

402
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,080
We would like to nominate you as the male representative from our major.

403
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,840
Are you free now? Do you have any plan after this?

404
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,720
We are going to eat after this.

405
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,720
Then, you guys can have this. Go ahead take it.

406
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,360
Wait for my friend a bit.

407
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,400
Is it okay to let me have your food here?

408
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,880
It’s totally okay.

409
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,760
We bought plenty of this food for those senior hazers.

410
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,120
They eat a lot.

411
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,520
They usually take two serves of food.

412
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,200
It’s never enough so we always buy a lot.

413
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,360
Nah, if these food boxes are for the senior hazers,

414
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
we don’t dare to take it.

415
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,240
What to be afraid of?

416
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,880
You know what?

417
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,280
The very persons who care about you guys the most…

418
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,800
are those hazers.

419
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,960
Go ahead, take it.

420
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,120
And have these oranges too. I bought so many of them.

421
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,520
Just wait for my friend a little bit.

422
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,880
Hey, Fang.

423
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,760
Has the junior who’s got hyperventilation gone?

424
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,520
I wanted to visit her but couldn’t find her

425
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,640
Oh, yes.

426
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,200
Oh, and the pain relief balm you asked me to get.

427
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,840
I don’t know you want the cool or the hot one.

428
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,160
There are two kinds.

429
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,320
So I bought them all.

430
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,200
Thanks a lot.

431
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
He is waiting there to use it.

432
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,640
What are you doing here?

433
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Well, I ask Kongpob to wait here.

434
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,720
We are going to nominate him to compete in the faculty’s star contest.

435
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,160
Faculty’s star contest?

436
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Are you going to nominate him?

437
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,880
His looking is hideous.

438
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,000
His manners are flawed.

439
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,680
You are going to embarrass us all if you nominate him.

440
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,480
But you are the one who said we should nominate him…

441
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,520
Yes.

442
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,440
I said that.

443
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,560
But I don’t see the chance of him winning the contest at all.

444
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,120
Fang, you bitch!

445
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,920
Where is he?

446
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,280
The junior you told me he was extremely good looking.

447
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,000
I need to check out on him myself.

448
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,760
He’s really handsome

449
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,480
Why don’t you tell me sooner?

450
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,960
Come with me, boy. Come.

451
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,000
Where have you been, darling?

452
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,040
He’s this handsome.

453
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,600
I don’t think we need to choose now.

454
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,320
Let’s just skip and nominate him to be the faculty’s ambassador.

455
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,720
I guarantee that he’s going to win because he’s got the look.

456
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,120
I confirm.

457
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,000
Well, can I have your number first?

458
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,880
Can I?

459
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,920
Sure

460
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,680
Your hands are beautiful too.

461
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
Now just wait and pick up my call.

462
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,520
You can go to his dorm if you like.

463
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,280
He lives alone in the dorm.

464
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,800
Really? What’s your room no.?

465
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,680
Why is it so noisy here?

466
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,120
Be considerate to other people.

467
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,920
Fang, Knot wants to see you.

468
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,040
Okay.

469
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,160
And you, freshmen boys,

470
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,640
If you are done here, just go.

471
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,840
Wait.

472
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,840
Give me your hand.

473
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,240
My friend gave these to you. Eat them. Don’t leave them behind.

474
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,320
Understood?

475
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,760
For a minute I thought we were in trouble.

476
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
What are you doing?

477
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,800
You can’t get it in the hoop even once

478
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,720
You know something?

479
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The third years punish us harsher.

480
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,040
Yeah.

481
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,080
So what?

482
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,920
Don’t you care about your fellow freshmen at all?

483
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,240
Why do I have to join the gathering?

484
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,640
I never see those third-year seniors do anything for us.

485
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,080
You only get scolded…

486
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,200
You only get punished

487
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,440
We are there just to satisfy their damn needs.

488
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,600
I don’t get it why do you guys bother to join the gathering.

489
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,760
Damn it.

490
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,520
I myself don’t like what they did.

491
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,480
But I’m curious what they do all those for.

492
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,240
Sometimes, what we see…

493
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,880
is not always the truth.

494
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,400
I must head back to finish my assignment.

495
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,080
Here.

496
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,640
From the seniors.

497
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,000
M.

498
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,120
Hm? What’s up?

499
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,480
Where’s the lecture note I told you to keep for me?

500
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,600
Oh, I forgot it in the room 303.

501
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,480
Really?

502
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,240
What should we do?

503
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,000
I really need it for tomorrow class.

504
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,440
I go get it first thing in the morning.

505
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,080
But we need to hand in the assignment before 10 am.

506
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,680
How will it be possible?

507
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,520
Let’s just go get it together now.

508
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,840
Hold on, Kong.

509
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,560
Now?

510
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,280
It’s almost 12 a.m.

511
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,760
It’s ghost time.

512
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
Just go there together all of us.

513
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,760
Don’t be chicken out.

514
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,320
I just need to go get changed first.

515
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,080
Oak, my leg hurts, you go with him alone.

516
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,200
No, it doesn’t.

517
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,880
Isn’t it that side?

518
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,920
Don’t bail on me

519
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,520
The building is so dark.

520
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,200
I’m on the 3rd floor now.

521
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,280
Don’t say that you are worried about me.

522
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,800
You two are so damn coward.

523
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
I’ve got to go. I need to use the phone light.

524
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,640
Do you understand?

525
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I hope you make use of what I taught you today to the freshmen.

526
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,360
Do you understand?

527
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,800
Yes.

528
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,040
That’s a wrap for today.

529
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Hey!

530
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,120
Kongpob?

531
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,480
What are you doing here?

532
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,880
I forgot my lecture note.

533
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,360
So I’m here to get it.

534
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,680
Hurry and go back now.

535
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,960
P’Arthit…

536
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,800
I think when you put on your serious face,

537
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,080
you look kind of cute.

538
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,080
You son of a..
