00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
The hazing activities depicted in this series,
“SOTUS the Series”
have been exaggerated for entertainment purposes.

2
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,680
Let go.

3
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,600
I will

4
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,360
but we need to talk.

5
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,600
But I have nothing to talk to you.

6
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
But P’Arthit

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
If you don’t let go

8
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,000
then I don’t want them.

9
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,040
Hey, Arthit

10
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,320
Did you have a fight with that junior again?

11
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,320
No I didn’t.

12
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,760
Come on, you jackass.

13
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,920
I don’t buy it.

14
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,000
He’s been waiting to see you since noon.

15
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,240
It’s obvious that he has something to clear with you

16
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,640
Why are you avoiding him?

17
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
Oon!

18
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,600
This way.

19
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,720
Sorry, Namtan

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
Have I kept you waiting for too long?

21
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
Not at all. I’ve just got here too.

22
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,160
We finally get to hang out together. But it’s a bit difficult, don’t you think?

23
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,120
Well, we are getting busier these days.

24
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,160
I miss the old days.

25
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
We were always together

26
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,080
And then you multiply this with 2.

27
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,600
And you get the answer.

28
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,320
See? It’s a piece of cake

29
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
Yeah, this is so refreshing

30
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,800
So, how to get this?

31
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,600
You missed it, man.

32
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,080
You slept when I told you.

33
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,680
I’m not gonna repeat it.

34
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,320
Come on, Oon.

35
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,800
Do it one more time.

36
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,840
No.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
Hey, you guys

38
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Take a break and have these snacks first.

39
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,040
Namtan, you’ve brought too many. How can we finish them all?

40
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,560
I want to try them all. I want to know if they are all good

41
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
I see.

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,840
Let me have it.

43
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,040
Are you gonna eat them all?

44
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,120
Put it here. Do share some, man.

45
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,360
You want to have some?

46
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
Tell me how to solve this one

47
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
No, I can just eat this.

48
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
No, you can’t eat.

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,080
Are these yours!

50
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,480
Namtan gave them to me

51
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,640
Hey, Jay.

52
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Which one that you are stuck?

53
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,520
This one.

54
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,920
It’s so easy. I can teach you.

55
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,920
Don’t get attention by acting pitiful.

56
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,120
You are pathetic.

57
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Namtan offers to help me.

58
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,960
I didn’t say anything.

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,040
Really?

60
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,840
Let me.

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,440
By the way, you want to enroll to the Faculty of Food Science?

62
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,720
Yeah, probably.

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,920
But I’m still deciding, though.

64
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,080
Hey, do you want to enroll to the Engineering with me.

65
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
We can study together.

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,320
Another thing is

67
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
if you are in the engineering,

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,720
I’m sure you get nominated as the Star of the faculty

69
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
Come to think of it,

70
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,120
she will be the Star student no matter what faculty she’s in.

71
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,440
She is this pretty and cute.

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Oon, stop teasing me.

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,760
I don’t think you should go to the Engineering

74
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,200
Stick with your Food Science choice.

75
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,760
Okay?

76
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,000
What the hell is wrong with you, Jay?

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,240
I want her to study with me.

78
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,760
What about you? Communication Arts or Architecture?

79
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,240
Well, my mother wants me to study architecture.

80
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,120
Listen, Oon & Jay.

81
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,200
you can study whatever as long as we are in the same university

82
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,520
Okay?

83
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,160
Let’s make a toast to our friendship.

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,080
Yeah.

85
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,520
Cheers!

86
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,040
Hey, Oon.

87
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,520
Can you do me a favor, this Valentine’s day?

88
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,520
Can you do me a favor, this Valentine’s day?

89
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,240
What is it, pal?

90
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,360
Are you planning to surprise someone?

91
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,040
Great, you really know what I want.

92
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
So?

93
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Who is she? Can I know?

94
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,320
Sure, you can. I’m asking for your help, right?

95
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,520
Who is she?

96
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,920
I…

97
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,520
like Namtan.

98
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,120
On the Valentines’ day

99
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,920
can you like…

100
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,360
take Namtan out to eat or something?

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
And I’ll surprise her with a flower bouquet

102
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,480
How does it sound?

103
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
Sure. No problem.

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,840
Thanks a lot, pal.

105
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,720
I’m sorry for asking you to meet me all of sudden.

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,440
It’s all right.

107
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,320
But what’s going on?

108
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,880
Well…

109
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,560
it’s the same old things.

110
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,720
You must be fighting with Jay again.

111
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,640
No we are not.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
It’s not really fighting.

113
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,600
Just a bit upset.

114
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,680
What did he do?

115
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,280
Jay has been very busy lately.

116
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,200
And he doesn’t seem to care about me like before.

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,120
It could be just this period.

118
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,480
His faculty’s play is about to kick off, isn’t it?

119
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Come on. Don’t think too much.

120
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,440
I try not to think too much.

121
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
But…

122
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,880
Jay didn’t remember our anniversary.

123
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
On our date, he kept me waiting for 4 hours.

124
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,440
I tried not to flip out.

125
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,840
Since it was our anniversary after all.

126
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
I wanted everything to go well for us on that day.

127
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,880
But it turned out…

128
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,680
that day was the day I felt uncomfortable the most.

129
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,320
I…

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
I felt like…

131
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I put up with this for too long

132
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,080
And I don’t think any woman can put up with it like I do.

133
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
Excuse me

134
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
Our restaurant is closing.

135
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,480
Can you please box them up for me?

136
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,960
Here you are.

137
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,040
Namtan, I’m really sorry.

138
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Jay!

139
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,160
I kept you waiting for hours.

140
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,080
Jay, it’s really okay.

141
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,600
How was the rehearsal?

142
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,440
Was it doing okay?

143
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,000
it wasn’t okay actually

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,160
The seniors came to check

145
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,280
and they revised all the scenes from the top.

146
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,320
So it took us a long time to do the run-through.

147
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,240
Ah. You must be really hungry then.

148
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I had ordered food for you but the restaurant was about to close.

149
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,160
So I had to have them boxed up.

150
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,920
I ordered your favorite spaghetti too.

151
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,480
Oh, thank you so much.

152
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,840
But I have eaten already from the uni.

153
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,200
Don’t worry I can take them home and eat later.

154
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,600
This is your gift.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,160
Hey, what is this?

156
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,520
For me?

157
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,280
Yes, for you.

158
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,400
Really?

159
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
What is this gift for?

160
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,920
You must be really busy.

161
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,880
It’s not surprising that you forgot.

162
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,480
Today is our 3rd year anniversary.

163
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,720
Listen, I’m sorry.

164
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,640
I work so hard that it slipped my mind.

165
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,520
I’m truly sorry.

166
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Let me make it up.

167
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,480
How about I take you to a seafood restaurant?

168
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,120
Let’s go there and I’ll treat you.

169
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,800
We will order lots and lots of seafood. How does it sound?

170
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,640
But I can’t eat shrimps.

171
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,080
You don’t remember?

172
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,960
I do remember.

173
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,000
But it’s totally okay.

174
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,880
Just be nice to me when we go to Lipe island is enough, really.

175
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,840
Well…about the Lipe trip.

176
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,240
The play show date has been put off for another 2 weeks.

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,240
Can we postpone the trip to later date?

178
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,160
Well, what can I say? You leave me with no choice

179
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,800
I’m sorry.

180
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,520
What can I do?

181
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,840
Open the gift. I want to know whether you like it.

182
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,080
Here you are.

183
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,480
This is the menu

184
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,200
I’m sorry.

185
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,320
I talked too much.

186
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
I must be really stressed out.

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
Come on. It’s okay.

188
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,840
Let it all out.

189
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,120
So you feel better.

190
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,520
Um, I will get better soon.

191
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,680
Let’s talk about something else.

192
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,840
Let’s not talk about serious stuff.

193
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
What about you, Oon?

194
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,760
Do you have a girlfriend yet?

195
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,360
Why did you ask?

196
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,320
Are you planning to hit on me?

197
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,760
Though, I’m not seeing anyone right now.

198
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,040
but many people are going after me, you know?

199
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,080
You are still full of confidence like before.

200
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,680
But you just had the initiation rite at your faculty, right?

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,080
Was it fun?

202
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,320
Um…it was kinda fun. I guess.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Was it, really? Mr. Head Hazer

204
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,280
Your voice doesn’t sound like it.

205
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,800
Is there anything wrong?

206
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,200
No, nothing.

207
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,840
I’m okay.

208
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,800
Well, if you say so.

209
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,120
Okay it is.

210
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,040
By the way, do you remember my friend, Joy?

211
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,200
Yes. Why?

212
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,480
Joy likes a guy.

213
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,720
He’s your junior at the engineering faculty.

214
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,120
She falls head over heels for him

215
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,840
Let me show you her status

216
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Look.

217
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,880
Woah, she is really mad about him.

218
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,880
Who is he? I may know him.

219
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
You definitely know him.

220
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,080
Because he’s your junior at the engineering faculty.

221
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,480
His name is Kongpob.

222
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,160
He was also the Moon of the Engineering faculty

223
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,040
Here’s the thing.

224
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,480
Joy went to the University Star Contest.

225
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,080
After she laid her eyes on Kongpob.

226
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,800
She fell in love right away.

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,240
But Joy is too shy to make a move and approach Kongpob.

228
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,160
She doesn’t know what to talk to him.

229
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Since he’s from your faculty.

230
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,320
So I want to get some info of him.

231
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,800
His info?

232
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,040
Something like what color does he likes?

233
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,720
what food does he like?

234
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,760
where does he normally go when he’s free? Something like that.

235
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
Wait a minute.

236
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,920
Are you trying to be a matchmaker or what?

237
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,920
Correct. I am!

238
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,600
I want to hook her with a guy.

239
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,080
#findYourFriendABoyfriend

240
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,160
Come on. Tell me.

241
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
He’s from your faculty

242
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Where should I start?

243
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Ah, this bloke, Kongpob…

244
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,040
he likes iced coffee.

245
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,080
He’s a morning person.

246
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,120
And…when he wakes up, he likes to eat soy milk with Chinese doughnut.

247
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,080
He always eats the same old things.

248
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,280
What else? You have talked only his morning habits

249
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,360
Well, he likes bland food.

250
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,040
He can’t have spicy food.

251
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,800
His usual food includes minced pork omelet,

252
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,080
noodle in clear soup with meatball something like this.

253
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,840
His food is so damn bland and tasteless.

254
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,960
I even asked him, you know?

255
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,680
why he had to buy minced pork omelet when he could effortlessly make one.

256
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,120
He said

257
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,520
“Well, bro. I can burn even omelet.”

258
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,560
He sounds like a kid born with silver spoon, right?

259
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
And how he dresses too.

260
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,440
He dresses really slow, you know?

261
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,240
He must look neat from head to toe.

262
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,080
He can’t go to places by himself.

263
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,480
He always has someone to go with him when he wants to go out.

264
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,880
This could be the reason why he loves his friends so much

265
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,400
And he likes to be a hero.

266
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,640
He always comes front and protects his friends.

267
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,600
All of my friends don’t like him, you know?

268
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,080
And he likes to provoke me during the freshmen gathering.

269
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,480
So he makes me feel like he’s a pain in the ass

270
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,120
It’s a bad choice of Joy to like Kongpob.

271
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
Seriously.

272
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,240
So you don’t really like him?

273
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,600
Yeah.

274
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,840
If you know him,

275
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,600
you’ll feel like your head can get exploded anytime.

276
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,880
But what you have been saying about him,

277
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,840
it doesn’t sound like you dislike him.

278
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,120
You seem to know him more than anyone

279
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,280
What? Are you crazy?

280
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,560
It’s not like that.

281
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,640
Actually, I heard about him from people.

282
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,160
I don’t really pay attention to him that much.

283
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,240
Well, do you want to get anything else?

284
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,000
No, I’m good.

285
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,400
You can order yours.

286
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,720
Well then…

287
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,960
A pink milk for me please.

288
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,120
You seem to do a lot of activities in the uni.

289
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,800
Is your grade still good?

290
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,640
Well, my GPA is 3.25 as of now.

291
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,440
Really? You are so awesome.

292
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,280
Thank you.

293
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,800
Pink color doesn’t suit you.

294
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
This reminds me of those days when we skipped school.

295
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,760
We were really a group of troublemakers, right?

296
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,240
The teacher was like…

297
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,960
The teacher probably got sick of us.

298
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,720
He would still mad at you, I think.

299
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,520
Did you apologize to him?

300
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,440
I did but he shut me off completely. He was really mad.

301
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,800
Thank you so much for keeping me company today.

302
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,040
Come on. You don’t need to thank me.

303
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,000
Don’t make it sound like we are being estranged.

304
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Really?

305
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,760
At first, I was afraid that you didn’t want to meet me.

306
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,760
But I am happy now

307
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,280
It’s been a while to laugh like this.

308
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,520
Same here.

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don’t know why

310
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,400
But I feel strangely comfortable when I’m with you.

311
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
I feel like I can tell you anything.

312
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,560
I let out a lot of my stories

313
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,560
I didn’t hear some from you.

314
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,640
Actually, I don’t have anything much to tell.

315
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,160
Only your stories can take up the whole day.

316
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,600
Do you realize that you frown every now and then?

317
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,080
I don’t know what is on your mind that’s bothering you.

318
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,760
Or whether you have a disagreement with someone.

319
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,240
Let me say what you like to say to me.

320
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,280
If something is bothering your mind,

321
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,920
just go clear it up with that person.

322
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,200
Don’t let it unsolved in your mind.

323
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,920
You are my best friend, you know?

324
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,160
You can always come to me if you have anything that you want to say

325
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,160
Thank you.

326
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,160
I’m going now. Thank you for walking me here.

327
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,080
Okay, bye bye. Take care.

328
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,440
Let me close it for you.

329
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
You smoke too?

330
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,400
Yes.

331
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,480
Quit it.

332
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,480
Think about your parents.

333
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,400
They work hard to pay for your education.

334
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,040
Not to see you ruin your own lung.

335
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,560
Do you know what I mean?

336
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,920
Kongpob (14)
Kongpob (7)

337
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
P’Arthit.

338
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,840
Yes, P’Arthit.

339
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,680
Uh..Kongpob.

340
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,040
Can you return those books to the library for me?

341
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,600
And for those comic books…

342
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
you can keep them.

343
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,360
I’ll pay the fine with the book rental shop later.

344
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,320
Bye for now

345
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,640
Hold on, P’Arthit.

346
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,840
You are mad at me.

347
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,960
No, I am not mad at you.

348
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
If you are not, why don’t you talk to me?

349
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,200
Could it be that day?

350
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,560
That I didn’t answer your question…

351
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,560
If you really want to know, I can just tell you now

352
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
I don’t know when it happened.

353
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,400
I don’t know how it happened

354
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,520
You are a guy.

355
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,880
And I’m also a guy.

356
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,040
But I really can’t stop my own feelings.

357
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,320
P’Arthit,

358
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,640
I have always wanted to tell you.

359
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,760
that I…

360
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,560
♪ Though we must not make our feelings for each other known to anyone.

361
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:54,240
♪ Keep this relationship to only the two of us.

362
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,920
♪ Just sharing the same air with you is already good enough.

363
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,600
♪ I don’t need anything else.

364
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,560
♪ And I’m not gonna ask for more.

365
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,880
♪ ‘Cause everything is already good as it is

366
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,560
♪ As long as we know about it.

367
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,400
♪ Our minds connect just by looking into each other’s eyes.

368
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,840
♪ Just listening to the same love songs…

369
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,000
♪ …is enough to keep our heart warm

370
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,680
♪ And there’s nothing else I could ask for more.

371
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,280
♪ Just know it in our own heart.

372
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,680
♪ Just the two of us is enough.

373
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,400
♪ It’s more than love. No words could ever express.

374
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,080
♪ We don’t need to walk hand in hand.

375
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,920
♪ Just standing next to each other is good enough.

376
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,200
Let go.

377
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,040
If you don’t let go,

378
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,440
then I don’t want them.

379
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,240
And for you,

380
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,880
Do me a favor and get the hell out of my sight.

381
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,600
Hello, Maprang. What’s up?

382
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,640
How are you going to the uni tomorrow?

383
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,960
Wanna come with us?

384
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,400
Well, I’m going there by bicycle, I guess.

385
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,920
Why?

386
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,720
Really?

387
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,160
Okay.

388
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,960
And what are you up to?

389
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
Wanna hear something fun?

390
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,640
I’m writing my diary and surfing the internet.

391
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,480
But I can listen. What’s it about?

392
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,520
Hey, Oak.

393
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,160
Last night, why did you let me go out in the field alone?

394
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,640
You said you would support me.

395
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,320
I barely made it out alive, you know?

396
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,240
I told you to wait for me.

397
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,200
You didn’t.

398
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
You wanted me to wait for you?

399
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,560
Then I wouldn’t get anything done If I had waited for you

400
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,240
So, where the hell were you last night?

401
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,360
Yeah, last night.

402
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,600
I met a girl

403
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
She is so damn pretty.

404
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,360
I went after her.

405
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,520
Really, you did?

406
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,720
How’d it go?

407
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,920
How’d it go?

408
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,600
The outcome you mean?

409
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,760
Look who’s talking.

410
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,840
Don’t tell me you get her to like you back?

411
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,080
Like me back my ass

412
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,520
I didn’t stand a chance.

413
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,080
I knew it. You wouldn’t get some

414
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,400
You should have had helped me instead.

415
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,720
But you were out there chasing a girl.

416
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,920
See?

417
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,920
Hey, Kong.

418
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,880
Hey, Kong.

419
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,040
Why do you look like you’ve been through a battle or something?

420
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,200
You must exert yourself too much last night?

421
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,600
Yeah,

422
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,080
I couldn’t sleep last night.

423
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,200
Really? Is everything okay?

424
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,240
Nothing important.

425
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,960
Hey, if you are not okay, you can go back and rest.

426
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,080
I’ll jot down the notes for you.

427
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,920
It’s all right. I’m okay.

428
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,520
Thanks, man.

429
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,640
All right, only a few weeks away before the final exams.

430
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,240
After looking at the points you all have had so far,

431
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,800
some of you are still behind.

432
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,440
Particularly, those who skip class.

433
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,560
You should note that you are marked by your class attendance too.

434
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,320
Nevertheless, I do have something to help you.

435
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,480
I will have extra 10 credits for this class.

436
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,080
But you need to do some research about what we have learned.

437
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,280
Each person will have to write one topic by doing a research from the library.

438
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,080
I will provide the main 8 topics as followings:

439
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,920
Here.

440
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,280
All right?

441
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,440
Ma’am

442
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,320
Yes?

443
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,320
We can pick the topic that we want to do, right?

444
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,480
No, you can’t.

445
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,920
I will assign the topic to each of you by the order of your student numbers.

446
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,360
If I let you choose at your own will,

447
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,560
you will choose only easy ones.

448
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,480
So, we will do it like this instead.

449
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,400
Don’t forget to submit the papers on time.

450
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,240
That’s a wrap for today

451
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,480
Goodbye, you all.

452
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,480
Thank you

453
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,320
For real? Is this extra credit?

454
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,280
I think we will have to write whole lots of things for the given topic

455
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,040
Hey, guys.

456
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,440
What research topic did you get?

457
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,760
I think I get to do the Thermodynamics topic

458
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,200
Mine is the Stoichiometry and Chemical Equations.

459
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,040
You are so lucky.

460
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,760
I have to do the Solution Substance and Colloid topic.

461
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,880
I think I’m going to become solution substance myself and melt away.

462
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,680
Melt away?

463
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,880
What is that?

464
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,000
Well, it’s difficult, you know?

465
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,960
Kong, are you okay?

466
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Kong!

467
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Huh?

468
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,640
Nothing.

469
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,760
Please excuse me.

470
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Who knows what is wrong with him?

471
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,680
You’re his close friend.

472
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,880
If you don’t know,

473
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,560
do you expect us to know?

474
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,000
We don’t!

475
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,680
He’s going to be fine.

476
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,280
Don’t worry.

477
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,080
Let’s get going.

478
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,040
Hey,

479
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,280
we don’t have class this afternoon, right?

480
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,680
Do you want to go to the library and do the research together?

481
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,520
M, why don’t you ask Kong to come too?

482
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
Sure.

483
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,480
Hey, eat more veggies.

484
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,440
You don’t have to show your love to me this much.

485
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,720
Just eat them.

486
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,240
Let’s grab a beer tonight.

487
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,800
Have you ever thought of asking me to have something else?

488
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,320
Always malted barley.

489
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,400
You should have the real barley for a change.

490
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,720
Here! Japanese barley drink.

491
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,760
You act like my mom more and more, you know?

492
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,160
Does your family know that you are like this?

493
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,920
Like what?

494
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,240
That you are a fag, you moron!

495
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,000
You asshole, I can just turn you into my hubby, you know?

496
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,800
Eat!

497
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Always ask me to drink.

498
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,240
Someone is being bummed today.

499
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,960
Who? Who is being bummed?

500
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,440
I don’t like it.

501
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,120
Are you done, Arthit?

502
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,440
You ate less today.

503
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,400
You have bloated stomach or what?

504
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,360
No.

505
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
Actually, I had eaten before I came here.

506
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,040
Really?

507
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,080
So you are done?

508
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,080
Then, let me have it.

509
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,680
I didn’t see you drink anything after eating.

510
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,320
Here. I bought it for you.

511
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,560
You will feel more refreshing.

512
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,000
Thank you.

513
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,800
Why didn’t you buy it for me too?

514
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,520
Give me your money.

515
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,240
I know what makes Arthit stressed.

516
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,440
What is it?

517
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,520
He’s broke.

518
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,640
He even has to pay down payment on this sunny side up egg [play on word].

519
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
What will you do?

520
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,800
But your friend is not allowed to stay.

521
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,760
Why are you still here?

522
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,840
Get out!

523
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yes, sir.

524
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,200
Kong, where are you?

525
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,040
Hello.

526
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,760
Hey, Kong.

527
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,440
I’m at the library with May’s group. We’re working on the assignment

528
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,080
Come here right now.

529
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,880
I think I want to..

530
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,080
Don’t turn your back on me.

531
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,240
Come here now.

532
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,000
I need your help. It’s bloody difficult.

533
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,800
Fine, I’ll be there soon.

534
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,000
Here, eat it.

535
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,600
Hey, guys.

536
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,880
I’m going to the library.

537
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,080
Wanna go with me?

538
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,760
I go

539
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,880
I’ll be waiting at the beverage stall.

540
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,600
I and the library cannot get along well.

541
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,240
A guy like you can only get along with bad places.

542
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,600
A red-light district is a perfect match for you.

543
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,400
No, you are wrong.

544
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,160
I can be at any place but

545
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,240
there must be lovely ladies around.

546
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,120
Fine.

547
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,640
You’ll find them at the library too.

548
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,400
I saw many freshmen going there to do some research.

549
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,080
I don’t want that.

550
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,320
You don’t know what I mean?

551
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,040
Do you know what I mean?

552
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,520
I do.

553
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,560
What about you?

554
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,840
Hey, I think I’ll wait at the beverage stall too.

555
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,760
What? What’s wrong with you?

556
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,920
Fine, I’m taking off then.

557
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
I don’t know when it happened.

558
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,120
I don’t know how it happened.

559
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,200
You are a guy.

560
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,520
And I’m also a guy.

561
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,680
But I really can’t stop my own feelings
