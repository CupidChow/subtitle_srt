1
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
May.

2
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,160
Is everything okay?

3
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,200
Are you looking for someone?

4
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,600
Ah…

5
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,560
No one particularly.

6
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
I just look around and enjoy the atmosphere.

7
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,600
I don’t know where Kong is.

8
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,960
Do you want to go find him with me?

9
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,760
Um. Why not?

10
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,800
We are taking a stroll.

11
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
Take your glass with you.

12
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,320
See you.

13
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,720
Want some?

14
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,240
I thought you didn’t want to talk to me

15
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,120
I said I was tired of picking a fight with you.

16
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
If you want to talk

17
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,920
we can just sit down and talk.

18
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,360
I do want to talk to you.

19
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,400
How come you get to be the leader of the hazing team?

20
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,800
I was asked to

21
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,880
My senior mentor, P’Tum.

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
He was also the leader of the hazing team when I was a freshman.

23
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,600
So he wanted me to take over this role.

24
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,320
Honestly speaking,

25
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,240
this is not me at all.

26
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,120
There are a lot of responsibilities falling on my shoulder.

27
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,240
Another thing is, I know I’m a quick-tempered person.

28
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,040
Remembered when I grabbed your collar?

29
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
I almost got kicked out of the leader’s position.

30
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,960
But you didn’t.

31
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,960
Well,

32
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,760
my friends pleaded with P’Deer for me.

33
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,520
Since no one stopped me at the time.

34
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,280
So we all were equally guilty.

35
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,600
P’Deer let us off the hook…

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,920
given that it was our first mistake.

37
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,200
I’m sorry.

38
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,440
Come on.

39
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,600
Forget about it.

40
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
It was a long time ago.

41
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,040
And I did punish you for that already, didn’t I?

42
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Do you remember our bet when I contended the University Star Contest?

43
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Sure I do.

44
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,480
Why?

45
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
You have something you want from me now?

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Yes.

47
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
Are you free next Saturday?

48
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,200
Next Saturday?

49
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,280
I guess I am.

50
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Why?

51
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
I have something I want to buy.

52
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,320
Can you go with me?

53
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
Uh…

54
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
Just that?

55
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,760
Fine.

56
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Well then…

57
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,280
Can I have your number?

58
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,800
So I can call you later about the appointment.

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Sure.

60
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,680
Well…

61
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,520
When will you take that off?

62
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
Why should I?

63
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I prefer it to stay tied on my wrist like this.

64
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,760
I don’t want to take it off.

65
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,280
Arthit!

66
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,920
Arthit!

67
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,080
where the hell are you?

68
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
All right. All right.

69
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,040
I’ve got to go now.

70
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,440
Hold on a sec, P’Arthit.

71
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,520
Well…

72
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,840
I have something to give to you.

73
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,240
What is it?

74
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,800
Give me your palm.

75
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
Why do you return it to me?

76
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,360
I don’t.

77
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,280
I just want you to take care of it.

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,040
Why do you want me to keep it?

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,320
Oh?

80
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,200
You don’t know the meaning of it?

81
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
I thought you knew.

82
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
Well then…

83
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,520
You can ask P’Deer about it.

84
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,960
Hey, Arthit!

85
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,960
The whole table is waiting for you!

86
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,840
Move your ass!.

87
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,840
All right. I’m coming!

88
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,600
Hey, May.

89
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,280
What rank did you pick for this faculty?

90
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,120
Oh, it’s my first rank, actually.

91
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,120
I always want to study here.

92
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,440
What about you?

93
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,000
Well I…

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
chose this as my first rank as well.

95
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,360
Well…

96
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
After I passed the admission to this faculty,

97
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,360
I didn’t try anything else.

98
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,680
The fact that we met each other

99
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,560
is like the destiny, don’t you think?

100
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560
Yeah.

101
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
When two strangers…

102
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,680
get to meet each other…

103
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
is the most special occurrence.

104
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,040
Hey, Kong.

105
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,000
Where have you been?

106
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,760
I just had a chat with seniors.

107
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,960
Where is our table?

108
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,640
Oh, we sit over there.

109
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,800
Are you going there?

110
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,400
Yeah, let’s go.

111
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,680
Hey,

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,920
Why don’t you let the girl walk in the middle?

113
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,240
Is it necessary?

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
M…

115
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,160
This is chilled.

116
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,520
Hey, P’Deer.

117
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,160
Can I ask something?

118
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,400
What is it about?

119
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,960
What is the meaning of the gear.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,920
Huh?

121
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
Are you drunk?

122
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,480
It represents our unity

123
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,840
And It’s extremely important.

124
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Because…

125
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,960
You all must go through a lot…

126
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,400
before you can get hold of the gear.

127
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,080
You are right.

128
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,280
and also

129
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
It’s very important because…

130
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,720
it’s like our heart, us engineering people.

131
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,840
So they compare it saying…

132
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,320
The gear is in your heart.

133
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,960
The heart is in your gear.

134
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
If you ask someone to take care of your gear…

135
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
it means you ask that someone to take care of your heart.

136
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,720
Isn’t it cool?

137
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,320
So cool, right?

138
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
What’s wrong, Arthit?

139
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,840
Just a glass of booze.

140
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
It makes you choke

141
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,280
you are drunk and turn red already?

142
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,960
You are such a lightweight drinker.

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
Bottoms up!

144
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,080
Cheers to Arthit.

145
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,520
Bottoms up!

146
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Bright, I think you need a piss.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,280
our bus broke down.

148
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,000
How do we go home now?

149
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,720
How about the bus no.7, P’Yatch is on that bus?

150
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
I heard it was full already.

151
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,040
Let’s take the bus of the third-year seniors.

152
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,440
That’s all right.

153
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,640
But we would be super nervous sitting with those seniors

154
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,440
We should be fine. They go easy on us now.

155
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,920
Yeah.

156
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,600
Well then. Let’s take the third-year bus

157
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,760
Hey, guys.

158
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,440
Which bus are you taking?

159
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,080
We think of going on the third-year bus.

160
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,800
Oh, then hurry up.

161
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,200
Their bus is about to leave

162
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,520
Okay.

163
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,760
All right. Let’s get going.

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
M, give me a minute.

165
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
You can get on the bus first

166
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,880
I need to go to the toilet first.

167
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,280
Yes, please get on.

168
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,240
36, get on.

169
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,920
Guy, please check your stuff and your friends.

170
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,080
We won’t come back to pick anyone left behind.

171
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,560
Okay?

172
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,720
Good.

173
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,000
Hey, what’s wrong?

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,080
0062

175
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,560
62

176
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,280
Okay, get on the bus from the front door.

177
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,920
All seats in the back are full.

178
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,680
Hey, Kong.

179
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,640
The seat behind me is available. You can sit there.

180
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,680
May I sit here, May?

181
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,720
Of course.

182
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,080
Want some durian chips?

183
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,440
Nah, I don’t eat durians.

184
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,560
Then, what do you normally like to eat?

185
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,280
I can eat almost everything.

186
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,080
Except durians.

187
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,320
Do you want this?

188
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,880
For me?

189
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,920
Thank you, then.

190
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,960
how do we get into this dessert castle stage?

191
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,480
M!

192
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,680
Hey, didn’t you hear what I asked?

193
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,280
Are you talking to me?

194
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
Yes, I’m talking to you?

195
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
I’m sitting with you, right?

196
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,280
Who else could it be?

197
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,160
You shouldn’t have asked.

198
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,200
What do you want?

199
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,960
This stage, how can I enter?

200
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,960
You must complete the quest first.

201
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,480
You must go talk to that snail before entering the dessert castle

202
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,720
Hey, what’s wrong?

203
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,080
You look quiet.

204
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,760
Nothing, I’m just drowsy and tired.

205
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,240
Really?

206
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,920
We are on a trip. We must be active.

207
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,720
Go sleep when you are home.

208
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,720
Cut me some slack, Khun Bright.

209
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,880
Last night, I barely slept last night because I patrolled the place

210
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,640
You were drunk and crashed at 11 pm.

211
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,400
Really? I did that?

212
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,080
Yes sir.

213
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,800
Want me to smack you so you recall that?

214
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,080
I don’t want to see my friend become quiet.

215
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,600
Can’t I do that?

216
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,080
Can you let this friend sleep?

217
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,720
Everyone, we will have a 30-minute break for toilets.

218
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,120
If you want to buy souvenirs, you can do at this stop.

219
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,800
Hey, May.

220
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,440
You are not getting off?

221
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,360
Nah, I still have plenty of snacks left.

222
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,400
You are not getting off, P’Arthit?

223
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,880
Nah.

224
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Hey, we are stopping at the gas station?

225
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,160
Aren’t you getting off?

226
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,640
No, I want to sleep.

227
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
How come you sleep all the time?

228
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
I want to buy dried squid for my mom.

229
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,800
Want some?

230
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,840
Make way. Make way.

231
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,440
Hurry up. My mother needs squid.

232
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,200
It’s all mine.

233
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,560
Hey, M.

234
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,920
Can you move to that seat for a sec?

235
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,400
Which seat?

236
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,200
I feel stiff all over. I want to stretch a bit.

237
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,360
Just a minute. Come on.

238
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,840
Why do you have to stretch?

239
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,560
Come on. It won’t be long.

240
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,920
Why do I have to move?

241
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Come on. Just a minute.

242
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,560
You are so damn selfish.

243
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,080
Come on. Go away.

244
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,200
Go

245
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,360
Hey, May.

246
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Can I sit here? Oak wants to stretch.

247
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,080
Sure.

248
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
You like durian chips?

249
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,920
It’s my favorite.

250
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,720
Do you like it?

251
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,840
Do you want some?

252
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,120
I know another shop that sells the best durian chips.

253
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,000
It comes in different packaging.

254
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,160
Hey, I know which one you are talking about.

255
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,640
I like that brand too but it’s really sought after, you know?

256
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,200
So I bought this one instead.

257
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,800
It’s not bad, actually.

258
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,440
Well then, I’ll buy some for you when I find one.

259
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,920
Are you serious?

260
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,400
Buy me two. It’s really hard to find.

261
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,360
Sure.

262
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,520
But this one is okay too

263
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,560
Have some.

264
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,880
Hey!

265
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,760
How come you sit here?

266
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,080
Where’s my friend?

267
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,040
All seats are occupied.

268
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,800
And P’Bright

269
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,840
He’s not with the rest of the gang in the backseats.

270
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,880
You are sleepy?

271
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,840
You can go back to sleep.

272
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,000
What? Nah.

273
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,400
We are on a trip. We shouldn’t waste the time on sleeping.

274
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,520
Do you want some snacks?

275
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,040
Nah.

276
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,760
Well, do you want this drink?

277
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,240
When I get off and bought these snacks,

278
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,440
I found this drink

279
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,680
so I got it for you.

280
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,000
Hey, do you want to tease me with this?

281
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,640
Not at all.

282
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
I see that you look tired.

283
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,040
So…

284
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,960
I wanted you to have this cold drink and snacks.

285
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,600
But I don’t know what kind of snacks you like.

286
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,040
So I bought a variety of them.

287
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
But one thing that I know about you.

288
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,280
I know that you like pink milk

289
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,560
So here it is.

290
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,560
In case you don’t want the pink milk,

291
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,080
I also have green tea right here.

292
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,280
I want you to eat something.

293
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
It’s still many hours away until we get there.

294
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,640
You may get sick if your stomach is empty.

295
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,520
Listen, Prae.

296
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,320
The gear we got is like the heart of engineering students.

297
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
How romantic!

298
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,920
You can’t help looking up for this kind of thing, right?

299
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,040
P’Arthit

300
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,560
We’ve arrived.

301
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,400
Let’s get off!

302
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,600
Where should this thing go?

303
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
You can put it with this stuff.

304
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,960
Wait.

305
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,160
Nothing important.

306
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,200
Thanks for your help.

307
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,960
You’re welcome.

308
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
It was my pleasure.

309
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,800
Wait, Kongpob.

310
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,240
I just want to say “take care.”

311
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,440
Thank you

312
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,320
Sorry to have kept you waiting

313
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
How could you call me out this damn early?

314
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,920
11 a.m. is not early.

315
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,680
Woah, look at you all dressed up!

316
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,640
Well? What is the thing you want to buy?

317
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,960
Come this way. I want your advice.

318
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,160
To you, which is cuter?

319
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,520
I’m going to buy but I can’t decide.

320
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,800
I don’t you know you have this kind of taste

321
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,480
I don’t.

322
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,040
Tomorrow is my niece’s birthday.

323
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,000
I want buy her a present.

324
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,720
How old is she?

325
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,520
So we know what’s best for her.

326
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,000
3 years old.

327
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,440
She’s a daughter of my big sister.

328
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,440
Hm? You have an older sister?

329
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,440
Yeah, I have two sisters, actually.

330
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,200
They are almost 10 years older than me.

331
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,600
I’m the Benjamin of the family

332
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,640
What about you?

333
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
How many siblings do you have?

334
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,200
I’m an only child

335
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,400
Are you really going to buy this plush toy?

336
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,640
There are many other kinds of toys

337
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,080
something that helps brain development and growth something like that.

338
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,800
Listen, I used to see on the internet,

339
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,280
there is this play dough that you can make Lego

340
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,600
or roll into various shapes.

341
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
I think it’s kind of cool.

342
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,360
In my era, the most flashy toys are laser guns.

343
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,120
Your era was way better.

344
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,600
If I’m not wrong, we are just 2 years apart.

345
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,920
So what?

346
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,440
I was born first.

347
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,760
It can’t change the fact that I’m your senior.

348
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,880
Then you can just drop off the formality of Khun and Phom

349
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,240
And change to P’ and Nong instead.

350
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,160
That’s totally up to me.

351
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,560
You got a problem with that?

352
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,400
No.

353
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,760
Let me see

354
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,320
Well, I think the brown is probably better.

355
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
The white one could get dirty easily.

356
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
What do you think?

357
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,520
I just choose the one that you like.

358
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,960
Hey.

359
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,560
You can’t come to a decision based on my preference.

360
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,800
It’s your niece’s birthday.

361
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,840
Pay a bit more attention.

362
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
Then, I pick this one.

363
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,960
It’s more suitable for a little girl anyway.

364
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,760
Please wait a minute.

365
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,880
I go pay for this.

366
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,840
What are you looking for?

367
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,440
Oh, I’m looking for something for P’Tum and P’Fon’s wedding.

368
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,800
I think of giving them a wedding gift.

369
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,120
I think a card is not a bad idea.

370
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,840
Isn’t it too cliché?

371
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,000
I don’t think so.

372
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,760
The real gift is not the card…

373
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,720
but the message inside.

374
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Just write heartfelt wishes.

375
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,720
I’m sure P’Tum will be happy to read.

376
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
And it’s kind of romantic too.

377
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,120
I just want for something for his wedding.

378
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,840
I don’t think I need to be romantic.

379
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,280
It’s not a love letter or something.

380
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,800
Well then…

381
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,400
you can write it for me instead.

382
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,840
Oon, is that you?

383
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,840
Namtan!

384
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,400
It’s really you.

385
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,240
I almost didn’t recognize you in this casual clothes.

386
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,400
What are you doing here?

387
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,240
Well, I come here with my junior friend to get some stuff.

388
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,520
This is a junior from my major, Kongpob.

389
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,160
And this is my friend. She’s from the Faculty of Science.

390
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,200
Sawasdee krap.

391
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,240
So how are you doing? Are you doing all right?

392
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,680
Yeah. I’m doing fine.

393
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,240
Seriously, we study in the same university.

394
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,480
how come we hardly met each other?

395
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,480
I really miss you, you know?

396
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,160
Well, where is Jay? He’s not here with you?

397
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,840
No, I want to buy an anniversary gift for him.

398
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,680
Oh…

399
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,760
It’s been 3 years already, right

400
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,240
I’m so jealous of you

401
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,800
Why?

402
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,200
Haven’t you opened your heart to someone yet?

403
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,520
Well…

404
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,480
I can’t get over you yet.

405
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,480
You have such a sweet tongue like before.

406
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,760
Do you still use your old phone number?

407
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,360
Yes, it’s the same.

408
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,640
I thought you had changed your number.

409
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,600
You never picked up my calls.

410
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,240
Let’s eat together some time

411
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,480
Yeah, why not?

412
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,280
But give me a heads up

413
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,520
I’ve been busy with my studies lately…

414
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,640
and also the initiation.

415
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,840
Got it.

416
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Well, I should go buy a gift for Jay now.

417
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,400
Is she your friend?

418
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,280
Yeah, she’s my classmate from school.

419
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
So you have known her for quite a while.

420
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,200
Well, from a junior high, actually

421
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,360
So it’s been 7 or 8 years now.

422
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
She has a lovely smile.

423
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,160
Yeah. It’s not bad.

424
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,440
You like…her, do you?

425
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,880
Yes.

426
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,120
But it was a long time ago.

427
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
In fact

428
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,440
a friend of mine managed to have her like him before me.

429
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,400
I’m still hoping for them to break up every now and then.

430
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,800
But you know what?

431
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,360
They have been going out for 3 years already.

432
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,520
Actually, I can’t really blame my friend.

433
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,040
Cause I never confess my feelings to her.

434
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I don’t know why I keep it to myself either.

435
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,120
I understand.

436
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,640
What do you understand?

437
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,200
I understand why you are afraid to confess.

438
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,240
You are talking nonsense.

439
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,880
0062

440
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,840
0062

441
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,360
Kongpob!

442
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,760
What’s the matter?

443
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,840
If you are done here, you can go home.

444
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,840
You don’t have to walk with me looking dejected like this.

445
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,840
No,

446
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
I don’t want to leave just yet.

447
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,080
I’m just hungry.

448
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,120
You are hungry?

449
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,720
Why don’t you say it?

450
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,600
Fine, what would you like to have?

451
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,080
Anything is fine.

452
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,600
I let you choose.

453
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,040
Then, let’s go to a noodle house.

454
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,080
It’s nearby.

455
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,240
I go there often.

456
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,840
I’m sure you will like it.

457
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,560
Okay.

458
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,440
Follow me.

459
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,920
I’m having egg noodle in spicy soup with stewed pork.

460
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,320
What would you like?

461
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,960
Rice noodle in clear soup with meatballs.

462
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,040
A baby menu again.

463
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,920
Thank you.

464
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,440
Hold on a sec.

465
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,240
Here you are.

466
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,880
Come on, P’Arthit.

467
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,000
Can’t you let me have my usual food for once?

468
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,040
What?

469
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,600
I didn’t mean to tease you

470
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
But this bowl belongs to you, doesn’t it?

471
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,920
Yes, it does.

472
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,480
But I want you to try the stewed pork here.

473
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,160
It’s so damn good.

474
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,000
Finish it all if you like it.

475
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,160
How is it?

476
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,280
Is it good?

477
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,680
Yes

478
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,960
You should have just told me that.

479
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,680
Well, I want to see what noodle menu you normally have.

480
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,840
And look at this, your menu…

481
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,680
Rice noodle in clear soup with meatballs.

482
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,360
It is so damn plain.

483
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,440
You can take yours back.

484
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Hey…

485
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,600
What?

486
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,840
Don’t get offended by my words easily.

487
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,160
Keep it.

488
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,680
Another thing is…

489
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,840
I ordered it for you.

490
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
So, do you want to go back now?

491
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,640
Why?

492
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,240
Are you done here?

493
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
I want to have my hair cut first.

494
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,480
You can just take off.

495
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,200
No worries

496
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,560
I can wait for you

497
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,320
You can go to the salon now.

498
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,600
Well, what haircuts should I get?

499
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,280
How about skinhead haircut?

500
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,800
My fringes are annoying as hell.

501
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,520
Should I just go skinhead?

502
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,680
Sawasdee ka.

503
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,320
How can I help you?

504
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,280
I want to have my hair cut.

505
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,200
A hair cut, right?

506
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,400
Please come this way.

507
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,160
You can go walk around, no need to wait for me.

508
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,400
Okay.

509
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,880
It’s all done

510
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,800
You are now the most handsome man of all three worlds.

511
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,280
Here’s what it looks like from the back.

512
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,160
Check it out.

513
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,800
Okay?

514
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,440
You rock this hairstyle.

515
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,520
No one in this salon is more handsome than you

516
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,400
Kongpob.

517
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,000
How is it? Does it look okay?

518
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,040
I did tell him to do the skinhead.

519
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,920
But he said it wouldn’t look good on me.

520
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,000
I don’t feel confidence with this style.

521
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,040
No, dear.

522
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Please don’t touch your hair.

523
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,280
I have styled it to make you look this good.

524
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,320
This hairstyle is great. Trust me.

525
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,680
Or you can ask your boyfriend.

526
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,880
No. We are not a couple.

527
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,640
He’s my junior

528
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,400
Oops.

529
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,760
Well oh well.

530
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,880
I thought he was your boyfriend.

531
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,480
I saw he and you look out for each other…

532
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,440
How do I look?

533
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,600
I think my hair is still too long.

534
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,240
Should I have the skinhead cut?

535
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,200
You look good.

536
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,160
Give it to me straight.

537
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,000
I’m being serious here.

538
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,760
No need to sweet talk me.

539
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,000
I want to hear the truth.

540
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,560
It’s bad.

541
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,520
Huh?

542
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,000
It’s that bad?

543
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,000
No.

544
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,720
I’m talking about me.

545
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,480
It’s bad for my heart.
