1
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,280
People are talking about our freshman gathering.

2
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,800
This is very satisfying to read.

3
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,600
[Fourth-year seniors made a scene at the freshman gathering today.]
[This is so fake. / Is this getting too serious?]

4
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,760
Hey, Kong.

5
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,680
Kong, you bastard!

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,400
What hell is wrong with you guys?

7
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,520
Hey!

8
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,120
What’s wrong?

9
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,160
Nothing.

10
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,040
I’m just thinking…

11
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
…whether P’Arthit has done all 54 laps.

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,200
He’s crazy if he finishes all laps.

13
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,720
Nobody does that kind of thing for real.

14
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,320
Even you, you finished only 7 laps, right?

15
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah, that’s true.

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,880
Isn’t it great that the fourth years let us leave early.

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,200
We have plenty of time to work on the papers.

18
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,840
If we don’t have to take quiz tomorrow,

19
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,840
I would probably have a beer right now

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,280
Seriously.

21
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,760
What the f* is wrong with you guys?

22
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,720
Has someone broken your heart or what?

23
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,160
I knew it! Are you really heartsick?

24
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,240
Kong, are you heartsick?

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,240
Fine.

26
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,920
Apologies then.

27
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,920
who wants to find the books with me?

28
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,880
Are you going?

29
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,400
I’m going.

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,480
I’m going too.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,280
What the…

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,360
I have to guard our stuff then.

33
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
Hello, Nong Kong.

34
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,640
Sawasdee krup, P’Ple.

35
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,560
How are you?

36
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,120
I heard the fourth-year seniors intervened the freshman gathering today.

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,120
Yes.

38
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,880
But… they didn’t tell us to do anything

39
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,000
Only the third-year seniors were punished

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, really?

41
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,080
But I think they are quite soft on you guys this year.

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,080
In the past we had to run like a hundred of lap, you know?

43
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
Why did they have to go to that extent

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,480
Everything they do,

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,880
I’m sure they have reasons behind it

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
What about you?

47
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,720
How are you holding up?

48
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,280
It’s all about orienting yourself for the first year students.

49
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,280
In this uni, the studying is really tough,

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,800
and there are so many activities too.

51
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,680
I once thought of transferring myself to abroad.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Really? What changed your mind, then?

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
I just tried to settle in bit by bit.

54
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,640
After a while, I found that it was not all bad.

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,640
next think I know, I had already passed it all.

56
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,440
And when I look back at it,

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,320
it was kind of fun actually.

58
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,120
Is this what you are looking for?

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Yeah. Thank you.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,280
It was nice talking to you

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,680
but I think I should get back to my papers now.

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
See you around, okay?

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,360
Uh…P’Ple.

64
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,640
Actually, I wanted to study in economics.

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
So right now,

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,200
I’m not sure if I really fit in this place.

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,720
In your case,

68
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,880
what did you do so you are certain that you actually belong here

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,960
I think you better figure it out by yourself.

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,240
Even if I tell you, it’s just my own viewpoints.

71
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,600
You must find it out yourself

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,200
I hope you find it somehow.

73
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,560
Su Su. See you.

74
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,800
Now I ask for permission to run around the field for 54 laps.

75
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
What a long day!

76
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,720
I think I’m gonna crash out right away once home.

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,040
Hey, don’t forget that we have a physics test tomorrow.

78
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,840
Gosh, physics test!

79
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
The lecture note I took…

80
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
is just a scribble.

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,280
Has anyone had the lecture summary? Can I borrow?

82
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,120
No one takes note these days. We use this.

83
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,560
Hey, you guys.

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,200
Look over there.

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
Is that P’Arthit?

86
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,840
Is he still running?

87
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,480
I feel sorry for him

88
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,080
Look, someone just shared a picture of a hazing senior running in the field

89
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,920
Are you kidding? Isn’t it too much?

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,480
Yeah, what’s up?

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
Not yet. What’s the matter?

92
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,040
All right.

93
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,080
P’Arthit, please stop.

94
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,120
What are you doing here?

95
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Leave me alone!

96
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
But you have been running all day.

97
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,720
Please take a break at least.

98
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,240
Get out of here so I can finish this running.

99
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,200
Then, I’m gonna run with you.

100
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,120
Kongpob!

101
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,760
What the hell are you doing here?

102
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,640
I said get out!

103
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,600
No.

104
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,840
If you don’t stop, I won’t stop.

105
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,320
Kongpob!

106
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
Hey, Arthit.

107
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,520
What’s going on?

108
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,280
Get this brat out.

109
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,200
So I can continue running.

110
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,800
You, the first year,

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
what are you doing here?

112
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,640
He’s been running all day long already.

113
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
Why does he have to keep running?

114
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
But this is the punishment of the hazing team leader.

115
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,680
It’s not something for a first year like you to concern.

116
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,680
But I…

117
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,800
No more talking.

118
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,280
I don’t give you permission

119
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,560
Go wait over there.

120
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,680
Nong Kong.

121
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,080
Go up there and sit with your friends.

122
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,360
I’ll bring you some drink.

123
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Hey, Kong.

124
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,760
Over here, have a seat.

125
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,520
We just finished our papers from the library.

126
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,960
When we saw that P’Arthit is still running,

127
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,640
we are here to watch.

128
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I just shared his pic on the faculty’s web board.

129
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,280
It got reposted many of times.

130
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,200
How come you are here by the way?

131
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,200
M called and told me about this.

132
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,040
So I rushed to here.

133
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
I also heard it from the web board.

134
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,800
He completed 100 push ups.

135
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,080
100 squats

136
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,800
and 100 sits and stands.

137
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,960
I can’t help falling for this kind of guy

138
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,080
Give me a break.

139
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
You have soft spot for every man, Maprang.

140
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,760
I really like this senior-junior atmosphere.

141
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
Hey, Arthit

142
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,160
It’s the last lap already.

143
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,800
You are almost there.

144
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,520
Get up, man.

145
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,680
It’s all right.

146
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,320
You can do it, Arthit.

147
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
Get up, man. Get up.

148
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,160
It’s all right, man.

149
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,560
You are almost there.

150
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,240
You can do it, Arthit.

151
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,520
You don’t need to say anything.

152
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,840
We’re taking you to the doctor.

153
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,960
Are you all right, P’Arthit?

154
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,720
You’re not going back yet?

155
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,400
Go home.

156
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
Stay out of this.

157
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,560
It’s none of the first years’ business.

158
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,640
Let me take you to the hospital too.

159
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,960
Leave me alone.

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,240
Didn’t you hear me?

161
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,200
I said it was none of the first years’ business

162
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,320
This first year doesn’t have the right to worry about the third year like you?

163
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,760
Let’s get going, Knot.

164
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,360
I don’t want to keep this on

165
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,360
And for you,

166
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,960
This is the last warning from me.

167
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,240
Don’t ever meddle with the seniors’ matter.

168
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
Otherwise,

169
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,400
I punish the whole first-year class because of you.

170
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,760
Leave him alone, Kong.

171
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,760
I, myself, was not into this initiation ritual

172
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,400
I never wanted to join the gathering at my own will.

173
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,200
But if you take a good look at it,

174
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,360
this freshman gathering is just a creation of situations

175
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,160
It urges us to learn how to get through difficulties together in a team.

176
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,600
It’s like a library of experiences…

177
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,520
…where you can choose which experience you would like to read

178
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,080
The signature book makes me socialize more.

179
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,160
And the nametag…

180
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
That reminds me to think

181
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,480
and value the importance of knowing others

182
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
The attention I have to every small matter…

183
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,680
gives me the courage to raise my hand and help others.

184
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,920
These are the things I receive from the freshman gathering.

185
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,880
Though I know everything is just a set-up

186
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,720
But the role we play is real,

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,080
the pain is real,

188
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,720
and our hurtful feelings is also real.

189
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,200
Those seniors have put themselves out for us, the first years.

190
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,960
“P’Deer”

191
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,400
Prem.

192
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,040
Son of a b*, Prem!

193
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,920
What?

194
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Get me the phone.

195
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,200
Get it yourself.

196
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,400
I can only move my lips and yell at you, you fool.

197
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,040
Get it for me.

198
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
All right

199
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,280
Sometimes, I wonder if I’m your friend or your servant.

200
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,360
Hello, P’Deer.

201
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,560
Hello. How are you holding up, bro?

202
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,320
Dead yet?

203
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,600
Almost actually.

204
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,880
I think I saw my late grandpa waving his hand for me.

205
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
I almost went to him, you know?

206
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,880
You can back talk like this,

207
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,480
I guess you are okay now.

208
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
Knot said he took you to the hospital

209
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,720
So I got worried.

210
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,880
I didn’t tell you to go overboard.

211
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,480
Didn’t we agree at just 20 laps?

212
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,000
Come on, bro.

213
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,360
I want to show those freshmen how powerful you are.

214
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,760
Powerful my ass.

215
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,760
It’s you who gets all the credits.

216
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,000
Many first years keep sharing the picture of you all over my Facebook.

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,200
They also bashed me for being too barbarian on you.

218
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,360
Come on. Just take it as my year to shine.

219
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
Okay. Get well soon, you fool.

220
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,680
Yes. Thank you.

221
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,560
You indeed exerted yourself too much.

222
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,160
It’s a rule after all.

223
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,440
Screw the rule. We are all in trouble because of that.

224
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,960
Prem, I’m hungry.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,320
Go buy me congee.

226
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,200
Here you are.

227
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,680
Not this.

228
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,920
I want to drink pink milk too.

229
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,840
Hurry up.

230
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,640
I don’t want to go down.

231
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,880
Come on!

232
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Don’t go too long, you jackass.

233
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,160
The ice could get melted fast.

234
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,040
Money?

235
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,880
Come on, pay for me

236
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,880
Why? I want money.

237
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,000
I’ll pay later

238
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,520
I won’t lock the door.

239
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,360
Fine

240
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,760
Can I get a pink milk?

241
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
Certainly.

242
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,920
20 baht

243
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,320
Woah.

244
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,680
You have some lovely taste of a drink.

245
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,160
Sawasdee krup, P’Prem.

246
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,640
Do you buy this pink milk for yourself?

247
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Why do you want to know?

248
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
Nothing actually.

249
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,680
Hello.

250
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,600
Take it easy. Is anything wrong?

251
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,160
I’ll be right there.

252
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,640
You do know that my leg hurts.

253
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,840
Why bother to knock on the door?

254
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,000
Get in. The door is not locked.

255
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,240
What took you so damn long?

256
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
Did you help them stir the congee pot or something?

257
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
Get it to me fast. I’m starving.

258
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,440
Excuse me.

259
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,280
Hello, you asshole.

260
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Hold on. I’m not done yet.

261
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,240
Where the hell are you?

262
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,120
Playing game?

263
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,800
Put it on automatic, you fool.

264
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Hello?

265
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,480
Come on. How could you be so busy all the damn time?

266
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,360
Oh, it’s you, dad.

267
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,400
Yeah, I’m still busy here. I have a match to compete this evening.

268
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,760
Yes, dad.

269
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes, very exhausted, dad.

270
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
I’ve got to go now, dad.

271
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,320
All right. I love you.

272
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,720
Yes. Yes. Yes. See you.

273
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,760
Here you are, finally.

274
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,080
How’d it go?

275
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,160
Just like what I told you on the phone.

276
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,600
Come on.

277
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,520
I’ve made myself clear so many times.

278
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
I cannot authorize this field trip for you.

279
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
Please hear us out, professor.

280
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,680
We have this field trip every year.

281
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,200
And we have never had problems before.

282
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,800
But not this year.

283
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,520
Many parents put pressure on the university board

284
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,680
demanding us to ban the initiation field trip

285
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,000
Cause senior students always ask junior students to do grueling things

286
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,360
But you know that we don’t do that kind of things.

287
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,320
I know.

288
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,360
But you all should know too

289
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,320
that the anti-hazing trend this year is remarkably strong.

290
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,920
Many parents even follow the gathering activities on the uni web board

291
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,080
So the dean has ordered us

292
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,000
not to authorize any initiation field trip

293
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,520
to nip it in the bud

294
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,720
This doesn’t make any sense.

295
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,120
Why don’t those parents think of the benefits…

296
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,960
their children could get from this trip?

297
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,560
Yes, professor.

298
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,400
At least, it helps bond seniors and juniors together.

299
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,880
And they will become more mature after this

300
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,440
Becoming more mature?

301
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,880
By having a fight with you?

302
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,680
I do understand...

303
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,560
the purposes of your ideas and actions.

304
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,160
But it’s not easy for their parents

305
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,920
not amidst the tragic news reported year after year.

306
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,120
But I don’t say that you cannot have the initiation activities

307
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,760
My best advice for the time being is…

308
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,960
go back and think of the initiation activities that are creative…

309
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,440
inspiring and have some social benefits.

310
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,400
Okay?

311
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,640
If the dean gives the green light.

312
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,080
I’m happy to sign this off too.

313
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,720
I need to give a lecture now.

314
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,720
Thank you, sir.

315
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,000
Hey, how come you get in here?

316
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,440
I run into P’Prem.

317
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,680
He has to go somewhere urgently.

318
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,840
So he asked me to bring you this food and drink to you

319
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,240
Son of a bitch, Prem.

320
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,000
How are you doing?

321
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,240
I’m fine.

322
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,280
Then, why do you have to rest your leg on this?

323
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,880
Well, no particular reason.

324
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Ouch!

325
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,040
Your injury is really bad.

326
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,600
You cannot walk just yet, right?

327
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
It’s none of your business.

328
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,560
You can go now.

329
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,080
How can I?

330
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,800
You are in this bad state.

331
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,960
Let me untie this congee bag for you.

332
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
Watch out your leg.

333
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,400
Here you are.

334
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,520
Why are you still here?

335
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,120
To clear the plate for you.

336
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,880
You won’t be able to do it yourself.

337
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Am I right?

338
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,480
Your room is far different from what I had in mind.

339
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,360
I used to imagine that…

340
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,600
…your room was neat

341
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,600
and perfectly organized.

342
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,680
In fact, a hazer like you is an ordinary guy after all.

343
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,880
That happens when you watch too many TV series.

344
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You like to read comic books too?

345
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,680
Hands off!!

346
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,480
Come back here

347
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,400
What a busybody you are!

348
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,520
You hang dry the clothes.

349
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,840
Let me collect them for you.

350
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
Hey…

351
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,560
wait a minute.

352
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
What do you think you are doing?

353
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,160
Ironing the clothes.

354
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,640
Who told you to do so?

355
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,640
Well, you can just ask me now.

356
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Something like

357
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,720
“Iron the clothes 54 times. Go!”

358
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,800
Come on. I’m just kidding.

359
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,680
Can you let me do this now that I’m here?

360
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,760
My mother always asks me to iron the clothes.

361
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,480
So it becomes my habits I think.

362
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,040
I just can’t stand seeing wrinkle clothes. I have to iron them.

363
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,560
Pleeease…

364
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,800
Fine. Do whatever you feel like to.

365
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,680
You like robots?

366
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,600
Well…something like that.

367
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,680
Hey, I like them too.

368
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,680
I’m really crazy about figures, you know?

369
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,360
I asked my father to buy me one.

370
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,280
But he refused because it’s pricey.

371
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,360
Same as me.

372
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,400
But I…

373
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,800
…saved up for them

374
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,040
I bought it one by one.

375
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,120
Next thing I know, I have plenty of these figures in my house.

376
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,880
These are just a fraction of them, you know?

377
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,600
So you study engineering because you like robots too?

378
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,040
Not exactly.

379
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
But I think…

380
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,720
I want to create a robot too.

381
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,200
Can I have like a really big one…

382
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
like what they do in Japan?

383
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,960
Nah, that’s too big.

384
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,640
I better start with a small one.

385
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
Then you can make a small one like Wall-E.

386
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,680
It’s cute too.

387
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,680
I totally forgot that you may have to take some medications.

388
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,680
I forgot to ask if you have to take before meal pills

389
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,120
Yeah, you do.

390
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,000
You do have the before meal pills.

391
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,800
You should have warned me.

392
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,800
You have skipped one dose of this.

393
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,800
When will you get recover then?

394
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,360
Don’t forget it again.

395
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,200
What a busybody you are!

396
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,720
I’m a grown man not a kid.

397
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,960
And I’m also your senior.

398
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,760
Stop bossing me around.

399
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,680
I know that you are my senior

400
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,960
But you should know too that you are sick.

401
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,800
And a sick person needs to be attended.

402
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,000
When you are fully recovered,

403
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,640
you can punish me later.

404
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,720
But please listen to me for now.

405
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,400
“Namtan”

406
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,280
Are you not going to answer it?

407
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,240
Nah. I don’t want to talk.

408
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,880
Well, I better leave you alone now.

409
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,040
Please don’t forget to take these pills.

410
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,840
Don’t be a sore loser.

411
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,840
Watch your damn mouth, boy.

412
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,080
We may lose in the game but not here.

413
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,480
What the hell do you want?

414
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,520
You were not good enough to beat us.

415
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,840
You damn sore loser!

416
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,120
The guard is coming! Run!

417
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,600
Are you okay?

418
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,280
We are good.

419
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,160
Are you okay?

420
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,360
Your leg hurts?

421
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
Yeah, a bit.

422
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,280
Are you okay?

423
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,280
It hurts.

424
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,200
Your leg?

425
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,680
Yes.

426
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,160
I’ll take you to the hospital.

427
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
The bag.

428
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,880
I want to tell you that…

429
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,240
Today…

430
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,200
is the last freshmen gathering.

431
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,800
But this doesn’t mean that…

432
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,480
we accept you as engineering student class 59.

433
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,280
You all still have to attend the last event.

434
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,600
And that is...

435
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,080
The flag capturing event.

436
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,320
Then we will consider that you have completed…

437
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,720
the initiation ritual

438
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
We wish you all the best of luck.

439
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,680
You may be dismissed now.

440
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,920
Yes.

441
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,840
No, I didn’t forget.

442
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,800
Sure, see you in the evening.

443
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,760
Kong.

444
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,520
Who was on the phone?

445
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,600
Your voice is too sweet.

446
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,040
My line senior mentors are holding a group dinner this evening.

447
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,760
You should make use of your good looks  , you know?

448
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,360
Are you kidding?

449
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,760
Studying and activities have occupied most of our time each day.

450
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,720
Hey, Wad.

451
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,880
What happened to your face?

452
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,200
Nothing. Just an accident.

453
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,600
By the way,

454
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,440
do you know that we don’t need to the gathering anymore?

455
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,040
Really? Why?

456
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,120
They probably don’t have anything else to coach us.

457
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,400
But there is a Flag Capturing Day something.

458
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,960
They want the freshmen to join the event as many as possible.

459
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,560
Speaking of the Flag Capturing event.

460
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,680
I’m eager to know what we have to do that day.

461
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,600
Hey, Kong.

462
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,560
Since you are having dinner with your line seniors this evening.

463
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,400
Why don’t you ask them?

464
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,040
Okay. I’ll ask them for you.

465
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,000
But this ‘y’ must go to ‘a’

466
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,920
You got it wrong this one.

467
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,640
No, it can go to ‘b’ too.

468
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,200
You should refer to the graph.

469
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,400
Listen, you guys.

470
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,600
The Flag Capturing Day is drawing near.

471
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,040
After that, we have to take them to the beach.

472
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,760
The thing is…

473
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,200
we don’t get the authorization from the teacher just yet.

474
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,680
Are we still going there or not?

475
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,880
I want to take them to the beach too, you know?

476
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
But I still have no clue how to take them there.

477
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,240
Well, I think…

478
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,760
why don’t we just secretly take them there?

479
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Let’s do it on the sly.

480
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,600
I think it’s too risky.

481
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,560
That’s not a bad idea.

482
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,520
My friends from other universities also do it like that.

483
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,760
They have the field trip every year.

484
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,920
Trust me.

485
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,000
It’s too risky.

486
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,240
How?

487
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Think about this.

488
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,240
There’s a pretty high chance that other people will know about this.

489
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,840
Even though we succeed in taking them to the field trip this year.

490
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,800
What if people find out later?

491
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Our faculty will be in the hot seat,

492
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,440
so are we.

493
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,120
In the worst case, everything may get called off.

494
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,560
I don’t think we can afford the risk.

495
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,560
I agree with Knot.

496
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,120
I think the best way out is to get the permission from the university board.

497
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,160
I will discuss this with the fourth-year seniors.

498
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,040
I will go ask for advice from other professors.

499
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,240
I will go watch some series in the mean time.

500
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,840
Is this the time to say that, you fag?

501
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,640
I’m trying to lift the mood here.

502
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,960
We still have time.

503
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,840
Don’t give up just yet.

504
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,520
P’Ple, sawasdee krup.

505
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,200
Hey, sawasdee Nong Kong.

506
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,360
Sit down.

507
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,840
Let me introduce our direct line seniors first.

508
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,720
This is P’Noonnoon. She’s our third-year senior mentor.

509
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,960
And our fourth-year senior mentor, his name is P’Pak

510
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,640
He’s busy so he cannot come today.

511
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,240
I’m sorry for coming here late.

512
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,400
I hope I haven’t kept you all waiting for me too long.

513
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,480
No, we’ve just got here too.

514
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,560
We thought people might be crowded

515
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,120
so we were here early to reserve the table.

516
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,280
More people are joining us?

517
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
Yes.

518
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,200
Ple hasn’t told you this?

519
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,400
We have co-senior mentors too for our student ID line.

520
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,880
Our line senior mentor who graduated, P’Fon

521
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,760
she’s going to marry P’Tum from another student ID line next month.

522
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,440
So we have a big group of 2 student-lines party here.

523
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,480
And what is the other student ID line?

524
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,920
0206.

525
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,280
It’s the same set of numbers like us but swap around.

526
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,480
Isn’t it strange?

527
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,800
So many say P’Tum and P’Fon are destined to be with each other.

528
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,960
Come on. Let’s eat.

529
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,320
Hey, Nong Kongpob.

530
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,560
I have been seeing you from the pictures on Facebook

531
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,480
You look even cuter than those pictures.

532
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,200
Thank you.

533
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,040
Hey, Ai-Oon

534
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,600
Over here!

535
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,440
Sawasdee krup.

536
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
Sawasdee krup.

537
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,920
Come on, bro.

538
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
I told you not to call me Ai-Oon.

539
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,560
Call me Arthit instead.

540
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,280
Why?

541
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,640
Your nickname is Ai-Oon.

542
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,840
I’ve been calling you that ever since you were a first year.

543
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,360
I get used to it already.

544
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,000
But I’m now a third-year.

545
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,520
And I’m also a hazing team leader.

546
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,920
The name can affect my image, you know? (Ai-Oon = Warmth)

547
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,400
All right. I forgot.

548
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
You are now a third-year senior and a hazing team leader.

549
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,720
But…the gathering activities have been over, haven’t they?

550
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,080
We still have the Flag Capturing event left.

551
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,600
Good. Have you thought about what you would do for the flag event?

552
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,560
Yes, but I can’t tell you.

553
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
All I can say that it’s going to be really tough.

554
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,080
Well, I’m going to get more pork.

555
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,000
Do you want anything else?

556
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,320
Go ahead. Don’t worry about us.

557
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,400
Please let me help you.

558
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,560
I just realize that your nickname is Ai-Oon.

559
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,720
Who says you can call me by that name?

560
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,280
Why?

561
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,040
I think Ai-Oon is a good name actually

562
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,040
If you keep calling me that,

563
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,560
I’ll order you to sit and stand right in the middle of this place.

564
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,880
You must not tell anyone about my nickname.

565
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,240
I won’t, P’Arthit.

566
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,680
Is your leg better now?

567
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
It is.

568
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,640
That’s a relief.

569
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,840
Now I can rest my worries about you
