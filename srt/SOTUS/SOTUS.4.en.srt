1
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,720
Kong!

2
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,360
What’s up?

3
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,440
Check this out.

4
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,000
Look.

5
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
Why do you guys look all excited about the event?

6
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,800
We do.

7
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Do you still remember when we played basketball in high school?

8
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
Remember?

9
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,840
We were on top of our games with passion and all.

10
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,720
We practiced all day all night.

11
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,320
Did we?

12
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,400
Do you remember?

13
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,120
But I…didn’t go to the same high school as you guys.

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,000
That’s why I’m asking you to join us here.

15
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,240
Remember the moment we won the trophy.

16
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,640
Remember? We won it.

17
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,160
Think back to the time we got to touch the trophy.

18
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,400
It was a shiny, gleaming and gold. Remember?

19
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,880
That gold thing that I wish I could touch it once again.

20
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,880
Okay. Enough.

21
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,240
I’m in

22
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Now we’re talking, man.

23
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,720
What about you, Oak?

24
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Nah. Go ahead.

25
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,240
I don’t want to rain on your parade.

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,960
But I heard this year

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,880
the basketball players from the Faculty of Sports Science are hopeful winners.

28
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,840
They are all bulky and strong.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,080
Apart from us,

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,440
I think I never see any other first-year friends in the basketball field.

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
You are right.

32
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,600
Never mind about that

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,880
You guys can just dream about the trophy for the time being.

34
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,160
Leave the recruiting task to me.

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,480
Wad, wanna join the basketball team with me?

36
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,160
Hey, Wad.

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,840
Wad!

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Huh?

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,120
Wanna play basketball with me?

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,280
Are you talking to me?

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,480
Yeah. Do you want to play basketball with me?

42
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,040
Nah…

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,480
Thanks!

44
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,360
How’d it go?

45
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,560
I saw Wad smiling back at you.

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,400
It’s a no from him.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,480
He just shut the door on me.

48
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
It’s going to be all right.

49
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,360
We can play just for fun.

50
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
Look! P’Arthit is here.

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,320
Didn’t he get kicked out from the lead hazer already?

52
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,640
I know, right?

53
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
I have something to tell you

54
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,560
For the next whole week…

55
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,240
the freshmen gathering will be temporarily put off

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,640
so that you all can participate in the activities during the Freshy Games

57
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,080
And I require you all

58
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,880
to take part in every single activity

59
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,720
and give it your all.

60
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
I hope this is not beyond your ability to do.

61
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,600
Kongpob.

62
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,680
Hey, Prae.

63
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,880
How are you doing?

64
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,480
I still have no idea what to perform at the talent round of the Freshy Star Contest.

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,320
Do you mind if I sit here?

66
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,600
Hey, Maprang, May

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,720
Since when you are close to these ladies.

68
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,320
Have you registered your name to any activity yet?

69
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,000
What register?

70
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,960
The third-year seniors told us to win all activities.

71
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,200
So Tew is finding people to sign up for those activities.

72
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,480
What activity do you take part?

73
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,440
I and May will be helping the grandstand cheering team.

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
But we still understaff.

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,760
Are you guys interested?

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,720
Yeah, why not?

77
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,760
What about you guys?

78
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
Are you joining?

79
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040
Yeah.

80
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
Any activity is fine

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,600
Tew!

82
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
What’s up, Maprang?

83
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,320
Kongpob has agreed to help us on the grandstand.

84
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Are you serious?

85
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,960
That’s cool.

86
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,680
Well, can you sign up here for me, then?

87
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Hey, M.

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,920
Huh?

89
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,880
Are you in too?

90
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,320
Absolutely, let me sign up now.

91
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
Yeah, just complete it.

92
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,560
Hey, Kongpob.

93
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,440
Didn’t you have to compete in the Freshy Star Contest?

94
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,720
Hey, Kong.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,720
You don’t have to sign this up.

96
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,920
I forgot that you were nominated to the Freshy Star Contest.

97
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,600
Well, I gave him my word to take part in this basketball competition

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,880
Can I sign up for a substitute player?

99
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
Sure. You can join the team as a substitute player.

100
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,680
Just a couple of minutes in the field would do us good.

101
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,280
That’s enough to boost the team rating

102
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,400
Hey, Wad.

103
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,320
How’d it go?

104
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
Did you do well on the quiz?

105
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,640
It was so-so.

106
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,720
Are these all the names we have so far?

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
And look at their fitness.

108
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,960
I don’t think we stand a chance in this competition.

109
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,400
That’s what I think too.

110
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,440
Screw it.

111
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,400
Do you think we should call them and talk?

112
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,920
If we don’t do something, we won’t get to win anything.

113
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,400
Yeah.

114
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,040
Call the freshmen in.

115
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,160
All of the first years who participate in the sports competitions,

116
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,880
come over here.

117
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,480
I ask you to gather here

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,480
not that I want to help you train or give you any advice.

119
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,240
I am here today…

120
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
just to let you know that

121
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,360
our Faculty of Engineering,

122
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,240
ever since the first Freshy Games was held

123
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,520
we have never been defeated to anybody.

124
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
We have always been No.1

125
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,480
I hope I don’t have to witness…

126
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,880
that all we have accomplished ends here at your year.

127
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
But the Freshy Games are supposed to build unity among freshmen.

128
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,080
If this is what you can think of, go home and let your mom suckle you.

129
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,760
Hey!

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
I asked you nicely, didn’t I? Watch your damn mouth!

131
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,960
So?

132
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,120
What do you want?

133
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,040
Who do you think I am? I’m your senior.

134
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,920
Or you want a piece of me?

135
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,640
Sure, I do!

136
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,480
What’s so great about being born first?

137
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,680
You can get kicked in the ass too.

138
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,520
Do you want to f* with me?

139
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,400
Stop!

140
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
Why do you keep picking fights with each other?

141
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
Don’t you feel ashamed of yourself?!

142
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,560
You want to know right?

143
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,800
Fine!

144
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,520
Let me tell you.

145
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,520
You are newly enrolled students here, so to you,

146
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,760
the Freshy Games may be just ordinary competitions.

147
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,440
But to me, this is the test to prove your capability,

148
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,080
whether you have what it takes to be in the Faculty of Engineering.

149
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,560
The more you are serious about these competitions.

150
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,200
the more it proves to me that you earnestly give importance to them.

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,880
But if you take them for granted…

152
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,720
and give up from the beginning.

153
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,040
Then you don’t deserve…

154
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,800
to be the students of engineering in this faculty.

155
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,320
We will win for sure.

156
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,080
Don’t just talk the talk but walk the walk.

157
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
Bear in mind that you are the representatives of the freshmen.

158
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,800
And you carry the hopes and aspirations of the whole first-year class.

159
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,120
I know that fully well.

160
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,520
That’s why I say “we will win for sure.”

161
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,520
I will prove to you…

162
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,920
that us, the first years, have what it takes to be engineering students here too.

163
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,720
Good.

164
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,640
We’ll look forward to that.

165
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
Hey, Wad. Hold on.

166
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,640
Don’t you want to prove them wrong?

167
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,520
I, myself, can’t stand being looked down upon like that.

168
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,520
What if we lose like they say…

169
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,320
I’m in.

170
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,560
Save your words.

171
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Tee, this is unbelievable.

172
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,400
With the four of us in the team, we have a high chance of winning.

173
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Yeah, Wad will help us win for sure.

174
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
Hey…

175
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,480
you shouldn’t have stopped Prem

176
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,280
I really wanted to see him fight.

177
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,120
Think thoroughly before you do anything.

178
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,880
Don’t lose yourself to your emotions easily.

179
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,280
The teachers are closely monitoring us, you know?

180
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,200
If you are like that, those juniors will never respect us.

181
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,360
Yeah,

182
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,680
And your 0062 boy…

183
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,840
He’s such a nosy parker.

184
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,160
It’s in his nature.

185
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,960
I’m sick of punishing him too.

186
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
He acts like he can do everything.

187
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,200
Can he really pull it off?

188
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,080
Don’t underestimate him.

189
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,720
Huh?

190
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,880
What did you just say?

191
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,600
Nothing. Let’s get going.

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,360
What the hell?

193
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,760
♬ No, I never fear the storms. ♬

194
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,280
♬ I’m ready to go through it with you by my side. ♬

195
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,200
♬ It’s not a big deal because I will never let go of your hand. ♬

196
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,800
♬ When you are right beside me, I will never be lonely ♬

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,080
♬ or feel weary either day or night. ♬

198
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,520
♬ As long as you are there for me, my spirit can never be shaken. ♬

199
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,880
♬ Let’s love lead the way. ♬

200
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,040
♬ The goal won’t be just a dream. ♬

201
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,880
♬ As long as you and me are together, ♬

202
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,840
♬ The goal line is never out of reach.  ♬

203
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
♬ Even though I stagger,  ♬

204
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,440
♬ my eyes never wander.  ♬

205
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,440
♬ My mind never wavers  ♬

206
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,480
♬ from the dream I have. ♬

207
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,880
♬ Even though I stagger,  ♬

208
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,720
♬ my mind never wavers. ♬

209
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
♬ Even though I get knocked over, ♬

210
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,960
♬ I will never let go of your hand ever. ♬

211
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,640
Okay guys.

212
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,480
The game is over. Please gather here.

213
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,280
Wan, you are the best, man.

214
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,960
How can I be as good as you?

215
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,320
It’s called practicing.

216
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,720
Just practice a lot.

217
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
Haven’t I practiced enough?

218
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,280
Practice harder

219
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,960
Okay guys, I’m going to announce the starting lineup.

220
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,280
There will be 5 people.

221
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,360
The first person is Wad.

222
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,920
The second person is…

223
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,240
Tee.

224
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,240
Congrats, man.

225
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,680
The third person is…

226
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,760
Beam.

227
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,840
The fourth person is Klam.

228
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Hey, Kong.

229
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,480
Only one position left.

230
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,280
So either one of us will sit on the bench.

231
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,360
I hope this selection won’t affect our friendship.

232
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,760
And the last person…

233
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,480
M.

234
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,040
Yeah!

235
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,120
Congrats, man

236
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,440
Sorry, man.

237
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,000
I’m just too excited.

238
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,920
You are okay, right?

239
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,520
About what?

240
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,880
That you have to be a substitute player.

241
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,680
Ah, I actually asked them for that.

242
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,720
Did you forget?

243
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,280
Oh…

244
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,120
That’s a wrap for today.

245
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,480
Let get yourself ready for tomorrow’s game.

246
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,000
Well, I’m going to help Oak and Maprang on the grandstand team.

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,160
Who wants to come with me?

248
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,720
Nah, I better go back and rest.

249
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,440
I want to be fully fit for tomorrow.

250
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,600
That’s fine, man. See you later

251
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,920
You were so great today.

252
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,720
See you.

253
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,200
Let’s get going, Kong.

254
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,600
Hey, Oak.

255
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,760
Hey, M, Kongpob.

256
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,960
Wasdee, Maprang.

257
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,520
Is the selection over?

258
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,640
Yes.

259
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,360
Who got selected in the starting lineup?

260
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,200
There are Wad, Tee, Beam, Klam, and…

261
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
me.

262
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,080
Wow, really? You are indeed good at it.

263
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,840
Hey, Kong.

264
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Have you seen your picture on the Facebook?

265
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,120
What picture?

266
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,840
This.

267
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,640
The picture used for the Freshy Star Contest.

268
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,840
The official page just put it up

269
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,040
You look so damn handsome, man

270
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,160
Let me see the female contestants too.

271
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
Praepailin is so friggin’ cute.

272
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,400
Listen,

273
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,520
the Like amounts on Kongpob and Prae’s photos are still low.

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,680
let’s throw in money to boost the Like hits.

275
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,280
It’s all right.

276
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,280
Whatever the number of my Like hits is

277
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,720
I’m okay with it.

278
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,520
Is there anything else I can do here, Maprang?

279
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,480
Oh, actually it’s all good here.

280
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,080
We can handle it.

281
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,920
Hey, Kong.

282
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,800
Why don’t you go ask May?

283
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,400
She may have something for you to do over there

284
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,040
May!

285
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,520
Sorry. Sorry.

286
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,200
I can take care of this. It’s really okay.

287
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,640
Your shocking reaction is so manly, you know?

288
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,320
Kong.

289
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,480
How about I fix this up for you?

290
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,680
Give me the brush and the paint.

291
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,320
Are you sure?

292
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,120
But…

293
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,120
I can fix it myself

294
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,520
Just give me the brush and the paint.

295
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,880
Can you like…

296
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,160
paint it a little softer on that?

297
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,400
Hey, Kong.

298
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,840
Do you have a basketball match tomorrow?

299
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,800
Um.

300
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,800
Well, Susu! (give it your all)

301
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,360
I’ll be there to support you.

302
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,800
Thank you.

303
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,880
Um.

304
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,720
Hey, M?

305
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,520
Why are you still here?

306
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,200
Don’t you have a basketball match tomorrow?

307
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
Nah.

308
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,040
I want to stay up until everything is done here.

309
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,560
Are you kidding?

310
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,000
But I’m good here.

311
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
It’s almost done anyway

312
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,840
You are a quiet person, aren’t you?

313
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,960
Uh..May.

314
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,440
Huh?

315
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,000
Well…

316
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,840
You got a paint on your face.

317
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,920
A paint?

318
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,040
..on your cheek.

319
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,080
My cheek?

320
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,040
This side.

321
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,040
On your right.

322
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,320
This?

323
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,160
Move your finger a bit higher.

324
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,640
Has it gone?

325
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,480
No.

326
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
It became messier.

327
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,920
Really?

328
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,360
Where is it?

329
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,840
This area.

330
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,600
Gone?

331
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,320
Not yet.

332
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,880
Then, can you do me a favor?

333
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,680
Hey, it’s not like I have a poop on my face.

334
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,920
Don’t just brush.

335
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,960
Wipe it off for me so I can get back to this.

336
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,880
♬ Just know it in our own heart. ♬

337
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
♬ Just the two of us is enough. ♬

338
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,360
♬ It’s more than love. No words could ever express. ♬

339
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,080
Has it gone?

340
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,800
Yes?

341
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,360
Wonderful. You are actually a useful guy.

342
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,200
♬ We don’t need to walk hand in hand. ♬

343
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,560
♬ Just standing next to each other is good enough. ♬

344
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,720
♬ Our love does not require any kind of words…♬

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,160
♬ …to define it. ♬

346
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,560
Kong.

347
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
Hey, Kong!

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,800
What are you looking at?

349
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,560
I’ve been calling you for a while, you don’t hear me?

350
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,440
No, nothing.

351
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,960
What are you looking at?

352
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,680
It’s really nothing.

353
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
Focus, man

354
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,640
The game is about to begin.

355
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,920
Go get the ball and practice.

356
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,120
Yeah, give him the ball.

357

360
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,240
Come on. Hurry up.

361
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,800
It’s all right.

362
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,280
We are just 5 points behind.

363
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,320
We still have a chance to win this game

364
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,520
But every time we attack, we must score.

365
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,120
Just block your opponents one on one.

366
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,120
M, you keep following No.7 player

367
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,600
He’s so fast.

368
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,280
And Wad,

369
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,720
don’t bother to stay back to rebound.

370
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,600
Understand?

371
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
You are still okay, right?

372
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,120
Yes

373
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,480
Coach, I’m done.

374
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,120
Then, you take his place, Kongpob.

375
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,840
If you can’t shoot from the inside

376
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,000
throw the ball to Kongpob

377
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,360
and let him shoot a three pointer.

378
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,520
Okay.

379
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,880
Come on. Give it your all!

380
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,280
Come on.

381
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,640
Engineering!

382
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,600

386
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,120
What the hell do you want?

387
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,440
Stop. No.

388
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,840
Engineering 61 – 60 Sport Sciences

389
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,880
Come here, man.

390
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,280
That shot was so cool, you know?

391
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,160
You are so awesome.

392
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,640
How could you do that?

393
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,840
We must practice a lot, right?

394
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,440
Hey, is your leg okay?

395
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,160
No, it’s from that fall earlier.

396
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,200
Are you okay?

397
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,400
It hurts.

398
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,640
Guys, you are really terrific.

399
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,520
Here.

400
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,040
A little support from your seniors

401
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,600
Drink it.

402
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,520
Pass it on.

403
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,840
Everyone gets one, right?

404
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,080
Hey, Kong.

405
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,440
What’s with the expression?

406
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,120
Aren’t you glad that we won?

407
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,480
No.

408
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,800
I just don’t see any third-year seniors in the crowd.

409
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,640
So what?

410
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,320
They are afraid of losing their face.

411
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,440
They underestimate us too much. See? Now that we prove them wrong

412
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,640
They don’t dare to show up.

413
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,480
Wait and see.

414
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,800
I’ll poke them in the eye with the trophy…

415
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,400
and shut their big mouth.

416
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,400
It’s all right, guys.

417
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,400
We are all drained today

418
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Tomorrow is the final game

419
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,680
Why don’t we go home?

420
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,080
It’s okay though those seniors are not here.

421
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,640
We won, didn’t we? They will find out somehow

422
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,760
Let’s just go home. Okay?

423
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,320
And you, stop looking, okay?

424
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,400
You are still looking

425
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,440
Fine.

426
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,320
Come on. Let’s go home.

427
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,440
40 baht.

428
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,760
Your order?

429
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,760
5 grilled pork skewers and 1 pack of sticky rice

430
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,200
Wait a sec. They are being cooked.

431
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,600
I’ll come back and pick up my order later.

432
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,720
Hi,

433
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,560
5 grilled pork skewers and 1 pack of sticky rice.

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,680
Wait a sec. They are being cooked.

435
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
Sawasdee krup, P’Arthit.

436
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,240
What’s up?

437
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,720
My basketball team is in the final round now

438
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,440
And I heard that other sports from our faculties are in the final too.

439
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,800
Why do you tell me?

440
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
I didn’t see you at the arena to watch the game.

441
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,680
So you probably don’t know about this.

442
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,880
Just getting into the final round…

443
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,800
you don’t need to tell me.

444
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,360
‘Cause I don’t care.

445
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,040
I only care whether you win or not.

446
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,120
You don’t have to worry about that.

447
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,560
I’m going to win no matter what.

448
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,800
Are you sure?

449
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,000
I heard that you contend in the Freshy Star Contest too.

450
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,640
Do you remember what I said?

451
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,600
We, engineering students, never lose to anyone.

452
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,240
If you want me to accept you,

453
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,360
you must win all competitions you take part.

454
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,080
What if I win…

455
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,760
what will you give me?

456
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,840
Kongpob!

457
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,240
How dare of you to make a deal with me?

458
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,720
I’m not making a deal.

459
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,560
I’m just making an offer.

460
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,880
You can take it or leave it.

461
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,640
In fact,

462
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,120
All the difficulties are on me.

463
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,560
Except you are afraid to see me win.

464
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,440
Fine.

465
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,600
I’ll take your offer.

466
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,760
‘Cause I think the person like you…

467
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,000
will probably lose in every game.

468
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,720
Then, don’t forget to come and watch for yourself,

469
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,400
whether I lose or not.

470
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,520
Your order is ready.

471
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,160
How much?

472
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
60 baht.

473
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,640
Look, it’s up!

474
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,160
What?

475
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,160
He’s so gorgeous.

476
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,280
Look at this one

477
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,960
He’s really cute.

478
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,280
Isn’t he cute?

479
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,880
How is your leg.

480
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,240
Still hurts a bit.

481
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,520
Wad, you sit on the bench first.

482
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,440
Let’s see what tactics our opponent use.

483
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,160
I’m so damn nervous.

484
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,120
They have a university basketball player in the team.

485
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,080
All players, please get yourself ready.

486
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,000
Hey, Kong. What are you looking at?

487
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,320
The game is about to begin.

488
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,640
Focus, man.

489
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
No, nothing.

490
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
No my ass. You are still looking as we are speaking.

491
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,440
What are they here for?

492
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,680
Hey, Wad.

493
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,360
I was free back there. You should have handed me the ball.

494
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,440
I could get a shot too.

495
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,080
But you are risking yourself to get hurt

496
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,000
It will hurt more if we lose.

497
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Engineering 59 – 60 Agricultures

498
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,880
Kong, hurry up.

499
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
You have to get ready for the Star Contest.

500
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,320
P’Arthit.

501
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,360
Don’t forget to come watch me at the contest.
