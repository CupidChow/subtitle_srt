1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay guys, we are going to train you the chant today.

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Okay, let’s start.

3
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
We are engineer. Ready?

4
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
Ready.

5
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,600
3..4..

6
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,880
E-N-G-I-N-E-E-R

7
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,240
We Are Engineer.

8
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,440
Stop!

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
What are you doing?

10
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
Is this the best you could do?

11
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,560
It’s not loud enough.

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,840
It’s not even harmonious

13
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
I’m wondering...

14
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,960
who’s in charge of training them?

15
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,680
It’s me.

16
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,040
Then show me how you chant

17
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,240
I want to see what you taught them

18
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,840
The first years, sit down!

19
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,240
We are engineer, ready!

20
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,840
3…4…

21
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,920
E-N-G-I-N-E-E-R

22
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,440
We Are Engineer Engineer.

23
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
Is this the best you could chant?

24
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,480
Then it’s not surprising at all!

25
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,440
…why these freshmen can’t chant properly.

26
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,400
Because the trainers are crappy!

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,600
You guys suck!

28
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,480
Keep chanting and don’t stop

29
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,760
until these freshmen know how to do it.

30
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,160
Go!

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,600
It’s sucky!

32
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,320
Kongpob, student ID 0062.

33
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,680
May I ask for permission?

34
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,280
What do you want?

35
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,840
May I chant on behalf of the second years?

36
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
You don’t get the permission to do so.

37
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,000
We don’t need a hero here.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
Sit down!

39
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,400
But…

40
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,200
If you don’t sit down, then get out of here!

41
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,800
Go on. Now!

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
May I ask for permission?

43
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,320
No, you can’t.

44
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
May I?!

45
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,320
Kongpob!

46
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,840
You don’t get the permission.

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
Get out of here!

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,800
Get out!

49
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
Kathawut, student ID 0097.

50
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
May I ask for permission?

51
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
What’s the matter?

52
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,520
I would like to have Kongpob come back in

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,840
and I…

54
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,640
I and the rest of us here will chant on behalf of the second years

55
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,720
No, your permission is rejected.

56
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,880
Sit down.

57
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
May I ask for permission?

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,400
No, you can’t.

59
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,280
May I ask for permission?

60
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,200
No, you can’t.

61
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,440
May I ask for permission?

62
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,360
No, you can’t.

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,240
May I ask for permission?

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,960
No, you can’t.

65
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,720
May I ask for permission?

66
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,760
May I ask for permission?

67
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,040
May I ask for permission?

68
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
May I ask for permission?

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,720
May I ask for permission?

70
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
May I ask for permission?

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,320
May I ask for permission?

72
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
Enough!

73
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,720
If you would like to chant that badly,

74
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
Fine!

75
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,760
I let you do it.

76
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,000
But your friend is not allowed to stay.

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,920
Why are you still here?

78
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,080
Get out!

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,560
Yes, sir.

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,840
Go ahead.

81
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,040
Do the chant.

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,440
We are engineer, ready?

83
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,800
3…4…

84
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,840
E-N-G-I-N-E-E-R

85
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,080
We Are Engineer Engineer.

86
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
Where should we eat today?

87
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,160
Aunt Toi’s.

88
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
Aunt Toi’s? No. Let’s go to Aunt Nang’s

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,360
Wait. Who’s that guy?

90
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,720
0062

91
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,920
What are you doing here?

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,560
I’m waiting for my friends.

93
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,880
You know, right?...

94
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,600
why I kicked you out today.

95
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,120
Because I upset you.

96
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,680
About what?

97
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,560
About my request to chant on behalf of the second years

98
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,520
No, it’s not that.

99
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,320
I kicked you out today,

100
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,720
because I told you that we didn’t need a hero here.

101
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,280
What do you mean?

102
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,160
Or you don’t like the fact that I always present myself to do things?

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,720
I never want to be a center of attention.

104
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,080
I only want to help my friends.

105
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,400
Don’t you think you make them get used to being helped by you?

106
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,520
Doesn’t it make them only wait for someone to lead them?

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,200
What if they face a difficult situation in their life,

108
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,280
how can they handle it by themselves?

109
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,800
If your friends just wait for someone to lead them…

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
and don’t even try to stand up and work it out by themselves

111
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,120
then they are not good enough…

112
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,960
to be my junior students.

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,160
Do you understand what I mean?

114
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,640
Yes.

115
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,480
But a friend of yours came to talk to me to help you today.

116
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,960
So I will let you join the next gathering meeting.

117
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,480
But take this as the last warning from me, Kongpob.

118
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,440
Don’t try to be a hero.

119
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,880
Do you understand?

120
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
I do.

121
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,840
Wait, P’Arthit.

122
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,640
When I asked for your signature back then,

123
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,320
I didn’t try to be a hero or anything.

124
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Why did you punish me?

125
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,520
What do you think?

126
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,760
I think…

127
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,880
…you like me.

128
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,240
Huh?

129
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,080
What did you just say?

130
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,920
They say when you like someone,

131
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,640
you try to find a way to tease that someone to get his attention

132
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,040
And you seem to enjoy punishing me.

133
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
Does it mean…

134
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,880
you have a crush on me?

135
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,600
No, I don’t!

136
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
What are you looking at?

137
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,880
If you are done here, then leave.

138
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,040
You too.

139
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,680
Go home.

140
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
Kong.

141
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,400
Did you just annoy him again?

142
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,320
I didn’t

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
How could he deny that he didn’t.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
Obviously, he’s pissed off by you

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,840
I just got on his nerves with some little thing

146
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,000
Let’s get going.

147
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,680
This is frightening.

148
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,360
Why did he have to do that?

149
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,840
Can I not go?

150
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,680
Here I am.

151
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,280
Here, I bought them for you all.

152
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
Absolutely, I’m always bright

153
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,040
Listen.

154
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,520
I have something to share.

155
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,080
According to a Japanese’s belief,

156
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,680
if you write down the name of your crush on an eraser,

157
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,960
and use it up without lending it to anyone,

158
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,760
you love will come true.

159
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,680
Really?

160
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,040
Why don’t you write down P’Yatch name on your eraser?

161
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,680
I heard you have a crush on him?

162
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,640
You are right.

163
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,000
If I write his name,

164
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,320
his parents may come ask me to marry his son

165
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,720
Am I right?

166
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,760
You girls wake me up!

167
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,880
It’s cold, you know?

168
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,600
Here, drink it so your brain gets awake.

169
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,520
You may get nothing from out class if you stay drowsy.

170
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,240
What were you talking about?

171
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,920
It’s nothing. I’ll tell you later.

172
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,840
Come on. Tell me now

173
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,280
It’s really nothing.

174
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,000
By the way,

175
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,560
do you girls know about Prae?

176
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,120
What is it?

177
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,240
The seniors ask Prae to join the faculty’s star contest

178
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,960
Isn’t it awesome?

179
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,400
How awesome.

180
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,920
Then who’s the male representative from our faculty?

181
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,200
Ah, it’s Kongpob.

182
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,600
The guy who gave you his name tag.

183
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,000
Don’t you remember?

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
I think…Kongpob is kinda handsome too

185
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,640
He’s not bad at all.

186
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,320
Don’t you think?

187
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,920
Huh?

188
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
What do you think about Kongpob?

189
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,880
Is he okay?

190
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,520
He’s okay.

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
I heard he’s still available too.

192
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,280
Really?

193
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,760
Wow, interesting.

194
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,600
And he’s hot too

195
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
May.

196
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,960
Are you okay?

197
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,880
I’m good.

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,880
Are you sure?

199
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,200
Well, where’s Prae?

200
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,760
Hey, you girls.

201
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,520
We have a quiz today!

202
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,360
Are you serious?

203
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,800
Prae is waiting for us

204
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,800
Good luck!

205
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
Well, we’ve got to split.

206
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,840
Excuse me, sir.

207
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,480
Yes.

208
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,920
Take this test and get to your seat.

209
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,360
What are you looking for?

210
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,680
I forgot my eraser.

211
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,920
Here.

212
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,200
I have two of them.

213
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
You can use mine.

214
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,680
Um. Thank you.

215
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,680
You can start now.

216
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,840
That’s a wrap for today.

217
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,800
Have fun at the gathering meeting

218
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
See you again.

219
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,520
Thank you.

220
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,080
Hey, Kong.

221
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,480
Thank you for the name tag.

222
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,200
Oh, it’s all right.

223
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,760
How did you get a new name tag?

224
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,400
I found it in my locker.

225
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,360
I didn’t know who put it there either

226
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
That day, when you gave me your name tag…

227
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,560
weren’t you afraid of being punished by those seniors?

228
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
It better get punished instead of you.

229
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,600
Hey, what are you doing?

230
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,160
Let’s go get changed.

231
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,640
Yeah, sure.

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
I have to get going first.

233
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,200
See you.

234
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,720
Today, I’m the person in charge of training you.

235
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,680
Where’s P’Arthit.

236
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah, why?

237
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,600
Why does P’Knot take his place?

238
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,560
I think…

239
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
P’Knot is not as harsh as P’Arthit.

240
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,440
Everyone, be silent!

241
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,160
I hope you haven’t forgotten about the signature gathering task.

242
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,120
Have you managed to collect 1,000 signatures of seniors in your book?

243
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,480
M, how many have you got?

244
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,240
Me?

245
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
6 or 7 signatures.

246
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,520
Damn it, man

247
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,640
I’ve got over 200

248
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,840
Over 200?

249
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,520
The person like you?

250
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,440
Be quiet!

251
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,160
I’m talking right now.

252
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,120
Don’t you have some manner at all?

253
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Can I see your signature book?

254
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,760
Hey, M.

255
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,360
Why didn’t Tew get in trouble?

256
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,160
He’s probably got a lot of signatures.

257
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,800
For the past whole week,

258
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,920
what did you do during the time you had?

259
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,640
How come you couldn’t complete this task?

260
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
Let me ask you this.

261
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,880
Do you still want to be an engineering student?

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,040
We do.

263
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,080
If you still want to be an engineering student in this faculty,

264
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,240
the next time we meet,

265
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,960
I hope you show me your earnest commitment in completing this task

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,440
Lastly,

267
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,840
I want to assign you another task.

268
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,080
I want you to appoint someone as a student president for your year class.

269
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
And come to meet me tomorrow…

270
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
before 5 p.m.

271
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,040
Before 5 p.m.!

272
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,360
Is he mad?

273
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,280
We don’t even know everyone in this faculty yet.

274
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,920
I hope, for this matter,

275
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,840
you won’t keep me waiting and waste my time again.

276
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,720
I would like to end our gathering for today.

277
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,280
You all can go now.

278
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
“Kongpob”

279
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,080
Hey, Kongpob

280
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,360
Are you P’Ple?

281
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,560
Yes.

282
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,840
Here are some lecture notes and textbooks.

283
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,640
Just choose the ones that you think are useful.

284
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,040
And for the rest,

285
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,040
you can keep them and give to the future 0062 junior.

286
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,280
Check them out.

287
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,560
Thank you so much.

288
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,800
You’re welcome.

289
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,680
Consider it as my redemption for just coming to meet you, my junior mentor.

290
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,680
I think I have to go to my class now

291
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,160
Let’s catch up again soon.

292
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,920
All right.

293
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,320
Listen!

294
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,520
The seniors want us to appoint a student president by 3 p.m.

295
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,040
What the hell?

296
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,680
Wasn’t it supposed to be 5 p.m.?

297
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,040
Let’s start.

298
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,800
Who among us wants to take this role of the student president?

299
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,520
The person who is fit to be the student president for our class

300
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,240
must be someone who can stand up against those seniors

301
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,600
That’s Kongpob!

302
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,640
Yes. Yes

303
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,240
Hey, Kong.

304
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,440
What do you think?

305
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,800
No.

306
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,360
I don’t think I fit for this role.

307
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
You do. Kong.

308
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,080
If it’s not you, I don’t see anyone else who should do this.

309
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,760
You are the only one who can fight back those seniors

310
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,360
I’m with Oak for this one.

311
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,320
If it’s not you, no one else here fits for this role.

312
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,800
Kongpob, my dear.

313
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,240
Are you ready?

314
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,000
Hi, kids.

315
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
Are you in the middle of a meeting?

316
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,320
I’m sorry.

317
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,800
Kongpob, are you ready?

318
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,640
Let’s go to the shooting room with me

319
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,040
We better hurry or the room is closed

320
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,520
Sorry, guys.

321
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,600
But I’ve got to split

322
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,160
Where are you going?

323
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Well, I have a photoshoot for the faculty’s star contest.

324
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
I’m really sorry.

325
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,640
Just choose another fellow.

326
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
He’s too handsome for this.

327
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,800
Yeah, your buffer has run away.

328
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,000
What do we do now?

329
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,920
Forget about him.

330
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,600
Let’s see who else here can stand up against the seniors.

331
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,840
Maprang.

332
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,880
Wad?

333
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,480
where is he?

334
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,600
The senior is coming this way.

335
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,400
or else...we should find someone who can help us get through this first

336
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,760
It's you, Hew.

337
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,360
When p'Knot checked your signature book, you are the only one who survived.

338
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,880
I'm in the same dormitory with the senior.

339
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,000
So I meet with a lot of seniors.

340
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,760
But until I get all the signatures,

341
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,240
they used me like a slave.

342
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,200
and...

343
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,440
How many signatures you have got?

344
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,360
about 500 I guess.

345
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,360
500.

346
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,480
Then you it is.

347
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,320
This means that you are the closest one.

348
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,960
Please.

349
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,600
for everyone.

350
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,880
They are almost here!

351
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Do I have a chance to reject this?

352
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,200
reject what?

353
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,320
Ok. I can do it.

354
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,360
Awesome.

355
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,440
1 2 3

356
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,320
Okay.

357
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Tilt your face to the left.

358
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,640
Okay, great.

359
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,520
Hello. Sawasdee ka

360
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,640
I have brought your male counterpart.

361
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,920
Hurry up.

362
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,200
Stop here.

363
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,080
Greet your senior graciously first.

364
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,840
His name is P’Poj. He’s your photographer.

365
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,600
And this lady.

366
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,840
Do you know her?

367
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,360
Praepailin, your fellow first-year friend.

368
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,080
But she’s this year university’s star to be.

369
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,520
Hey, Kongpob.

370
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,240
How’s it going? The student president searching.

371
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,120
Oh, I had to come here so I didn’t know.

372
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,680
How long have you been here?

373
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,920
A while actually.

374
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,080
Okay, kids.

375
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,920
If you want to finish this sooner,

376
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,440
why don’t we go back to the shooting?

377
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,240
Let me have a 1:1 discussion with Kongpob.

378
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,080
You know what I mean, right?

379
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,920
Okay, sis.

380
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,760
I don’t want to get in between you and him.

381
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,080
Fantastic!

382
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,600
Let’s continue. 1..2..3

383
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,360
Take a seat, dear.

384
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,080
Here you are.

385
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,240
Fill in this application form.

386
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,120
Hold on a sec.

387
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,440
By the way, P’Minnie

388
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,400
Yes, dear?

389
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,320
I haven’t had your signature on my book yet

390
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,040
No biggie, Kongpob.

391
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,360
Come on, let me sign it now

392
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,360
You should have just asked me to sign from the first time we meet.

393
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,360
Here it is.

394
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,920
P’Minnie…

395
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,680
Yes?

396
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,040
I would like to ask you something

397
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,840
What is it?

398
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,160
I want to know…

399
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,960
about…?

400
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,960
Where’s P’Arthit?

401
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,400
Arthit?

402
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,160
Well, he doesn’t go anywhere.

403
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,720
He’s still where he is.

404
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,760
But he didn’t come to the gathering today.

405
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,200
He didn’t?

406
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,400
Well…

407
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,560
I can’t tell you

408
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,200
They asked me not to say this.

409
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,240
It’s okay if you can’t say it.

410
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,040
Okay. Okay.

411
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,640
I can tell because it’s you.

412
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,480
But you must not tell this to anyone else.

413
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,880
Understand?

414
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Of course not. I swear

415
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,480
Here’s the thing.

416
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Right now, Arthit has been dismissed from the hazer team.

417
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,320
It happened because of that incident,

418
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,640
when you and your friend were joining the gathering activities

419
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,360
and your friend had the sudden hyperventilation and fainted.

420
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,600
The teachers heard about it.

421
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,040
So they were called in by the teachers.

422
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,880
After that, the third years don’t want to take any hard approaches on you people.

423
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,440
That’s what happened to him.

424
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,200
But Kongpob,

425
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,440
don’t tell this to anyone ever.

426
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,800
Or I’ll be in trouble

427
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,680
Okay.

428
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,600
What’s up, M?

429
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,160
I don’t feel like going.

430
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,440
Just play the game with Oak.

431
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,960
Okay.

432
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,440
Please take this seat first, dear.

433
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,240
All tables are full. We have many customers today.

434
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,920
Excuse me.

435
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,480
Can I join the table?

436
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,560
Go ahead.

437
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,880
Thank you, P’Arthit.

438
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,400
Hey,

439
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,760
0062, Kongpob.

440
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,520
How come you are here?

441
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,160
I’m taking this seat then.

442
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,960
Hold on.

443
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,600
Who said you could sit here?

444
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
What?

445
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,360
You said go ahead earlier

446
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,760
And another thing is.

447
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,640
All table are fully booked.

448
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,840
What would you like to have?

449
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,320
Can I have a minced pork omelet with rice?

450
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,200
Please wait a moment for your food.

451
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,400
A minced pork omelet with rice?

452
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,280
Your food choice is so damn baby.

453
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,320
I don’t like spicy food.

454
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
What?

455
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,480
You are a grown-up man now,

456
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,000
how can you not eat spicy food?

457
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,240
What a sissy!

458
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,200
Here’s your drink, Arthit.

459
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,800
Hey, sis.

460
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,000
You probably deliver this to the wrong customer.

461
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,800
No, I don’t.

462
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,960
This is what you always have, I remember.

463
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,920
And this is yours.

464
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,720
Yes, thank you

465
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,320
It’s interesting to know that a hazer like you likes to drink pinky milk.

466
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,640
You son of a…

467
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,720
Here’s your omelet.

468
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,520
And your chicken basil with a sunny side up egg.

469
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,160
Hold on.

470
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,280
As I’m your senior.

471
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,360
Let me give you another lesson.

472
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,800
You do know how hard it is to get a grain of rice, don’t you?

473
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,240
I know.

474
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,280
So…

475
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,440
I would like you to show your appreciation to rice…to me.

476
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,160
You know how to pray before eating, right?

477
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,560
Yes, I know.

478
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Good.

479
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,800
Then, show me. Say it out loud.

480
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,560
Make it as loud as the level of your gratitude toward rice.

481
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,520
Cat got your tongue?

482
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,640
Hurry and do it.

483
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,880
“Every dish of your rice.

484
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,480
Every dish of your food.

485
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,520
Do not waste it.

486
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,360
Every bit of it is valuable.

487
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,920
There are many people…

488
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,760
who have nothing to eat.

489
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,960
and there are many innocent kids…

490
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,840
who still go hungry.”

491
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,040
Hold on.

492
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,960
Okay, now this belongs to you.

493
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Why do you give your food to me?

494
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,360
I know now that you have gratitude for food.

495
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,600
So I want you to make the most of it.

496
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,280
This dish is filled with basil, chicken and also a sunny side

497
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,760
You can have full nutrition in one dish.

498
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,680
Why?

499
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,520
Are you rejecting my kindness?

500
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,280
Fine. Thank you.

501
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,960
How is it?

502
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Is it good?

503
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,760
It’s good.

504
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,440
But personally, I think the food here is a bit bland.

505
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,480
Let me add spice it up for you.

506
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,320
Here’s how I do it.

507
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,640
When I’m here, I add this.

508
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,280
The more the better.

509
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,920
I guarantee this is the best you’ve ever had

510
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,240
Go ahead.

511
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,200
Why are your lips shaking?

512
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,440
Dig in.

513
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,760
Hello?

514
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,080
What?

515
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,040
Now?

516
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
All right. I’ll be there right away.

517
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,920
Okay.

518
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,240
I’ve got to go.

519
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,120
And you must clear this plate.

520
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,640
Don’t waste any food.

521
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,000
Understood?

522
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,240
Hold on, P’Arthit?

523
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,440
What?

524
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Please take good care of yourself.

525
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,000
Can I have the bill, please?

526
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,120
Your bill has already been taken care of by that man.

527
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Oh, okay.

528
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,000
How much is my coffee?

529
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,360
It’s all right.

530
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,320
Arthit has already paid for you.

531
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
Can I have another pinky milk then?

532
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,160
Thank you.
