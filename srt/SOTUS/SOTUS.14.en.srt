1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,000
The hazing activities depicted in this series,
“SOTUS the Series”
have been exaggerated for entertainment purposes.

2
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
Hey kids,

3
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
you can sit here, we’re done.

4
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Really? Thank you so much

5
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
Dude, finish your dish already. You too.

6
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,200
All three of you.

7
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,600
We must take care of these juniors

8
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
We’re done. Let’s move.

9
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,280
Hold on.

10
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,560
What does it have to do with me?

11
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,400
Are you setting a sprat to catch a mackerel?

12
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
Stop it, you asshole Bright.

13
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,960
I know what you are thinking.

14
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,000
At the end of this month, there’s a Thank You Party

15
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,000
you please them so that they buy you gifts.

16
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,560
Damn you all, why do you have to spoil my plan?

17
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,280
Damn it.

18
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,920
Nong M.

19
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,880
Yes, P’Bright

20
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,160
2 boxes of chocolate.

21
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
If you don’t know where to get them, call me.

22
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Okay?

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,560
Okay.

24
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,000
Get up. Get up!

25
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,880
Let’s go.

26
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,560
He indeed sets a sprat to catch a mackerel.

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,680
Uh…Kongpob.

28
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,120
Are you free this Saturday?

29
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
I am

30
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Well…

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,560
Well, I have something I want to buy.

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
And…

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,960
If you don’t have any plan,

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
do you mind going with me?

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,440
Absolutely.

36
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,840
Well then,

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,800
See you on Saturday at 11 p.m.

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,360
Wait a minute.

39
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Can I take this…

40
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,040
as you are asking me out on a date?

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
No, it’s not!

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,440
Did you just annoy P’Arthit again?

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
It’s good that the hazing event is over.

44
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,120
Or else you’ll be in very much trouble.

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,160
No, I didn’t do anything.

46
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,520
Come on. You gotta be kidding me.

47
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,560
I got here in a rush

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,400
How come you are here before me?

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
I’ve just got here too

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,880
So, what do you want to buy?

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,640
Follow me.

52
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, yes.

53
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,800
P’Tum called and told me that P’Fon was 2 months pregnant.

54
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,320
Really?

55
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,560
Um. So I want to buy them a gift.

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
How about a card?

57
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,360
What? No more.

58
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Last time I got him a card. And you know what?

59
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
He couldn’t stop making fun of me.

60
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,920
I think…

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
we can get them a toy…

62
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,280
or baby clothes

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,600
Wait a minute.

64
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,040
You don’t even know whether it’s a boy or a girl.

65
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,480
Another thing is…

66
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,560
P’Fon is just 2 months pregnant.

67
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,800
Isn’t it too early to get them that stuff?

68
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,680
Well…

69
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,680
It’s meant to be a surprising gift in advance.

70
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,960
And we don’t have to buy something that is gender-specific

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,320
We can buy something that is gender-neutral.

72
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,360
Something that is good for either boys or girls.

73
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,880
Do you know what I mean?

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
What do you think?

75
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
You have a niece, right?

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,360
Just give me advice.

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,720
Since my niece is a girl.

78
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,840
So she likes something adorable like plush toys.

79
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,800
But it’s another story for a boy.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,760
I used to think about this.

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,320
If I have a child,

82
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
I want a boy.

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,320
What do you think, P’Arthit?

84
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,200
P’Arthit krup

85
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,080
What did you say?

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
I said how about supplementary diet.

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,440
This is the time that nutrients are important to pregnant women

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
so that their babies get strong.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
Um. Good idea.

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,960
For supplementary diet,

91
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,280
how about we get them near our dorm?

92
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,640
So we don’t have to carry it around

93
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,120
Um. Let’s do that

94
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
Since we have time left,

95
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,400
would you like to catch a movie together?

96
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,520
there should be a movie that is yet to start.

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
Kongpob,

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,320
the thread I tied for you

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
you can take it off already.

100
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,360
Look, it became dirty.

101
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
It was you who tied this for me.

102
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,200
I want to have it on.

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,520
Is there any movie you want to watch particularly?

104
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,720
No. I let you pick.

105
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,560
Please wait here for a sec

106
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,400
Hold on, Kongpob.

107
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,360
Take my money.

108
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,640
It’s all right. It’s on me.

109
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,880
What? No.

110
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,720
You don’t need to.

111
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Please let me pay.

112
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,480
We’re on a date after all.

113
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,520
Hey, Kongpob.

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,360
Oh, P’Arthit. Sawasdee ka.

115
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,440
Hey, Prae.

116
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,080
Are you here for a movie?

117
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
Yes. I came to watch a movie with my friend.

118
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Are you here to watch a movie too?

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
Um, I’m going to watch this.

120
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,720
Really? Me too.

121
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,440
I have been wanting to watch this since the first week it hit the screen.

122
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,800
I really like the female lead.

123
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,960
Her acting is so good.

124
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,160
Yes.

125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,680
Especially the emotion scenes.

126
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,320
I think her eyes are powerful.

127
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,880
She can convey her emotions strongly with just her eyes.

128
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
I know right.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,640
And the director of this film is superb too.

130
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,600
I’m sure it’s going to be great.

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,560
What? You follow this director’s works too?

132
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
I have been following his works for a very long time

133
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,880
For every movie he directed, I must watch it in the cinema

134
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,360
and keep it when it came out in DVDs.

135
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,880
Really?

136
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,120
I think I probably watched all the movies he directed.

137
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,920
But there could be some movies I missed.

138
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,720
Can I borrow your DVDs later?

139
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
Sure, no problem at all.

140
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
And are you here to watch the movie alone?

141
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Or you are here with P’Arthit?

142
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,080
No. No.

143
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,400
I’m here on my own.

144
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,240
We just run into each other.

145
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,400
Ah, I see.

146
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
It’s a small world, isn’t it?

147
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
Well, I have to excuse myself.

148
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,560
My friend is waiting for me

149
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
All right then, Kong. See you.

150
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,880
P’Arthit, sawasdee ka.

151
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
Bye bye.

152
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
How was the movie?

153
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,840
Did you enjoy it?

154
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
Um, not bad.

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
Are you hungry yet?

156
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,080
A little bit.

157
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,760
Let’s go to that noodle place again.

158
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,480
Are you all right, P’Arthit?

159
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,280
Do you feel unwell?

160
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,840
No, I’m fine.

161
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,760
Or the movie I picked isn’t good?

162
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,280
It’s good.

163
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,400
Kongpob.

164
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,160
Yes?

165
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you find…

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,760
Praepailin cute?

167
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,080
Yes, she is.

168
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,320
She’s crowned as the Star of the university, right?

169
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,880
That’s right.

170
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
She is this cute. I wonder if she has a boyfriend yet.

171
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,360
I heard that she hasn’t had anyone yet.

172
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,560
Actually, I have her phone number.

173
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,040
I got it when she asked me to sign her signature book.

174
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,720
Really?

175
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,440
How nice.

176
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Is there any place here you want to go see?

177
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,600
No, I don’t.

178
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Well, let’s go back then.

179
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,520
Are you okay, P’Arthit.

180
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,840
I’m okay.

181
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,360
You don’t need to worry.

182
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,960
Hey. Hey!

183
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,520
You are eating my food.

184
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,880
Pay me. Pay me now.

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,720
I didn’t buy it for you guys.

186
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,920
Pay me now.

187
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,160
Come on.

188
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,720
Have some sympathy, M.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The Thank You Party is next month

190
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
I don’t have money to buy my senior a gift.

191
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,960
It’s you who has to have sympathy for me.

192
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,720
Didn’t you remember what P’Bright had asked from me?

193
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,040
2 big boxes of chocolate

194
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
Those could make me poor, you know?

195
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,280
But I think it’s harder for Kong.

196
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
You have to buy stuff for the senior with Co-student ID too, right

197
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Um.

198
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,560
Hey, Kong.

199
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,720
Hey, Prae.

200
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,280
Is it okay to take the table after you’re done here?

201
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
Oh, we are about to go anyway, Prae.

202
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,240
Thank you

203
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,360
But my friends are still waiting for her food.

204
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,720
Can you wait for them for a minute?

205
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,200
The food portion from this shop is small

206
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,320
M, you dork.

207
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,320
Are you done eating?

208
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,040
Yes.

209
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,680
Then, hurry up and move.

210
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Nong Prae wants to take the seat.

211
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,160
And Nong Prae, have you eaten yet?

212
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,280
If no, do tell me.

213
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,000
I go buy food for you.

214
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
Okay?

215
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,360
Well, I…

216
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,600
M, don’t give me that look.

217
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,040
2 boxes of chocolate.

218
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,120
How about I reduce to 1?

219
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,080
Okay?

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,240
Nong Prae. Eat with me.

221
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,800
Prae is reserving the table for her friends to join

222
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,720
If you want to sit here,

223
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,120
I’m afraid there’s not enough room for you all.

224
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,320
Oh.

225
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,400
You are being possessive of her too.

226
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,640
Is there anything going on between you two?

227
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,960
You’re not okay if I want to sit with her?

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,480
Okay, it’s fine.

229
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,520
Prae, go ahead.

230
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,440
We can find another table.

231
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
Are you dating her?

232
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,680
P’Arthit krup.

233
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,680
Hands off!

234
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
What are you looking at?

235
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,520
You drop the pen.

236
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,840
I just pick it up for you.

237
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Thanks.

238
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,560
What is wrong with P’Arthit?

239
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,160
Why did he have to throw a fit at you like that?

240
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah,

241
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,400
his reaction scared the hell out of me.

242
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,000
Is there a thing that you are not scared of?

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,080
YOU!

244
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,800
Calm down.

245
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,680
Hey, Arthit.

246
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,680
Cat got your tongue?

247
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Or you have a fight with your girlfriend.

248
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,600
What? I don’t have a girlfriend yet

249
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,200
It’s really nothing, pal.

250
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,720
I just have a headache.

251
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,640
Has your headache gone?

252
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,400
Here. I got this painkiller for you.

253
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,600
Where’s Prem?

254
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,600
He’s working on the report inside the house.

255
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,040
Hey, Arthit.

256
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,600
If anything is bugging you mind, you can share it with me.

257
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,680
If I tell you, promise me that you won’t laugh at me.

258
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,720
Well, I have tried not to think too much.

259
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,880
But there are a lot of boundaries in male and male relationships.

260
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,920
Be it our families or our society.

261
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,320
What if we want to have kids?

262
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,600
In the end,

263
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,000
the relationship between me and him

264
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
has to come to an end after all.

265
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,600
And if it has to come to that…

266
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,200
why don’t I let him be with someone who is better than me?

267
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,760
Look at Praepailin, for instance.

268
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
When they are together,

269
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,600
they look perfect for each other much more than me. Seriously.

270
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Do you regret to be with him?

271
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,000
No, I’m afraid that he will regret to be with me.

272
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,080
Have you asked him that yet?

273
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,560
So you haven’t even asked him yet.

274
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,240
Are you a mind reader?

275
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,840
How come you know what he thinks?

276
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,000
How could you know ahead of what he thinks?

277
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,520
It’s not that.

278
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,040
Well, I just worry about his future.

279
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,600
You choose to worry about the future that you don’t see…

280
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,720
over the person who is right in front of you now?

281
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,360
And another thing is…

282
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,760
you get annoyed

283
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,200
when you see him with someone else.

284
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
It’s not because you are envious of them

285
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
Technically speaking,

286
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
it means that you are getting jealous.

287
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,480
Hey, Knot.

288
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,080
I’m not getting jealous!

289
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Fine. Whatever.

290
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,760
But if anything is bugging your mind,

291
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,560
you should tell him directly.

292
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,440
P’Ple, sawasdee krup.

293
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,040
Well, where’s P’Arthit?

294
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,040
P’Arthit?

295
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,600
He called and said that he was working on an assignment out of town

296
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,440
So he couldn’t make it here.

297
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,360
Here he is.

298
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,480
What a surprise.

299
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,280
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t be here tonight?

300
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,800
Why are you here?

301
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,640
We thought we couldn’t make it. It was already late when we finished.

302
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,600
But Arthit kept rushing me so I drove super fast.

303
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I see. Do you want to get your junior mentor’s gift that bad, Arthit?

304
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,720
Shut up, you queerbag.

305
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,520
I come here to give my junior mentors and co-junior mentors these gifts.

306
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,360
Here you are.

307
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,560
He bought them a cotton candy.

308
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,200
Cotton candy, my ass.

309
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,080
Here you are.

310
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,640
Thank you.

311
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,560
Here. Take it.

312
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,080
What? You want some?

313
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,000
Here you are.

314
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Wow. Thanks a lot.

315
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
What a big bag.

316
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,160
All right. I’ll be back.

317
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,480
Hold on, P’Arthit.

318
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,440
Well…

319
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,800
I have something for you.

320
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,880
P’Arthit krup. I once told you…

321
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
…that I wanted you to write me a love letter.

322
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,400
But today, let me be the first to write it to you.

323
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,120
I hope you don’t mind me doing this at will

324
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,360
Honestly…

325
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,240
I have so many things to tell you.

326
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,280
But I’m afraid that I may not be able to put them all in this letter.

327
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
And I don’t really know what words I should use to express my feelings.

328
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
As there are no words that could reflect the grateful feelings in my heart

329
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,040
I would like to thank you for your kindness.

330
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,000
You have been taking care of me and do a lot of things for me.

331
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,240
I want to thank you for your smiles and your laughs

332
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,480
which could turn my ordinary days to the ones that are so special.

333
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,120
And I want to thank you

334
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,320
for allowing me to love you.

335
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,040
Every time we are close to each other,

336
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
do you know how happy I am?

337
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,520
I may be stupid.

338
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,720
I may like to tease you.

339
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,560
I may be so disobedient and self-absorbed…

340
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,080
that make you tired of me

341
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,360
So, I won’t ask you to love me like I do.

342
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,280
No matter what happens or changes.

343
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,480
To me,

344
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,240
the only thing that matters to me

345
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,760
…is you, P’Arthit.

346
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,840
You are my only sun.

347
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,680
And I promise that you will always be that to me...

348
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,320
Thanks.

349
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,640
And I have something for you too.

350
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,560
But…

351
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,200
give me your hand first.

352
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,400
No, another one.

353
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,000
Here, tie for me too.

354
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,000
Ahem.

355
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,480
You two wear the same thing.

356
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,640
Uh…may I ask if you two are dating?

357
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,320
We…

358
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,160
So what?

359
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,120
Why?

360
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes, we are dating.

361
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,360
Kongpob…

362
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,720
do you remember that I still have a favor to ask from you?

363
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,440
Yes, I do remember.

364
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,200
What do you want to ask from me?

365
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,600
To be honest, I don’t know what will happen to us in the future.

366
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,840
But I want to ask you to know that…

367
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,200
at this very moment…

368
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,840
at this very minute…

369
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,640
you are the person I feel special with the most.

370
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,200
And…

371
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
you are the only person…

372
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
…that I love.

373
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,680
I know.

374
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,120
I also want you to know

375
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,240
At this very moment

376
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,240
you are the only person that I love.

377
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,880
By the way, P’Arthit.

378
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,520
I have something to ask you.

379
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
What is it about?

380
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,320
Do you like Prae?

381
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,600
What? Prae?

382
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,520
No, I don’t like her.

383
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,200
It’s you. You like Praepailin, don’t you?

384
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,640
How could I like her?

385
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,920
…when I know that she likes women.

386
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,760
Huh?

387
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,800
Praepailin, really?

388
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,360
Yes.

389
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,080
She told me when we went to the beach.

390
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,400
How come you never told me about it?

391
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,280
Well, I don’t think…

392
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,600
it is something that matters to us.

393
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,800
And another thing is…

394
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
you never asked me.

395
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,920
Why?

396
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,920
Or you get jealous?

397
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,160
No, I don’t!

398
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,840
Well, are you free this Saturday?

399
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,800
This Saturday?

400
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,320
Yes, I’m free

401
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
Do you want to buy something again?

402
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,200
No.

403
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,160
I want to ask you out on a date.

404
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,320
Chicken basil on rice with runny-yolk sunny side up egg

405
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,200
and pink milk drink are here.

406
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,600
I have kept you waiting this long.

407
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,720
You must be very hungry now.

408
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,360
I’m sorry. There were many people in the queue.

409
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,960
It’s okay. Thank you so much.

410
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,960
Hey, listen.

411
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,400
You look really funny in high school uniform.

412
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,840
Kongpob, may I ask you this?

413
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,680
If you didn’t want to study in this faculty in the first place,

414
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,920
no one could do anything about it, right?

415
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,480
Why didn’t you study something else?

416
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,000
I think you are qualified to any field of study.

417
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,800
Do you really not remember?

418
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
What to remember?

419
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,600
Do you really not remember me?

420
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,000
I can go home on my own, mom.

421
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,400
It’s busy there at the factory, isn’t it?

422
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,280
All right. I’ll call you when I’m done.

423
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,720
Okay.

424
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,960
Hey, Kong.

425
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,760
Hey, M. What’s up?

426
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,600
Are you enrolling here too?

427
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,240
But Tae said you were going to choose Economics.

428
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,720
Well, I have to help my family business.

429
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,480
So I think Engineering should be more helpful.

430
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,400
But you must think carefully about this.

431
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,160
Learning something that you don’t like for 4 years is pretty damn long.

432
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,080
Why don’t you go talk about it with your mother again?

433
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,320
It’s your future after all.

434
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,840
Those who are here for the interview, please come up here.

435
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,680
They are calling us.

436
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,840
You can go first.

437
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,520
I’m going to the restroom

438
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,560
Hurry up then.

439
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,440
Hey, Kong.

440
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,080
What took you so long?

441
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,400
Your number is about to get called.

442
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,840
I thought you run away and got home.

443
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,320
I won’t run away.

444
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,440
I have made my decision to study Engineering here.

445
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,520
Why?

446
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,680
I think I will like it here someday.

447
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,800
That’s good for you.

448
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,400
I remember you like sunny side up egg with runny yolk.

449
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,720
How come you never told me that?

450
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,000
Well, you never asked.

451
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,560
And another thing is, you are the one who told me to pick this faculty.

452
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,360
Probably.

453
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,040
I don’t remember at all that we have met before.

454
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,440
It’s called destiny
