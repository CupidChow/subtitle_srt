1
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,480
2 years ago.

2
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680
From that formula, you get this answer.

3
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,480
We have 2 bloody subjects on the very first day

4
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
Are we going to make it here?

5
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,520
I’m totally lost, Arthit.

6
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,920
Do you understand what he taught?

7
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah, I do.

8
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,680
He’s actually going over what we learned in high school.

9
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
You don’t understand?

10
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,320
No.

11
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
I can teach you later if you want.

12
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,960
Good, help me.

13
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Uh...you guys...krup.

14
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,480
Shall we go eat something together after class?

15
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,760
I reckon we can only leave here when it’s already late at night

16
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,040
But today’s class is about to end, isn’t it...krup?

17
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,200
What?

18
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,480
You never heard about the freshmen gathering before?

19
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,120
At the end of the last class,

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
seniors will be waiting for us outside the room.

21
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,360
Then, they take us to the gathering hall…

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
where they will discipline us all.

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,560
We can’t do anything but stay in that hall in agony

24
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,640
Until they are satisfied.

25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,360
Is it that extreme?

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,320
Yeah.

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,320
Come on, Bright.

28
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,280
I think you are exaggerating.

29
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,720
Whatever.

30
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,960
But I’m also curious about it.

31
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,120
The gathering activity of the so-called SOTUS system.

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,040
What’s it like? Aren’t you curious too?

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
And what do they do it for?

34
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Um...you’ll find out in no time.

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,200
That’s a wrap for today.

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,120
Don’t forget to go over the lesson I taught you today.

37
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,920
Oh, and don’t leave the room just yet.

38
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,600
Your seniors have something to talk to you

39
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,800
You suck!

40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,040
Your class year sucks!

41
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
This man, his name is P’Tum.

42
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,920
Nickname,

43
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,920
Tum the badass. He’s really harsh.

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,080
I heard that he’s the head of this year hazing crew.

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,040
And he’s really an annoying person.

46
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,960
He’s good at getting on people’s nerves

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,240
I have never known any class year...

48
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,400
as hopeless as you guys.

49
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,160
Yesterday,

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
my friend told me...

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,120
a freshman walked pass him

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
and didn’t ‘Wai’ him.

53
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,240
You don’t give a damn about us, your seniors, right?!

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
What did you do?

55
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,720
You, stand up!

56
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,000
I’m talking to you.

57
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,760
What’s your name?

58
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,120
My name is Arthit, student ID 0206.

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,640
What did you just do?

60
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,800
Uh...I got bitten by a mosquito.

61
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,560
It’s my campus’ mosquito,

62
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,240
you have no right to touch it.

63
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,680
Arthit, 0206.

64
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,880
I was in the middle of speaking

65
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,960
And your friends were paying attention to what I said.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,840
Don’t you know what the “manner” is?

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,520
If you don’t, let me teach it to you.

68
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,480
Go “Wai” the big tree in front of the building

69
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,000
for 3 hours.

70
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,520
This way could help you learn the meaning of “manner.”

71
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,040
Go!

72
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,080
It’s the stupid punishment like this!

73
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,080
I’m not surprised that juniors didn’t show respect to you.

74
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,280
What did you just say?

75
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,320
Didn’t you ask us earlier?

76
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,960
Why didn’t we ‘Wai’ you?

77
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,760
We are here to study not to be your slaves

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
so that you can order us around.

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,280
The so called SOTUS system

80
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,000
is just an excuse for those with power craze.

81
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,600
Am I right?

82
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,400
Do you know the meaning of “respect”?

83
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,680
Do you even have it at all?

84
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,520
I’m your senior and you are my junior

85
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,880
You said you were here to study.

86
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,840
Do you want to do that only?

87
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,920
You refuse to have friends.

88
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,680
You refuse to socialize.

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,080
Do you want to run a one-man show?

90
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,480
Do you really think you can pull that out?

91
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,760
That’s none of your business.

92
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,200
It has nothing to do with you.

93
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,400
It has!

94
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,720
Every place has its own set of rules.

95
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,640
If you cannot accept the rules. Then, get out.

96
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,000
But the freshmen this year, they seem to lack of punctuality

97
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,960
Fine, I’m so going.

98
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
Go!

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
What a pussy!

100
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Hey!

101
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
Why stop walking all of sudden?

102
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,440
You want to run a one-man show, right?

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,920
Just go!

104
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,880
Don’t tell me that you want to pussy out of this now.

105
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,600
Hey, Knot.

106
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,520
Calm down, man.

107
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,760
Look what he did to you.

108
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,600
How could I calm down?

109
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,920
I’m cool with it

110
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,920
You told me you wanted to study here, didn’t you?

111
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,600
If you want to be here, don’t look for trouble.

112
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Stay here and study with us till the end.

113
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you know what I mean?

114
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
Fine. I’m not going.

115
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,560
You don’t need to stop him.

116
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,440
I told you, right?

117
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
If any of you find it hard to accept the rules here,

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
feel free to leave

119
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,320
If I do what you told me to,

120
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,320
I can stay here, right?

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,680
Yes.

122
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,600
All right, then.

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,960
Where are you going?

124
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,320
I’m going to ‘wai’ the big tree like you told me to.

125
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,080
All right, you can go.

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,440
And for the rest of you,

127
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
You will get punished

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,800
for breaking the rules.

129
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
The first year!

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,840
Sit and stand 100 times.

131
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Go!

132
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,360
1..2..3...4...5

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,240
Have you gone mad?

134
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,480
What if today activity got out of hand,

135
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,400
what would happen to us?

136
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,040
Do you even realize…

137
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,120
that the very persons who get the consequences

138
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
are us, the seniors?

139
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Not those juniors.

140
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,480
If something like that happens again,

141
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,760
I’ll report it to the dean.

142
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,120
Come on, Fon.

143
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
You are actually pretty and your body is not bad.

144
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,080
But you nag like an old lady.

145
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
No man would want to make you his wife.

146
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
Tum!

147
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,640
You talk rubbish like this

148
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,680
no wonder those juniors don’t want to respect you.

149
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,560
Are you really proud...

150
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,520
to get a ‘wai’ from those juniors?

151
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,240
They do that only to avoid the punishment.

152
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,880
Fon,

153
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,640
‘Wai’ is a nice gesture.

154
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,160
I want the juniors to learn to be modest.

155
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,600
Wherever they go,

156
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,600
We know right away that they are our fellow juniors.

157
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,480
And we can’t help taking them under our umbrella.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,520
If one day they run into troubles,

159
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,120
we can help them.

160
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,520
This is to form a good bond between seniors and juniors.

161
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,120
That’s why it’s not right for the junior to outclass us

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,600
and take us for grant

163
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,040
And ‘Wai’ is really simple, you know?

164
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,520
It’s really easy to do.

165
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,640
But the benefits of it are tremendous.

166
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,160
So, why do you have to defy us on this?

167
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,400
But you didn’t have to go that extent.

168
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,960
You could have just told them nicely.

169
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,880
All right. I’m done explaining myself.

170
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,200
Let’s say that it won’t happen again.

171
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,520
Hey!

172
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,960
What are you doing here?

173
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,320
Ah, bro...

174
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
No, I mean P’Tum. Sawasdee krup.

175
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,240
What are you doing here?

176
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,800
Well, it was you who told me to be here...

177
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
so I do what you told me to.

178
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,680
Don’t tell me...

179
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,680
that you have actually been ‘wai’ this tree for 3 hours?

180
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,720
Don’t you get leg pain at all?

181
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,120
I do get leg pain

182
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,440
But I’m following your order

183
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,400
even it’s not what I want to do.

184
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Also…

185
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,000
I already gave you my word that I would do it

186
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,400
I must do it

187
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,120
What’s your name?

188
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,080
My name is Arthit.

189
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,480
Do you have a nickname?

190
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,640
It’s Ai-oon krup.

191
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,120
You have quite a nickname.

192
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,600
It’s very cutesy.

193
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,960
Yeah, I guess.

194
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,360
Okay, you can go home and get some rest.

195
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
You have class tomorrow, right?

196
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,080
And one more thing.

197
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,520
You can call me ‘bro.’

198
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,920
I’m fine with it.

199
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,080
All right.

200
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,360
Thank you, bro.

201
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
Sawasdee krup.

202
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,920
I’m sure this junior who has the same student ID with me, 0206...

203
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,640
is going to be another head hazer.

204
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
You will make a great head hazer, Ai-oon.

205
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,360
Why are you here mumbling to yourself?

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,160
You scared the hell out of me.

207
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,600
Let’s go home.

208
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,480
Actually, you were really something too.

209
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,560
Well, P’Tum did get on my nerves first.

210
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,440
Back then, P’Tum seemed to be harsher than you for my class year.

211
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,640
I know, right?

212
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,080
It became much softer when I disciplined you.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And...if you want to order me to do something now.

214
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,280
What would it be?

215
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,840
I don’t know.

216
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,040
How can I give you punishments without a good reason?

217
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,880
How about...

218
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,560
order me to shout “I like you” 3 times at the top of my lungs?

219
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,080
What do you think?

220
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,440
Are you nuts? That’s ridiculous.

221
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,320
But you used to order me once.

222
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,720
Listen, Kongpob.

223
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,640
Do you really want to be a hazer?

224
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,240
Yes, I do.

225
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,760
Why’s that?

226
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,880
If I’m not wrong, you don’t like SOTUS system, do you?

227
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,040
I like the essence that lies inside the SOTUS system.

228
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,680
But the approaches to convey that to the freshmen

229
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,640
must be changed over time.

230
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,240
I really believe that you make a good senior.

231
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,880
Just like you, right?

232
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,960
Of course!

233
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
This is the last one. I let you have it.

234
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
If I get the last piece...

235
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
it means...

236
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,640
my boyfriend is...

237
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,240
Just eat it.

238
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
You are talking too much.

239
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,800
I don’t want to attend this freshmen gathering.

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,080
I don’t like this.

241
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,800
I don’t know what the seniors will do to us.

242
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,480
I know. I couldn’t be bothered to.

243
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
Let’s get out of here.

244
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,600
Don’t go. Trust me.

245
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,200
You are going to miss out something really really great.

246
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,840
I heard that the head hazer this year is really handsome.

247
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Are you serious?

248
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,800
Then I must prepare myself to get scolded by him, then.

249
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,080
Sawasdee krup, the first year.

250
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,160
My name is Kongpob.

251
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,760
I have a duty to look after you all from this day on.

252
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,920
First of all...

253
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,960
I would like to congratulate you all

254
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,760
for being qualified to study here at this Faculty of Engineering

255
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,240
Be still!

256
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
What do you think you are doing?

257
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,360
I said “Be still!”

258
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,880
Listen, you all. You must show some respect to us.

259
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,840
And pay attention.

260
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,160
No one ever teaches you about manners?

261
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,080
The first years, please sit with your back straight.

262
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,240
Today,

263
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,800
I’m going to teach you to sing our faculty’s anthem.

264
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,360
♪Engineering is like a boat.

265
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,400

267
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,720
Not good!

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
But I won’t blame you.

269
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,080
Maybe, asking you to sing altogether is not a good idea.

270
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,680
Then, I have another option for you.

271
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,480
I will test you one by one.

272
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,160
I hope you can do well this time.

273
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,160
Start with you.

274
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,400
Go ahead.

275
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,160
My name is Nattawut, student ID 0088.

276
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,400
Please sing.

Too soft. The seniors in the back can’t even hear you.

00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,280
Try again.

282
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,760

Please sit down.

310

That’s a wrap for today’s gathering.

311
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,720
Hi. Sawasdee krup, professor.

312
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,720
Hi, Arthit.

313
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,400
Wow, you dress sharp and look good.

314
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,040
Where do you work, by the way?

315
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,320
I work for a main board manufacturer.

316
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,840
That’s good of you.

317
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,760
You get to work for a big company after you graduated.

318
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,960
Yes. And how are you doing?

319
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,240
How are freshmen this year?

320
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,240
I’m doing okay.

321
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,440
They are late for class.

322
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,160
I don’t want to be fuzzy about this small matter.

323
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,880
Since they have all grown up.

324
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,200
I probably ask the seniors to teach them some disciplines

325
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,680
Yes, that’s how kids are these days.

326
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,120
All right. You are going to the gathering hall, right?

327
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
Yes.

328
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,800
Can I ask you to tell the senior hazers

329
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
to teach some disciplines

330
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,760
and emphasize the importance of being punctual?

331
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,120
I will.

332
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,200
All right then.

333
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,920
Damn it. My paper is not done.

334
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,240
I don’t even have time to play games.

335
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,840
Why don’t those seniors offer to help us on our paper too?

336
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,960
How about this? Let’s skip the gathering tomorrow.

337
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Nah, I reckon that tomorrow’s gathering will be great.

338
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
Up to you.

339
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,240
Hey, Kong.

340
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,760
I’m going to the meeting room first.

341
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,880
Okay, I’ll be there in a min.

342
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,280
Hey, guys. Let’s go.

343
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,080
How are you doing?

344
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,240
Are you tired?

345
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,120
Why hadn’t you told me that you would be here?

346
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,120
So I could go meet you.

347
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,480
I’m here to get my transcript

348
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,880
I’m going home soon.

349
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,280
You have to join the meeting with the hazing crew, right?

350
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,160
Well then, you should go there.

351
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,520
I probably just go home.

352
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Do you really have to go home now?

353
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,120
Actually...

354
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
I’m not that hurry.

355
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I can stay here a little longer.

356
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,320
Just wait for me here.

357
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,040
Let me go tell those guys.

358
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,200
Hey, don’t do this.

359
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,400
Don’t skip the meeting.

360
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
You are the head hazer.

361
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,200
It’s true that I have a duty of the head hazer.

362
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,280
But I also have a duty...

363
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,040
...of your boyfriend.

364
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,520
Wait for me here just a sec.

365
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,320
Sorry.

366
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,560
I have kept you waiting for so long.

367
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,960
Are you hungry?

368
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,560
I’m not hungry.

369
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,360
What about you?

370
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,120
Have you eaten anything yet?

371
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,080
You look skinnier, you know?

372
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,240
Are you worried about me?

373
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,680
Don’t change the topic.

374
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,240
So what would you like to eat?

375
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,880
Minced pork omelet.

376
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,560
Mince pork omelet?

377
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,520
Hey, Kongpob.

378
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,760
Why did some juniors wear different clothes at the gathering?

379
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,160
Ah,

380
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,440
some groups of them are yet to get their T-shirts

381
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,920
There are a lot of juniors attending the activity this year

382
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,840
So? Have you experienced any problems?

383
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,760
No.

384
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,720
Most of them are well-behaved.

385
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,280
And almost everyone attend the gathering

386
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,800
The professor wants you to emphasize the freshmen the importance of being punctual.

387
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,680
Sure, I’ll let them know.

388
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,160
You’re lucky.

389
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,600
I thought there would be some rebellious freshmen like your class year.

390
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,680
Rebellious how?

391
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,640
like someone who claims to make the senior hazer his wife?

392
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,320
Kongpob!

393
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,280
How will you go home?

394
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,800
I’ll just call a taxi from here.

395
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,320
You look really sleepy.

396
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,360
Because of work.

397
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,680
Seriously, I kept you waiting too long, didn’t I?

398
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,280
Not really.

399
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,160
Take care, P’Arthit.

400
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
You too.

401
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,920
Take good care of yourself.

402
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,040
Have some rest if you are tired.

403
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,200
Just tell me right here that you miss me.

404
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
My tiredness will be gone.

405
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,840
Are you nuts?

406
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,440
How can I say that?

407
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
Take care then.

408
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,960
Hold on...

409
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,400
I miss you, Kong.

410
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,080
Hold on, P’Arthit.

411
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,840
Don’t go just yet.

412
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,680
I can’t stay.

413
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,480
I have to go to work early tomorrow.

414
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
I’ll give you a lift. You won’t be late for sure.

415
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,320
But tonight…

416
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,480
stay with me.

417
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,040
Are you going or not?

418
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,280
Please…

419
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,320
I’m not going. Sorry.

420
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,640
Okay.

421
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,160
If I’m late for work tomorrow,

422
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,040
I order you to do 100 pushups in front of all freshmen.

423
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,840
I will run 100 laps for you.

424
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,640
Let’s go home.

425
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,520
This diary of yours can make me smile everytime I read.

426
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,120
You have read it like 10 times already.

427
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,120
Aren’t you get bored of it?

428
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,920
I like what you wrote in here.

429
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,400
It’s like reading a novel.

430
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,760
And with all these old photos,

431
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,120
they make me think of my friends.

432
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,920
“Is this the best you can chant?”

433
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,120
“Louder!”

434
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,920
He shouted in a serious voice like a jail officer yells at his prisoner.

435
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,160
You don’t need to read out loud.

436
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,480
It’s embarrassing.

437
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
It’s lovely.

438
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,920
Thank you, P’Arthit.

439
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,000
Thank you for making my first year memorable.

440
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,240
Come on.

441
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,000
You must give yourself some credit too.

442
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,600
it was all up to you whether you could make the most of your first year or not.

443
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,680
For all the good things I got,

444
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,240
I would like to pass them on to my juniors.

445
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,120
Like you passed them on to me.

446
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,920
I’m not surprised why those juniors admire you this much.

447
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,200
Time does fly, right?

448
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,440
I’m now a third year.

449
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,080
And I actually become a hazer.

450
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,360
I know, right? It seems like only yesterday that you got yelled by me.

451
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,280
I miss those days when I was a first year.

452
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,560
Me too.

453
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,640
Because…

454
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,440
we can be a first year only once.

455
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,640
You miss me when I was a first year, right?

456
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,600
Said who?

457
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,520
I didn’t say that. It’s all in your head.
