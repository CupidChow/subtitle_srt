1
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,160
The freshmen who are done with the registration, please walk inside

2
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,400
Let’s sing a song together. Please help sing along.

3
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
What do you think, P’Yatch?

4
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,160
Let’s start!

5
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,520
♬ What’s your name? ♬

6
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,560
Sawasdee, first year students.

7
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
My name is Arthit.

8
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,520
I’m a third year and your senior in this Faculty of Engineering.

9
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,040
I’m in charge of monitoring all of you throughout the next whole year

10
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,800
to make sure that you stay disciplined

11
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,400
and that you strictly comply with all the rules.

12
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,280
I expect to receive a full cooperation from all of you.

13
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,400
I would like to congratulate all of you

14
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,320
for being enrolled in the Faculty of Engineering

15
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,400
But…

16
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,480
I don’t consider that you…

17
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,480
…are my official junior students yet.

18
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,560
Not until…

19
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
you own this thing.

20
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,840
Gears are cogwheels that work together systematically for a mechanism

21
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,640
if a cogwheel is missing.

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,960
gears can’t function properly.

23
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,120
That’s why gears are the symbol of us, engineers.

24
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,920
It’s the symbol of honor and dignity

25
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,520
not representing just one particular person.

26
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,520
Before you can get hold of this gear badge,

27
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,320
you must learn…

28
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
and fully understand what SOTUS is.

29
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
Besides!

30
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,840
You must come to the freshman gathering every time.

31
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,120
You must not be late

32
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,120
And more importantly,

33
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,680
you must respect your seniors.

34
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,600
And finally,

35
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,760
each and everyone of you

36
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,920
must strictly follow my orders.

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,760
Understood?

38
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,280
Understood.

39
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,600
Now, do you all want to know us, your seniors?

40
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,400
Yes

41
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,200
Do you want to know your seniors?

42
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,520
YES.

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,200
Then, I want you to introduce yourself to the senior students

44
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
and get their signatures

45
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,920
1,000 signatures!

46
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
within one week.

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Is there a problem?

48
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,640
I forgot to tell you our custom.

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
Before you can get to speak

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,720
you must stand up

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,920
say your name and your student ID

52
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,880
before you could say anything, every time.

53
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,640
Kongpop, Student ID 0062

54
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,960
May I have a permission to speak?

55
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
One week is too tight.

56
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,080
We don’t think it’s going to be possible

57
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,640
Have you tried yet?

58
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,040
If you can’t complete this small task,

59
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,120
will you be able to get anything done in the future?

60
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Can we have at least one month?

61
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
No, you can’t.

62
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
If it were you,

63
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,800
would you be able to get 1,000 signatures in one week?

64
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
You are in no position to ask questions back.

65
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,560
My orders are absolute.

66
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,240
Understood?

67
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,760
I asked if you understood?

68
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,960
Understood.

69
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,640
Don’t be too worried.

70
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,920
N’Kongpop, why don’t you sit down first.

71
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,520
And this is the signature book that you have to get signatures from senior students.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,440
Pass them along.

73
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,720
Take one and pass the rest to your friends.

74
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,440
And those who are yet to get your name badges, just tell us.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,200
You were so cool earlier.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
By the way, my name is Oak.

77
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
What’s your name?

78
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,800
My name is Kong, Kongpop

79
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,360
Do you have a plan tonight at the dorm?

80
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,800
My name is M.

81
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,080
Wanna go play DotA?

82
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
Hey, you play DotA too?

83
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,880
Yeah, you play too?

84
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,200
The internet signal under the dorm is really strong

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,640
I know a place. Wanna check it out?

86
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,120
Sure.

87
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
Nice. Let’s go there.

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,160
See you guys in front of the dorm.

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
Hi, P’Ball. Sawasdee krup

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,040
P’Ball, thank you so much for helping me find a dorm room.

91
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,680
No problem.

92
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,800
Well, I’m trying to get seniors’ signatures.

93
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,920
Can you sign for me?

94
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,680
Sure.

95
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,600
Thank you so much. See you again.

96
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
Check this out.

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,800
Yesterday, this freshman talked back to P’Arthit.

98
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,120
Really? Let me see.

99
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,840
Oh my goodness. He’s such a hottie!

100
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,200
What is his name?

101
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
Hey, dude.

102
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,680
What are you doing?

103
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Let’s go hunt for the signatures.

104
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Wait a sec.

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
I’m trying to reload money to this game

106
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,160
Haven’t you tried to do it since the morning?

107
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,240
I read how to fix this on the internet but I can’t make it work yet.

108
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Forget it. Let’s go get some signatures.

109
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,960
Hold on a sec. Okay.

110
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,040
Come on.

111
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,960
You are so annoying.

112
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,680
It’s not that hard.

113
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,160
All you have to do is just introduce yourself and ask for the signatures

114
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,120
What? Is it that simple?

115
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,520
We can just ask for the signature without knowing each other?

116
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,920
Whatever, man.

117
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
Hey, you are free, right?

118
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
Come with me.

119
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,560
We are ready.

120
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,440
Okay, then. Introduce yourself.

121
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,640
My name is M…

122
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,640
A first year from Industrial Engineering.

123
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,760
Okay, then.

124
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
Can you do the grilled-chicken dance?

125
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,840
And sing the song loudly too.

126
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,960
Got it.

127
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,320
We have to dance…

128
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,800
right here?

129
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,800
Yes, right here.

130
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,240
can’t I do the push up instead?

131
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,160
Hey, dance is easier.

132
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,000
I’m ready.

133
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,480
Then. Start.

134
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,720
Grilled chicken..3..4.

135
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,840
♪ The chicken is being grilled.♪

136
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,720
♪ The chicken is being grilled.♪

137
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,680

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,440

142
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,560
Give me your signature book. I’ll sign for you.

143
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,120
My name is Yatch.

144
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,960
A second year from Industrial Engineering.

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,880
You can come to me if you need help.

146
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,080
Thank you.

147
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,560
Thank you.

148
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,160
Your name is M?

149
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,720
My name is May.

150
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,240
Thanks for joining me.

151
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,000
I have to go now.

152
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,760
Hey, M.

153
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,240
Hey, Kong.

154
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,600
How many signatures have you got?

155
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,560
Me?

156
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,800
Well, 3 already.

157
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
How about you.

158
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,720
All 3 pages.

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
You are awesome, man.

160
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,480
Give me your signature book.

161
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,720
I’ll help you.

162
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,480
Do you think it’s a good idea?

163
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,160
The seniors ask you to do the things you are not good at.

164
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
I hate to see when people are being forced.

165
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,720
Are you Kongpop?

166
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,720
Yes

167
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,160
What can I do for you?

168
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,680
You haven’t had our signatures on your book, right?

169
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,440
Come. Give me the signature book.

170
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,720
If you need help, you can come to us anytime, you know?

171
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,040
Well,

172
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,960
can I bother you to sign on this notebook too?

173
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,240
No problem.

174
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,800
Thank you.

175
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,120
Look, you guys.

176
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
We got only a small number of signatures.

177
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,000
Just one week. It’s just impossible.

178
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,760
It’s possible.

179
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,720
You just have to ask all the senior students you come across

180
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,640
Do you mean those seniors too? Behind you.

181
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,080
The first one, his name is P’Knot.

182
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,720
He is quiet, calm and extremely reserved.

183
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,000
He has been refusing everyone who wants his signature

184
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
The second one there, do you guys see him?

185
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,240
His name is P’Prem.

186
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,720
This man is heartless.

187
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,000
The last freshman who came to get his signature

188
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,760
had to do a push up for like a hundred time.

189
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Unbelievable, right?

190
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,000
And the last person,

191
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
he’s the toughest one out of them.

192
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
I’m, for one, not going to mess with him.

193
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,680
Who do you mean?

194
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,160
P’Arthit.

195
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,840
He’s incredibly brutal.

196
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,920
I heard that no one even dare to ask for his signature

197
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,600
Well then

198
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,560
I guess we can skip this group of seniors.

199
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,240
It should be okay.

200
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,520
No, it’s not okay.

201
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,160
You say you want to ask for the signatures from every senior you come across.

202
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,240
They are sitting across you right there

203
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,720
Go get their signatures.

204
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,200
What? Why me?

205
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,160
Because you are the prettiest out here.

206
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,920
It has nothing to do with that at all.

207
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,640
It has.

208
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,240
Those tough seniors could be mesmerized by your cuteness

209
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,200
and give you’re their signatures.

210
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,360
Come on.
Come on.

211
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Come on, Prae.

212
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,360
P’Arthit, my friend wants to know you.

213
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,520
Well, P’Arthit…

214
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,560
Name and student ID.

215
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,040
Praepailin, 0744.

216
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
What’s the matter?

217
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,520
I want you to sign on this signature book for me.

218
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
Isn’t it too easy to get my signature by just asking?

219
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,000
Eh?

220
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,760
You must do something for me.

221
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,960
What do I have to do?

222
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,240
You must shout out

223
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,160
“I like the super good-looking P’Arthit” 3 times at the top of lungs.

224
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,320
What?

225
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
Do you want my signature or not?

226
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,600
Hurry up, girl.

227
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,960
What do you have to be afraid?

228
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,320
Super good looking P’Arthit, I like you.

229
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,520
I can’t hear you.

230
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,560
Super good looking P’Arthit, I like you

231
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,200
Super good looking P’Arthit, I like you

232
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,680
Super good looking P’Arthit, I like you

233
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
Thank you for your confession.

234
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,920
For the sake of your prettiness, can I…

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
have your number and a picture of you?

236
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
Let me take a picture for you.

237
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,160
Smile.

238
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,760
Smile.

239
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,080
Arthit, you are such a badass

240
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,080
You managed to get her number this way.

241
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
Can I have it too?

242
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,040
Excuse me, man.

243
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,640
Get lost.

244
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,760
Do you have to be that harsh to me?

245
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,640
Well, this approach is pretty common for me.

246
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,440
I see.

247
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,120
Why don’t you ask that freshman his number too?

248
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,600
But I don’t think you can go to him.

249
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,080
He’s being crowded up by those girls.

250
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,840
Kongpop, 0062.

251
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,960
Why do you have two signature books?

252
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
Another one belongs to my friend.

253
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Your friend?

254
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,840
Why don’t your friend work on this himself?

255
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,840
You told us to get signatures.

256
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,000
But you didn’t specify how to get them, did you?

257
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,240
Have you had my signature yet?

258
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,920
Not yet.

259
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,840
Give me your signature book.

260
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,560
You seem to get a lot of signatures already.

261
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,080
Can you do me a favor?

262
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,520
What is it?

263
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,960
Can you?

264
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,440
All right

265
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,000
Do you see the last table back there?

266
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,760
Yes.

267
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,680
Go stand on the table

268
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,080
and shout out, 3 times

269
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,520
“I like men.”

270
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Wait. I’m not done.

271
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,400
Then you must ask some male students over there, let’s say…

272
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,920
how many?

273
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,560
10.

274
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
10 guys

275
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,720
and ask “Would you like to go out with me?”

276
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,480
Do you think you can do all these?

277
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,320
Why are you silent?

278
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,440
Or you don’t have the guts to do.

279
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,280
He has the guts.

280
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,920
I like men

281
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,120
I like men

282
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,640
I like men

283
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
Would you like to go out with me?

284
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
Would you like to go out with me?

285
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,960
I’m done.

286
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,480
Good job.

287
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,720
Take this back.

288
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,240
But you haven’t signed yet

289
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,360
When did I say that I would sign on it?

290
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,440
And don’t do this again.

291
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,640
Return this signature book to your friend and let him get the signatures himself.

292
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,040
Understood?

293
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,480
Hey, but there’s one thing I can help you.

294
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,920
I can find you a skirt to wear if you like

295
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,360
We are giving you guys a T-shirt.

296
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,080
Those who wear size S, come out and get it first.

297
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,320
They have a T-shirt for this?

298
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,160
It must get tougher from now.

299
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,680
Hey, Kong.

300
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,840
I’m sorry about the signature book

301
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,520
I got you into a trouble.

302
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,120
It’s fine.

303
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
That senior can always find a way to bully us.

304
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,240
You are being targeted from the start. Do you think it’s okay?

305
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,520
Next, Size L. Come and get it.

306
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,120
Hey, Oak?

307
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,400
Aren’t you a size M?

308
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,240
Hold on. I’m a size M!

309
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,160
okay come and get yours.

310
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,600
Size L, come out.

311
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,760
How many size L do we have left?

312
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
Please wait.

313
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,360
Check that bag too.

314
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,160
We have none left.

315
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
We have run out of size L.

316
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,720
Do you mind take size M instead?

317
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,760
Okay.

318
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,120
Take size M for now.

319
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,640
Hey…

320
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,840
My name is Wad.

321
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,880
Wad, do you want to swap your tee with me?

322
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,400
I’m smaller. I could go for size M

323
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,960
Really?

324
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,560
Thanks.

325
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,080
And you are…

326
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,960
I’m Kongpop. You can call me Kong.

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,120
Okay.

328
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,520
Thanks a lot, Kong.

329
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,640
So you are all set here.

330
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,400
Okay guys, the third years want us to remind you

331
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,880
that you must wear this T-shirt to every freshman gathering.

332
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,840
Sawasdee krup.

333
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,480
Sawasdee krup.

334
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,960
Are you done changing?

335
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,120
Then go to the hall.

336
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,320
I’m waiting for my friends. They are getting changed

337
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,200
We’ll be there soon.

338
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
What game is that?

339
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,160
I’m playing Eleven Nights.

340
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,920
But there’s a glitch I can’t fix. I reloaded money to the game a long time ago.

341
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,400
It happened to me once

342
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,880
You must fix it from a computer.

343
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,600
You have an account set up already, right?

344
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
I’m heading out first.

345
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,560
See you there.

346
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,360
Hey, isn’t that P’Yatch

347
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,400
What did he say?

348
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,200
He gave me some tips about the game.

349
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,720
It’s not a bad idea to befriend with the seniors.

350
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,560
They seem to know a lot.

351
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,520
Didn’t you hear what I ask?

352
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,480
I asked how many students in your first-year class?

353
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,720
You must answer when I ask!

354
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,640
No one cares to answer.

355
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,400
It means this whole day…

356
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,720
you don’t care about your fellow friends at all.

357
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,360
That’s why you don’t know a single of them

358
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,920
Kongpop, student ID 0062.

359
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,800
Get up!

360
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,960
I asked how many students were there in your first-year class?

361
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,960
I don’t know.

362
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,560
Why don’t you know that?

363
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,160
Cause I never count them.

364
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,000
Even you don’t,

365
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,480
but every answer I ask

366
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,520
you must give me an answer.

367
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,080
Understand?

368
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,280
Yes, I do.

369
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,800
Do you see this gear badge?

370
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,160
Yes, I do.

371
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,080
This is the gear badge for each engineering class

372
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,040
It’s an honorary symbol representing all engineering students.

373
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,800
Not just for one particular person.

374
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,320
And if any of you…

375
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,080
can’t prove to me that you should earn it

376
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,760
feel free to get out.

377
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,480
And I won’t consider you as my junior students any longer

378
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,160
Now, Mr. Kongpop…

379
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,560
What if I don’t give you this gear badge?

380
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,280
What will you do?

381
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,760
I just take it from you.

382
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,120
What did you say?

383
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,320
If you don’t give the gears to us,

384
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,040
we can just snatch them from you.

385
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,560
How do you do that?

386
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,120
I just make you my wife.

387
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,240
They say, what belongs to your lover is also yours.

388
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,640
If I can make you my wife,

389
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,440
your gear badge is also mine.

390
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,160
You are really brave, Mr. Kongpop.

391
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,760
That’s good.

392
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,880
Let’s see if you can do like you say.

393
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,240
But at this moment!

394
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,680
The gears are in my possession.

395
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,880
And I have the right to order you to do anything.

396
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,200
Kongpop, student ID 0062.

397
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
Sit and Stand 200 times.

398
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,880
Go.

399
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,960
1, 2…

400
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,440
Don’t look!

401
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
Hold on to your friends.

402
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,880
And keep your head down too.

403
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,400
Hey you guys, I haven’t finished my assignment yet

404
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,200
I’m not coming here tomorrow.

405
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,560
If you are absent, other people will be in trouble.

406
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,560
So what? I’m not gonna get it done if I come.

407
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Why don’t we tell them that we have class tomorrow.

408
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,760
Hey, what are you talking there?

409
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,960
You asshole, Oak. You are too loud.

410
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,760
We are going to be screwed now

411
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,240
The persons who talk, stand up!

412
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,480
Tew, you stand up.

413
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,560
Tewtat, student ID 0075. May I request for a permission?

414
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,160
What are you guys talking?

415
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,480
Well, we have class tomorrow and an assignment due this Friday.

416
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,800
So I would like to ask for your permission not to attend the gathering tomorrow.

417
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,520
I don’t allow.

418
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,280
It’s your problem.

419
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,200
How could you ask for such thing?

420
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,960
You are all a grow up. You should learn to manage time.

421
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,040
Can’t you do it?

422
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Get down.

423
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,360
Thank you.

424
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,640
They should help us on our assignment.

425
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,440
If they help, do you dare to work with them?

426
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,280
The glass boy!

427
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,160
How many time do I have to warn you?!!

428
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:21,800
(lecturing)

429
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,520
This is a class room not a bed room

430
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,560
May,

431
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,240
what time is it?

432
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,080
Almost 4 pm.

433
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,880
Today class is almost over

434
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,280
Those hazing seniors are probably waiting for us now in the hall.

435
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,600
Don’t exaggerate.

436
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,560
It’s just a first-year gathering, it’s not like we are getting into a jail or something.

437
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,160
It’s pretty much the same to me.

438
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,040
Instead of getting to the gathering, I prefer to study 24 hours straight.

439
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,760
Hey, I heard someone mentioning about the gathering.

440
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,640
It makes me awake.

441
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,320
Look, your godfathers are all there.

442
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,280
I should have skipped this class.

443
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
All right.

444
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,360
What I have taught you today will be in a quiz next week.

445
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,760
I hope you all go over it before the quiz.

446
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,040
Good bye.

447
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,560
Hey, Oak.

448
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,720
What is today’s lecture about?

449
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,680
I think we are going to be in deep shit for this class.

450
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,640
You are so unreliable, man.

451
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,080
Hey, Kong.

452
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,240
I and Oak are now relying on you.

453
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,760
You are relying on me all your life.

454
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,560
You are really a smart ass boy.

455
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,440
Great.

456
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,160
Hurry and change your clothes. Come meet us in the gathering hall.

457
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,360
Why do you raise your head?

458
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
Don’t tell me that you want to look at my handsome face.

459
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,680
Keep your head down!

460
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
What is the time I told you to be here?

461
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,440
4 pm.

462
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,200
Answer me louder and clearer!

463
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,560
What is the time I told you to be here?

464
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,080
4 PM.

465
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,600
And what time is it now?

466
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,640
WHAT TIME IS IT NOW?

467
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,160
Enough.

468
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,760
Don’t bother to answer.

469
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,240
Let me tell you.

470
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,600
The time now is 4.18 pm and 57 seconds.

471
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,680
You keep us waiting for you.

472
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,560
Do you have any responsibility at all?

473
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,520
Or you don’t have it with you?

474
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,800
But it’s all right.

475
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,800
I consider that it’s the first time.

476
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,920
I will give you another chance.

477
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
But…

478
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,520
I’m going to call out one of your fellow friends by random.

479
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,240
And if this person I pick can’t answer my question.

480
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,600
You all will be punished.

481
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,120
Student ID 0062.

482
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,560
raise your head and come out.

483
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,400
I asked you yesterday how many people there are in your class.

484
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,800
Do you remember?

485
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,200
I do.

486
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,480
The Faculty of Engineering, class 2559 (2016)

487
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,680
there are 1,118 students in total.

488
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,320
and there are 216 students in Industrial Engineering major.

489
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,600
Good.

490
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,720
But that’s not the question I’m going to ask.

491
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,640
I just want to bring it up to remind you.

492
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Now look around and count loudly

493
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,360
how many first-year students come to the gathering today.

494
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,120
1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8

495
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,120
160..161

496
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,320
There are 162 people gathering here.

497
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,240
Good.

498
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,280
And here is the question I want to ask

499
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,760
I want to know where are the rest 54 students.

500
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,360
Where are they?!!!!

501
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,720
Where are they?!!!!

502
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,680
Raise your head.

503
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,080
Raise your head and see this friend of yours who has no answer for me.

504
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,880
That means you all here will be punished!

505
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,320
They are not missing.

506
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,680
Say that again.

507
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,200
Those 54 students are not missing.

508
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,160
Open your damn eyes and see if they are here?

509
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,280
How the hell you say that they are not missing?

510
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
They are not missing, really.

511
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,480
Though they cannot be here in person.

512
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,400
But they have sent their heart here.

513
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,240
Your missing friends must have a lot of heart to spare.

514
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,160
Then, for the heart they have sent,

515
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,840
it should be enough to keep you all running on the track 54 laps

516
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,400
No.

517
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,760
They sent their heart to me only.

518
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,520
Why did they send it to you only?

519
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,520
To replace my heart that was already given to you.

520
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,080
Kongpop!

521
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,280
Yes?

522
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,520
Run around the track field 54 laps

523
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,440
Go!

524
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,960
Yes, sir.

525
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
Don’t look at him!

526
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,040
Hey. Kongpop.

527
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,400
Stop running.

528
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,080
I just did 7 laps.

529
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,400
It’s okay.

530
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,640
If you finish all laps, you’ll be exhausted to death.

531
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,640
Here you are.

532
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
Take a rest and sit here.

533
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,400
Are you done all laps?

534
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,240
Not yet.

535
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,640
Why did you stop?

536
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,120
P’Fang told me to stop.

537
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,280
And she’s my senior too.

538
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,720
Is it wrong to listen to the seniors?

539
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,520
Where’s the big talker back there now?

540
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,760
Don’t just talk the talk but walk the walk.

541
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,280
What a scumbag.
