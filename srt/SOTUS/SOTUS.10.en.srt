00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
The hazing activities depicted in this series,
“SOTUS the Series”
have been exaggerated for entertainment purposes.

2
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,600
Do you still have anything else you want to buy?

3
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,880
No, I want to go back to my dorm now.

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
Let me go with you.

5
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,000
Hey,

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
you don’t have to walk me home.

7
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
I’m not a girl

8
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,960
No, it’s not that.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
This is my way home too.

10
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,360
Why?

11
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,280
You really thought that I was walking you home?

12
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,640
No, I didn’t.

13
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,880
But if you want me to walk you to your dorm…

14
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,240
That’s totally fine.

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,760
I’m happy to do so.

16
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,680
Thank you, P’Arthit.

17
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,880
For helping me choose the present

18
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
You’re welcome.

19
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,160
All right then

20
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,240
See you.

21
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
Hello, P’Arthit.

22
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
What’s up?

23
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,440
You forgot to take P’Tum card with you.

24
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,560
Do you want me to bring it to you now?

25
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,080
Yeah. I completely forgot about it.

26
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,840
Okay, I’m going down now

27
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,800
Shit! What the?!

28
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
Kongpob, I can’t go now.

29
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,480
Can you bring it up to my room? Bye for now.

30
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,400
Come in. The door isn’t locked.

31
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,640
Be careful. The floor is slippery

32
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
The water pipe is broken?

33
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
Yeah.

34
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
I can’t believe this shit happened either.

35
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,040
Look at this mess.

36
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,160
And where can I get the plumber at this hour?

37
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,920
Let me help you clear this stuff.

38
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,840
Thanks.

39
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Kongpob, let me take care of my personal stuff. You can leave it to me.

40
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,680
These books and papers,

41
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,840
if you put them in the freezer right away,

42
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,640
it can prevent shrinkage.

43
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,120
But I don’t have a fridge.

44
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,800
You can put them in my fridge.

45
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,520
All right, thanks.

46
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
But where would I sleep tonight?

47
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,600
You…can sleep at my place tonight.

48
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
Nah, it’s okay.

49
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,920
I will just go there and leave these books to you.

50
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,840
Then I go crash at my friend’s.

51
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,240
I have many friends.

52
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,400
My whole room got flooded.

53
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,920
Yeah. This sucks.

54
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,040
I don’t know what to do.

55
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,200
I called everyone

56
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,960
Knot’s gone home.

57
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,760
Prem didn’t pick up my calls.

58
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Yeah. Tuta and Bright are still drunk.

59
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,640
Really?

60
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,640
No worries.

61
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,840
I can get a place to crash somehow.

62
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,160
All right. Bye for now.

63
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
You can crash here.

64
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,520
Well, I guess it has to come to that

65
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
I’m here after all.

66
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,880
I will take care of those books.

67
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,200
I may shrug away the ones I don’t need anymore.

68
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
Okay.

69
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,880
Well then.

70
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,840
I’ll be right back.

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,520
He has only a few bottles of water in the fridge.

72
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,440
What a waste of electricity.

73
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,600
I got this for you, P’Arthit.

74
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,680
I don’t know what your favorite food is.

75
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
So I bought what I like.

76
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,680
Thank you.

77
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,360
You have gone for so long just to get an omelet with rice?

78
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,720
Can’t you get me anything else?

79
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,360
We can make an omelet if you like to have it, you know?

80
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,040
I can’t make it as tasty as this.

81
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,680
And the thing is…

82
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
I end up burning it every time.

83
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,040
You’ve got to be kidding me.

84
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,320
You are a grown man.

85
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,960
How come you still burn your omelet?

86
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,120
You must have born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

87
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,160
But I know you like this.

88
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,600
Now we’re talking.

89
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,360
Kongpob, do you have a cleaning cloth?

90
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,600
I help you clean this up.

91
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,840
It’s at the porch.

92
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,760
Kongpob,

93
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,360
you know where my room is located, don’t you?

94
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,120
Definitely. I’ve just been there.

95
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,920
No, I mean…

96
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,440
You know all along that our porches are opposite each other.

97
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,600
Yes, I do.

98
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,160
For how long?

99
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,600
Since the beginning of the semester.

100
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,560
How the hell did you know?

101
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,440
Well, I saw you when you hung your clothes.

102
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,480
And many other occasions.

103
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,920
Why didn’t you tell me?

104
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,520
I don’t want you to know that I know.

105
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,040
Why?

106
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,240
Why don’t you want me to know?

107
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
I got it.

108
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,560
You want to use this to make fun of me behind my back, right?

109
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
No.

110
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I’ve never told anyone about this

111
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,400
Why?

112
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Cause I don’t want anyone to get closer to you more than I do.

113
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,440
Kongpob,

114
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,560
give it to me straight.

115
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,280
Up until now, everything you have done for me.

116
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,960
Is it because you have feelings for me?

117
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,920
What do you mean, P’Arthit?

118
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
Screw it.

119
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,280
I’m going to take a shower now.

120
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,920
Hey.

121
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,360
You smoke too?

122
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,400
Yes.

123
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,680
Quit it.

124
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
Think about your parents.

125
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,840
They work hard to pay for your education.

126
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,040
Not to see you ruin your own lung.

127
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,760
Do you know what I mean?

128
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,360
Yes. I will quit smoking.

129
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,400
Good. It smells bad.

130
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,160
Are you going to sleep now, P’Arthit?

131
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Though we cannot say it that we love each other.

132
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,480
Cause we know people may not like it when they know.

133
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,200
No matter how strong our feelings for each other is.

134
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,360
Only the two of us know

135
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,800
and must keep it to ourselves

136
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Can’t tell anyone.

137
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,200
Cause everything is already good as it is.

138
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
As long as we know about it

139
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,560
Our minds connect just by looking into each other’s eyes.

140
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,120
Just listening to the same love songs…

141
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,960
…is enough to keep our heart warm.

142
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,440
And there’s nothing else I could ask for more

143
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,520
Just know it in our own heart.

144
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,320
Just the two of us is enough.

145
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,760
It’s more than love. No words could ever express.

146
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,640
We don’t need to walk hand in hand.

147
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,760
Just standing next to each other is good enough.

148
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,040
Our love does not require any kind of words to define it.

149
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,760
P’Arthit…

150
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,480
Have you already gone to sleep?

151
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,160
To answer your question…

152
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,400
…whether I have feelings for you or not.

153
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,360
I don’t know what you mean by that.

154
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,840
But if it’s the same as I had in mind.

155
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
Yes, I do.

156
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,880
And I have had that for quite some time now.

157
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,080
To replace my heart that was already given to you.

158
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,280
Have these. My friend gave them to you, didn’t she?

159
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,120
Don’t ever forget them.

160
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,520
Understand?

161
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,360
What do you think?

162
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,640
I think that…

163
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,680
you like me.

164
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,920
I told you it was none of the first years’ business.

165
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,200
This first year doesn’t have the right to worry about a third year like you?

166
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,240
What now?

167
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,200
In the future, if you want to cry.

168
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,880
Tell me

169
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,160
I’ll wipe away those tears for you.

170
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,520
You are awake now?

171
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,560
Um. What time is it?

172
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,480
8.30 a.m

173
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,520
8.30 a.m

174
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,640
Why did you wake up so early?

175
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,080
I have to go to my niece’s birthday party.

176
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,400
You look sleepy.

177
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
You can go back to sleep.

178
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,680
I’ll leave a spare key to you.

179
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,560
You don’t have to.

180
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
I’m taking a shower now.

181
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
I should go back to my dorm.

182
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,520
Damn it.

183
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,840
Act normal.

184
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,160
Are you hungry?

185
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,880
I bought you soy milk and Chinese doughnut.

186
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
Have them before you leave.

187
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,400
Um.

188
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,600
Here you are.

189
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,560
Kongpob, I’m sorry.

190
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,480
It’s all right. Leave it to me.

191
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,600
I’m really sorry.

192
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,080
Yes, mom

193
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,120
Yes, I’m about to leave

194
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,400
Well, I’m going first.

195
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
Hey, P’…

196
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Yes?

197
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,320
Oh, it’s nothing.

198
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,200
I’ll call you when I get there.

199
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,520
Where are you?

200
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,160
At the faculty.

201
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,960
Where exactly are you?

202
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,000
At the hallway in front of the room.

203
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,280
P’Arthit.

204
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
You left your books at my dorm.

205
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,920
Are you free today?

206
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,600
I can take them to you.

207
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,800
Hey, Kong.

208
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,280
Where the hell have you been?

209
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,520
I’ve been looking for you

210
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,560
Nothing.

211
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,240
I just want to be alone once in a while

212
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,520
You want to be alone?

213
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,280
Are you an artist or what?

214
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,760
By the way, have you done the chemistry assignment?

215
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,600
I have.

216
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,840
Good. Can I copy it?

217
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,240
I wonder what you have spent all your time with.

218
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,160
This assignment was given to us a long time ago.

219
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,440
I have been into Dota lately

220
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,960
It’s Oak. He keeps bugging me to play with him.

221
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,600
And he’s totally a noob.

222
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,680
He loses all the times and he wants to win some.

223
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,760
But he stands no chance to defeat me.

224
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,160
You know he’s just a friggin’ stupid noob.

225
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,760
You’ve never changed no matter how many years have passed.

226
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,920
You mean I’m good at Dota?

227
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,080
No.
Your laziness.

228
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,960
Be careful or you get an F

229
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,360
Here.

230
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,280
Thank you, pal.

231
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,400
Well, Kong.

232
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,600
I want to hear your thought on something.

233
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,600
Well I…

234
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,240
I want to have a new haircut.

235
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Huh?

236
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Which hairstyle should I get?

237
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,760
This or this?

238
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,240
What the hell is wrong with you?

239
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,600
Why do you want to change your looks all of sudden?

240
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,360
Hey? Hey? You talked like this.

241
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,800
You probably haven’t heard about P’Arthit.

242
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,080
What’s about him?

243
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,640
He has a new haircut.

244
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,920
He looks so damn cool.

245
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,360
Many girls dig his new looks.

246
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,920
So I want to have a new haircut too.

247
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,840
Which hairstyle should I get? How about this one?

248
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,240
Where did you see him?

249
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,680
At the motorcycle parking lot.

250
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,880
But can you help me choose this first? I’m being serious here.

251
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,680
Look.

252
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,640
Fine, just choose between these two choices. This and this.

253
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,320
M, I’ll be right back.

254
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,680
What?

255
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,600
Which one should I get, then?

256
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,200
Hey, did you see P’Arthit earlier?

257
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,520
Yeah.

258
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,920
He’s really cute.

259
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
He’s so friggin’ cute, right?

260
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,360
Maprang,

261
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,960
try to contain yourself.

262
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You are a lady. It’s not right.

263
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,280
Come on. These days, being shy will get you nothing.

264
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,640
Really, he should be my boyfriend.

265
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,600
Maprang,

266
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,760
Get real!

267
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,280
Stop imagining things.

268
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,800
You didn’t sleep enough because of the papers, did you?

269
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,560
I like him.

270
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,240
Hey, Kong.

271
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,680
What’s wrong?

272
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,720
Are you running to class?

273
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,800
No, I just need to do something.

274
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,040
Have you seen, P’Arthit?

275
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,080
I have. He went in the building already. I heard that he had to hurry to class.

276
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,840
Really?

277
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,200
Thank you.

278
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,720
What’s with him?

279
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,280
He looks so tired.

280
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,680
Let’s get going.

281
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,200
We are going to be late.

282
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,280
What should we eat for lunch?

283
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,920
Arthit.

284
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,400
Arthit.

285
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,400
Arthit.Arthit, you jackass!

286
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,040
Didn’t you hear me?

287
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,200
Huh?

288
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,520
What’s the matter?

289
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,840
Is everything all right?

290
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,480
You have been quiet since morning.

291
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,680
Well, I’m sleepy.

292
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,480
I watched a football match at late night.

293
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,480
Which match?

294
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,440
The Premier League has ended, hasn’t it?

295
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,120
Forget it.

296
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,120
I’m hungry. What do we eat

297
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,240
Hey, Kong.

298
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,200
Later. I’m in a hurry.

299
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Let’s eat.

300
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
He cut me out coldly like that?

301
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,640
Forget him. Let’s eat.

302
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,280
What should we eat?

303
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,520
P’Knot, sawasdee krup

304
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,640
Hey, sawasdee krup.

305
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,920
Have you seen P’Arthit?

306
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,760
Arthit? He’s right here.

307
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,600
Where has he gone?

308
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,920
What’s the matter?

309
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,640
Nothing.

310
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,400
By the way,

311
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,360
do you have any class left today?

312
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,560
Today?

313
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,560
We have a lab class.

314
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,720
It ends around 4 or 5 p.m.

315
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,040
I see. Thank you.

316
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,400
So we will try that?

317
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,760
Where the hell have you been?

318
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,120
You’ve gone for too long.

319
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,520
We’ve already eaten.

320
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,000
I’ve got diarrhea.

321
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,880
The toilet bowl must be filled up.

322
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,840
Earlier, there’s a junior asking for you.

323
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,280
Who?

324
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,200
It’s your favorite junior

325
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,120
Kongpob 0062 krup!

326
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,520
Excuse me.

327
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,520
Do you have a minute?

328
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,040
For all 3 of you,

329
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,560
I can have all day.

330
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,000
You’re always fast when it comes to women.

331
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,000
What can we do for you?

332
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,400
And you stop acting cool, you moron.

333
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,040
So what can we do for you?

334
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,240
We are from the Faculty of Arts.

335
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
We are conducting a survey

336
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,960
and we would like to ask all of you to complete some questionnaires for us.

337
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,240
Of course. Bring it on.

338
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,160
Helping people is my nature.

339
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,320
You don’t have to go that far.

340
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,360
Give them to me.

341
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,880
How kind of you.

342
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,320
I’m a gentleman.

343
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,320
I’ll come back later to get these questionnaires.

344
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,520
Please take your time and complete them for us

345
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,440
What if we are done

346
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,800
and you are busy handing these questionnaires out to others…

347
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,080
What should we do?

348
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,000
Can we have your Line ID so that we can text you?

349
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,760
Oh, you are possessive of this one.

350
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,160
I ask this one, then.

351
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,280
No.

352
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,480
Or this one

353
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,360
None of them.

354
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,240
Not even one?

355
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,440
No.

356
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,960
Well, when we’re done, we let you know

357
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,760
Thank you so much.

358
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,400
All engineering seniors are really kind.

359
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,520
All right.

360
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,280
You are leaving us now?

361
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,320
Damn it, man.

362
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,120
I lost them.

363
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,400
You scared the hell of out of them.

364
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Once in a while, a prey walks into my trap.

365
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Hey, the question that reads

366
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,040
“how many girlfriends have you had so far?”

367
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,960
In what level of relationship do we have to have to call them “girlfriends”

368
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,200
Well, if we count those one-night stands, I have like hundreds of them

369
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,800
Hundreds of them?

370
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,320
You should seek doctor advice now.

371
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,640
Hundreds of what? Feet?

372
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,080
Bite me, you asshole.

373
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,880
Give me a break, Knot.

374
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,360
Let me see your answer

375
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,120
Wah?

376
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,520
Never be in a relationship? You are single?

377
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,880
Wait a minute.

378
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,800
You have never been in a relationship. For real?

379
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,280
Yes, what’s wrong?

380
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,040
It’s hard to believe

381
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,800
Arthit has never had one either.

382
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,080
It’s not a big deal.

383
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,040
You never have a girlfriend also?

384
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,960
Or you just nailed them

385
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,840
and didn’t give them the status of being your girlfriends?

386
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,280
He’s not like that.

387
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,560
Really?

388
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,360
I beg you. Can you change your ringtone?

389
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,280
Speaking of which, he’s got a call from a girl.

390
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,080
Really? What is the caller’s name?

391
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,800
N’Brown.

392
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,240
Namtan. Namtan (Namtan = brown color)

393
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,600
Hello

394
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,040
What’s up, Namtan?

395
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,600
Okay, see you then.

396
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,840
The gender you are interested in while in school/university? …Male …Female

397
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,120
Female.

398
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,280
That’s all for today.

399
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,680
See you next week.

400
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,720
Sawasdee krup.

401
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,920
Bright, Prem….. now!

402
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,840
Hey, want to grab something to eat?

403
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,920
I have a plan. You guys have fun.

404
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,640
All right.

405
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,040
What’s wrong with you? You look bummed.

406
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,640
No. I’m just being cool as always.

407
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,360
Nothing really happened.

408
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,800
I’m worried about you.

409
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,200
Can’t you just answer me properly?

410
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,160
Just go.

411
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,640
Hey, Arthit.

412
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,440
Someone is here to see you.

413
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,960
I’ll wait outside

414
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,880
What’s the matter?

415
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,960
I’ve brought these books for you.

416
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,880
Let go.

417
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,560
I will

418
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
but we need to talk.

419
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,640
But I have nothing to talk to you

420
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,240
But P’Arthit.

421
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,560
If you don’t let go,

422
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,000
then I don’t want them.
