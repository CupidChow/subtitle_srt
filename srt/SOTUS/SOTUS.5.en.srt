00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
I’m back, sir.

2
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
Hey, Arthit.

3
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,480
Where the hell have you been?

4
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
You keep us waiting with this paper.

5
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,320
Here you are, sir.

6
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,760
I bought these drinks for you to get more refreshed.

7
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
Thank you.

8
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,560
Hold on.

9
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,440
Bright is sleeping again.

10
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,600
Not surprising.

11
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,880
What the hell are you doing?

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
You jackass, Bright.

13
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Are you not going to help us on the paper at all?

14
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,760
You sleep all the time.

15
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,160
Look, you miss all the good stuff

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
You always miss everything.

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,800
What does he miss?

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,760
The auditorium.

19
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Hey, you have never asked us to go watch the Star Contest before.

20
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,760
What’s wrong with you today?

21
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,960
I just want to watch the concert there.

22
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
Oh, you want to watch the concert.

23
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,120
That’s right, sir.

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Or do you actually want to nail a Star there?

25
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,120
That’s great.

26
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
You guys can nail those Stars.

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,600
Leave the Moons to me (Note: Star = female contestants / Moon = male contestants)

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,760
I don’t know.

29
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,840
All in all, you guys must come with me.

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,960
You have had these drinks I bought, so I take that as a yes.

31
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
What? This is not just your generosity

32
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,880
No.

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
But I’m okay with this.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,080
Okay, right?

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,240
Okay, I like the idea.

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,280
This is why I love you

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,640
You deserve a kiss from me.

38
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,280
Hurry and finish your drink so we can go.

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,640
I need to go back to my dorm first

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,920
to do stuff and keep this paper there.

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,400
Let’s get going or we are late

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Nong Kongpob, are you nervous?

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,760
No.

44
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,800
Why do you look so serious?

45
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,560

48
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,640
Why don’t you think about the prizes you could get?

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,800
I heard that this contest have many sponsors this year.

50
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
If you want me to accept you,

51

you must win all competitions you take part.

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000

what will you give me?

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,680
After I brought up about the prizes, you finally smile and your eyes are sparkling.

55
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,440
First up, the Faculty of Communication Arts, please come out.

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,640

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,240

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,680
Let’s meet all the star & moon contestants from each faculty.

64
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,880
Okay, can I have another big round of applause for all contestants here?

65
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,360
They all look lovely, aren’t they?

66
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Now, we’ll ask them to introduce themselves…

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,520
Take it easy, what’s the rush?

68
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,560
You called me out at 6 p.m.

69
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,280
You all want to watch it too.

70
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,960
I only asked Bright to come. Why are you all here?

71
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,120
I called them so we can put more pressure on that boy.

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,440
If he wins this contest too, we will lose face, you know?

73
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
What would you do?

74
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
I don’t think he wins.

75
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,160
He has such an annoying face.

76
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,520
It’s unlikely of him to win.

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,000
♪ that love needs time.

166
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,520
♪ I’ll wait until I hear that ‘word’

167
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,520
♪ That’s the prize I’ve been longing for

168
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,560
♪ And it’s worth searching your heart

169
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,760
All right.

170
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,400
The performance of the Engineering faculty is over.

171
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
First of all,

172
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,320
let me ask you why you chose to sing those 3 songs for your performance?

173
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,640
The reasons that we chose to perform these songs

174
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,360
is that they can reflect well our 3 stages of life.

175
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,000
For the first song,

176
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,560
it relates to our childhood when there are only good memories.

177
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,200
We had fun and good relationship with friends.

178
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,600
For the second song, “L-O-V-E”

179
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,080
this is the stage of life where we had a puppy love which was beautiful.

180
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,640
And the third song,

181
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,120
it relates to the stage of life where we are old enough to have a secret crush.

182
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,560
We would like to use our heart to search the heart of your crush.

183
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,160
And now

184
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,560
I would like to use my whole heart to search the heart of our judges

185
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,280
whether they are letting me qualified or not.

186
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,480
Wow. All right, please give a big round of applause

187
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,840
for these contestants from the Faculty of Engineering.

188
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,520
We will let them have a break at backstage.

189
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,200
Thank you so much.

190
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,840
They are so lovely, aren’t they?

191
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,560
You did so well, both of you

192
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,360
Your performance was impeccable perfect!

193
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you, P’Ginny.

194
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,880
And please forward my thank to P’Minney too.

195
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,520
If it’s not for both of you, it would be a mess for me.

196
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,920
You’re welcome.

197
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
Well, you better hurry and get changed to the uniform.

198
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,080
You have to go back there to hear the result.

199
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,960
Hurry up

200
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,080
Okay now, it’s the moment you have been waiting for.

201
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,120
We have 4 qualified faculties in the final round.

202
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,080
Let’s make a round of applause for them!

203
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,280
I think he has a high chance of winning.

204
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,520
Look at this.

205
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,240
His picture gets so many Likes on Facebook.

206
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
You are in trouble now, Arthit.

207
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,280
It’s just the first round, isn’t it?

208
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,600
There’s also an interview round.

209
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,040
I don’t think he gets through this round.

210
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,320
Now, all of the contestants, either Star or Moon representatives,

211
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,120
must show their skills in answering the questions from our judges.

212
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,320
Let’s start with the Faculty of Science.

213
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,680
Please pick an envelope.

214
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,320
And the last question is for the Faculty of Engineering.

215
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,040
That’s Nong Kongpob.

216
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,720
Please pick an envelope.

217
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,200
It’s the question No. 3

218
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,200
Could I have the question from the judges?

219
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
For this question,

220
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,600
What is your view on the SOTUS systems that are still being used nowadays?

221
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,760
Do you think it should be called off already? And why?

222
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,280
For this question,

223
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,720
What is your view on the SOTUS systems that are still being used nowadays?

224
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,680
Do you think it should be called off already? And why?

225
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,360
I think…

226
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,440
all the systems in the world have pros and cons in them.

227
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,280
So the SOTUS system has pros as well.

228
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,120
SOTUS has taught us to have the unity among us.

229
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,760
Since we have different backgrounds and come from different schools.

230
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,840
This system can draw the common points we have the easiest and the fastest

231
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,760
But if the system controllers are not able to manage this system well enough,

232
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,320
or use the measures that are too extreme.

233
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,960
The freshmen may reject to cooperate

234
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,000
and find it hard to respect the seniors.

235
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,880
It could lead to a severe disagreement between the two parties in the end

236
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,000
Therefore, I don’t think I can give you the answer

237
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,200
whether the SOTUS system should be continued

238
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,960
or called off.

239
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,200
Because it depends on the purposes of the users.

240
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,320
But there’s one thing I can confirm…

241
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,760
as I’m also one of the freshmen who is going through these hazing activities

242
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,560
Although the seniors opt to use the SOTUS system on us,

243
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I believe that they have reasons for every action.

244
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,880
And one of the reasons is that the seniors want us, the first-year students,

245
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,080
to be able to lead the university life…

246
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,880
as effective as we can.

247
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,520
Thank you.

248
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,520
Thank you Nong Kongpob.

249
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,720
And that’s his answer.

250
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Where are you going?

251
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,000
I’ll be right back.

252
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,400
The Popular Vote Prize.

253
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,320
The winner has received the most Likes on Facebook, which is 4,957 likes.

254
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,400
And the Popular Vote Prize goes to…

255
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,160
Who would it be?

256
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,160
Nong Kongpob Sutthirak!

257
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,040
Congratulations.

258
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,560
Please come out and take the sash for the popular vote prize this year.

259
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,400
Hey, if Kongpob wins the popular vote prize.

260
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,280
He won’t get to be crowned as this year University’s Moon

261
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,640
Why?

262
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,440
No one ever wins both prizes in this contest before.

263
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,400
Now is the moment you have been waiting for…

264
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:27,520
The 2016 University’s Star goes to…

265
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,120
Who should it be?

266
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,600
Miss Praepailin Putthiaksorn from the Faculty of Engineering.

267
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,960
Congratulations.

268
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,880
And this is the face of this year University’s Star.

269
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,760
She will be crowned as ‘Freshy Girl

270
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,320
Isn’t she lovely?

271
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,720
Please give her a round of applause.

272
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,480
and the male contestant who will be crowned as

273
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,040
the 2016 University’s Moon is…

274
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,120
Mr. Kongpob Sutthirak from the Faculty of Engineering.

275
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,880
Nong Kongpob, that’s your name.

276
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,160
He’s probably so shocked that he forgot his name.

277
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,080
Congratulations.

278
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,760
And this is the University’s Moon  winner of the year 2016.

279
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Congratulations to Nong Kongpob once again.

280
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,800
Are you happy with the results?

281
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,640
We should now let them have a rest at the backstage.

282
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,800
Congratulations to this year Star & Moon winners!

283
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,720
Let’s give them a big round of applause.

284
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
Congratulations to both of you.

285
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,200
I’m so happy, you know?

286
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
You are so great out there.

287
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,120
Oh my goodness.

288
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,560
Let’s have a picture.

289
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,680
Can I be in the frame too?

290
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,600
Wow, I can get to take a picture too.

291
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,000
Stand in the middle.

292
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,960
Next.

293
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,280
Please excuse me for a minute.

294
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,680
Are you leaving?

295
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,920
He probably has something to do.

296
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,560
Take a picture with our University’s Star first.

297
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,760
P’Arthit

298
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,720
I won already

299
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,040
Yeah, I know.

300
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
Just tell me what you want.

301
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,240
Then I want to…

302
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,160
I want to save it for later.

303
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,600
When I have something I want from you, I’ll let you know.

304
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
What the hell?

305
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,160
Why putting it off?

306
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,960
Just tell me what you want now.

307
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,080
What do you think about the song?

308
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,440
This song?

309
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,800
It’s not bad I think. I used to hear it occasionally.

310
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,520
No, I mean the song I sang.

311
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,160
It’s absurd.

312
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,280
We are from the Student’s Association.

313
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,120
Can we have an interview with you?

314
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,360
How do you feel about winning the Popular Vote

315
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,080
and being crowned as this year University’s Moon?

316
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,840
Well, it’s not bad.

317
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,840
Why is it just not bad?

318
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,800
You are the Moon that gets to be with all the stars in the sky.

319
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,280
But I think

320
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,440
there are not only the moon and the stars in the sky.

321
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,840
What else is there?

322
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,760
It’s a secret

323
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,600
Please excuse me.

324
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,080
See you, man.

325
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,040
Hey, are you going to eat with Prem?

326
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,840
Nah, I don’t think so.

327
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,520
I should go to bed early…

328
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,280
better save the strength for tomorrow.

329
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,160
See you.

330
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,520
Hey, Knot.

331
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,720
Thanks a lot.

332
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,920
for what?

333
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,800
For talking the teachers into having me resumed the position.

334
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,960
It’s me who should thank you.

335
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,440
You took all the responsibilities for us.

336
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,040
And not just me,

337
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,680
Prem, Bright, and Tuta feels the same too.

338
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,640
We have made a pact that we will get through this together.

339
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,640
And beautiful voice too.

340
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,160
Yes

341
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,600
and the face is sweet.

342
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Well answer and problem-solving skills are remarkable.

343
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,640
Wait a minute.

344
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,360
Are we still talking about Prae?

345
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Yeah.

346
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,040
Who else could it be?

347
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,360
I thought you mean the other contestant.

348
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,960
Are you crazy?

349
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
I’m talking about Prae.

350
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,480
Hey,

351
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,480
You stare at her for too long.

352
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,960
You could get her pregnant, you know?

353
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,320
She’s a human not a goldfish

354
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,040
Goldfish, my ass.

355
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
It’s fighting fish.

356
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,760
Yeah, fighting fish.

357
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,040
I’m going to say hi to those girls.

358
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,680
Are you coming?

359
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
Nah, go ahead. I’ll stay here.

360
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,800
Why?

361
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,040
Are you chicken out?

362
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,680
No.

363
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,880
I just don’t know what to talk to them.

364
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,720
We can just say hi.

365
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,120
May, Kongpob is standing there by himself.

366
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,280
Why don’t you go congratulate him?

367
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Come on.

368
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,040
Go to him

369
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,360
Is it too late to ask for your autograph?

370
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,880
Come on. Don’t think too highly of me.

371
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,240
Our grandstand won the prize because of your works too.

372
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,760
Of course!

373
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,160
Our engineering faculty is so cool.

374
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,360
It’s not surprising because we are all smart people, right?

375
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,960
I should go to Kong.

376
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,880
Don’t you see that he’s with May.

377
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,200
What? We are all friends.

378
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,520
Come on.

379
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,040
Okay, if you say so.

380
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,520
May I cut in?

381
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,040
I would like to congratulate Kong.

382
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,080
He’s really not in this just for fun.

383
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,760
Me, #TeamKONGPOB

384
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,360
You are also exaggerating.

385
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,280
We won because of everyone’s help.

386
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,600
And one more thing,

387
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,720
We won the grandstand prize because of May.

388
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,920
This friend of mine is not just pretty but also full of talent.

389
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,240
She’s not in this just for fun.

390
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,440
Me #TeamMAY

391
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,280
And M is also amazing.

392
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,880
He led the basketball team to become the champion.

393
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,880
I saw him score many points.

394
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,320
Then, I will have #TeamM

395
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,880
Wait a minute.

396
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,320
You all have your own hashtag.

397
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,640
What about me?

398
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,600
No?

399
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Do you hear someone saying something?

400
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,480
You have friends, that’s good enough.

401
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,600
Hey, I think I should get back to my table.

402
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,160
I’ve left my friends for too long.

403
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,560
Do you mind if I join your table too?

404
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,880
Not at all. The more the better.

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,120
Good. Can I join too?

406
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,800
But I have to go the restroom first.

407
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,760
See you later.

408
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,480
You jackass, you don’t let the chance pass, do you?

409
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,160
Are you back?

410
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,440
Any progress between you and him?

411
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,120
Stop teasing me.

412
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,920
Are you serious?

413
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,240
Knock it off.

414
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,240
Sit down.

415
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,640
Have this too. You can finish them all.

416
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,480
I need to go to the restroom.

417
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,920
Hey, M.

418
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,040
Do you mind accompanying her?

419
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,360
It’s all right.

420
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
I’m good.

421
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
I don’t mind. I want to go too.

422
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,640
Go now.

423
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,040
Do you want to come too?

424
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,160
Don’t go. Eat this. Eat them all.

425
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,040
Hey, M.

426
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,520
Have you been a friend with Kong since high school?

427
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,200
I have been a friend with him since Junior High.

428
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,960
But he has a lot of friends.

429
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,760
He’s good at academics and sports.

430
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,360
He excels in everything actually.

431
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,040
Are you praising him too much?

432
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,720
You are not bad yourself.

433
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
You have a big body. You could get the ball into the hoop many times.

434
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,200
You also rebounded and assist your team a lot.

435
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,120
I used to be a slim person

436
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,240
but I got bullied often.

437
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,920
So my father bought me a fitness course.

438
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,800
I became bigger after that.

439
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,440
I see.

440
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,000
By the way, since when you were close to Kong?

441
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,480
When I was in Grade 10, I competed in a riddle competition.

442
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,960
I got the second place because the winner cheated.

443
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,880
Kong then protested to the judges for me.

444
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,360
So I got the first prize instead.

445
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,120
If it was not for him, I would not get it.

446
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,240
So Kong always stands up for his friends.

447
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,120
I and him became close friends since then.

448
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,080
Uh…M

449
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,720
What?

450
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,440
Does Kong have someone he likes?

451
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,480
Well…

452
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,440
I don’t see that he has anyone yet.

453
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,200
Hold on. Wait for me.

454
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,760
This one is very good.

455
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,040
Oak, open your mouth.

456
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
Come on. I won’t miss it this time.

457
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,240
M.

458
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,080
What’s wrong with you?

459
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,440
Nothing.

460
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,560
I’m just drowsy.

461
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,720
Come on, guys.

462
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Let’s make a toast for our victory.

463
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,240
Cheers!

464
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,680
Hey, guys.

465
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,760
Listen to this.

466
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,480
Someone is writing about us on the university’s message board.

467
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,600
I don’t think those senior hazers dare to give us a hard time now

468
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,120
I’m sure on this.

469
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,160
Trust me.

470
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:06,200
45 46 47 48 49

471
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,280
Enough!

472
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,760
You have been participating this activity for too many times.

473
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,640
Why can’t you do this harmoniously without us repeatedly telling you what to do?

474
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,240
I heard that

475
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,720
you, the first years,

476
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,960
thought that you did well already

477
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,240
so you didn’t bother to listen to us, your seniors?

478
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,320
Some people post comments on their Facebook

479
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,480
and even post a thread on the university’s message board.

480
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,840
You don’t think we know that you bash us behind our back in there?

481
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,160
Are these the acts from the intellectual?

482
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,200
You are nothing but a troll.

483
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
You don’t respect your seniors.

484
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,920
Oak, didn’t you say they would not give us a hard time anymore.

485
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,520
Be silent!

486
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,440
While I’m talking,

487
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,960
who gives you permission to speak?

488
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,560
Why?

489
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,440
50 times is too easy, right?

490
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,080
Then, I order you to sit and stand 100 times. Go!

491
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,440
Sit and stand 100 times. Go.

492
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,920
1 2 3

493
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,080
Everyone, stop!

494
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,280
These are your fourth-year seniors.

495
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,360
Everyone, pay respect!

496
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,400
Sawasdee ka/krup.

497
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,480
Everyone, sit down.

498
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,560
First of all, I would like to applaud all of the first years

499
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,600
for your remarkable performance during the Freshy Day events.

500
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,040
You are all marvelous.

501
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,920
But for all of you, the third years.

502
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,840
I’m not certain that you are as good as these first years.

503
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,320
Someone told me that the third year seniors…

504
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,680
had been punishing the first years inappropriately.

505
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,160
They were ordered to run for a line up,

506
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,640
squat jumps, push up,

507
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,400
and run around the field 54 laps.

508
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,440
Who’s the head of the hazing crew?!

509
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,280
It’s me, sir.

510
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,640
Tell me your reasons of punishing these first-year students.

511
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,120
I punish them so that they stay disciplined and learn to have responsibility.

512
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,800
As a ruler

513
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,400
it means you can perform all of those punishments as well, right?

514
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,720
Yes, sir.

515
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,600
Can I ask you all to demonstrate all those punishments in front of me and these juniors?

516
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,360
GO!

517
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,120
All of the hazing staff,

518
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,720
sit and stand 100 times

519
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,240
push up 100 times,

520
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,160
And squat jump 100 times

521
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,680
and me as the head of the hazing crew,

522
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,040
I will run around the field 54 laps.

523
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,360
Everyone!

524
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,880
Push up 100 times.

525
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,920
Go!

526
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,160
1 2 3 4…

527
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
All of us have completed those punishments.

528
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,880
Now I ask for permission to run around the field for 54 laps
