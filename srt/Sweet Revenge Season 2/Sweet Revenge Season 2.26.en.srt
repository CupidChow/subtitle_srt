~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:35,074
Okay.

5
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:38,397
Take care of your leg.

6
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:40,698
See you tomorrow.

7
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:42,212
Bye.

8
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,696
Was that Geum Su Ji from your class?

9
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:49,510
Yes.

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,110
Why are you suddenly so close with her?

11
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:56,767
Do you like her?

12
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:57,817
No!

13
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:00,069
Then why are you taking care of her?

14
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,622
It's weird.

15
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:04,113
She got hurt because of me.

16
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:08,027
If it wasn't for her, I could have gotten hurt.

17
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,180
So I'm just helping her out.

18
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,692
Excuse me?

19
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:25,275
You're late.

20
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:28,017
Pardon?

21
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:30,219
Sit.

22
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,900
Sit!

23
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:38,397
You act strongly on the outside, but you're frail and lonely, aren't you?

24
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:40,409
Yes, that's right.

25
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,563
You're good at dolling up, but at home, you're a slob.

26
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:47,047
Oh my. How did you know?

27
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:49,338
Let's see here.

28
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:51,651
I see it all.

29
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:54,675
So you have two nieces.

30
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:57,166
Oh my.

31
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,389
Yes, that's right.

32
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:01,481
Let's see here.

33
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,664
Let's see here. I see it all.

34
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:08,618
You run a café, don't you?

35
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,369
That's amazing!

36
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:11,801
How did you know that?

37
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,673
I see it all!

38
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:17,847
Let's see here.

39
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,490
I see it all.

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,812
xNiecestagram, my first niece, my second niece.

41

xDon't forget your auntie. ~ Revenge Note 2 ~

42
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:30,450
If only I could turn back time, I feel like I could do anything.

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,422
Love is dead.

44
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:37,927
You were dumped recently.

45
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:42,062
You thought if only you could turn back time, you could do anything.

46
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,124
Yes, that's right.

47
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:49,528
You don't have an eye for men.

48
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:51,762
If you had married early, you'd be divorced by now.

49
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,263
Do you think...

50
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:55,726
I can get married?

51
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:57,137
Why not? You've met him already.

52
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:59,019
What?

53
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,890
I've met my husband already?

54
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,494
Who is he? How old is he?

55
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:05,876
Where does he live?

56
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:09,990
I see it all. He's roaming around.

57
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,241
He keeps roaming around.

58
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:14,073
Roaming?

59
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:16,465
Is he someone who travels a lot?

60
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,278
I see it all.

61
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:27,297
I see that he has a certification from the government.

62
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:29,267
The government?

63
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:30,820
Certification?

64
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:35,383
Could he be a doctor? Or a lawyer?

65
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,141
- And...
- Yes?

66
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:45,214
If you meet this man, you must never

67
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:51,741
feed him chicken wings. If you do, he'll cheat on you.

68
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:53,474
Go on.

69
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:55,364
- Go on.
- That's it?

70
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,766
Next, please.

71
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,527
I need to give this back to him.

72
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:26,475
Sorry to make you wait.

73
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:29,919
No, not at all.

74
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,542
Well,

75
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,314
I have something to tell you today.

76
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,238
I'm hungry.

77
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,740
Should we get something to eat first?

78
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,224
Okay.

79
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,473
Ro Bin, what should we have?

80
00:04:58,387 --> 00:05:01,390
What do you like? How about this?

81
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,873
What about this?

82
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,883
Anything is fine.

83
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,940
Should we go somewhere else?

84
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,613
No.

85
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,074
This place has good food.

86
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:16,836
Let's sit over there.

87
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:33,200
♫ The day that you briefly passed me by ♫

88
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,390
♫ I was quietly walking ♫

89
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,494
What's this? You guys are on a date too?

90
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:47,255
I guess you're really a couple.

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:59,970
♫ Was it from that day? Was it since then? ♫

92
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:07,370
♫ I mean the day I started to yarn for you ♫

93
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,490
♫ Was it from that moment? ♫

94
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,573
Hey, Je Yi.

95
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,313
Do you know

96
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:18,738
if something happened between Ro Bin and Su Ji?

97
00:06:18,738 --> 00:06:21,552
They weren't this close, but now they're always together.

98
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:23,542
I just wondered if something happened.

99
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:26,696
She got hurt because of me.

100
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:30,269
If it wasn't for her, I could have gotten hurt.

101
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,524
I'm not sure myself.

102
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:36,505
I haven't heard anything.

103
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,488
I see.

104
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,263
Sorry, Ro Bin.

105
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:46,485
I'm going to break the rules this time.

106
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,684
This looks good.

107
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:00,220
Ro Bin, try this. Open wide.

108
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,131
I'll eat it myself.

109
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:15,124
Enjoy.

110
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:17,126
Thanks.

111
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,104
Ji Na, wait a minute.

112
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:53,794
There we go.

113
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,834
You had something on your face.

114
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:59,638
Thanks.

115
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,838
I need to go to the bathroom.

116
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,639
Okay.

117
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:26,115
I said I'll take you home. Come on. Let's go together.

118
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:29,008
I'm fine. You go ahead.

119
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:48,327
Su Ji got hurt because of me.

120
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,872
So I'm just helping her out. Don't get the wrong idea.

121
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:55,804
You don't need to explain the whole situation to me like that.

122
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:59,609
But even then, you two look a bit too close for comfort.

123
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:02,421
You get her water and tie her shoelaces for her.

124
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:04,635
Why didn't you just feed her her pizza?

125
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:06,757
What about you?

126
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:09,409
You looked real close with Je Yi earlier.

127
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,363
I need to stay up rewriting my contest submission.

128
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,516
If you're done talking, I'm going to go now.

129
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,358
Je Yi, let's go.

130
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,634
He submitted an acrostic poem for the writing contest.

131
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,869
It's an acrostic poem about Go Jin Sang.

132
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:04,403
Isn't that the principal's name?

133
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,456
I'll give you the letters.

134
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:07,867
Go...

135
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,100
"Jin Sang is..."

136
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,052
- Jin...
- "...just a tyrant,"

137
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:17,696
- Sang.
- "such a major tyrant."

138
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:25,004
Seo Ro Bin, you little...

139
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,955
He's pretty witty.

140
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:31,551
Why am I so itchy?

141
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,584
There's one here about you too, Ms. Jeong.

142
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,707
Me? Really?

143
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:38,898
"Jeong..."

144
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:41,521
"Just curious, but..."

145
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:43,753
What could it be? "Jeong..."

146
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,755
"Just really curious, but..."

147
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:50,359
- "Ah..."
- "Are you a young lady or old woman?"

148
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,364
Who wrote that one?

149
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,035
It was An Mi Nam.

150
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,036
Zero points.

151
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:02,873
Oh Ji Na from Class One wrote a very good submission.

152
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:05,424
I was going to take some marks off because she submitted it late at night.

153
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:08,297
But the plot is clever and it's written well.

154
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:12,281
It must be a good submission if the Korean teacher says so.

155
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:18,789
What?

156
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:20,500
Wait.

157
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,241
Come look at this.

158
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:28,147
How could these be so similar?

159
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,282
It was a romance that should never have begun.

160
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:34,954
Those little...

161
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:37,245
This is too obvious.

162
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:41,831
Title: Joseon Love Letter

163
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,404
"Joseon Love Letter.

164
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,355
On the morning that Dad left,

165
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:49,258
Mom received a letter.

166
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,011
It was on a faded piece of Korean paper.

167
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,805
Mom said it was a love letter given to her by her lover

168
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,177
500 years ago."

169
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:59,228
My goodness, this is well-written.

170
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:03,464
It's a literary work of art. Amazing.

171
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,775
Thank you.

172
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,818
But the problem is

173
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:10,941
that there are two of the exact same thing here.

174
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:13,282
Geum Su Ji, Oh Ji Na,

175
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:17,687
how could your writing submissions be so similar?

176
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:21,501
- Excuse me?
- What? That's not possible.

177
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:24,953
Which one of you plagiarized?

178
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:30,259
Even when you go down to the police station,

179
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,303
if you self-confess, they go easy on you.

180
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,747
You should be honest with me.

181
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:38,468
It's not too late.

182
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:41,180
Pardon? I really was the one who wrote it.

183
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,103
I didn't look at anyone else's work.

184
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:45,685
Then how could you and Su Ji write

185
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:48,147
the exact same story?

186
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:51,612
If you didn't copy hers, how did this happen?

187
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:52,882
Principal,

188
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:55,866
you must be impartial and talk to both students fairly.

189
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,578
Ms. Maeng, can't you tell?

190
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,701
Su Ji submitted hers at 7 p.m.,

191
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,993
and Ji Na submitted hers at 3 a.m.

192
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,748
Come on. It's common sense.

193
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:11,520
The one who turned it in later is the plagiarist. Don't you agree?

194
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,594
Wow, Oh Ji Na, you really are something else.

195
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,965
I'm speechless.

196
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:20,600
Principal, I really had no idea what Su Ji wrote.

197
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,854
Last year, I wrote that in my diary, hoping that my parents would get back together.

198
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:27,567
And I rewrote that diary entry to submit for the contest.

199
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:30,920
Really? Then where's that diary now?

200
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:35,475
The thing is that I lost that diary.

201
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:39,027
I can't believe it. What's with her?

202
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,771
Oh Ji Na.

203
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:45,124
Don't you agree that your own story is a bit suspicious?

204
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,497
This is also another form of stealing.

205
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:50,070
As for plagiarizing,

206
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,572
it's a form of stealing

207
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:54,343
someone else's intellectual property.

208
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:58,156
I really didn't plagiarize. I really did write this.

209
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,492
Geum Su Ji, go back to your classroom.

210
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:08,126
Oh Ji Na, we need to talk more about this.

211
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:15,574
Yes, Principal. Excuse me.

212
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:30,039
I heard Ji Na and Su Ji's entries were exactly the same.

213
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,752
They're investigating it and everything.

214
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:35,635
I can't believe her.

215
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:39,639
Is she an idiot? She even copied my title word for word.

216
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,663
My gosh. Ji Na copied your work, even down to the title?

217
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,345
That's too much.

218
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,917
Oh Ji Na is a complete idiot.

219
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:49,218
But when I think about it,

220
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:52,753
were you ever really a good writer?

221
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:55,414
Just eat your bread.

222
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:58,658
Hey, Geum Su Ji. Ji Na's not that kind of girl.

223
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:01,341
Are you sure you weren't the one to copy Ji Na's work?

224
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:05,164
If you don't know anything, just stay quiet.

225
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:07,416
I submitted mine at 7 p.m.,

226
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,289
and Ji Na submitted hers the next morning.

227
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,542
Isn't it obvious who copied whom?

228
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:16,736
You could have seen Ji Na's work before that.

229
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:19,969
Don't take her side just because you're friends.

230
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:24,504
It's going to be clear soon who was the plagiarist.

231
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,586
First Place: Geum Su Ji, Class One

232
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,769
Disciplinary action, Oh ** **

233
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,541
School service for cheating

234
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,411
The results are already out.

235
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:34,925
Su Ji got first place

236
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:38,047
and Ji Na's getting disciplinary action.

237
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,631
So Ji Na really did plagiarize?

238
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,132
I can't believe it.

239
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,993
Maybe she was tempted by the school record points.

240
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,005
I'm disappointed in Oh Ji Na.

241
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:49,849
Plagiarist Ji Na.

242
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,412
How's your new nickname?

243
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:54,063
Geum Su Ji.

244
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:57,256
I swear that I've never seen your work.

245
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,420
But I get accused for plagiarizing and even got in trouble.

246
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,511
So what?

247
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:04,383
That means one of us is lying

248
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:07,036
and it's not me. So it must be you.

249
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:09,059
Be honest and tell the truth!

250
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,000
What truth is there to be told?

251
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,702
Let go. I said let go.

252
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:18,418
You're the one who got yourself into this mess. Why are you blaming me?

253
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,421
It hurts.

254
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:25,364
Hey, what are you doing to someone who got hurt?

255
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,717
She just doesn't care anymore, does she?

256
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:30,259
Su Ji, are you okay?

257
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,982
Oh Ji Na, you have lost your mind.

258
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,840
She's shameless.

259
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,380
What's with her?

260
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,784
Do you really think Ji Na would do that?

261
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:48,337
Let's go. I can't believe Ji Na's doing that to an injured person.

262
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:49,569
Come on.

263
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,270
I knew Ji Na was like that.

264
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,353
- What's with her?
- Let's just go.

265
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:55,425
I still can't believe it.

266
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:01,920
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

267
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,405
This isn't fair.

268
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:07,686
This isn't right.

269
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,791
Enter target's name

270
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,956
Then how could you and Su Ji write the exact same story?

271
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:17,146
I really didn't plagiarize.

272
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:19,289
x- I really did write this.
- Gosh.

273
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,922
I submitted mine at 7 p.m.,

274
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,424
and Oh Ji Na submitted hers the next morning.

275
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:27,427
Enter target's name
Geum Su Ji

276
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:29,559
Plagiarist Ji Na.

277
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,724
You're the one who got yourself into this mess. Why are you blaming me?

278
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:36,795
Target meets all conditions.
We will proceed with the revenge.

279
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:47,877
Su Ji, you must be in a lot of pain.

280
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:49,850
What's with Oh Ji Na?

281
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,591
I know, right?

282
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:55,054
- Let's go.
- Okay.

283
00:17:57,336 --> 00:18:00,590
Ji Na didn't even eat lunch. Where did she go?

284
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,892
Ji Na wouldn't do that.

285
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:06,596
How do you think Su Ji stole Ji Na's work?

286
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:10,349
Good question. I am 100% sure that it was her.

287
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:13,223
But there's no evidence.

288
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:17,317
What if this all just passes without the truth being revealed?

289
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:23,774
You have been selected as a revenge target.

290
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:28,818
"Revenge"?

291
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:31,281
You have been selected as a revenge target.

292
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:33,102
What is this? How annoying.

293
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,075
Let's go and have fun.

294
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,227
- Let's go!
- Let's have a good time.

295
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:38,479
Oh no!

296
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,469
I'm so sorry.

297
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:46,525
Are you all right?

298
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,048
Why did you ruin my cheating?

299
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:49,719
Why won't this turn off?

300
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:53,222
- Why did you ruin my cheating?
- This is shocking.

301
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:56,586
Why are you turning it off? It's quite entertaining.

302
00:18:56,586 --> 00:19:00,379
I had a stroke of bad luck the last time I got this text. It came again?

303
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:02,191
You have been selected as a revenge target.

304
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:07,717
Could Oh Ji Na have something to do with this?

305
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,636
That's right. Even last time,

306
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:20,909
I got this text after I got involved with Ji Na.

307
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:31,210
Why is she looking so hard for that diary?

308
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,054
Why is she making me go all the way to Mom's office to look for it? Gosh.

309
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:35,755
Oh Ji Na, you little...

310
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:39,088
Hi, Sa Na.

311
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:41,061
What's wrong? Did something happen?

312
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:44,354
Oppa Je Yi, what's wrong with Ji Na?

313
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:46,375
Did something happen at school?

314
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,838
She was grumpy at me the moment she got home.

315
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:50,950
She's acting really weird.

316
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,366
Some stuff went down at school today.

317
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:59,729
She was accused of plagiarizing her writing contest entry.

318
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,963
She's not the type to do that, so it'll get solved in no time.

319
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:05,545
I see.

320
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:09,298
My eonni would always write stuff down in her diary.

321
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,301
She wrote her submission in that diary before.

322
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:14,875
She's the type to write everything down.

323
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,476
If only she had that, everything would be solved.

324
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:20,140
I need to go search my mom's office and the convenience store.

325
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,280
I'll see you later.

326
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:52,301
I found it. Please help so no one will be wronged.

327
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,697
- Hello.
- Hello.

328
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:00,810
Hello.

329
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,172
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

330
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:12,152
I found it. Please help so no one will be wronged.

331
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,940
Joseon Love Letter

332
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,832
She wrote this a year ago.

333
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:26,316
The contents are

334
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:28,778
basically the same.

335
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:30,921
But

336
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:35,344
it's going to be hard to prove with just this as the evidence.

337
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,757
Wait a minute.

338
00:21:36,757 --> 00:21:39,889
This came up on the school forum. Come take a look.

339
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,731
What is it?

340
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:59,730
Oh my. Geum Su Ji...

341
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,052
What was she thinking? Why would she do that?

342
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,280
Geum Su Ji, you little...

343
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,465
She even deceived her teachers.

344
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,817
Where is Geum Su Ji?

345
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:21,951
Thank you for dealing with Su Ji's predicament

346
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:23,814
so quickly for her.

347
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:29,147
It's no problem. I just did my duty fairly.

348
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,533
Gosh. How could that girl be so shameless?

349
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:33,693
Gosh.

350
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:35,716
Please make sure she gets punished.

351
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:38,367
Do not worry.

352
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:42,242
As for Su Ji,

353
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:45,395
she's not just pretty,

354
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:48,027
but she's an excellent writer.

355
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:59,479
- Hey.
- What are you looking at?

356
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,161
Hurry up.

357
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:05,145
I don't like this.

358
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:07,135
I'm lazy.

359
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:11,852
- Let's start.
- I'll go first.

360
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:16,135
What does this mean?

361
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:17,718
What is that?

362
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:19,410
It's...

363
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,161
If you use it like this...

364
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:27,706
What's that noise?

365
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:30,299
Is there a fire?

366
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,672
Wait a minute. A fire?

367
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,675
- It's a fire!
- Let's run!

368
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:36,547
Oh my!

369
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,968
What happened to "ladies first"? I'm a lady!

370
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:41,131
I'm turning 60 soon!

371
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:42,342
What happened to "elders first"?

372
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:44,263
You old geezer!

373
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:45,975
- Out of my way!
- Oh my!

374
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:47,376
You're insane!

375
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:48,838
- What's going on?
- What's that?

376
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:50,590
- What's that?
- It's a fire!

377
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,152
- Let's get out!
- Let's go!

378
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:10,389
Ji Na, are you okay?

379
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:27,097
I'm okay.

380
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:28,739
Let's get out.

381
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:31,680
The fire alarm just now was a false alarm.

382
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,224
Students, please remain calm and return to your classes.

383
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,098
The fire alarm just now was a false alarm.

384
00:24:38,098 --> 00:24:42,102
Students, please remain calm and return to your classes.

385
00:24:42,102 --> 00:24:43,392
My goodness!

386
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:46,146
Principal...

387
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:50,561
For someone who's turning 60, you sure don't push like one.

388
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,851
Oh my. My new bag!

389
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:54,724
I can't believe him.

390
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,488
Goodbye! I can't believe that man.

391
00:24:58,488 --> 00:24:59,980
My goodness!

392
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,712
You think you're perfect?

393
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:03,212
Gosh.

394
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:05,665
How could that woman be so strong?

395
00:25:05,665 --> 00:25:09,419
You could take down an ox with that strength!

396
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,760
Gosh.

397
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,873
- What was that?
- That was lame.

398
00:25:12,873 --> 00:25:14,424
- I'm relieved, though.
- I was so scared.

399
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,126
I thought I was going to die.

400
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:17,467
I was so shocked.

401
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:18,799
We came out for nothing.

402
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,519
This is so lame.

403
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,782
I got scared for nothing.

404
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:25,355
Hey, Geum Su Ji, what's with you?

405
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:28,217
Did you lie about your leg injury?

406
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:31,742
That's right. She ran out of the classroom so fast.

407
00:25:31,742 --> 00:25:33,053
Seriously?

408
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:36,016
So all of that was just for show?

409
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:38,358
No, that's not it.

410
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:41,230
I thought you got hurt because of me and I helped you.

411
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,704
But you weren't even injured?

412
00:25:43,704 --> 00:25:47,918
So that's why Ro Bin has been sticking close to Su Ji recently.

413
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:50,660
You really are the worst, aren't you?

414
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,892
No. Earlier, I...

415
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:55,586
I ran because of the adrenaline rush.

416
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:56,937
Oh, it hurts.

417
00:25:56,937 --> 00:25:59,618
Su Ji, wrong leg.

418
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,271
Oh, it hurts.

419
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,144
It hurts...

420
00:26:08,077 --> 00:26:10,389
It hurts...

421
00:26:22,162 --> 00:26:26,334
It was a false alarm. You can stop holding hands now.

422
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,654
Ji Na, are you okay?

423
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:44,414
What is wrong with me?

424
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:48,778
It feels like my heart is going to beat out of my chest.

425
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:56,886
What's with you two? Something looks fishy.

426
00:26:56,886 --> 00:26:58,758
Fishy? What are you talking about?

427
00:26:58,758 --> 00:27:01,050
You're blushing.

428
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:06,646
Where's Mi Nam?

429
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:32,611
Geum Su Ji.

430
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:38,639
This is Ji Na's diary from a year ago.

431
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:40,819
Read it out loud.

432
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:46,806
"Joseon Love Letter.

433
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:51,551
On the morning that Dad left, Mom received a letter.

434
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:53,331
It was on a faded piece..."

435
00:27:56,786 --> 00:28:00,911
Oh Ji Na totally rushed to make this to defend herself.

436
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:03,933
Oh Ji Na is so sneaky.

437
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,897
Then how can you explain this?

438
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:19,319
That wasn't me. This is manipulated footage.

439
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,872
Su Ji, just admit your wrongdoing.

440
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:25,174
I didn't do it. It wasn't me!

441
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:29,078
Where do you think you're going?

442
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:33,723
Oh my. Hey.

443
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:40,600
What?

444
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:47,387
What's going on?

445
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:49,759
I think you need to see this.

446
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:56,826
Notice of Disciplinary Action

447
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:00,589
"Principal Go Jin Sang was

448
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:03,492
biased and unfair during the plagiarism incident

449
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,726
that occurred on school grounds.

450
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:07,728
On the grounds of attacking a student's character,

451
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:09,880
the Board of Disciplinary Action has sent this notice."

452
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,522
Are they crazy?

453
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:15,304
Wait a minute.

454
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:18,607
I can't be under disciplinary action.

455
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:22,911
I won't be able to get the position of education superintendent.

456
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:25,995
Gosh!

457
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:29,038
I'm going to find out who ratted me out!

458
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:51,841
Your revenge is complete.

459
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:56,735
Revenge Note helped me out this time as well.

460
00:29:57,707 --> 00:30:01,821
What if I end up relying on it for all my troubles?

461
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:06,905
But... who could have brought my diary?

462
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:11,511
Ms. Maeng, how did you find it?

463
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:13,774
It was just on my desk.

464
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:17,727
It had a note from someone saying that they randomly found it.

465
00:30:17,727 --> 00:30:21,201
I found it. Please help so no one will be wronged.

466
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:35,674
Hey, Je Yi.

467
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:40,489
Take this.

468
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:45,345
I like you only

469
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,746
as a friend.

470
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:52,991
I want to continue just being friends.

471
00:31:05,145 --> 00:31:09,599
I'm a little sad that you're returning this to me.

472
00:31:11,732 --> 00:31:14,104
Sorry. Thank you.

473
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,558
- Ji Na!
- Ji Na!

474
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:19,399
Hurry up! Let's go to the store!

475
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,060
Okay.

476
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:25,215
I'll get going.

477
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:44,420
♫ The day that you briefly passed me by ♫

478
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:51,640
♫ On that day, I was just walking ♫

479
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,790
♫ silently ♫

480
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,865
But...

481
00:31:56,865 --> 00:32:00,989
I don't think I can give up like this.

482
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,354
Ji Na...

483
00:32:04,354 --> 00:32:11,470
♫ I follow your gaze without realizing it ♫

484
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:18,900
♫ I can hear how you feel ♫

485
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:27,340
♫ I am following you without realizing it ♫

486
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:30,366
Epilogue
Where is it?

487
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:40,640
♫ I follow your gaze without realizing it ♫

488
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,351
♫ I can hear how you feel ♫

489
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:47,173
Something just fell.

490
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:54,870
♫ I follow you without realizing it ♫

491
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:57,812
Here it is.

00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:05,241
Joseon Love Letter

493
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:10,576
What a relief.
