~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,471 --> 00:00:04,173
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:32,993
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:40,811
I don't see her anywhere.

5
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:43,702
I know, right? I don't think she's in this neighborhood.

6
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:46,716
Where's Oh Ji Na?

7
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:49,259
Wasn't she with you two?

8
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,090
I thought she was with you.

9
00:00:57,477 --> 00:00:59,549
She's not picking up.

10
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,693
She's not a child. You don't need to make a fuss.

11
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:06,155
A friend disappeared. Aren't you worried?

12
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:08,908
Don't worry. She'll be back soon.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,850
It looks like it's going to rain.

14
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,875
Then let's look for Ji Na first.

15
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,137
- Yes.
- Let's do that.

16
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,292
Excuse me, Hyeong...

17
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:26,636
- You are...
- I saw the big-eyed girl.

18
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:28,647
She was headed into the hills.

19
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:30,180
Really?

20
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:36,144
Let's go look for her in the hills.

21
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:39,678
Sa Na, why don't you go home in case Ji Na comes home?

22
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:41,191
Okay.

23
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,952
Ji Na!

24
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:55,664
- Oh Ji Na!
- Oh Ji Na!

25
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,278
- Ji Na!
-Oh Ji Na!

26
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,019
Oh Ji Na!

27
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,530
- Should we scatter and search?
- Okay.

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,173
I'll go this way. You can go that way.

29
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:15,945
- Let's meet back here if we find her.
- Okay.

30
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,540
Oh Ji Na!

31
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,358
Oh Ji Na!

32
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,091
Oh Ji Na!

33
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,835
Ji Na!

34
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,348
Oh Ji Na!

35
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,070
Gosh, I almost died.

36
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:44,843
That hurts.

37
00:03:57,366 --> 00:04:00,239
I think I'm totally lost.

38
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,251
What do I do?

39
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:09,049
No Service

40
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,021
Oh Ji Na!

41
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,616
Ji Na!

42
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,542
Ji Na!

43
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,956
Ji Na!

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,891
What do I do?

45
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,770
I'm so scared.

46
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:57,806
I want to go home.

47
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:02,672
Grandma... Sa Na...

48
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:09,748
Oh Ji Na!

49
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:15,194
- Ji Na!
- Ji Na!

50
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:18,297
Oh Ji Na!

51
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,970
Ji Na!

52
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,374
Ji Na!

53
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:26,885
Ji Na!

54
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:29,468
Oh Ji Na!

55
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,313
I'm over here!

56
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:33,985
Over here!

57
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:06,707
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

58
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:26,337
Don't worry.

59
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:28,060
You're all right now.

60
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,611
Let's wait here a bit.

61
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,655
We can go down when the rain stops.

62
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:52,764
Your leg is bleeding.

63
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:54,525
Are you hurt?

64
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:58,899
It must have happened when I slipped.

65
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:02,333
I forgot about the pain because I was so scared.

66
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,299
It's all right.

67
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:24,335
Why are you blushing?

68
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:26,657
Your face is redder than mine.

69
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:29,721
It's because I have a fever.

70
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:42,123
You do have a fever.

71
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:44,986
It's pretty high.

72
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:58,881
No, it's all right. You're cold too.

73
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:02,604
I'm fine. I don't feel cold at all.

74
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:13,395
Hey, stop it. You'll get hungrier if you run.

75
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,758
Ji Na!

76
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:21,592
Oh Ji Na!

77
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:25,920
Ji Na!

78
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:33,205
I want to eat my mom's spicy sujebi.
(hand-pulled dough soup)

79
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,679
I'll ask her to make you some

80
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,731
with a lot of potatoes in it.

81
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:41,502
It's really good.

82
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:46,427
What do you want to eat right now?

83
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,230
Sausage stew.

84
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,874
Did your mom make it often?

85
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:53,675
No,

86
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:56,056
but she bought it for us often.

87
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:59,951
Our parents were so busy.

88
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:02,183
They weren't home very often.

89
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:06,867
I have so much respect for you and Je Yi.

90
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,412
We're the same age,

91
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:13,845
but you two are doing well even without your parents.

92
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:17,057
Isn't it hard?

93
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,372
It's my goal to move out as soon as possible.

94
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:25,196
It's probably hard to live without a dad,

95
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,530
but you never even show it.

96
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:33,224
I really admire how you care for others.

97
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:36,388
It's nothing compared to you.

98
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,661
Okay, that's enough.

99
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:42,703
This is getting cheesy.

100
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:45,247
That's right, let's stop.

101
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:48,229
But... why did you come up here by yourself?

102
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,482
Something bad could have happened.

103
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:52,864
I came up with Geon Wu.

104
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:55,180
He said he saw Sam Sun.

105
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:59,210
But he disappeared at some point.

106
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,413
Maybe he got lost too.

107
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:06,868
Are you dumb? Why would he get lost?

108
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,663
He did this to you on purpose.

109
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,285
- No way.
- I haven't liked the look of him

110
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:16,167
since the very beginning.

111
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,291
I'll make him pay for this later.

112
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:24,135
Are you feeling cold?

113
00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:27,929
What should we do?

114
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:41,963
Do you think you can walk?

115
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:44,547
I think we need to go down now.

116
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:47,258
Yes, I feel better.

117
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:50,592
Can you...

118
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:55,928
I must be crazy.

119
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:09,191
Be careful. I don't want you to trip and fall again.

120
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,574
I'm not a clumsy person who trips all the time.

121
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:18,660
My bracelet.

122
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,121
What?

123
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,253
My bracelet is gone.

124
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:24,707
It was one of my favorites.

125
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,668
Where did you lose it?

126
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,592
- I'll look for it.
- No.

127
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:33,925
Don't worry about it. I don't even know where I lost it.

128
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:35,767
Let's just go.

129
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:43,475
Do you think Ji Na's leg will be all right?

130
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:45,527
I think she'll be all right.

131
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:48,611
Ji Na, do you feel better after showering?

132
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,533
- Yes.
- What a relief.

133
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:57,119
Sin Ae, do you know where Ro Bin is?

134
00:12:57,198 --> 00:12:58,199
Ro Bin?

135
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,914
I'm not sure. He's been gone for a while.

136
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,667
Why are you looking for Ro Bin?

137
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:08,339
It's nothing.

138
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:29,902
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

139
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:33,945
- Do what?
- You left Ji Na in the hills.

140
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:37,279
Ji Na went through so much because of you.

141
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,870
So what if I did do it on purpose?

142
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,242
She's dumb enough to get lost.

143
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:42,624
You jerk.

144
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:45,668
Ro Bin, stop it.

145
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:48,040
Why don't you hit me? Are you scared?

146
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,635
Don't even talk to him. Let's go.

147
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,264
Hey, what is this?

148
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:04,976
Give it back. It's mine.

149
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,268
This belongs to Sam Sun.

150
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,813
This is my grandma's handwriting.

151
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:14,196
I... found it.

152
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:15,657
It was on the street.

153
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:18,029
Liar.

154
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:19,911
Oh Geon Wu,

155
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:22,664
you took Sam Sun, didn't you?

156
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,667
Where is Sam Sun? Tell me now.

157
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:29,040
You got the wrong person. Did you see me take her?

158
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:34,636
Say it. Where is she?

159
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:36,338
Where is Sam Sun?

160
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,049
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

161
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,143
You'll probably never see Sam Sun again.

162
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:45,767
What?

163
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:50,191
No way.

164
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:52,153
Hey, stop right there!

165
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:07,168
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

166
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,171
Don't tell anyone, please!

167
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:12,584
I saw her in the hills.

168
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,465
Enter target's name

169
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:17,338
So what if I did do it on purpose?

170
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,841
She's dumb enough to get lost.

171
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,014
Oh Geon Wu

172
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,016
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

173
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:27,389
You'll probably never see Sam Sun again.

174
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,815
Target meets all conditions.
We will proceed with the revenge.

175
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,954
Why did you lie to her?

176
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,708
I don't know. She just gets on my nerves.

177
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:48,830
Let her struggle a bit.

178
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:55,086
You've been selected as a revenge target.

179
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:58,129
"You have been selected as a revenge target."?

180
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:00,011
What is this?

181
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:02,304
Revenge? Who's getting revenge?

182
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:04,426
I don't know. I think someone's playing around.

183
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:07,228
Are you being punished for lying, Hyeong?

184
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,747
Sam Sun, why didn't you eat?

185
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:31,292
Hyeong, Sam Sun hasn't eaten yet.

186
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,586
What if she starves to death?

187
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,416
Skipping one meal won't kill her.

188
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:39,551
Maybe she's not eating because she misses Grandma.

189
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,765
Can't we just let her go?

190
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:46,387
Just wait a little longer. We'll let her go

191
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:48,770
as soon as they go back to Seoul.

192
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:50,603
Sam Sun.

193
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,370
Crap! Gross! That's nasty!

194
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:11,413
I think someone's really getting revenge on you.

195
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,795
- What are you going to do?
- My pants...

196
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,709
- My pants...
- Oh no. What do we do?

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,300
Sam Sun.

198
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,464
Sam Sun...

199
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:30,683
Sam Sun?

200
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:32,353
Sam Sun.

201
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,732
Sam Sun.

202
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:41,774
Sam Sun.

203
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:48,450
- Sam Sun, let's go.
- Come here.

204
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,582
- Let's go.
- Come on, Sam Sun.

205
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:52,034
Come.

206
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,299
Your revenge is complete.

207
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:20,942
Did you let Sam Sun go?

208
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:22,153
Yes.

209
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,906
So please stop getting revenge on my brother.

210
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:27,699
He's not a bad person. Please forgive him.

211
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:31,744
All right. Don't worry about it anymore.

212
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:34,205
But Hyeon Wu,

213
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,919
why did Geon Wu take Sam Sun?

214
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,331
It's because of you.

215
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:43,424
It was because of you.

216
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,258
You called me a shoe thief.

217
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:49,091
You promised you wouldn't tell anyone.

218
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,554
No, I never told anyone.

219
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:54,056
Liar. I heard your friends laughing at you

220
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,687
calling me a shoe thief.

221
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:57,649
Shoe thief?

222
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:01,103
You shoe thief!

223
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:02,734
- Oh my.
- Stop that.

224
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:07,949
Bo Ra was saying that to Sam Sun.

225
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,283
Then why did you say you felt bad for us?

226
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:15,416
Do we look pathetic to you? Who are you to pity us?

227
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,120
Well...

228
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,674
We were basically talking about ourselves.

229
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:26,879
We grew up with our grandma too

230
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,761
when we were much younger than you.

231
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,306
- Liar.
- It's true.

232
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,978
You reminded me of ourselves.

233
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,192
I didn't know you would be so offended.

234
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:42,774
I'm really sorry.

235
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:51,242
I'm sorry too.

236
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:54,536
You did nothing wrong, but I took my anger out on you.

237
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:59,000
I really didn't think

238
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,963
you would get lost in the hills though.

239
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:05,797
I was also going to bring Sam Sun back.

240
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:08,259
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:12,134
I'm fine,

242
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:14,976
so just apologize to Sam Sun, okay?

243
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:18,019
Okay.

244
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:20,933
Eonni!

245
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:26,438
Sa Na, Geon Wu found Sam Sun for us.

246
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:29,571
Really?

247
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:34,116
Thank you so much.

248
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:36,497
Don't mention it.

249
00:20:45,006 --> 00:20:46,257
What do you want this time?

250
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:47,298
Well...

251
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,633
I noticed last time that the table light bulb went out.

252
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:52,764
I'll just change the light bulb and leave.

253
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:57,219
All right then.

254
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,221
You can do that and leave.

255
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:06,528
This is so simple.

256
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,322
Try turning on the light.

257
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:21,203
Thanks.

258
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,456
Is there anything else that needs fixing?

259
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:27,879
Gosh, this is so simple.

260
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,752
You just have to put it on.

261
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:31,924
It's done.

262
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:35,177
Why isn't the water coming out?

263
00:21:35,257 --> 00:21:36,929
- It's the other one.
- This one?

264
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,181
- Oh, it's this one.
- Yes.

265
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,312
- Oh my gosh!
- Wait.

266
00:21:43,144 --> 00:21:44,436
What are you doing?

267
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:45,647
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh no.

268
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:47,398
- What's are you doing?
- Why are you...

269
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,191
- Gosh!
- It's...

270
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:54,906
I didn't know the water pressure would be so strong.

271
00:21:55,577 --> 00:21:56,828
It's fine.

272
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:58,830
Gosh.

273
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:00,872
You have water on your face.

274
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,835
- Let me get it for you.
- I'm home.

275
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,003
- Hi, Seon Hui.
- You're here.

276
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:15,176
- Why are you smiling like that?
- Seon Hui.

277
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:17,639
It's not what you think. We...

278
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:19,891
- Don't get the wrong idea.
- Wait, Seon Hui.

279
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:21,683
- Wait...
- Seon Hui!

280
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:23,434
- Why does she just smile and leave?
- Seon Hui!

281
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:24,896
Hey, Seon Hui!

282
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:27,108
It's...

283
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,982
- What do we do now?
- Well...

284
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:52,585
Are you asleep?

285
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:54,256
Yes.

286
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:01,594
Sleep tight.

287
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:04,646
Okay.

288
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:22,575
- It's a mountain stream!
- Sweet.

289
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:23,826
Oh my gosh.

290
00:23:25,957 --> 00:23:28,621
Come here, fish!

291
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,463
- Gosh.
- Why are you picking up rocks?

292
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:34,005
They're so pretty.

293
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:36,128
Oh my gosh!

294
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:41,133
- Stop.
- Don't do that.

295
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:42,635
Wait.

296
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:44,475
- Gosh.
- Oh my goodness.

297
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:46,308
Let's do this.

298
00:23:52,104 --> 00:23:53,274
Just kidding.

299
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:57,820
Come here, fish.

300
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:02,954
I even eat the seeds.

301
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,078
- I eat them too.
- Same here.

302
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,662
Try it. It's good.

303
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,084
- Do you just chew on them?
- Yes.

304
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:14,086
- It's good for digestion.
- Really?

305
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:18,090
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

306
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:24,426
I really need to go.

307
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,181
God, please. Please help me just this once.

308
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:31,022
Just this one time...

309
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:52,124
What if someone sees this?

310
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:55,837
What should I do?

311
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:21,944
There we go.

312
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:27,660
- Sa Na!
- Sa Na!

313
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,040
Oh Sa Na!

314
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:30,202
Sa Na!

315
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:35,457
Hey, where were you? You disappeared without telling us.

316
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:39,300
I was just looking around.

317
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,754
If we're doing a campfire at Grandma's tonight,

318
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:43,425
we might need more sticks.

319
00:25:44,095 --> 00:25:45,257
Let's go find some more.

320
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:46,509
- Okay.
- Okay.

321
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,813
- Let's see.
- Sticks...

322
00:25:58,521 --> 00:25:59,732
Guys, come here.

323
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:04,906
It's so pretty.

324
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:06,868
Maybe someone made a wish here.

325
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:08,409
I wonder what wish they made.

326
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,782
Let's make a wish here too.

327
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:11,453
- Okay.
- Sure.

328
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,806
Sa Na, take a good one, okay?

329
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:36,437
One, two, three.

330
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,021
One, two, three.

331
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:42,064
One, two, three.

332
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:43,444
One more time.

333
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:46,238
One... The flower smells so nice.

334
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,409
One more time. One, two, three.

335
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:53,414
That won't make it any bigger.

336
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:58,670
I wonder how this worked here.

337
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,672
I ate so much. I'm stuffed.

338
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:02,334
I wish I could live here.

339
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:03,965
I really ate so much.

340
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,433
Could one of them be the Master?

341
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:13,895
I've never had better food in my life.

342
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:17,059
Ji Na, what are you doing? Let's take a picture.

343
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:19,150
Sure.

344
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:21,814
One, two, three.

345
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:25,858
Guys, do you want to play Secret Monitor?

346
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:26,908
What's that?

347
00:27:26,988 --> 00:27:29,111
We pick our Secret Monitor by lot

348
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,453
and tell them our biggest secret.

349
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:33,745
Is that so?

350
00:27:34,577 --> 00:27:37,669
But we'll never know whose secret it is.

351
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:39,961
That's why we can tell our secrets.

352
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,173
What if that person doesn't keep it a secret?

353
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:44,005
Secrets must never be told.

354
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:46,968
If someone says it out loud,

355
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:48,930
that person is out.

356
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:51,222
Let's play.

357
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:55,517
I took a dump inside the stone tower where we made our wish

358
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:03,775
I like Seo Je Yi

359
00:28:20,962 --> 00:28:23,836
I wish you could like me

360
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:27,339
What does this mean?

361
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,092
Does this mean he likes me?

362
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,764
I wonder who wrote it.

363
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:45,276
[Epilogue]
It's inside the cabinet.

364
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:48,990
Open it and look.

365
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,362
Photo Album

366
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:05,296
Oh my goodness.

367
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:08,049
What is this?

368
00:29:10,802 --> 00:29:11,924
Oh my gosh.

369
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:15,557
Sa Na,

370
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:17,680
your father

371
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,271
bought a camera

372
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,975
right when you were born

373
00:29:23,185 --> 00:29:26,478
and took so many pictures of you.

374
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,110
He didn't do that for Ji Na,

375
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:32,574
but he kept doing that for you.

376
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:36,788
He wanted to give

377
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:39,370
this album to you as a wedding gift.

378
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:41,914
He put so much effort into it.

379
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:45,998
I was wondering where it was,

380
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,960
but you found it.
