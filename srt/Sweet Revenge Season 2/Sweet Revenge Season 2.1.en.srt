00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,500
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

00:00:58,568 --> 00:01:00,150
To Hwagok-dong, Yeongdeungpo, Shinchon Station

5
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,800
Wait.

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,500
Thank you.

7
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,910
- What are you doing?
- Just a moment, please.

8
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,500
I will see you on your moving day.

9
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,700
The more I look at you, the more handsome you are.

10
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,775
Thank you.

11
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,485
- What?
- Hey, student! What are you doing?

12
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:27,897
Are you crazy?

13
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:29,739
Mom, I really like this neighborhood.

14
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,812
You do? I should call your dad and let him know.

15
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,785
- Let's go.
- Come on.

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,300
- Why can't we leave?
- Why aren't we going?

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,500
Let me take that for you.

18
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,141
It's your dad.

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,700
- Dad?
- Yes.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,900
Ajussi*, please wait until this grandma settles in her seat.
(form of address for an older or middle-aged man)

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,300
Aish!

22
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,900
Have a seat here.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
Hold on!

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,500
Wait!

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,300
What should I do?

26
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:28,567
Oh Ji Na, Hanjong High School Class 1-1

27
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:33,732
Je Yi, what are you doing over there?

28
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:35,245
Let's go.

29
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,800
Coming!

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,800
Excuse me. Here, catch.

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,500
- Nice catch.
- Are you crazy?

32
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,000
- I'm sorry.
- You're dead.

33
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:02,100
I'm so sorry.

34
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,700
That bag wasn't hers?

35
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,754
- Good morning.
- Give that back.

36
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:16,896
I really have to do well on this test.

37
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:18,708
Hey! Did you stay up all night?

38
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:21,330
Your eye bags are down to your knees.

39
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,362
- Is it that bad?
- Yes, it's quite a sight.

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,100
Look at yourself.

41
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,359
Delete it now. What is this?

42
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,529
I look so weird.

43
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,691
- Look at you.
- I look weird.

44
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,614
- What's this?
- Isn't this from middle school?

45
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,176
- Yes.
- You kept this? Goodness me.

46
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:39,328
This teddy bear was yours.

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,300
- This is when we went to karaoke.
- You look so funny.

48
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:44,854
- Let's go.
- Hey, delete that picture.

49
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,600
Here, you can be in charge of this.

50
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,696
Ji Na!

51
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,340
You can give this back to me later.

52
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,000
- Sin Ae!
- You can hold onto this.

53
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,400
Okay, take a picture.

54
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:16,846
At the morning assembly,

55
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,718
my friends threw me a surprise birthday party.

56
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,831
Thanks, guys.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,300
Okay, it's done. How perfect.

58
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:32,792
Hey!

59
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:35,134
It looks as if I'm proposing to you with the flowers.

60
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,686
Delete it. Isn't this fraud?

61
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:38,837
This is not fraud.

62
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,939
I just exaggerated a bit.

63
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:43,191
You're putting so much effort into it.

64
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,615
The number of likes is going up so fast.

65
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:49,508
Come on, guys. Press "Like."

66
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:54,200
Isn't this a brand new item?

67
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,600
It's so pretty.

68
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,337
You can have it.

69
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Really?

70
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:04,493
I was going to buy another one from Panel instead of this one.

71
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,785
I'm so annoyed.

72
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,940
You have a lot of money. Why don't you just buy it?

73
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,771
My lame mother suddenly said she would cut off my allowance.

74
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,437
That can't happen. If your allowance gets cut off,

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,800
who will buy me bread?

76
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Sorry.

77
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:29,229
How strange. Where did my diary go?

78
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,370
Your diary? Maybe you left it at home.

79
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,884
I remember putting it in.

80
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,800
I can't let anyone see it.

81
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,100
Guys, be quiet.

82
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,400
Quiet down, please.

83
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:54,062
Be quiet!

84
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,000
The teacher is here.

85
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,140
Thank you, Class President.

86
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,373
We will skip attendance

87
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:06,175
and move on to the video assembly.

88
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:07,617
Pay attention.

89
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:11,049
Life is

90
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,551
just like sports.

91
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,185
From time to time, I hear people saying

92
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:21,130
that the process is important, but that's nonsense.

93
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,984
In competition, we must win, no matter what.

94
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:29,097
What must a student do to win?

95
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,000
You need to do well in school.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,700
Students who don't perform well in school

97
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:38,707
will have nothing to say.

98
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:41,991
Even if they have nine mouths to speak,

99
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:45,354
they won't have anything to say.

100
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:48,058
He has come up with another saying today.

101
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,430
Be quiet. You also have nothing to say.

102
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,700
What do you mean?

103
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,264
Who is making a fuss over there?

104
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:57,626
How dare you interrupt the principal's speech?

105
00:06:57,656 --> 00:06:59,628
You have no manners.

106
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,270
Well...

107
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,634
The performance assessment will begin soon.

108
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,465
From now on,

109
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:12,060
even if a single person gets caught cheating,

110
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,794
the whole class will have to retake the test.

111
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:20,168
If you get caught cheating,

112
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:24,643
I will never forgive you.

113
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:28,786
Use your result to justify the process.

114
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,002
With that said, I will conclude today's assembly.

115
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:36,165
- Gosh.
- What was that?

116
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,557
Quiet down.

117
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,768
It doesn't matter if our class gets the lowest score.

118
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:41,870
Just make sure you don't cheat.

119
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,573
Not only will you retake the test, but you might even get demerits.

120
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,830
I trust you.

121
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:49,408
- Oh, my gosh.
- Awesome.

122
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:51,821
It looks so good. This is amazing.

123
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:54,763
Get anything you want to eat.

124
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,485
Thank you.

125
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:59,467
Su Ji, thank you so much.

126
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,289
I'd like to pay for these.

127
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:08,538
Student, your card has been suspended.

128
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,769
No way. Try again.

129
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:15,724
It's been suspended.

130
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:18,776
Can you move aside for the next customer?

131
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:21,710
Heol! No way.

132
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:26,364
Mom,

133
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:29,728
did you suspend my card? Why?

134
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,272
Why are you suddenly getting on me about my grades?

135
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,664
Mom.

136
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:36,976
Mom?

137
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,287
Mom!

138
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,962
- Then what about these?
- I know, right?

139
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:44,653
What do you mean?

140
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:47,285
You can just buy them yourselves.

141
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,600
This is so annoying!

142
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,829
Sin Ae.

143
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,361
Can I see you for a minute?

144
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,919
You can do that for me, right?

145
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,252
If we get caught cheating,

146
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,565
the entire class will have to retake it.

147
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:19,137
Come on. We don't have to get caught.

148
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:21,059
Don't worry about that.

149
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:26,074
Just make a few pages of notes as you study.

150
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:29,147
Write down the answers to a few of those, and send them to me.

151
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,310
What's so hard about that?

152
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:34,422
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:37,175
I'm not sure if I can.

154
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:46,695
Hey!

155
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:50,288
Do you think this is a request because I'm asking nicely?

156
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:55,112
This is an order.

157
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:58,146
Do you want to go back to your middle school days?

158
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:01,441
It's not a big deal for me to bully you.

159
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:13,972
You're scared.

160
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:15,574
Hey, don't worry.

161
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,916
If everything works out, I won't bother you.

162
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,729
You can do it, right?

163
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,390
Good luck.

164
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,591
This is delicious.

165
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:58,807
- Why aren't you eating?
- What?

166
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm not hungry.

167
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,223
Is it because you're worried about the test?

168
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:07,635
Is your mom pressuring you about it?

169
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,211
Actually...

170
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:14,602
You're preparing well for it, right?

171
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:18,086
How dare you not read my texts quickly?

172
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:21,379
Hey, Bae Sin Ae!

173
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,496
Are you not going to answer me?

174
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:31,359
What is it?

175
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,801
What?

176
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,913
It's nothing much.

177
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:40,610
I'm sorry. My stomach hurts today.

178
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,430
I'll get going now, okay?

179
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:49,187
Yes, madam. You made an excellent choice.

180
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:52,201
Facing south with 1,200 square feet. That apartment is perfect for you.

181
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:54,153
The owner's son made it into Hankuk University.

182
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,264
It's a really good place.

183
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:59,409
Yes, we will make sure the payments go through on time.

184
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:00,969
Have a good day.

185
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:03,032
Mom, take a look at this quickly.

186
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,282
What?

187
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,944
Is this or this better?

188
00:12:05,944 --> 00:12:08,587
The dress code is regular attire today. What should I wear?

189
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:12,129
They both look bad. You look best in a school uniform.

190
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:14,632
Hey, Oh Sa Na, isn't this mine?

191
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,305
This looks better on me.

192
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:21,318
Shut up. You better put it back exactly where you found it.

193
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:22,401
You're so selfish.

194
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:24,442
- I hope you get a zero on your test!
- Oh my.

195
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,905
Look at her speaking out so rashly.

196
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:30,689
I'm late.

197
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:38,186
- Water...
- You scared me.

198
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,161
My goodness.

199
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:45,455
You always have a hangover.

200
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:47,536
Aren't you ashamed of yourself in front of your nieces?

201
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:48,828
My gosh.

202
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,638
Thanks.

203
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,884
Water...

204
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:56,585
Do well on your test, all right?

205
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:59,477
- Sit up.
- Water...

206
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:07,165
So it's...

207
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:10,249
Background knowledge...

208
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,950
The Traveler's Song.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Also...

210
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:16,845
Oh.

211
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,451
Excuse me.

212
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:44,062
You dropped this.

213
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:48,196
You can have it.

214
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:51,639
A hundred won (about 10¢) is still money.

215
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:55,953
I'm late.

216
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:21,259
You're not even studying. Just give up.

217
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,052
I'm going to get a 100 this time.

218
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:24,873
That's suddenly going to happen?

219
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,099
Gosh.

220
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,781
Do you really have to do that now?

221
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:36,014
Darn it.

222
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,289
You fool.

223
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,072
The test is on the material starting from the next page.

224
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,242
Darn it.

225
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:46,844
Gosh.

226
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:51,930
I'm cramming at the last minute. Study with me.

227
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,883
Does happiness come from grades?

228
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:36,690
Liberalism, Individualism, communitarianism...

229
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,900
You're a genius.

230
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,411
So these are all the expected questions?

231
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:48,456
Don't forget to send me the answers later.

232
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:49,867
Yes.

233
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,531
Are you crazy?

234
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:55,103
You've been acting weird since yesterday.

235
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:57,205
Hey, stay out of this.

236
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:59,938
You made her do this, didn't you? Why are you bothering Sin Ae again?

237
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:02,010
Hey, stop butting in.

238
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,903
Ji Na, I told her I'd do it for her.

239
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:06,533
Just pretend you don't know.

240
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:08,377
- Hey, do you want to die?
- You cannot do this.

241
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:11,009
If you get caught, you'll let Sin Ae take all the blame.

242
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,430
Sin Ae, don't do anything.

243
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,713
Please don't do this.

244
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:16,985
Oh Ji Na, that crazy girl.

245
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:42,000
Clear your desks and put everything in your backpacks.

246
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,542
Hurry up.

247
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:48,617
First and second rows, switch seats.

248
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:50,820
You, you, and you.

249
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,621
Change seats.

250
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:15,644
To those who are thinking,

251
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:18,156
preparing, and deciding to cheat,

252
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,469
just wait and see what I'll do if you get caught.

253
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:23,472
If you're curious, go ahead and do it.

254
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,905
Pass the test papers down.

255
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:27,845
Teacher,

256
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:32,349
may I borrow an eraser from the person in front of me?

257
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:34,652
I'll let you borrow mine.

258
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:37,014
Here, use this.

259
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:50,378
You have ten minutes remaining.

260
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,201
Teacher,

261
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,174
my pen is out of ink.

262
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,465
I am going to borrow one.

263
00:19:17,465 --> 00:19:19,978
I'll lend her mine.

264
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,303
Here, use this one.

265
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:48,216
Put down your pens and hand in your tests.

266
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:51,648
Hurry up.

267
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,701
It's over.

268
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:00,749
Are you crazy?

269
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,236
What is this?

270
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:31,489
What is this?

271
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:36,694
Oh Ji Na, answer me.

272
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,346
That is...

273
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:40,849
It's not mine.

274
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,252
It fell out of your bag. If it's not yours, then whose is it?!

275
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:48,026
How dare you cheat in front of me?

276
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,890
Ah, you made it so well!

277
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,851
Have you been

278
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:56,935
passing this thing around?

279
00:20:57,866 --> 00:21:00,047
Since I caught you,

280
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:02,480
everyone must retake the test!

281
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,394
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

282
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:09,047
Be quiet! I can't trust any of you!

283
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,819
Prepare for a retake.

284
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,052
Class President, follow me.

285
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,256
- My goodness.
- What is this?

286
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:18,426
What is this?

287
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:21,389
- I didn't study anyway.
- Gosh.

288
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:25,864
You're amazing.

289
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:29,486
You're always pretending to be nice, yet you've been cheating all along?

290
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:31,920
What are you looking at?

291
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,042
You have nothing to say.

292
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,985
Even if you had nine mouths, you'd have nothing to say.

293
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:40,069
Hey, Geum Su Ji, you know that's not true.

294
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:41,530
What's not true?

295
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,811
If you didn't make it, who did?

296
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:46,414
Who? Who made it?

297
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:51,320
Hey, Oh Ji Na, you've been caught red-handed.

298
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:53,322
Why are you getting worked up?

299
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:56,044
We all need to retake the test because of you.

300
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,955
This is so stressful.

301
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,981
Oh Ji Na, why did you do that?

302
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,282
If we retake the test,

303
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:05,634
all the questions will change.

304
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,335
I did really well this time!

305
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:11,028
If I do badly on the retake, will you take responsibility?!

306
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,063
Ju Ri, don't cry.

307
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:16,684
Guys, I can explain.

308
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:18,317
I'm not the one that made it—

309
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:20,648
You are really so shameless.

310
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:22,350
Who are you trying to blame now?

311
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,662
You're such a piece of trash!

312
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,666
Why are you crying?

313
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,130
Oh Ji Na,

314
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,322
you're being called to the teachers' office.

315
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,126
Hanjong High School Social Studies Performance Assessment.

316
00:22:50,418 --> 00:22:52,359
Oh Ji Na.

317
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:58,887
You're getting a zero on your test.

318
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:01,800
How dare you cheat in front of me?

319
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,502
Teacher,

320
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:06,384
you should also listen to her side of the story—

321
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,885
Look at this, Teacher Maeng.

322
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:10,878
What more do I need to hear? We have the proof right here.

323
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,472
My gosh.

324
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,774
If you had the time to make this, you could've spent it studying.

325
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,226
You put so much effort into it.

326
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:19,808
Goodness.

327
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,771
Really?

328
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:35,924
- You're full?
- No, I'm not full yet.

329
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,415
- This is so delicious.
- I know, right?

330
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:40,969
- This is good.
- This is really good.

331
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:45,863
This is so good.

332
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,320
Hey, who do you think you are?

333
00:23:56,444 --> 00:23:59,467
You're really getting on my nerves.

334
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:01,428
Clean it up.

335
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:10,898
Hey, Bae Sin Ae, aren't you going to follow me?

336
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:32,881
What a long day this is.

337
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:57,694
You should've at least messaged me before going.

338
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,270
Gosh, it's annoying.

339
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,301
The stickers are all the same.

340
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:06,564
Hey, did you hear?

341
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:08,317
Someone got caught cheating in Class One.

342
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:09,818
Are you serious?

343
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:10,839
That's crazy.

344
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,270
So that class will retake the test?

345
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,743
We should be thankful that the crazy girl isn't in our class.

346
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,415
That is wild. I would've pulled out her hair.

347
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,237
But when she got caught cheating,

348
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:20,789
she refused to admit that she did it.

349
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:21,709
Really?

350
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,552
That's crazy.

351
00:25:23,552 --> 00:25:26,563
Why would she do such a thing?

352
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,836
She is so shameless.

353
00:25:28,836 --> 00:25:32,661
If you're not going to buy them, stop touching them.

354
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,363
The bread will get all squished.

355
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:37,315
Whatever. Let's go.

356
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:46,083
I heard you guys had a test.

357
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,406
Did you do poorly?

358
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:51,138
What?

359
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:52,210
Yes.

360
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:56,052
Aigoo, it's all right.

361
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:58,516
It happens sometimes, you know?

362
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:00,318
Here.

363
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:02,759
Take these.

364
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,511
Fighting!

365
00:26:14,243 --> 00:26:15,744
Everyone must retake the test.

366
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,696
I did really well this time.

367
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:21,359
If I do badly on the retake, will you take responsibility?

368
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,271
We all need to retake the test because of you!

369
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,464
You are so shameless.

370
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:27,105
Who are you trying to blame now?

371
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:28,976
You're such a piece of trash!

372
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:31,629
We should be thankful that the crazy girl isn't in our class.

373
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,400
That is wild.

374
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:10,738
Who are you?

375
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Well,

376
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,602
we just moved in on the fourth floor today.

377
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,881
The door is open.

378
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,775
Oh Ji Na

379
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:36,053
Wait!

380
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:40,418
Oh Ji Na Hanjong High School Class 1-1

381
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:48,736
Where did it go?

382
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:56,023
Oh, no.

383
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,213
Sin Ae, did you get home safely?

384
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,828
What's wrong with her?

385
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:26,524
I trust you guys.

386
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,238
You're such a piece of trash.

387
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,555
Sin Ae, did you get home safely?

388
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:41,168
Why are you being like this, too?

389
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:58,466
You shouldn't be two-faced like that.

390
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:02,649
You're so selfish. It's really unbelievable.

391
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:05,854
What the f***! I feel bad for your parents!

392
00:29:05,914 --> 00:29:07,516
You obviously did it.

393
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:09,406
How annoying.

394
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,859
If we end up retaking the test, I'm going to make you pay for it.

395
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,271
How well did you think you could do?

396
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:14,523
You're not even smart.

397
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,915
Stop being nosy. It's disgusting.

398
00:29:17,926 --> 00:29:20,217
You're acting like you're the victim.

399
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,435
Sin Ae has left the chatroom.

400
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,430
Sin Ae...

401
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,448
What's this?

402
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:14,232
Would you like to download Revenge Note?

403
00:30:19,757 --> 00:30:20,839
What was that?

404
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,080
Oh, my gosh. It's a thief!

405
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,032
Mom!

406
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,814
- It's a thief!
- Wait.

407
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:29,297
It's a thief! There's a thief here!

408
00:30:29,297 --> 00:30:31,088
It's a thief!

409
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:32,910
Wait!

410
00:30:53,622 --> 00:30:54,813
~ Epilogue ~

411
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,625
Where should I put these?

412
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,836
- You can set them down over here.
- All right.
