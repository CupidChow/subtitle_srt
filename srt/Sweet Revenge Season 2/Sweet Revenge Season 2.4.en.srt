00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:32,993
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

3
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:37,898
I'm embarrassed to be the one saying this,

4
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:40,730
but what do you think about me? As a potential girlfriend.

5
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:44,865
Aren't I a pretty good catch?

6
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,588
Yes. I think you're a really nice person.

7
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,662
But... I'm really sorry.

8
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:54,545
I already have someone I like.

9
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,336
Really?

10
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:57,777
Who is it?

11
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:00,841
You don't know her.

12
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,342
You're lying.

13
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:06,064
It's fine. I didn't like you that much anyway!

14
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,224
Get out of the way!

15
00:01:33,222 --> 00:01:36,405
- What happened?
- Dont tell me she...

16
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:39,939
Why did you...

17
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,500
Be quiet.

18
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,718
I'm sorry. Hold on for a moment.

19
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:50,851
Didn't Oh Ji Na jump from here?

20
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,303
Where did she run?

21
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:55,574
- Just wait until I catch her.
- Shh!

22
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:59,829
The bell rang. Let's go. We have Teacher Lee's class next.

23
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:04,303
Oh Ji Na!

24
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:07,097
Thank goodness. They're gone.

25
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:09,087
Thanks, Je Yi.

26
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,082
Je Yi, what's wrong?

27
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,623
Je Yi.

28
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:20,190
Seo Jae Yi

29
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:26,747
What's going on?

30
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,968
I heard you got hurt.

31
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:31,721
It's nothing serious. Were you worried?

32
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,794
No. You look fine.

33
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:38,978
Why are you here?

34
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:41,021
Well, that's because...

35
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:44,804
Oh, Ji Na accompanied me to the hospital.

36
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,996
Doctor, he's not seriously injured, is he?

37
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:59,188
No, thankfully nothing is broken.

38
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:01,381
His intercostal* muscle is bruised.
(*between the ribs)

39
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,823
There might be some delayed bleeding,

40
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:05,004
so we'll be observing him here for a day.

41
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:06,637
We'll decide tomorrow if he can go home.

42
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:08,748
Thank you, Doctor.

43
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:12,202
Judging from your uniform, you must be Hanjong High students.

44
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:15,305
- Yes.
- I graduated from there, too.

45
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:18,899
- Nice to meet you.
- Really?

46
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,911
Ho Gu Jun?

47
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,361
Ho Gu Jun?

48
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,195
Aren't you the Hanjong High legend?

49
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:26,726
That sounds like an exaggeration.

50
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:29,550
Teacher Lee is always talking about you. He says you were legendary.

51
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,622
Is he still like that these days? Gosh.

52
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:38,468
It was nice to meet you all. I'll see you next time.

53
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,503
Aren't you leaving?

54
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,686
Well, that is...

55
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:48,548
Right, Ji Na. Your mom is probably worried.

56
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,650
- You should get going.
- Okay.

57
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,761
I'll come back tomorrow.

58
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:53,993
Come back? Why?

59
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:56,145
I'm not coming to see you.

60
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,398
See you tomorrow, Je Yi.

61
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:07,397
Don't you have your part-time job tonight?

62
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,539
Wake me up when dinner comes.

63
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,424
How did I end up like this?

64
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:26,626
How long do I have to live like this?

65
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:30,239
Until Jo Eun Yeon graduates?

66
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,033
Oh Ji Na!

67
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:37,136
Why are you so surprised?

68
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:40,489
You scared me! I thought you were Eun Yeon.

69
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,343
Oh Ji Na, it's so hard to get a hold of you.

70
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:56,346
Come over here.

71
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:08,208
You're out of your mind, aren't you?

72
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:12,771
How dare you do that to me?

73
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:15,845
I should just—

74
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,868
The bell rang. Let's go.

75
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:20,529
Yes, things will get complicated when Teacher Maeng gets here.

76
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,027
Oh Ji Na, come to the rooftop at lunchtime.

77
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,029
I'll get my hands dirty there.

78
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,070
Come alone.

79
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,362
If you bring someone, I'll put my hands on her first.

80
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,820
Poor Oh Ji Na. What will you do?

81
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,323
I know. She won't be around for much longer.

82
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:17,886
I want to go to the roof too to watch.

83
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:21,010
What's this?

84
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,472
Sorry. There was some milk on the floor.

85
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:24,955
It's my turn to clean this week.

86
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,816
You're so annoying!

87
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,202
- La bouche. ("the mouth" in French)
- La bouche.

88
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:36,434
- Le bras ("the arm" in French).
- Le bras.

89
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:38,456
- La main ("the hand" in French).
- La main.

90
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:40,158
- Le sang("the blood" in French).
- Le sang.

91
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,710
- Le sang.
- Le sang.

92
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,562
- Le sang.
- Le sang.

93
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:44,483
Good.

94
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,706
Come to the rooftop at lunchtime.

95
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,819
I'll get my hands dirty there.

96
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,301
- Le sang.
- Le sang.

97
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:53,122
- Le sang.
- Le sang.

98
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,654
Good.

99
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,345
All right, that's it for today.

100
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,128
- Thank you for the class.
- Thank you.

101
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,260
See you next time.

102
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,766
Ji Na, what are you going to do? Are you going?

103
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:09,288
Eun Yeon looked bloodthirsty.

104
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:11,280
Are you going to be all right?

105
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,264
I should go, shouldn't I?

106
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,796
She wouldn't kill me, would she?

107
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:20,800
This seonbae's nickname is "One Punch, Double Nosebleed."

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,462
Do you want to take some tissues?

109
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:27,426
She's so annoying.

110
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,861
Do you think Oh Ji Na is actually going to come?

111
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:34,274
Wouldn't she be too scared to show up?

112
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:36,665
That would actually seal her fate.

113
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:41,269
How should I deal with her?

114
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:59,199
I really didn't mean to do that.

115
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,972
Couldn't you please forgive me just this once?

116
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,805
Are you kidding?

117
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:07,897
Do you know how much I went through because of you?

118
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:09,789
I will just—

119
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,508
What are you all doing here?

120
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,212
We were practicing curling!

121
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,595
- That's right.
- Keep going.

122
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:27,346
Faster!

123
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:30,368
Ji Na, you too!

124
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,545
Oh Ji Na, play your part, all right?

125
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:37,107
Eun Yeon, here.

126
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:40,010
Keep going. Faster!

127
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,381
Here it is.

128
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:42,782
Yes, that's it.

129
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:44,985
It's so hot. Why curling, out of all things?

130
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:46,236
You all are really strange.

131
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:48,808
You know, this is really fun.

132
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,490
- Yes, it is.
- It's so much fun.

133
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,752
All right then. You can keep going.

134
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:55,754
Ji Na, can I talk to you for a bit?

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,560
Yes.

136
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:06,716
See you later, Ji Na!

137
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:09,258
Let's practice again soon!

138
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:13,563
Teacher...

139
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:16,125
Why did you come to the rooftop?

140
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,299
Someone told me that I should check.

141
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:23,454
Are you all right?

142
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:26,405
- Yes.
- Good.

143
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:46,296
This is so annoying!

144
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,508
That girl is the worst!

145
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:51,201
I thought Maeng was dense, but I guess she's a teacher for a reason.

146
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:54,103
How could she insult me like that?

147
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:59,148
- Seonbaenim!* (respectful form of "seonbae")
- Why is she here?

148
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,981
I heard Oh Ji Na weaseled her way out again.

149
00:10:02,522 --> 00:10:05,114
She needs someone to beat some sense into her.

150
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:07,097
How can I ruin her?

151
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:08,328
Seonbaenim,

152
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:11,270
I have a suggestion.

153
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,171
What?

154
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:15,675
It's a way to mess her up right down to her core.

155
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:18,997
Really?

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,504
I feel like we have a lot to talk about.

157
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:27,887
Trash bin - General waste

158
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,251
Seonbaenim,

159
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:33,793
Oh Ji Na is on her way now.

160
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,729
Aigoo...

161
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,351
What?

162
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:47,446
Whose is this?

163
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:50,700
Jo Eun Yeon

164
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:56,185
What do I do?

165
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:59,778
Why did I pick this up? I should have just left it there.

166
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:04,024
Should I just put it back?

167
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:06,565
Right, that's what I'll do.

168
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,178
Oh Ji Na. That wallet...

169
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,832
That's mine. Why do you have it?

170
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:14,395
I just found it here on the bench.

171
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:17,056
Did you just try to steal it?

172
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:21,060
Eun Yeon, check if anything is missing.

173
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,603
I put 1,500,000 won (≈ $1,300) in here earlier.

174
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:26,184
That was our extracurricular club fee.

175
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:28,679
But it's not there anymore.

176
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,951
- There's nothing in here.
- Hey. Give it back while we're asking nicely.

177
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:34,323
It wasn't me. I really didn't do it.

178
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:37,057
We collected that money from all the members of the club.

179
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:39,159
Do you think they'll let you slide?

180
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,291
Let's just take her to the police station.

181
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,172
The police station? Why?

182
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,984
I really didn't take the money.

183
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,407
You were caught at the crime scene though.

184
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,659
You were caught red-handed.

185
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:53,633
Even if you say you didn't, who would believe you?

186
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,134
That's not how it works...

187
00:11:56,557 --> 00:12:00,650
Do you want to settle things between us instead of going to the police?

188
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,334
Excuse me? How?

189
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,066
Just pay me back.

190
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:09,649
Then I'll forgive you for everything you've done.

191
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:11,801
Really?

192
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:15,264
But I don't have that much money right now.

193
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:16,806
Did I tell you to pay me back now?

194
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:19,218
You can take your time.

195
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,601
But let's write a contract.

196
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,414
I promise to repay 1,500,000 won

197
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:29,208
Let's seal it with a thumbprint.

198
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,264
Print yours here.

199
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:39,219
I promise to be Eun Yeon's slave until I repay this debt

200
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:44,023
Oh Ji Na

201
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:57,967
Here. I'll see you later, then.

202
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:17,116
Hey, 10,000 won (≈ $9)?

203
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:20,661
Do you think I'm a beggar?

204
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:23,713
Do you think I'm joking around?

205
00:13:23,713 --> 00:13:25,184
Do you?

206
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:39,138
This is the one we've chosen for today.

207
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:42,312
Look at Oh Ji Na's cheeks. She's practically Pikachu.

208
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:44,793
This is where she stores electricity.

209
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,988
Gang Su Ji. You're Squirtle.

210
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,239
Now, just do as I say.

211
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:53,031
Squirtle, use body slam!

212
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:58,908
Hey.

213
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:01,160
What are you doing? Hurry up and do it!

214
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,171
Body slam!

215
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:07,767
It's okay. Just do as they say.

216
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,058
This is hilarious.

217
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,552
Pikachu, what are you doing? Get up.

218
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,952
That guy from yesterday was so hot.

219
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:44,514
- I know, right?
- Did he call you?

220
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:45,976
No, he hasn't called.

221
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:47,166
He hasn't?

222
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,848
- Which one?
- I don't know.

223
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,382
- Really?
- That's so funny.

224
00:14:57,608 --> 00:15:01,580
To be honest, I don't want you to pay me back.

225
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:05,083
It's nice having a little slave.

226
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,564
Wash it and bring it back tomorrow.

227
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:17,277
I'll call you later,

228
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:19,318
so don't you dare turn off your phone.

229
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,081
Let's go to the noraebang (karaoke place).

230
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,822
Yes!

231
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:40,069
Jo Eun Yeon

232
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,614
Should we just tell the teacher?

233
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:46,616
Do you think that would solve things?

234
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:49,940
They'd just bully you when the teachers aren't there.

235
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,930
Then what should I do?

236
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,273
Should I quit school?

237
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:56,947
This won't end until you repay them.

238
00:15:56,947 --> 00:16:00,520
Even if you're innocent, paying her back is the quickest way out.

239
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:03,974
Where would I get that kind of money?

240
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:06,035
I don't even have 100,000 won (about $90).

241
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:08,638
Jo Eun Yeon

242
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,992
Why is my life so difficult these days?

243
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:34,985
Will you be the revenge goddess?

244
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:36,765
It showed up again.

245
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:41,870
Is someone really watching over me?

246
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:48,638
Enter target's name

247
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:51,351
Jo Eun Yeon

248
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:55,906
I must be losing my mind.

249
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:58,167
How could I fall for something like this?

250
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,982
Enter target's name

251
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:14,444
Hi, Je Yi.

252
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:16,006
Ji Na, you're here.

253
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:19,098
You didn't have to come all the way here.

254
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:22,472
How could I not? You got hurt because of me.

255
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:31,691
I checked all the parts that your class went over today.

256
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,433
Really?

257
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,610
Great.

258
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,023
This must have taken so much time.

259
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:45,445
Thanks.

260
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:53,854
The circle equation

261
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:55,395
Incredible!

262
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,066
Were you studying in the hospital?

263
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,389
Yes. I heard we'll have a quiz soon.

264
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:01,030
I see.

265
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,174
We already learned this part in our class.

266
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,658
Do you want me to teach you a bit?

267
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:10,600
What? That's all right. I can study on my own.

268
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,842
I definitely know this part. Just trust me.

269
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:20,430
I'm not sure about this.

270
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,575
Solve each quadratic equation

271
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:26,365
It's...

272
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,239
Then I add...

273
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:34,174
I give up. How about number four?

274
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:38,729
x+1=0...

275
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:40,779
So...

276
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,684
I really don't know this one.

277
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,949
Maybe our textbooks are different.

278
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:52,381
Never mind. We go to the same school.

279
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:57,867
Don't laugh. I said don't laugh at me.

280
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:01,551
Now, you're acting more like yourself.

281
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:05,215
Did something happen to you earlier?

282
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:07,646
You looked upset.

283
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,172
No, nothing's going on.

284
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,657
Come to the karaoke place right now.

285
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,113
A friend wants to see me. I'm going to go out for a bit.

286
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:26,024
I'll be back soon.

287
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:38,167

288
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,350

294
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,222
That was quick.

295
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:15,235
Let's see how well you sing.

296
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:24,884
I put together all the money I have.

297
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:26,485
It's not much,

298
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:29,028
- but can't you please let me go?
- One, two, three,

299
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,301
12, 13...

300
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:33,182
It's 130,000 won (≈ $115)?

301
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:34,455
Just 130,000 won?

302
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:37,326
Are you kidding?

303
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:40,540
This doesn't even cover the interest on what you borrowed.

304
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,501
What?

305
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,444
But I never borrowed money from you.

306
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,627
Don't you see this?

307
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,358
You wrote this.

308
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,881
You said you would repay me 1,500,000 won.

309
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:54,844
But you made me write that contract.

310
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:56,637
Look at this girl.

311
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:59,079
Did we put our hands over yours and make you write it?

312
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,732
- You wrote this yourself.
- Forget it.

313
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:04,173
Just give me my money back as written here,

314
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:07,187
or live as my slave until you've repaid the debt.

315
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:12,582
Also, starting from tomorrow, I will charge interest daily.

316
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,093
It's so funny.

317
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:27,746
Oh Ji Na is really dumb, isn't she?

318
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:32,152
Does she really not understand what we did?

319
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,534
Of course, not.

320
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,157
If she knew, she wouldn't be so meek.

321
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:41,300
You saw her writing that contract with shaky hands.

322
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:45,695
The person who falls for that deserves it.

323
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:49,129
We have some money thanks to her. What do you want to do with it?

324
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,651
Why don't we go clubbing? It's been a while.

325
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:55,135
Good idea!

326
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,997
Let's go.

327
00:21:56,997 --> 00:22:00,400
- Let's go.
- Let's show off some moves.

328
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:28,408
Will you be the revenge goddess?

329
00:22:28,408 --> 00:22:29,920
You're done for.

330
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,562
You're a mouse inside a trap now.

331

Do you think I'm joking around?

332
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,445
Come out while I'm asking nicely.

Oh Ji Na

336
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:48,789
Starting tomorrow, I will charge interest daily.

337
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:52,042

Hey!

Hey!

349
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:40,200
Are you all right?

350
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,092
- Hey, are you all right?
- Wake up!

351

- Eun Yeon, are you all right?
- Wake up.

352
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:44,874
She must have been electrocuted!

353
00:23:44,874 --> 00:23:46,015
- Are you all right?
- Eun Yeon!

354
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,087
What do we do?

355
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,489

356
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:52,422
Hey, Jo Eun Yeon.

360
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,475
- Eun Yeon.

361
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:06,705
I'm fine. Stop.

362
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:10,109
I don't like it here.

363
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:11,401
I'm leaving.

364
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:13,564
We'll sing a bit more and leave.

365
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:14,875
Okay.

366
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:20,350
Who got you that bag? Your boyfriend?

367
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,871
It's so pretty.

368
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:23,453
It looks so nice.

369
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:27,166
This isn't a fake, right? Can I hold it just once?

370
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,678

00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:45,634
Oh, my.

376
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,901
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

377
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:06,305
You crazy wench!

378
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,589
I won't let this slide!

379
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:10,619
Aish!

Darn it.

383
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:27,347
Aish!

384
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:29,259
The smell is awful.

385
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:32,442
What's this?

386
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:35,445
The letters are all smudged.

387
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:37,947
If Oh Ji Na finds out, this will have to end.

388
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:48,309
Hey, I'm cleaning up my bag.

389
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:50,650
Hey, we're in trouble.

390
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,163
There are police officers here.

391
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:55,405
They know we took money from students. They took our bags.

392
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:57,377
It's a mess.

393
00:25:57,377 --> 00:26:00,120
What? I can't hear you clearly.

394
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,072
Why is your voice like that?

395
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,763
Be quiet.

396
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:06,626
Just get rid of the money you have.

397
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:09,379
It's all evidence. If they find it,

398
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:11,391
we'll be sent to jail.

399
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:12,893
Is that true?

400
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:15,686
Yes, I'm not joking. You have money in your account, right?

401
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:17,427
Withdraw that first.

402
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:20,570
What are you doing? Hurry!

403
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,862
I'm almost there.

404
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:23,633
Financial service

405
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:27,887
I'm at the ATM.

406
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,640
Transfer all the cash you have and the money in your account.

407
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,703
Where to?

408
00:26:32,703 --> 00:26:36,145
I'll tell you the account number now.

409
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:37,778
Hurry up and tell me.

410
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:42,323
Neohi Bank, 123-456-678.

411
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:43,474
Wait a bit before you come out.

412
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:46,316
I'll call you after I make sure the police aren't after us.

413
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:48,897
Okay. I got it.

414
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:55,854
What is going on?

415
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:11,312
- Jo Eun Yeon!
- Eun Yeon!

416
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:13,354
Be quiet!

417
00:27:13,354 --> 00:27:15,255
The police might hear.

418
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:16,686
Why are you talking so loudly?

419
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:18,769
Police? What police are you talking about?

420
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,151
You told me the police were after us.

421
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:25,635
What are you talking about? I never said that.

422
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:29,430
You told me that if I keep my money, I'll be sent to jail.

423
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,012
You told me to transfer it.

424
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:33,412
Over the phone.

425
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:35,986
She was at the noraebang with me until just now.

426
00:27:35,986 --> 00:27:37,906
Who did you talk to?

427
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:45,235
Hey, did you...

428
00:27:45,235 --> 00:27:48,589
Was it voice phishing then?

429
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:50,351
What?

430
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:52,932
- I think it was.
- What do we do?

431
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:57,607
A total of 5,000,000 won (about $4,500) has been withdrawn

432
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:02,543
Oh, no. My money...

433
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:05,014
I need that money.

434
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,871
Hey. This is your fault!

435
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:14,074
You told me to send the money. Give me my money!

436
00:28:14,074 --> 00:28:16,786
- Are you nuts?
- Get a grip, Eun Yeon!

437
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,358
Without that money,

438
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:21,461
I'm dead meat.

00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:29,379

Someone is helping me through the Revenge Note.

444

Who is the Master?

445
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:29,618
Aigoo, you're going to catch a cold.

Did Ji Na come here?

448
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,712
She said she would come back.

449
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:35,215
I don't know. I didn't see her.

450
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:37,846

456
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:08,048
She got voice phished yesterday

457
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:09,750
