~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,173
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:32,913
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:37,416
Hey guys, look at us.

5
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:39,998
Are you ready?

6
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,955
One, two, three.

7
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:46,486
AOA Rocks

8
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:47,967
What is that?

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,910
It looks pretty nice.

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,833
Look at that.

11
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,816
Oh my gosh. The shirts came out great.

12
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,340
You guys are newbies.

13
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,433
You can't just write the name Mina.

14
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,295
I wrote that I'm her future husband. Do you understand?

15
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:08,688
- What is that?
- That's cute.

16
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:09,780
I'm amazed.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,431
As expected from the president.

18
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:15,485
- You're amazing.
- They've gotten worse these days.

19
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,492
You made the placards, right?

20
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:26,615
They need to stand out so that the members can remember us.

21
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:29,598
Ta-da! What do you think? Isn't it great?

22
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:31,301
I made one for Jimin.

23
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,722
How does it look? Isn't it amazing?

24
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:35,105
It's all right,

25
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:36,896
but you need to highlight the word "heart"

26
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,007
in order to catch their attention.

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,823
Mina, it's me, your future husband!

28
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,103
You're the best.

29
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,627
- Now that's shocking.
- Everyone will stare at him.

30
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:49,720
- Oh my. As expected from the president.
- I admire you.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,191
- It's so cool.
- Hey, be quiet.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,932
My goodness. What kind of class are we having today?

33
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,544
- He looks great.
- What's going on?

34
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:06,496
Right. My outfit is a bit strange today, isn't it?

35
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:09,880
The last performance evaluation before summer break is dance.

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,071
- What?
- Dance?

37
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:13,993
I can't dance. I have no sense of rhythm.

38
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:16,305
Can't we just do boxing or something?

39
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:19,429
I will now make a demonstration.

40
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:22,302
Pay attention and watch closely.

41
00:02:22,302 --> 00:02:24,744
Please come out.

42
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,859
Oh my gosh.

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,392
Her clothes look a bit strange.

44
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:35,105
- Are they a couple?
- They look good together.

45
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:37,426
- She's so pretty.
- No way.

46
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:38,978
Swing Dance

47
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:40,871
Bluetooth Audio

48
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,993
The sound is great.

49
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:09,118
Don't they look like professionals?

50
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:11,040
Yes, they do.

51
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:17,146
- Date!
- Great!

52
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:21,361
- You are amazing!
- Oh my goodness.

53
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:24,164
The performance evaluation will be on easy moves,

54
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:27,926
not difficult ones, so don't be nervous.

55
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:31,570
Then... Boys and girls each make a line.

56
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,793
Where are you standing? I'm going to be first.

57
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:36,935
You can't switch places with anyone.

58
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:40,910
The person next to you will be your partner.

59
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:43,834
What? You're my partner?

60
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:47,756
Sorry. I have a lot of sweat...

61
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:50,820
Oh Ji Na, switch places with me.

62
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,942
The teacher told us not to.

63
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,304
Is it because you want to dance with Ro Bin?

64
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:56,846
Do you like him or something?

65
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:59,639
What are you talking about? Hurry and switch places then.

66
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,734
Let's learn the basic steps then.

67
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:06,296
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

68
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:10,209
I don't feel well. I don't think I can participate.

69
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,913
All right, Yi Deun. You can sit out this time.

70
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:18,917
The boys can move up one spot.

71
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,754
Darn it. What the heck is this?

72
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:27,996
Now face each other.

73
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,332
Here are the moves. Three, four.

74
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:36,135
One, two, three, four.

75
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:38,787
You need to hold hands.

76
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,642
Don't be shy. You're supposed to hold hands.

77
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:45,764
It's just dancing.

78
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,068
Can you stay on rhythm?

79
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:51,780
I'm trying my best.

80
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:57,956
Hey, why are your hands so sweaty?

81
00:04:57,956 --> 00:05:00,740
Are you nervous because you're holding hands with me?

82
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,192
Hey, I just have a lot of sweat on my hands.

83
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:06,415
Put on some gloves then.

84
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:15,254
Ji Na.

85
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:17,876
I'll see you later.

86
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:21,071
Did you see the way they were holding hands?

87
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,343
It was so fast. I had no choice.

88
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:25,274
Hurry up.

89
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,539
Aren't you hot? Drink this.

90
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,141
Thanks.

91
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,185
It's actually my mom's birthday soon.

92
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:39,568
Could you help me pick out a present? I don't know what to get her.

93
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:42,162
Sure, I can help you with that.

94
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,903
I've bought a lot of gifts for my mom and aunt.

95
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,576
Then do you want to go shopping later?

96
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,249
Sure.

97
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,632
Out of all the gifts I got for my mom and aunt,

98
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:56,065
I think they liked scarves the most.

99
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,027
Scarves?

100
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:15,094
I thought he was the one.

101
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,128
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,439
I'm at the airport right now.

103
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,242
I suddenly got transferred overseas.

104
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:26,587
I can't ask you to wait for me.

105
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,059
I guess this is the end of our relationship.

106
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:32,442
- Take care.
- Oh no.

107
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,564
This can't be happening.

108
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,455
Gi Jun,

109
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:39,988
I can wait for you.

110
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,971
Welcome...

111
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,996
Gi Jun.

112
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,820
How have you been?

113
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,975
What brings you here?

114
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,408
These are lisianthus flowers.

115
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,640
In the language of flowers,

116
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,013
it means unchanging love.

117
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:39,818
I came back because I couldn't stand it anymore.

118
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,872
I'm sorry for being so late.

119
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:06,595
Oh.

120
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:11,841
I was in a rush coming back from Paris, so I could only get you this.

121
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,205
- What is this?
- This is sold only in Paris.

122
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,157
It is limited edition perfume.

123
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:21,960
Miss Seon Hui, I thought the fragrance would go well with you.

124
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,993
It's quite luxurious.

125
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,523
It's so nice.

126
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:36,985
It's so luxurious.

127
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:40,029
Anyway,

128
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:42,821
I guess it isn't very busy at this time.

129
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:46,975
Business isn't doing so well these days.

130
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:50,540
Monthly rent?

131
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,022
Big deposit?

132
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:54,984
If you paid a big deposit for this place, it must have been expensive.

133
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:58,297
Would it be around 200 million won (≈ $180,000)?

134
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,540
I paid a big deposit.

135
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:08,918
If business isn't doing so well, you can just come to Paris with me.

136
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:11,920
Don't get stressed out about it.

137
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:21,050
I need to go back to work now.

138
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,961
I'll be back.

139
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,968
Let's see each other every day.

140
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,171
Yes.

141
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:02,361
You should at least eat kimchi with it. How pitiful.

142
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:04,113
Thank you.

143
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:14,914
Oh my. Your cooking is just so good.

144
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,916
It was sent by your mother.

145
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,478
Oh.

146
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:25,104
It's been so long since I've had a home-cooked meal.

147
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:30,230
Are you still good at making that squid and radish soup?

148
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,342
Can I come eat it sometime?

149
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:35,154
You only need to put out one more spoon.

150
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:37,097
Don't even think about it.

151
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,029
Only in your dreams.

152
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:41,990
Gosh.

153
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,363
You need to shave.

154
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,290
You look so messy.

155
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,553
Before summer break, you need to turn in your list of extracurricular activities.

156
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,216
- Yes.
- Yes.

157
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:59,219
But there's someone who didn't sign up for any yet.

158
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,909
Seo Ro Bin,

159
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,103
since you transferred here in the middle of the semester,

160
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:04,733
I'll give you some extra time.

161
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,927
Make sure you join one and turn in your list.

162
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,237
Yes.

163
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:11,040
Enjoy the rest of your day.

164
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,882
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

165
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,885
That's why you should've listened to me.

166
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:29,988
Since you need to join something, go ahead and write down your name.

167
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,321
AOA Rocks

168
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:34,993
Hurry up.

169
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:37,426
AOA Rocks
President An Mi Nam

170
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,872
Now, before we begin our meeting,

171
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:47,426
we will present a membership card to the newest member of our club.

172
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,141
Seo Ro Bin, please come up to the front.

173
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:53,972
I don't need it.

174
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:59,680
No, you need it.

175
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,661
I don't want it.

176
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,833
Before we begin our activities,

177
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,346
we will recite the lyrics of AOA's newest song

178
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:19,099
with a reverent attitude.

179
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,640
Bingle Bangle

180
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,771
"Hey, baby"

181
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:25,085
"Come on, don't be shy"

182
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,346
"Tell me about yourself"

183
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,628
"This fantastic feeling"

184
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:33,693
"Your eyes are nailed on me"

185
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:36,145
"I can tell but I act like I can't"

186
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:39,428
Next, we will learn the choreography

187
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:43,222
of AOA's new song "Bingle Bangle."

188
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,381
This is the most important part.

189
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:55,685
Shake your hips

190
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,837
Bingle bangle

191
00:12:57,837 --> 00:13:00,259
Give a short bounce to your hips,

192
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,972
and make sure your hands are like a cat's.

193
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:04,845
Five, six, seven, eight.

194
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:07,936
♪ Shake your hips ♪

195

That's right.

198
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,273
One more time.

Of, O.

202
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,461
Angels, A.

203
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:24,272
AOA rocks!

204
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:29,369
We're done, right? I'll get going.

205
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,194
Urgent Notice

206
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:38,717
There's an urgent notice. We need to go to the Internet café.

207
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,431
You need to come too.

208
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,143
It's first come, first served, based on comments.

209
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:45,534
- Help us.
- No thanks.

210
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:49,519
- I'm going to leave this club.
- Please help us out.

211
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,492
Just help us comment. I'll pay for the games.

212
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:54,954
You can post one comment and then play games.

213
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:56,485
Please.

214
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,818
Come on. Please.

215
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,260
Let's go. Help us. I'll buy you snacks.

216
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,362
Come with us.

217
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:11,511
Are you ready?

218
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:16,196
Seo Ro Bin, come on. You need to loosen up your hands too.

219
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:17,717
No thanks.

220
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,670
I'm going to write one line and play games.

221
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:24,675
We have five seconds left. Five, four,

222
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:28,758
three, two, one. Go!

223
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:34,534
Darn it.

224
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:35,925
- Did you get it?
- No.

225
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,488
I didn't get it either.

226
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:39,929
Gosh, I failed again.

227
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,501
- Me too.
- Same here.

228
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:47,796
Robin Hood

229
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:51,200
Number 98, ID Robin Hood?

230
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:54,403
- Isn't this you?
- Yes, it is.

231
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,548
- We got it!
- Oh my gosh!

232
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:01,992
- You've got some lucky hands.
- You're amazing.

233
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,963
This is great.

234
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,806
Let's go now.

235
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,868
Where?

236
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:11,021
They're handing out tickets in front of the agency's building.

237
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:13,053
We need your student ID.

238
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,514
Come with us one last time. Please?

239
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,876
I don't want to.

240
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,278
I'll give you my student ID. That's enough, right?

241
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,550
You need to be there in person.

242
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,823
You and I look completely different

243
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,026
from head to toe.

244
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,419
Please.

245
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,270
Come on.

246
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,480
This is the last time.

247
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,133
No, I don't want to.

248
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:42,882
Nothing is working out for me.

249
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:46,020
- Don't cry.
- Don't be sad.

250
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,888
It's really the last time.

251
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:53,213
Thank you.

252
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,935
You're such a good friend. Thank you.

253
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,717
We can't go because we have to go to the cram school,

254
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:00,250
but our president is in your hands, Ro Bin.

Mina, Mi Nam

259
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:27,678
What's that?

260
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,488
I stole it from my dad.

261
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:32,432
He goes around taking pictures sometimes.

262
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:36,875
That's a nice camera.

263
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,219
I'll take pictures and upload them, so you can look at them if you want.

264
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:43,582
The quality is on another level.

265
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,621
Hey, I'm looking at the manager's social media account,

266
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:54,254
and it looks like the members will be stopping by today.

267
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,534
- No way.
- Oh, my gosh.

268
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,947
Then we can see them today?

269
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:00,189
- We'll see our goddesses.
- I'm so nervous.

270
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:02,240
- What do I do?
- Oh my.

271
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,002
Their car is here.

272
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,791
Nuna Mina!

273
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,805
Nuna Mina, I'll make you happy.

274
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:17,157
You remember me, right? I can make you happy.

275
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:19,460
Let's be happy together!

276
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,142
- Hey, are you all right?
- Are you all right?

277
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,564
Yes.

278
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:37,287
He's so lucky.

279
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,097
Number 87.

280
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:45,445
Do you need any help? If you call out the number, I'll hand them out.

281
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:48,037
All right. Thanks again.

282
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:49,699
Number 88.

283
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,182
Wait, isn't that Maem Ma Ma?

284
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:54,835
She's the promoter of the fan club.

285
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:57,087
She's close to the agency employees.

286
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:00,010
She's close to all the members too. Isn't that amazing?

287
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,692
She's such a successful fan.

288
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:05,064
- I'm envious.
- Number 93.

289
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:07,226
Here you go.

290
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:09,638
Number 98.

291
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:15,180
Number 100.

292
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,041
I'll really get going now.

293
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,213
Thanks so much, buddy.

294
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:35,085
You're Mi Nam, right?

295
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:37,026
Maem Ma Ma?

296
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:38,668
You know me?

297
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:42,382
Of course I do. You're known as the one who shouts, "I'll make you happy."

298
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,520
Really?

299
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:48,527
That's a very nice camera.

300
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,972
I'm going to take lots of pictures during these promotions.

301
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:57,640
Your effort will really cheer up the members.

302
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:03,572
Mina really liked what you said earlier.

303
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:05,544
She did?

304
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,168
Mina really saw me?

305
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:11,210
Of course. They're always watching their fans.

306
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:13,642
Hold on.

307
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:17,896
Hello? Oh, Mina?

308
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,440
Yes.

309
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,003
Even if you feel down, hang in there.

310
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:28,107
Feel free to call me anytime. Okay, bye.

311
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,922
Was that really Mina?

312
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,476
Yes. Out of all the members, I'm closest to Mina.

313
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,118
Oh my gosh.

314
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:44,022
Did Mina say she's feeling down?

315
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:47,647
Yes, Mina is struggling these days.

316
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:50,940
It would be nice if someone like you could help her out.

317
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,303
What? Me?

318
00:19:57,808 --> 00:19:59,660
Save my number.

319
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,682
I think we'll meet again soon.

320
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,333
I'll see you next time.

321
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:06,355
Maem Ma Ma

322
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:17,376
Your mom is overseas? Where is she?

323
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:20,360
She's in Jordan right now.

324
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,781
Jordan?

325
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:24,560
Where is that?

326
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,950
Is it a cold country?

327
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:30,800
No, it's probably hot since it's a desert.

328
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh, it's a desert.

329
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:37,095
There's a lot of dusty wind there,

330
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,079
so I think a scarf would be great, as you had suggested.

331
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,221
I know, right?

332
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:44,193
My mom always covers her face with a scarf when it's sunny.

333
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,160
She doesn't want to get freckles.

334
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:48,897
Shall we choose one then?

335
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:57,620
What do you think of this one?

336
00:20:58,267 --> 00:20:59,319
No, no.

337
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:02,861
My mom likes colorful ones.

338
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:08,958
What about this one?

339
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,279
It's pretty nice.

340
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,863
I think you look better covered up.

341
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:15,614
What did you say?

342
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:17,290
I'm just kidding.

343
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:21,100
- What about this?
- This is nice too.

344
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,892
- What about this one?
- It's cute.

345
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,607
One, two...

346
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,511
Three... One...

347
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:43,662
Why is this so hard for me?

348
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:45,994
Ro Bin will scold me.

349
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:52,782
Three...

350
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:55,905
One, two, three, four.

351
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:26,105
One, two, three, four.

352
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:28,708
One, two...

353
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,581
Ji Na, let's go.

354
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:33,452
You're here.

355
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,195
Aren't you hungry? I'll buy you something yummy.

356
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:37,577
Okay.

357
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:40,120
This tonkatsu* looks good.
(Japanese dish: a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet)

358
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,721
Let me slice it for you.

359
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:58,648
Eat up.

360
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:00,740
Ro Bin is so lucky.

361
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,343
- Why?
- He has a hyeong like you.

362
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:07,025
I wish I had an oppa like you.

363
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:12,863
Eat up.

364
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:14,524
Thanks.

365
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:25,550
There's only one piece left.

366
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:29,430
- You can have it.
- No, you can have it.

367
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:34,260
Then let's play rock-paper-scissors. The winner can have it.

368
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,155
Okay.

369
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,758
Rock, paper, scissors.

370
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:41,360
Nice.

371
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,071
How sad.

372
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:46,206
The last piece is always the best.

373
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:58,658
What was that? I'm full.

374
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,813
Are you feeling sick?

375
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:16,855
Why do you look so tired?

376
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:21,190
Today was really exhausting.

377
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,122
Don't talk to me.

378
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:32,661
Come to the rooftop. We need to practice.

379
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:40,489
One, two,

380
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,782
three, four.

381
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:44,574
One, two,

382
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:47,017
three...

383
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,779
Why can't I do this?

384
00:24:57,336 --> 00:24:59,169
Okay, one, two...

385
00:25:01,882 --> 00:25:04,764
One, two, three, four.

386
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:09,848
When did you get here?

387
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,102
Don't laugh at me.

388
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:16,335
I've been practicing since yesterday.

389
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:19,189
No way. Are you sure you practiced?

390
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:22,091
I'm serious. I practiced until dawn.

391
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:23,912
That's amazing.

392
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:25,555
But you're still like this?

393
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:28,408
I don't know. I have no control over my legs.

394
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:30,219
I can't control them.

395
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:53,411
Relax your body and move along with the rhythm.

396
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:55,614
Watch closely.

397
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:29,198
That was great.

398
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:31,551
You're really amazing.

399
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:33,933
You're good at everything except studying.

400
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:37,756
It's not that I can't study. I just choose not to.

401
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:39,998
Stop showing off.

402
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,023
Here. Stand up.

403
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:55,874
Let's start.

404
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:00,791
One, two, three, four.

405
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,842
One, two,

406
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,955
three, four.

407
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,717
One, two, three.

408
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:12,252
Relax your body and move slowly.

409
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,092
Let's try this again.

410
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:19,148
One, two, three, four.

411
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,232
Why is this so difficult for you?

412
00:27:24,232 --> 00:27:25,606
I don't get why you can't do this.

413
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:27,767
Let's try again.

414
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:32,241
- One, two, three...
- One, two...

415
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:46,796
This happened again.

416
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,539
What is this? It's a thief.

417
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,102
- Mom!
- Wait.

418
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,333
It's a thief! Mom!

419
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,536
Mom, it's a thief!

420
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:58,297
Wait!

421
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:13,102
Sorry, I made you get caught up in laundry again.

422
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,142
This is Mina's private social media account.

423
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:43,744
She's struggling these days,

424
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:47,207
so I think it would be nice if you could be her secret friend.

425
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:50,029
Mina will respond if you send her a DM.

426
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:54,770
Her agency can't know about this, so keep it a secret. Got it?

427
00:28:55,493 --> 00:28:57,697
Unbelievable.

428
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:59,569
This is really hers.

429
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:11,231
I'm the fan who always shouts, "I'll make you happy."

430
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:20,299
I know. You're Mi Nam,

431
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,983
who's always cheering me on with the loudest voice.

432
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:25,975
Will you be my secret friend?

433
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:32,342
You can't rest.

434
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:34,234
I'll get you water,

435
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:36,185
so keep practicing and don't rest.

436
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:52,361
[Epilogue]
- Two, two, three, four. One...
- Two, two, three, four.

437
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,985
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

438
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:57,277
- Two, two, three, four.
- Two, two, three, four.

439
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:01,961
- One, two, three, four...
- One, two, three, four, five...

440
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:08,539
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I...

441
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,490
- No.
- Oh my.
