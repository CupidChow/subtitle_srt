00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,600
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,000
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,900
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,001
How annoying.

5
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,263
How long am I going to have to do this?

6
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:44,843
Gosh.

7
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,061
Isn't Su Ji super-rich beyond our imagination?

8
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:55,686
I know, right? She's the one
who plagiarized and accused someone else.

9
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:58,067
And all she got was volunteer work.

10
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:06,076
Hey, who threw that? Who was it?

11
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:08,067
Does it matter who threw it?

12
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,379
Picking up trash is the punishment you got.

13
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,771
- Just pick it up.
- That's right.

14
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:16,115
Clean up well and make sure it's spotless.

15
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,610
Mo Ra Hae! Na Na Ri!

16
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,496
Na Ri! Ra Hae!

17
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:28,558
Hey, stop right there!

18
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:30,299
Hey!

19
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:34,714
How could you do this to me?

20
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:36,817
After all I've done for you...

21
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:38,889
I'm Geum Su Ji!

22
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:41,771
Do you think I'm just going to let this go?

23
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:43,694
- You little...
- What—

24
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:46,026
Who do you think you are to be complaining like this?

25
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:47,868
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

26
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:51,321
Mom, how long do I have to do this?

27
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:54,535
All the other kids are making fun of me and looking down on me.

28
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:58,417
Hey, you're the one who did this. Why are you making me clean up your mess?

29
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:00,631
Mom...

30
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:03,753
I'm so upset. Come here my baby.

31
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:06,485
Who did this to my baby?

32
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:09,108
Don't worry. Mommy will solve everything.

33
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:10,440
Really?

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,673
You're all I have, Mom.

35
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:16,727
Get rid of these dirty tools.

36
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:19,499
Those awful people!

37
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,067
Oh my!

38
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:30,490
What happened to "ladies first"?
I'm a lady!

39
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,613
I'm turning 60 soon!

40
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:33,913
What happened to "elders first"?

41
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:35,795
You old geezer!

42
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:39,258
- Out of my way!
- Oh my! You're insane!

43
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,970
Although

44
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,975
we had a bit of a misunderstanding

45
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:49,127
due to certain events the last time we met,

46
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,252
we should be constructive, forget the past

47
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:56,787
and continue to move forward.

48
00:02:56,787 --> 00:02:58,888
That's what I think.

49
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,641
Of course.

50
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:05,794
We can't have a rift in our partnership, right, Principal?

51
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:08,167
Did anything even happen last time?

52
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:11,310
I don't remember a thing.

53
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,364
That little snake.

54
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:18,026
How could I trust you?

55
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:27,647
Aside from that, Principal,

56
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:32,061
how long does my Su Ji have to keep cleaning?

57
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,524
She only did those things because she's young

58
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:37,206
and wanted to look good to her teachers.

59
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:40,531
Isn't this punishment too cruel?

60
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:42,963
Well, you see,

61
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:46,816
there were too many people who witnessed this incident.

62
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,897
Oh my.

63
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:50,991
Su Ji is reflecting very hard on her actions.

64
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:55,325
She was bawling to me earlier telling me it was all her fault.

65
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:57,677
My innocent child...

66
00:03:57,677 --> 00:04:00,019
My poor little baby...

67
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,643
All right then.

68
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,664
If Geum Su Ji is

69
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:08,207
reflecting that deeply on her actions,

70
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,260
I believe it's my duty as an educator

71
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,394
to give her another chance.

72
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:17,446
I'll make sure everything goes back to normal.

73
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,267
Don't worry.

74
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,784
I knew it, Principal, that you are a true educator.

75
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:27,726
I knew you would do this for me.

76
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,349
Out of my respect for you,

77
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,823
I've prepared a present for you.

78
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:34,710
A present?

79
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,878
The laws nowadays are so strict,

80
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,909
so I can't be accepting these.

81
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,941
Open it.

82
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:50,500
Thank you for the thought.

83
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,463
Nowadays, a portrait like this costs

84
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:56,045
millions of won (thousands of dollars).

85
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:00,058
- Something like this?
- Yes, a portrait like this.

86
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:04,212
That's why people say nowadays that art is a form of investment.

87
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:08,447
But,

88
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:11,551
is it right for me to accept such an expensive present?

89
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,484
Just say that it's a fake.

90
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:17,546
And as long as you and I keep

91
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:22,200
our lips sealed about this secret, who would even know?

92
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,205
- That's right.
- Also,

93
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:28,988
as for selecting the food provider for the school cafeteria,

94
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:30,631
please put in a good word.

95
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:34,643
Of course. Don't worry about that.

96
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:39,140
I really like how they drew my eyes in this picture.

97
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,192
They say that eyes are the windows to the soul.

98
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:45,273
My eyes are very clear.

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,350
Welcome.

100
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,871
Hello.

101
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:08,327
Hello. I opened up a flower shop right next door.

102
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,341
I brought some rice cakes for you to celebrate its opening.

103
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,715
So the construction was for a flower shop?

104
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:17,386
- Yes, it was.
- Oh my.

105
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,249
Thank you for the rice cakes.

106
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,891
My name is Chae Song Hwa. Since we're next door to each other,

107
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,113
I look forward to being neighbors.

108
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:27,846
I'm looking forward to it as well.

109
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,698
My goodness.

110
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:32,932
You look exactly like these rice cakes.

111
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:35,053
Oh my.

112
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:37,326
Do you think I'm a rice cake?

113
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:39,088
I'm a flower!

114
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:41,210
Oh my! Mister!

115
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,173
You're too funny!

116
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:45,344
Oh, my apologies.

117
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:48,497
You just remind me so much of my oppa. I'm sorry.

118
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:51,770
Well, I am technically still older than you.

119
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,403
Just think of me as an oppa.

120
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:56,145
Is that all right?

121
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,429
Oppa...

122
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:06,165
Since you're going to open a flower shop,

123
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:09,830
could I ask you something?

124
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:22,151
What's going on? Who's that woman?

125
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:28,157
I learned it but it was so difficult for me.

126
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,040
Not at all.

127
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,872
You're here.

128
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,684
Why are you so shocked?

129
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:38,008
It's almost like you got caught doing something bad.

130
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:40,019
What do you mean?

131
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,691
I'm just happy to see you.

132
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,522
Forget it.

133
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:45,745
But who is this lady?

134
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:49,269
Hello. You're the owner of the real estate office, aren't you?

135
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,141
I'm Chae Song Hwa.

136
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:54,393
I opened the flower shop next door, "Life's Like a Flower."

137
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:56,976
Yes. Hello.

138
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,639
So you're the owner of Life's Like a Flower.

139
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,763
I would've given you a good deal if you had contracted at my office.

140
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:06,436
What a shame.

141
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:08,647
I know, right?

142
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,950
Then I'll be going along.

143
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,452
Leave these here.

144
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,265
I'll deliver them to you.

145
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:17,197
What kind of convenience store delivers?

146
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,050
She bought a lot of items because she needs to prepare

147
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,881
for the opening of her store.

148
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,093
Just leave them. I'll bring them over.

149
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:25,864
Will you do that for me?

150
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:28,417
Thank you, Oppa.

151
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,434
"Oppa"?

152
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,830
She said I remind her a lot of her oppa.

153
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,031
So I told her to call me "oppa."

154
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:44,534
Gosh, how nice for you.

155
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:47,697
Now you suddenly have a younger sister. How nice.

156
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:50,199
Does it bother you a lot?

157
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:52,372
Should I tell her not to call me that?

158
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,124
Bother me?

159
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:57,636
Someone's going around telling me that life's like a flower.

160
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,130
But to me, life's just like a weed.

161
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,631
Goodness.

162
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,134
I can't believe this.

163
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:08,277
Gosh, her temper...

164
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:12,311
Are you a bee or something? You just walk in and sting me every time.

165
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:16,616
No, right?

166
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,998
Wait, is she jealous?

167
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,073
No matter how I see it, it looks like she's jealous.

168
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,387
Which one should I pick?

169
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:33,392
I wondered why you kept going on about coming to a bowling alley.

170
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:36,085
Hey, An Mi Nam, you're just here to show off, aren't you?

171
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:39,489
How can you just study all the time? You need to enjoy yourself too.

172
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:41,772
I was thinking about you guys when I suggested it.

173
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:45,030
And I am pretty good at bowling as well.

174
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:56,265
Ro Bin, you must be pretty good at bowling.

175
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:57,917
How unusual.

176
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:01,261
Of course, you're no match for me.

177
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:04,403
How does betting on a match sound?

178
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,087
The loser treats the winner like a boss for the entire day. How about it?

179
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,929
Why would we bet?

180
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,330
Seo Ro Bin,

181
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,092
are you chickening out?

182
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:17,527
An Mi Nam looks like he'd be better at bowling.

183
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:22,130
- I think so too.
- I think Ro Bin's going to win.

184
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,523
Me too.

185
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,735
I think Ro Bin's going to win.

186
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,680
Okay. Let's do it.

187
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:48,888
Yes!

188
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,742
- An Mi Nam!
- You're so good!

189
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:52,662
- Come sit down.
- Awesome!

190
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:54,373
Why are you so down?

191
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:55,766
Are you losing confidence

192
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:58,737
after seeing the great Mi Nam bowl?

193
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,990
I'm not confident...

194
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,635
that I'm going to lose to you.

195
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,601
- Awesome!
- That was amazing.

196
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,882
- Hey.
- Are you kidding me?

197
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:29,308
You're pretty good.

198
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,207
He's so good.

199
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:41,662
- Wow.
- He's better.

200
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,632
I can't believe it.

201
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,676
- Hey.
- What's with him?

202
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,832
This can't be right.

203
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:00,640
What are you doing?

204
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,603
Hyeongnim, please have a seat.

205
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:06,626
All right, work hard.

206
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,438
Yes, Hyeongnim!

207
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,681
Should we split into two teams and play a game?

208
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:14,093
- Okay.
- Actually,

209
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:16,035
I'm not good at bowling, so I'll sit out.

210
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,787
Then you sit out too, Ro Bin.

211
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:19,708
If you join, it's unfair.

212
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,931
First you put your right foot out.

213
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,824
Then as you put your left foot forward,

214
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,317
extend your left arm.

215
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:30,870
- Like this?
- Yes.

216
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,713
Then with the ball in your right hand, pull back.

217
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:38,548
And maintain your posture as you roll it.

218
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:43,160
Not like that.

219
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,574
Okay, so first,

220
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:47,276
put your right foot in front.

221
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,140
Put your right foot in front.

222
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,193
My heart is doing it again.

223
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:57,526
If I die, it'll be of a heart attack.

224
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:00,479
Lower your position.

225
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,312
Then roll it. Extend all the way.

226
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:06,890
Then pull the ball back, and roll it.

227
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:09,618
Don't do it like earlier.

228
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:13,380
Roll the ball between pins one and three.

229
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:20,299
Ro Bin has really long eyelashes.

230
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,292
They're twice as long as mine.

231
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,732
Got it?

232
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:26,355
Okay, got it.

233
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:57,127
Goodness.

234
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,775
I knew this would happen.

235
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:37,730
Surprise!

236
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,680
Mom! When did you get here?

237
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,522
Not too long ago.

238
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:44,514
How long as it been?

239
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:47,736
I missed you, my son.

240
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,272
You really surprised me.

241
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:56,275
You should have contacted me. I would have at least picked you up.

242
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:59,548
I purposely didn't so I could surprise you.

243
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:02,871
And I was curious how you boys were living too.

244
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:06,715
The house is a little dirty, isn't it?

245
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:09,358
We were going to clean after our test today.

246
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:12,091
It's fine. I did it all.

247
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,025
But it's not as bad as I thought it would be.

248
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:17,796
- You must have had a hard time.
- Not at all.

249
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:20,089
What about Dad? He didn't come with you?

250
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,292
I'll tell you about that
after Ro Bin comes home.

251
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,015
We have really good news.

252
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:29,158
Go wash up. I'll cook you a meal for the first time in a while.

253
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:45,364
I just got a strike. Did you see it?

254
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:48,748
You've really got the skills for bowling.

255
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,949
I shouldn't have been so silly.

256
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:52,871
Give me some tips next time.

257
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:56,600
How are you so good?

258
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,118
I'll get going.

259
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:09,939
Here.

260
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:12,982
What is this?

261
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:14,893
Your birthday present.

262
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:17,087
You knew about my birthday?

263
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:19,197
I'm touched.

264
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:28,670
It's exactly the same as the one I lost.

265
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:31,290
How did you get this?

266
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,033
I couldn't find it when I tried to buy another one.

267
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,180
I found it.

268
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:57,377
Really?

269
00:16:57,377 --> 00:17:01,230
I just saw it while passing by and bought it for you.

270
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,128
Take this.

271
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,373
I only like you

272
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:16,566
as a friend.

273
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,830
I want to continue just being friends.

274
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:26,585
Is it okay for me to be accepting this?

275
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:29,848
What's wrong? You don't like it?

276
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,472
If you don't like it, I can change it to something else.

277
00:17:32,472 --> 00:17:35,425
No, I like it. I really do.

278
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,227
Give it to me.

279
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:55,004
Don't lose it this time.

280
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:57,626
I won't. Thank you.

281
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,589
Pretty.

282
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:02,992
Really?

283
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:05,574
The bracelet is pretty.

284
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:08,608
I was talking about the bracelet too! Gosh.

285
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,112
It looks good on you.

286
00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:15,204
Right? I think it is really pretty.

287
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:18,507
Seo Ro Bin! Oh Ji Na! What are you doing?

288
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:26,455
What do you mean?

289
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:29,910
You scared me. Stop sneaking around.

290
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:34,034
You two seem very suspicious.

291
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:35,985
Why? What is it?

292
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:39,079
You know. They seem all

293
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,541
awkward and shy

294
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,004
yet so close to each other.

295
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:45,905
Really?

296
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:50,390
You two aren't dating, are you?

297
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,780
For real?

298
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,165
"Principal Go Jin Sang was biased and unfair during the plagiarism

299
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,747
incident that occurred on school grounds.

300
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,378
On the grounds of attacking a student's character,

301
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:02,441
the Board of Disciplinary Action has sent this notice."

302
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:09,729
Who could be the one defaming me into a villain?

303
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,801
Who could have snitched on me?

304
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:16,236
It's got to be one of the teachers at our school.

305
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:22,752
Principal Go Jin Sang

306
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,470
There's no doubt it's one of them.

307
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,312
But who is it?

308
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:37,937
Mr. Lee?

309
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:39,309
No way.

310
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,460
Mr. Choi?

311
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,700
Ms. Jeong?

312
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:49,800
She's not high enough on the ladder to do that.

313
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,565
Yes, Ms. Maeng.

314
00:19:58,057 --> 00:20:01,620
Is she sending an e-mail to the Board?

315
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:07,536
Ms. Maeng looks so lost all the time.

316
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:10,850
She just acts all nice. I didn't think she was like that.

317
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,850
Anyway, I don't like both the students and the teacher of this class.

318
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:18,488
Yes?

319
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:25,414
Principal, you called?

320
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:27,636
Yes, Mr. Lee.

321
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:32,591
I gave it a lot of thought,

322
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:36,015
but punishment isn't the only answer in this field.

323
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:40,749
So release that freshman Geum Su Ji from her punishment today.

324
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:42,302
Already?

325
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:44,403
She has a few days left.

326
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:49,409
Geum Su Ji is reflecting very deeply over her actions.

327
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:52,551
So... If students reflect on their misdeeds,

328
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,163
rather than punishing them,

329
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:57,146
we should lead them through forgiveness and understanding.

330
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,428
Don't you think?

331
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:02,551
Release Geum Su Ji from her punishment. Carry on.

332
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:03,803
But her actions were—

333
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:06,515
Forget that. Just go do it.

334
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:30,129
- Mom?
- My son.

335
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:33,303
Give me a hug. It's been too long.

336
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,510
When did you get here? You didn't even call.

337
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,584
I rushed to get here, so I couldn't.

338
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:47,267
Ro Bin, have you been doing well while I was gone?

339
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:48,568
Yes.

340
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:51,660
How long are you staying in Korea for?

341
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,274
Why? Do you want me to leave quickly?

342
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,570
No, that's not it.

343
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,128
I'll wash up first.

344
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:10,590
He's become so cold.

345
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,494
I miss the old Ro Bin.

346
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,491
Dad went to the States for work.

347
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:24,733
It went well.

348
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:28,308
So we're all going to be moving to the States.

349
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:29,888
What?

350
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,482
- What?
- The States?

351
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:34,353
- All of a sudden?
- When we go this time,

352
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,957
we need to be there for a long time. We can't just leave you here forever.

353
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,880
When are we going?

354
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,211
Not right away, right?

355
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:44,263
Your dad's workplace is going to help out.

356
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:47,125
I think it'll happen quicker than you think.

357
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,830
So in the meantime, do what you have to do before you leave.

358
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,583
What's wrong?

359
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,174
You don't want to go?

360
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:59,650
I thought you would like this news.

361
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,753
No, we do want to go.

362
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:04,964
It's just so sudden.

363
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:06,990
I don't want to go.

364
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:11,551
I'm going to stay in Korea.

365
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:13,973
- What?
- Ro Bin,

366
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:16,265
what are you talking about?

367
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:18,687
You're going to stay in Korea?

368
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:22,250
Yes. I can live by myself.

369
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,852
Take Je Yi with you.

370
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:26,215
Ro Bin.

371
00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:28,818
Stay here. I'll go talk to him.

372
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,518
You looked like you were dying for a few days.

373
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,392
What's with you shaking your butt around the house now?

374
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:46,715
Sa Na.

375
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:49,428
If a boy gets a girl water,

376
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,602
buys her presents, and tells her she's pretty,

377
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:55,294
they're dating, right?

378
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:01,740
Did the boy ask her to be his girlfriend?

379
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,694
No. That didn't happen.

380
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,987
Then, no.

381
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:12,170
Unless they say "I like you" and ask each other out, it's just flirting.

382
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:16,445
Do you have to say that kind of stuff?

383
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:20,120
If you like each other, can't you just get each other with just a look?

384
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,583
There's a lot of kids out there who stop at that stage.

385
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,715
Don't get yourself hurt

386
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:29,428
and ask the boy out, get what you need, and be clear about it.

387
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:34,032
But who is it? Who's the guy you're flirting with?

388
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:37,726
Is it someone that I know too?

389
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,519
No. It's nothing.

390
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,152
This is suspicious.

391
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:43,592
Ji Na, Sa Na.

392
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:45,945
Go get the laundry from upstairs.

393
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:47,946
Okay, Mom.

394
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,428
Let's go.

395
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:09,090
Seo Ro Bin.

396
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,600
Stop acting out.

397
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,423
Stop acting like a child in front of Mom.

398
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:15,264
What? Like a child?

399
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,157
You're acting like a complete child now.

400
00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:21,931
You're whining that you don't want to go to the States.

401
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:24,644
I could tell you were trying to tell her that you're having a hard time.

402
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:26,675
What do you know?

403
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,059
- Do you know how I feel?
- I don't.

404
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:32,030
That's why I couldn't say anything until now.

405
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,564
But you've crossed the line.

406
00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:37,730
You need to grow up, Seo Ro Bin.

407
00:25:41,602 --> 00:25:44,073
So this is what you really think.

408
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:45,565
Fine.

409
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:49,247
Why don't you stop pretending to be the kind older brother?

410
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,540
You're not my real brother.

411
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:55,190
What did you just say?

412
00:25:56,124 --> 00:25:59,528
Wouldn't it be better for you if I wasn't around?

413
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:01,722
Mom only needs you.

414
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:04,594
What did you just say? You little...

415
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:19,650
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:21,892
You take back what you said too.

417
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:23,282
Why?

418
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:25,774
It's true.

419
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:28,747
You and I, we're strangers.

420
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:31,020
Seo Ro Bin, what's with you?

421
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:44,160
Darn it.

422
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:49,800
Ro Bin.

423
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:13,932
I'm sorry, Oppa.

424
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,700
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

425
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:20,840
It's okay. Why would you be sorry?

426
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,270
But,

427
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:26,215
is what Oppa Ro Bin said

428
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,017
true?

429
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:34,780
Yes.

430
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:38,970
Ro Bin's real parents passed away when he was little.

431
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:42,360
So my parents adopted him.

432
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:47,176
Did you know from the very beginning?

433
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:48,698
No.

434
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,052
We didn't know until last year.

435
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:55,310
We saw it by coincidence.

436
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:59,120
But Ro Bin changed a lot after that.

437
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,540
He was a bright little rascal back then.

438
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:17,460
Do you want some pizza?

439
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,398
Thank you.

440
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,351
But aren't you broke?

441
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:24,453
Where did you get the money...

442
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:27,828
I got you, didn't I?

443
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:30,599
I ate the whole pizza by myself.

444
00:28:32,272 --> 00:28:33,483
Seo Ro Bin, you little...

445
00:28:33,483 --> 00:28:35,674
Come here. Get over here.

446
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,076
- Why?
- What's with this?

447
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:38,378
- What's wrong?
- You little...

448
00:28:38,378 --> 00:28:40,300
- Are you kidding me?
- What's wrong with it?

449
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,411
Get over here, you rascal.
