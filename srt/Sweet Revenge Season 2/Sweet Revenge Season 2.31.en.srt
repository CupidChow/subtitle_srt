2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,700
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:33,042
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,295
What do you want?

5
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:38,569
Can't you see that I'm talking to the chairwoman?

6
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:41,001
Yes, I see that very clearly.

7
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,962
Principal,

8
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:45,595
take a look at this.

9
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,426
What is this?

10
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,864
If we do this famine experience,

11
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:55,265
I get some free pocket money.

12
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,937
My goodness, this is so good.

13
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:59,339
W-W-What on earth is this?

14
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:01,221
H-How did you...

15
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:04,013
- W-Wait a minute.
- The money...

16
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,626
W-W-Who put that in my room?

17
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:09,789
Who installed a hidden camera?

18
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:12,451
Go Jin Sang, you can't trust him.

19
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,703
I can watch him with this.

20
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,480
- Why are you—
- Are you crazy?

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,063
- W-Why are you doing this?
- How dare you install a hidden camera?!

22
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:25,865
Do you want to screw us both over?

23
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:27,908
Fine, I did it. It was me!

24
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:30,260
Do you think I would've done this if you weren't so sneaky?

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,391
- Have you lost your mind?!
- Oh, my!

26
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:35,044
The principal is trying to hit a student's parent.

27
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:37,017
You awful jerk!

28
00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:39,239
What is this?

29
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,267
Oh, my. What are you doing?

30
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:50,851
Get away!

31
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,003
How dare she install a hidden camera?

32
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:55,806
She must have lost her mind.

33
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:57,996
What do you think you're doing?

34
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,649
What's going on?

35
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:06,736
What's going on? Move!

36
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:08,948
- No.
- We won't move.

37
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:11,732
What? Get out of the way.

38
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:12,843
You little...

39
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:15,975
Do you all want to be expelled?

40
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:21,671
What are y-you doing here?

41
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,383
You're not a teacher anymore.

42
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:24,824
It's all over.

43
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:25,906
Now, stop it.

44
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,357
What do you mean, it's over?

45
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:29,579
The hidden camera video from your office has already been leaked,

46
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,892
and the Board of Education is investigating everything.

47
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:35,516
What are you talking about? It's all fabricated.

48
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:38,148
The evidence I have is enough

49
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:40,961
to get you arrested, Principal.

50
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,343
H-How dare you speak such nonsense?

51
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:44,974
Move!

52
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,927
I told you to move!

53
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,281
Don't mess with our kids!

54
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,632
What's going on? What are you both doing?

55
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:12,903
You need to come with us.

56
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:14,203
W-What...

57
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:15,906
What do you think you're doing?

58
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:17,407
Do you know who I am?!

59
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,899
- Let go of me!
- Stop.

60
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,119
Why are you doing this?!

61
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:22,292
I'm a Women's College graduate.

62
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,514
Which police station are you from? Let go of me!

63
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,365
- You can come with us and talk.
- Oh, no!

64
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:27,918
Honey,

65
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:31,020
they are dragging me somewhere!

66
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:34,383
Can you believe what the principal did?

67
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:35,474
How could he?

68
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:39,038
Unbelievable. How could this happen?

69
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,250
Everyone, our school is on the news.

70
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,202
- What?
- Oh, my gosh. Let me see.

71
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:45,454
- I can't see.
- Let me see, too.

72
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,796
- Go away.
- Gosh.

73
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:51,050
- Look.
 - Mr. Go, the principal of H High School

74
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,783
in Seoul, has been detained

75
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:54,535
for illegally hiring a teacher

76
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,787
after receiving tens of millions of won worth of money and goods.

77
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:59,540
Mr. Go is suspected of hiring a teacher

78
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,551
in return for tens of million won given to him by Ms. Lee,

79
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:03,623
the parent of one of the students.

80
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:06,005
It has been further revealed that he accepted bribes

81
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:08,458
from a school lunch provider to manipulate the prices of ingredients

82
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,612
and to allow the use of low-quality ingredients.

83
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:14,895
He overworked me, saying he would promote me to a full-time position.

84
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:18,078
He then told me to make a donation.

85
00:04:18,078 --> 00:04:22,082
And he always messed with the students' lunches.

86
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:25,335
Mrs. Lee, who asked Mr. Go to commit these illegal acts,

87
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:28,338
is also being charged for bribery and fraud.

88
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:31,801
On a good day, he would insult me before I left work.

89
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,883
He wouldn't hit me on those days.

90
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:35,445
Mrs. Lee, the wife of the CEO

91
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:37,828
- of the school lunch provider in question,
- Get rid of the camera.

92
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:39,759
is also revealed to have repeatedly

93
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,003
- assaulted her driver.
- I'm from Golden Spoon Foods!

94
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,344
This is one of the many cases

95
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:48,317
these days involving the abuse of power.

96
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:51,951
There is a growing voice calling for severe punishment.

97
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:55,284
Hey, Geum Su Ji, isn't that about your mom?

98
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:56,806
What are you talking about?

99
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:58,499
She's not my mom.

100
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,789
She just looks like her.

101
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:02,792
We all know what your mom looks like.

102
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,625
The school lunch provider mentioned in the news

103
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,395
is your dad's company.

104
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:08,759
Don't tell me you knew about our lunches being spoiled

105
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,511
and didn't say anything about it?

106
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:14,403
No, that's not true. I got sick after eating the food, too.

107
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:16,726
You two were there, right?

108
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:18,677
Tell them.

109
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:20,910
I don't know about that. You were originally going

110
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,273
to eat the lunch from the hotel.

111
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,685
That's right. You said you were sick of it

112
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:27,206
and switched lunches with me.

113
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:30,109
You two aren't going to take my side?

114
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:32,942
Do you think you can get away with it by saying you didn't know?

115
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:35,786
It has to do with your family, so you should take responsibility, too.

116
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:38,509
Her parents are at fault.

117
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,661
It's not Geum Su Ji's fault.

118
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:44,202
Are you seriously taking her side right now?

119
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,051
So what?

120
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:55,194
Are you all trying to gang up on me or what?!

121
00:05:55,194 --> 00:05:56,946
I can leave this lame school

122
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:59,329
and go study abroad!

123
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:02,032
- Isn't she crazy?
- My goodness.

124
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,903
- I can't believe her.
- My gosh.

125
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:07,727
- Look at her audacity.
- Why is she the one getting angry?

126
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,279
Geum Su Ji probably won't be able to come back to school, will she?

127
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,712
She won't be able to come back right away this time.

128
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:15,735
I feel like Geum Su Ji really didn't know this time, though.

129
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:18,868
Hey! She deserves it for all that she did in the past.

130
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,181
Since the principal's wrongdoings have all been revealed,

131
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,842
Teacher Maeng would be able to come back, right?

132
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,215
Of course.

133
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:27,146
Oh, my.

134
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:29,499
- It's her!
- Teacher Maeng.

135
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,150
- Yes!
- It's Teacher Maeng!

136
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:35,274
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

137
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:37,968
- We're so happy.
- We're glad to have you back.

138
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:40,039
Are you happy even though we're going to do a lot of math?

139
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:42,111
- Yes!
- Yes!

140
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:45,795
A lot of bad things happened these past few days,

141
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:49,960
but let's stay strong and work hard.

142
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,421
Let's open up our math books then.

143
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,423
- Yes.
- Yes.

144
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,532
Everything has worked out,

145
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:04,664
and Ms. Maeng has returned, too.

146
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,856
So let's have a toast.

147
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:08,207
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

148
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:11,310
The drinks are going in.

149
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,884
How long are you going to make me dance?

150
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:16,155
Drink up.

151
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:21,390
It's a perfect time for drinks.

152
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,654
Apparently, the money that the principal has pocketed so far is enough

153
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:27,326
to buy a house in Gangnam.

154
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:29,479
That is ridiculous. Heol!

155
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,910
I saw it coming,

156
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,273
but I didn't know it was going to be that much.

157
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:35,214
How could an educator of kids

158
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,616
do such a thing?

159
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:40,431
I know, right? I'm glad it all worked out,

160
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:43,342
but I feel quite bitter.

161
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:45,094
He really lives up to his name.

162
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:49,058
He's so obnoxious, isn't he?

163
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:50,860
He makes me ashamed to face my students.

164
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,081
I know.

165
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:54,934
When I think about the kids who didn't see this coming,

166
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,636
I feel so bad for them.

167
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,298
That's right.

168
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,689
By the way,

169
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,891
how did the hidden camera video

170
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,263
from his office get leaked?

171
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:07,137
I know, right? It's so fascinating.

172
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:08,598
Who leaked it?

173
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:10,360
Gosh.

174
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:16,467
Where's Mr. Choi?

175
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,738
Is he fashionably late?

176
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:22,660
No, he should be here by now.

177
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,014
I'm here. Were you all waiting?

178
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,179
Mr. Choi, this is great.

179
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,791
You have returned as a full-time teacher.

180
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,033
Congratulations.

181
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,896
He was always meant to be a full-time teacher.

182
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:38,759
There were just twists and turns along the way.

183
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,382
Congratulations, Mr. Choi.

184
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:45,235
I'd like to announce one more thing

185
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,726
on this good day.

186
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:54,344
We're getting married.

187
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:55,626
Congratulate us.

188
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,737
Oh, my gosh.

189
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,750
When did you start...

190
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,692
How could you surprise us like this?

191
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:06,055
I had a feeling all along.

192
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,888
Congratulations, you two.

193
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,719
Thanks, Maeng.

194
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,762
I'm sorry. As an apology,

195
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:15,625
I will treat you all to two rounds of drinks today.

196
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,436
Two rounds?

197
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:20,751
You're now an engaged man and a full-time teacher.

198
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:21,872
You have so much good news.

199
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:24,082
You should take...

200
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,176
A love shot.

201
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,798
- Love shot.
- Gosh.

202
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,239
- Love shot.
- Don't do this.

203
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:33,082
- Love shot.
- Love shot.

204
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:35,293
- Love shot.
- Gosh.

205
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,135
I'm so glad Teacher Maeng is back.

206
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,598
When she walked into the room,

207
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:50,790
the kids all clapped,

208
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,242
and I almost cried.

209
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:57,827
I think Je Yi is really cool.

210
00:09:57,827 --> 00:10:00,149
Je Yi figured out the password to the hidden camera video,

211
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,042
which basically solved everything.

212
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:04,223
He's pretty amazing the more I think about it.

213
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:07,846
I was the one...

214
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:10,019
who found the hidden camera video.

215
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,881
What? Are you getting jealous?

216
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:12,912
No.

217
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,415
- I think you are.
- No, I'm not.

218
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,877
By the way,

219
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:19,388
isn't this a pretty sweatshirt?

220
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:21,230
Yes, it's cute.

221
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,042
I know, right?

222
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:24,923
I knew you'd say that,

223
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:28,619
so I got you one, too.

224
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:30,389
Taking a picture of us in matching couple sweatshirts is

225
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,392
on my bucket list.

226
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:41,602
It looks so good on you.

227
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:45,344
How can a guy wear this?

228
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,817
You don't want to wear it?

229
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:49,959
Fine then. Don't wear it.

230
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:53,703
Ji Na!

231
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,665
Where are you going?

232
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,481
How can I wear this?

233
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:08,266
She'll get angry if I don't wear it.

234
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:20,038
You put it on.

235
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,949
It looks great on you.

236
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,910
Let's take a picture.

237
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:24,685
What's going on?

238
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,857
Why is this eonni looking at him that way?

239
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:29,047
Eonni Sin Ae,

240
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:30,520
come sit here.

241
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,513
Sa Na, you're here, too.

242
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:35,123
Hi.

243
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,631
Hi.

244
00:12:43,683 --> 00:12:45,124
Hi.

245
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:02,122
It's obvious.

246
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:04,212
She likes him.

247
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:09,880
I guess this clueless oppa doesn't know yet.

248
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,160
Shall I help them?

249
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:20,741
Eonni and Oppa, I have to leave now

250
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,643
because I'm busy.

251
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:24,353
- Did something happen?
- Yes.

252
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:27,627
Aunt is stuck in the bathroom without any toilet paper.

253
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:30,459
Eonni, look after Oppa Je Yi.

254
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,662
Oppa Je Yi, you should grab some food with Sin Ae.

255
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:36,895
I'll get going.

256
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:56,565
A courageous woman wins at love.

257
00:13:57,597 --> 00:14:01,230
Love is right under your nose. Don't let her get away.

258
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:21,421
Sin Ae, can I take a look at your science notes?

259
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,373
I forgot to bring my notebook.

260
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:27,346
Here. I was just using them.

261
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,144
I like Seo Je Yi.

262
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:50,299
It's the handwriting from that note.

263
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,102
What's wrong?

264
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:54,253
Did I get something wrong?

265
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,398
No. You have nice handwriting.

266
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:03,262
Do I?

267
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,070
Can I help you?

268
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,931
I'm fine.

269
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:26,285
Did I make you wait?

270
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,556
No.

271
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,142
I can't believe he's in a suit.

272
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:34,944
He sure looks happy.

273
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,927
Is he about to confess his love or something?

274
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,105
Do you think I'll be able to do well?

275
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:58,056
Of course.

276
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,443
Then do you think

277
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,925
I can confess my love?

278
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:11,290
- Of course. Do it before it's too late.
- I can't believe this.

279
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,482
Hurry and confess your love.

280
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:14,734
Gosh.

281
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:18,607
I'm so nervous.

282
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,241
Do you really think it's okay?

283
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,243
I said it's fine.

284
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,479
Then...

285
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll do it.

286
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,983
Everyone,

287
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:48,558
I'm about to confess...

288
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:51,101
my love today.

289
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,522
Confess?

290
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:54,574
Even if it gets a bit loud,

291
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,766
please be understanding.

292
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:00,380
- Please...
- All right.

293
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,991
It's okay.

294
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,593
I can't believe this.

295
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:06,735
- How brave.
- You are.

296
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,889
I better leave...

297
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:12,470
before I get hurt.

298
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:19,258
Eun Hui.

299
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:33,992
Eun Hui.

300
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:38,697
I love you, Eun Hui.

301
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,581
I love you more now

302
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,933
than the day I met you.

303
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,817
This was...

304
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,402
meant

305
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,793
for me?

306
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,648
Do you like it?

307
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,849
I made this myself

308
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:12,513
just as you like it.

309
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:14,074
Do you like it?

310
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:16,495
You made this yourself?

311
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,408
The florist taught me

312
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:21,781
how to make it, and I did it myself.

313
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,777
So that's why...

314
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:30,348
you were always with her?

315
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:49,700
Congratulations.

316
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,030
Congratulations, Mom.

317
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,322
What's going on?

318
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:54,573
What do you think?

319
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:57,076
Dad prepared a surprise event for you.

320
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:59,388
I found out today, too.

321
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:02,581
Eun Hui...

322
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,554
I have one more thing for you.

323
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,255
What is it?

324
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:25,004
How...

325
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:26,376
The cake is

326
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:29,349
totally my taste.

327
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:35,095
From now on,

328
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:36,876
I will never...

329
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,109
give you financial stress.

330
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:44,373
Trust me this once.

331
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:57,677
Eun Hui...

332
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,541
Will you accept

333
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,613
my second proposal?

334
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,982
Mom, accept it.

335
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:15,905
Only you would get two proposals from the same man.

336
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,226
Oh, my gosh.

337
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,673
You should've told me beforehand.

338
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:26,916
How can I accept a proposal looking like this?

339
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,839
You still look pretty anyway.

340
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,223
Whatever.

341
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:47,837
Is this real?

342
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:50,510
Of course, it is.

343
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:55,515
I'm sorry about that time. I didn't know.

344
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:59,098
I'm sorry, too. I couldn't tell you then.

345
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:00,721
How much is this?

346
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:03,143
Two, four, six, eight, ten,

347
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:05,004
Twelve, fourteen...

348
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:07,106
There's so much.

349
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:08,628
Hanjong Elementary School 32nd Reunion

350
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:10,009
- It's been a while.
- Dae Gil.

351
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,860
Yeong Min.

352
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,086
Seon Hui, over here.

353
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:24,624
How have you been? Have you been doing well?

354
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:27,837
Yes. It's nice to see you again.

355
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,419
- What about you?
- I'm just

356
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:31,090
taking care of the kids.

357
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,202
I'm so busy.

358
00:21:34,524 --> 00:21:36,585
Are you married?

359
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,511
No, not yet.

360
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:43,352
If you can afford to, it's better to live by yourself.

361
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:44,564
Don't get married.

362
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:47,387
Getting married is digging your own grave.

363
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:50,750
Good to see you.

364
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,714
I'd rather get married and dig my own grave.

365
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,566
If you know of any nice men,

366
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,368
introduce me to them.

367
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,680
Hi.

368
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,123
Who are you?

369
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,885
You don't remember me?

370
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:08,837
Hold on.

371
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,792
Hello?

372
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,272
You don't remember him?

373
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:15,506
It's Kim Yi Dong.

374
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:16,676
Kim Yi Dong?

375
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:19,128
He was so little back then.

376
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:21,802
He has grown so much.

377
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:23,223
I know, right?

378
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:27,157
He's one of the few single men here.

379
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:28,637
Really?

380
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:35,014
There was a guy like that in our class?

381
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,116
Let's drink.

382
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:39,368
It's nice to see you all.

383
00:22:39,368 --> 00:22:42,633
Why aren't you married yet? You don't lack anything.

384
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,475
You have a boyfriend, right?

385
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,496
Of course, she'd have one.

386
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:49,208
Gosh, what am I supposed to say?

387
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,442
They'll look down on me if I say no.

388
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:54,884
If I say yes, they won't introduce me to guys.

389
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:56,716
No.

390
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:58,609
I don't have one.

391
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,419
Oh, no.

392
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,332
It must be hard to meet guys now.

393
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:07,197
That's true. Guys want to date younger girls.

394
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:09,949
Why would they want to date an old woman?

395
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:14,193
How could you call her an old woman? It's embarrassing.

396
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,666
No, I mean...

397
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,406
You look young on the outside,

398
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:19,929
so you don't look that old.

399
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:32,111
In my opinion, Seon Hui looks ten years younger than you all do.

400
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,524
Oh, my. That's going a bit far.

401
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:39,149
Seon Hui doesn't look any older than 32.

402
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:40,651
She's still so pretty.

403
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,032
Come on. She looks older than 32.

404
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:46,015
Anyway, it was nice to see you all.

405
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:48,577
It's no fun here. Let's leave.

406
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,752
- Why?
- What's going on?

407
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:53,793
- Who is that?
- Is it her boyfriend?

408
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:54,994
What's going on?

409
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,185
That's her boyfriend?

410
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:07,968
I was actually going to leave

411
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:10,540
because it was getting uncomfortable.

412
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,433
Should I be grateful, since you helped me?

413
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,816
I wasn't trying to help you.

414
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:18,418
I actually meant it.

415
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:22,392
You're still really pretty and charming.

416
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:25,235
Hey.

417
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:29,540
Do you really not remember me?

418
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,980
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,934
We never saw each other after elementary school.

420
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,535
I don't really remember.

421
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,898
We saw each other recently.

422
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:39,610
What?

423
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,320
Where?

424
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,744
It was on Gangbyeon Expressway, at Yanghwa Bridge.

425
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,609
I'll take you home. Get in.

426
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,092
Kim Yi Dong.

427
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,080
He does look familiar.

428
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,732
Why do I feel so comfortable, as if it were my own home?

429
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:26,866
We're home safe. Let's take a proof shot.

430
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:29,539
- What in the world are you doing?
- One, two, three.

431
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,741
- Snap.
- What are you doing?

432
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:33,332
Gosh, you're so handsome.

433
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,945
- One, two, three.
- You have good taste.

434
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:41,801
Wait...

435
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,883
Have I been in your car before?

436
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:45,904
Do you remember now?

437
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,208
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,641
When I was drunk

439
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:54,814
and taking photos...

440
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:55,995
Was that you?

441
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:57,496
Yes.

442
00:25:57,496 --> 00:25:59,579
You actually remember.

443
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:01,371
I didn't know at first,

444
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:03,333
but after seeing you two or three more times,

445
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,524
I could tell it was you.

446
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:08,798
Don't drink so much.

447
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,496
Do you think I can get married?

448
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:17,958
Why not? You've met him already.

449
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,238
We saw each other recently.

450
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:21,151
He's roaming around.

451
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:22,562
He keeps on roaming around.

452
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,965
It was on Gangbyeon Expressway, at Yanghwa Bridge

453
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:27,897
I see that he has a certification from the government.

454
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:31,080
I think it's fate.

455
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,843
I guess I've been drinking all this time in order to meet you.

456
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:38,519
Next time you're drunk,

457
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,111
don't call any other taxi. Call me.

458
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:44,213
I'll come wherever you are.

459
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:56,246
Well...

460
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:59,650
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

461
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,152
What's going on? You scared me.

462
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,714
The banner was specially made at the place

463
00:27:04,714 --> 00:27:06,296
that makes banners for AOA.

464
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:08,258
Every moment spent with you two dazzled.
Remember this member forever~ ♥

465
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:10,640
You didn't have to do this. It's embarrassing.

466
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,892
We know you like it.

467
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:14,805
Yes, I love it to death.

468
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,535
You guys made it really pretty.

469
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:17,998
- Good job.
- Yes.

470
00:27:17,998 --> 00:27:20,339
You know how loyal we are.

471
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,022
Loyal.

472
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:24,554
I missed three classes of hagwon.

473
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:30,459
We prepared a gift for you.

474
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,400
Photo Album

475
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:44,835
As if you're going to the cafeteria.

476
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:21,460
♫ Was it from that day? Was it since then when I started to yarn for you ♫

477
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:35,170
♫ Was it from that moment? Everyone except us knew it ♫

478
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:44,790
♫ I follow your gaze without realizing it ♫

479
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:52,922
♫ I can hear how you feel ♫

480
00:28:52,922 --> 00:28:54,344
I'm so touched.

481
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:55,675
Thanks so much.

482
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:03,253
♫ I follow you ♫

483
00:29:03,253 --> 00:29:05,494
Here.

484
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,306
This is my gift.

485
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:15,915
You're going to miss these when you go to the States.

486
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,748
You're thankful for my thoughtfulness, right?

487
00:29:18,748 --> 00:29:20,080
Yes.

488
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,262
I'll think of you whenever I eat it.

489
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:25,104
Ro Bin, you seem so much happier now.

490
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:27,588
- Do I?
- It's true.

491
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:29,469
It surprises me too these days.

492
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:31,971
Do you remember when Ro Bin first transferred here?

493
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,624
Of course, I do. He was so cold.

494
00:29:34,624 --> 00:29:37,097
I was scared of him.

495
00:29:37,097 --> 00:29:39,038
Did he change this much

496
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,050
because of you?

497
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:45,555
Is this the power of love?

498
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:56,185
- Do you want a slice of pizza?
- Sure.

499
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,497
By the way, Sin Ae,

500
00:29:57,497 --> 00:30:00,210
do you want the reference book I used?

501
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,251
Are you okay with a used book?

502
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:04,653
Of course, I'm okay with it.

503
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:09,318
It was used by the top student of our school.

504
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:10,921
Of course, I would want it.

505
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:13,963
What's going on? Why are you blushing?

506
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:15,905
I'm getting suspicious of you two.

507
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:18,679
N-No, I'm not blushing.

508
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:20,531
Then why are you stuttering?

509
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:22,953
I smell something fishy here.

510
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:25,706
Stop. Sin Ae is getting flustered.

511
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:28,027
I think you're blushing, too.

512
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:31,090
- What are you talking about?
- How suspicious.

513
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,613
When are you going to stop eating?

514
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,695
- It's so good.
- It was so fun at Grandma's, wasn't it?

515
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:36,845
- Yes.
- Eat up.

516
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:39,379
- Look at his face.
- This is good.

517
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,971
- Who ate it?
- Not me.

518
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:43,142
- We couldn't catch any fish.
- How did you know I ate it?

519
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,165
- That's right.
- Oh, my gosh.

520
00:30:45,165 --> 00:30:46,505
Ji Na.

521
00:30:47,436 --> 00:30:48,857
Here.

522
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,691
Thanks.

523
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:54,064
You fixed this?

524
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:55,315
I did fix it,

525
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:58,238
but I had to reset it, so you might've lost some important files.

526
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,310
That's all right.

527
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:04,895
There was something important in there,

528
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:07,276
but I don't think I'll need it anymore.

529
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:10,740
Anyway, you're amazing, Je Yi. Thank you.

530
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:13,333
Let me head back now.

531
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,505
- Look at this.
- Okay.

532
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,797
Bo Ra put that on you. It's too much.

533
00:31:16,797 --> 00:31:17,908
I was holding the camera.

534
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,889
Who wants cake?

535
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:21,120
- Me.
- Thanks.

536
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,641
Me, too.

537
00:31:23,472 --> 00:31:26,936
Revenge Note is back.

538
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:28,559
Without this,

539
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,590
I thought I wouldn't be able to do anything.

540
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,801
I don't think I'll need it anymore.

541
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:47,966
I have my precious friends who are always there for me.

542
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:52,232
Someone else will need it more than I do.

543
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:53,613
Just as I needed it before.

544
00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:55,575
Reinstall the Revenge Note?
No.

545
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:57,047
Revenge Note has been uninstalled

546
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:58,678
Revenge Note has been sent to the next person
