~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:34,794
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:36,416
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

6
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,118
You two, come here.

7
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:41,922
Get over here.

8
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:44,715
You basically cut that skirt in half.

9
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:46,486
How much did you hack off?

10
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:47,908
I didn't shorten it.

11
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:49,940
It just got shorter because I got taller.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,951
Are you a bamboo tree or something?

13
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,935
Do you grow ten centimeters a day?

14
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:58,067
And you just slathered your face in flour, didn't you?

15
00:00:58,067 --> 00:00:59,870
Please let me go this one time.

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,842
Who doesn't wear makeup like this these days?

17
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,422
Who doesn't?

18
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:06,115
Look right behind you. Look at them.

19
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:08,057
Look.

20
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:13,933
- Ju Ri!
- Hey.

21
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,184
So last night...

22
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:18,408
Anyway, you guys are getting a demerit, got it?

23
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:20,250
I got another one.

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,631
Yes, Principal.

25
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,693
Yes.

26
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:23,954
I'm not kidding.

27
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:25,545
She looks so lame.

28
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:28,258
We get in trouble because of kids like her.

29
00:01:28,258 --> 00:01:30,511
I'll be there right away. Yes.

30
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,622
- Hey, Do Min.
- Yes?

31
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:34,293
Write their names down.

32
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,494
You take guard, all right?

33
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:39,027
I have somewhere to be right now. See you.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,193
Hey, tight pants.

35
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:45,114
Get over here.

36
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,451
You call this a uniform? They're tights.

37
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,272
Stand over there.

38
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,248
Hey!

39
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:01,210
Yes, you.

40
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:08,387
What an arrogant freshman.

41
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:11,521
- I'm confiscating your earphones.
- We can't have them in school?

42
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:15,144
Of course not.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,031
Well, these are...

44
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:26,706
All right then.

45
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,451
Hey!

46
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,393
Stop right there! Hey!

47
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:38,818
You've got some guts.

48
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:39,960
What?

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,462
I guess you don't know yet because you transferred here.

50
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,575
Our student council head isn't just like any other leader.

51
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,257
He was the best fighter at our school.

52
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:48,619
And he's in student council?

53
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,240
He doesn't cause trouble since they put him on student council.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,842
And the students are scared of him.

55
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:54,535
It's perfect for the teachers.

56
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:57,346
But he's got a really hot temper.

57
00:02:57,346 --> 00:03:01,391
Don't mess with him. You'll just make trouble for yourself.

58
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,842
Hey, I'm talking to you!

59
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,862
So...

60
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:15,264
He really irritated the student council head this morning.

61
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:16,706
He took it out on me.

62
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:18,749
- What was he thinking?
- Seriously.

63
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:20,441
He must've been the best fighter at his school.

64
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,111
No way.

65
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:25,735
The student council head is waiting to get him.

66
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:27,918
- He's dead meat.
- Right.

67
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,839
If it were me, I would have knocked him out.

68
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,470
You want me to handle him? Hey.

69
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,092
- Don't stop me.
- You can't do anything.

70
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:34,475
- Hey.
- Stop it.

71
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,495
Don't stop me.

72
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:38,888
Sin Ae, can I borrow your science notes?

73
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:40,621
I fell asleep during last class.

74
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:44,083
Gosh, do you come to school to sleep?

75
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,506
It's a little messy, but here you go.

76
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:54,654
Queen of note-taking Baek Ju Ri.

77
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,038
Can I take a look at your notes just once? Please?

78
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,298
- Copy them quickly, okay?
- Okay.

79
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,607
Your notes are definitely something else.

80
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,927
They're awesome.

81
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,963
- Are you uploading this again?
- Of course.

82
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:16,406
#Studying, I hate tests, top school note-taker,

83
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:19,919
king of notes, studygram, follow for follow, gorgeous handwriting.

84
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,740
Thanks.

85
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:25,525
Quiet, everyone.

86
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:28,168
Remember the shirts we ordered for the school ball game competition?

87
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,721
It's 20,000 won (about $180) per person. Give it to Ju Ri by today.

88
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,401
- That's too expensive.
- No way.

89
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:34,514
That costs 20,000 won per person?

90
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:37,886
The design sucks. Can't we change it?

91
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:47,175
That hurts.

92
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,932
Is this a school or a thieves' hideout?

93
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,283
Mr. Choi,

94
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,566
go roll the security camera footage.

95
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:09,899
We actually didn't fix it the last time it broke

96
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,233
because you told us it was a waste of money.

97
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,444
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:17,718
Go fix it!

99
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,821
Once I catch the culprit, I swear...

100
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,993
Are you sure it wasn't one of the students?

101
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:26,586
Mr. Choi, if there are any students that act suspiciously,

102
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:29,669
make sure to keep a good watch on them.

103
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,320
Yes, sir. I'll make sure to keep a good watch.

104
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:38,367
He's even more aggressive now.

105
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,620
What's going on?

106
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,473
You know the trophy that the principal cherished like his own baby?

107
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:48,549
The one that he got for getting a hole-in-one at the golf competition.

108
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,810
Goodness. Someone stole it.

109
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,232
What? Who would steal that?

110
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:56,026
I know, right?

111
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:59,479
I wouldn't take that piece of trash even if someone paid me.

112
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,240
And why does he think the kids did it?

113
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,242
What would they do with it?

114
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:04,203
I think

115
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:07,877
someone took it just to really ruffle his feathers.

116
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,880
The vibe here is going to be tense for a while.

117
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,372
I can't concentrate.

118
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,617
- We made it.
- There's so many people.

119
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:19,279
Oh Sa Na, hurry up!

120
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,070
My gosh.

121
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,341
Girls,

122
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,393
let's go somewhere else.

123
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:26,557
- I'll look up other places.
- I already did.

124
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:30,078
They don't have it anywhere else but here.

125
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:33,442
I have a feeling they're going to be sold out here as well.

126
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,484
Please let there be enough.

127
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:38,738
Please. Come on.

128
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:41,200
Why does it have to be here?

129
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,253
Whatever. I'm still a customer, right?

130
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:52,772
Here you go.

131
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,523
All right. Thank you.

132
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:57,467
The lanyard wallet is 10,000 won (≈ $90), but it's only 5,000 (≈ $45) if you buy this too.

133
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,778
It's such a steal!

134
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:00,299
The wallet is so nice too.

135
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:03,282
My friend said she was out from six in the morning to get one.

136
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,483
Really?

137
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:07,397
Do you think there will be enough for us to buy one too?

138
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:12,321
The lanyard wallets are sold out.

139
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,235
- Thank you.
- Bye.

140
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,737
Ajussi when are they coming in again?

141
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,008
I'm not sure.

142
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:20,820
I don't know when we'll get more.

143
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,783
We should have come earlier. We just wasted our time.

144
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:28,248
I'm going to be late for the cram school. See you.

145
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,109
I'll go with you. See you tomorrow, Sa Na.

146
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,090
- Bye.
- Bye.

147
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,775
Hey, Sa Na. Come here.

148
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,721
Ta-da!

149
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:42,992
Take this.

150
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:44,173
I don't want it.

151
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,977
You like these, don't you? Just take it.

152
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,928
Welcome.

153
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:56,647
I didn't ask him to save one for me.

154
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,637
How annoying.

155
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,332
The wallet did nothing wrong, though.

156
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:21,951
Gosh, I should have just slept in.

157
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:30,119
He's a cute guy way out of your league.

158
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:33,392
You better do me proud and catch him.

159
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:35,995
My gosh. Fine, you little witch.

160
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,236
He better be cute.

161
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:46,434
Am I too late?

162
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:54,374
Not at all.

163
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:58,267
You're a lot prettier than your pictures.

164
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:00,580
I get that a lot.

165
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,864
What would you like?

166
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:08,439
I think it's because you are a businessman.

167
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:11,510
You have a fresh take on things.

168
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:16,146
- Give me a minute.
- Sure.

169
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,470
My gosh.

170
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,112
I can't believe it.

171
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:24,905
I'm so nervous.

172
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,425
Vitamin

173
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:29,668
What is this? Vitamins?

174
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,522
Oh, my heart.

175
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:47,436
Shall we have dinner together?

176
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,052
Oh my.

177
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:54,903
These are just vitamins.

178
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,328
It's done.

179
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,605
Again?

180
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:16,715
This is so hard.

181
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,169
What is?

182
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,002
Hey, Je Yi.

183
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:26,295
Our physics teacher said he'll give us points on how far these go.

184
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,897
But they keep falling to the ground. It's frustrating.

185
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,692
Really?

186
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:35,515
You could use Bernoulli's principle for these paper airplanes too.

187
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:37,436
Ber... Who?

188
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:41,351
He said when a fluid's speed increases, the pressure also decreases.

189
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:44,303
It's what keeps airplanes in the air.

190
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:46,466
Even though the size and shape are different,

191
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:49,368
the same principle can be applied to paper airplanes.

192
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,531
It's hard, isn't it?

193
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:56,035
To put it simply,

194
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:59,168
if the wings are wider, it'll travel farther.

195
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:01,622
And if the wings are narrower, it won't travel as far,

196
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:03,972
but faster.

197
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:08,727
Give me a paper.

198
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:30,990
It's done.

199
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,911
Try flying it.

200
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:45,274
It's Ro Bin.

201
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:47,798
I guess he's on his way to work.

202
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:51,260
Where does he plan on going with all that money he's making?

203
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,342
What?

204
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:55,576
He said he's saving because he needs to go somewhere.

205
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,236
You didn't know?

206
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,411
Is that so?

207
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,683
He doesn't talk to me much nowadays.

208
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:07,946
He wasn't like that when he was younger.

209
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,081
Good job this week.

210
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:22,933
Here's your pay.

211
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,734
I threw in a little bonus too.

212
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,194
Thank you.

213
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,719
Im Ba Reun, Lee Myeong Tae, An Mi Nam.

214
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:42,040
You guys haven't paid yet. Ba Reun, hurry up and pay.

215
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,212
Hey.

216
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:55,164
What are you doing? Get out.

217
00:12:56,236 --> 00:13:00,339
- Hurry up and get out!
- Fine. I'm going!

218
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,763
Ju Ri, what are you doing? Get dressed.

219
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:05,526
Let's stop by the bathroom too.

220
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:07,566
Sure.

221
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,634
Come out!

222
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:15,754
What's taking you so long?

223
00:13:16,757 --> 00:13:18,509
Move.

224
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,068
Move!

225
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,311
- Hey.
- Hurry up!

226
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:24,763
- Let's go.
- We need to run!

227
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:29,900
Hurry up. We're late.

228
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,090
The gym teacher will go nuts again.

229
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:44,453
One, two, three, four.

230
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:46,626
Run. Hurry up.

231
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:50,630
Seo Ro Bin, you're late.

232
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,562
Do 50 push-ups as punishment for being late.

233
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,695
If you don't do them right,

234
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:56,966
you have to start all over again.

235
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,057
All right? Go.

236
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:08,939
- Look at Ro Bin.
- That's awesome.

237
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:10,410
- He's so cool.
- Oh my.

238
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,981
- He's so strong.
- Awesome.

239
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,714
Can't you do that?

240
00:14:13,714 --> 00:14:15,466
- He's so cool.
- I know.

241
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:17,786
- He can do 50?
- He's good at this.

242
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:22,673
All right.

243
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,283
Everyone's been practicing, right?

244
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,995
Yes.

245
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,428
As for the school ball game competition,

246
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:31,771
the team who wins will get extra credit on their gym class grades.

247
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,023
Do your best.

248
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:36,536
The girls are going to play dodgeball,

249
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:37,588
so it's all set.

250
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,190
Shall we form teams for the boys?

251
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,093
Teache, Yi Deun isn't feeling well, so he can't play basketball.

252
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:44,344
Really?

253
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:47,056
Then instead of Yi Deun, let's have Park Su Ro.

254
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,678
Yes, sir.

255
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:55,034
- Go for it.
- Go.

256
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,276
He scored.

257
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,858
- Awesome.
- Amazing.

258
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,713
He's so good at basketball.

259
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:06,576
- I know, right?
- He's definitely my man. He's so cool.

260
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:09,208
Hey, since when was Ro Bin your man?

261
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,771
Don't worry about it. He's going to fall for me soon.

262
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,038
I definitely need to take a snap of this.

263
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:30,659
He's so good.

264
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:38,037
Class One,

265
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,870
you guys are actually better than I expected.

266
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:45,035
Lee Myeong Tae, Seo Ro Bin, Gang Ha Jun.

267
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:47,366
You three are the main team members.

268
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:49,790
The rest of you are backup members, okay?

269
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,062
You guys need to meet up and practice.

270
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:53,503
- Yes.
- Yes.

271
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,916
Today's class is over.

272
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:56,976
Head out.

273
00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:59,318
Thank you.

274
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,521
It's hot.

275
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:05,725
Ro Bin,

276
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,908
this is my Chanel handkerchief.

277
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:09,810
You can borrow it. Here.

278
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,730
It's fine.

279
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:19,639
You're scared to get it wet because it's expensive, aren't you?

280
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,292
- Thanks for the towel.
- Hey!

281
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:34,393
It's gone.

282
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,606
What is? What's gone?

283
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:38,508
My wallet.

284
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:40,960
It had all the money I collected for the class shirts.

285
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,421
Really?

286
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,314
So even my money's gone then?

287
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:46,375
Look harder. Are you sure you put it there?

288
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,137
I was going to take it to the teacher,

289
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:51,521
but I left it in here in my textbook because you said we were late.

290
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:54,273
- You saw me, right?
- I did.

291
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:59,359
The 400,000 won (≈ $360) I collected for the shirts was in there.

292
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,631
Really?

293
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:04,534
Everyone, Ju Ri's wallet is missing.

294
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,906
Maybe she put it somewhere else.

295
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,948
No way.

296
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,979
Ba Reun, close the doors

297
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,662
so no one can get out for now.

298
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:14,014
Ju Ri, did you look everywhere?

299
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:16,736
- I did.
- Hey, why did you put it in there?

300
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,177
You should have just given it to the teacher.

301
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,463
This isn't Ju Ri's fault. The guy who stole it is to blame.

302
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:27,266
Why does it have to be a guy? What if it was a girl?

303
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:32,712
What do you kids think you're doing during class time?

304
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:37,477
What's with her?

305
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:39,929
Class President, what's going on?

306
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:42,722
After we finished gym class,

307
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:45,445
Ju Ri's wallet was missing.

308
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:48,257
And her wallet had the 400,000 won for the class shirts.

309
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:50,458
What?

310
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,283
Baek Ju Ri, did you look everywhere?

311
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:55,915
Even Ah Ra saw me put it in my desk.

312
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:58,067
I looked through the lockers,

313
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,670
and it's not there either.

314
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,254
Is that so? This can't be good.

315
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,496
I don't want to doubt anyone,

316
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,177
but this means someone took it.

317
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:11,681
During gym class, we all left the classroom.

318
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,993
So it must be someone from another class.

319
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,366
Not all of us. One of us came late, remember?

320
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:19,008
- What?
- Someone came late to gym class.

321
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:21,760
Ro Bin came out the latest out of all of us.

322
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:26,637
- What?
- No way.

323
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:29,089
Could it be him?

324
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,661
If you have something to say, say it to the whole class.

325
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,022
Are you serious?

326
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,705
Are you guys suspecting Ro Bin right now?

327
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:38,579
Ro Bin is the culprit? No way.

328
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,390
He was the only one alone.

329
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,982
He's the only one without an alibi.

330
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:44,505
It'd be weird to just let him go.

331
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:47,967
Ro Bin should just say outright that it wasn't him, for his own sake.

332
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,660
Seo Ro Bin,

333
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,662
were you really the last one to come out of class?

334
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,322
Yes.

335
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,520
I'll say this right now.

336
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,150
We aren't suspecting you.

337
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,723
We just want to make sure it isn't you.

338
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,197
Can I take a look in your bag?

339
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:09,809
Yes.

340
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:25,846
- What is that?
- Seriously?

341
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:29,079
- What?
- It was totally him.

342
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,380
It was Ro Bin.

343
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:34,824
Quiet.

344
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:37,816
Seo Ro Bin, what is this?

345
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,881
Here's your pay.

346
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:49,570
This is my pay from my part-time job.

347
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,351
I forgot about it.

348
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:55,454
This is a lot of money.

349
00:19:55,454 --> 00:19:57,658
Are you sure?

350
00:19:57,658 --> 00:19:59,308
Where do you work?

351
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,161
The thing is...

352
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,552
I'll be keeping this for now, okay?

353
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:17,687
Let's put this on pause and start class.

354
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:27,497
All right. Make sure to prepare well for next week.

355
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:31,170
Seo Ro Bin,

356
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,671
come with me.

357
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,904
I knew it was Ro Bin.

358
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:46,306
Hey, Im Ba Reun,

359
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:48,168
don't say whatever you like when you're not even sure.

360
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:51,740
Didn't you see the envelope? Isn't that all you need?

361
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:57,518
Don't cry.

362
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,568
It's okay.

363
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:06,025
All right.

364
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:08,076
Be honest with me.

365
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:12,492
- You stole it, didn't you?
- It wasn't me.

366
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:18,559
There was exactly 400,000 won in here.

367
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,641
It's the exact amount for the shirts.

368
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:23,943
Would you believe it if someone said this was a coincidence?

369
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:29,088
Fine.

370
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,090
Let's assume that you're telling the truth.

371
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,552
Where do you work?

372
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,864
I'm going to go check.

373
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:39,058
Aren't you going to answer me?

374
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:41,311
Then just admit it and let's finish this.

375
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:44,334
Listen, you little brat.

376
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:47,367
If this gets up to the disciplinary council, not even I can help.

377
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,768
You're going to be the one who will be in trouble.

378
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:55,074
You little brat. Are you really going to stay silent like that?

379
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:58,478
Mr. Lee, I'll take care of this from now on.

380
00:21:58,478 --> 00:22:00,340
Ms. Maeng,

381
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,832
this kid is so stubborn.

382
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:05,205
This is going to be hard for you to handle. Leave it to me.

383
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:08,517
No. He's my student, so I'll talk to him.

384
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:11,341
Seo Ro Bin, follow me.

385
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:19,760
Seo Ro Bin,

386
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,472
you can tell me the truth.

387
00:22:22,472 --> 00:22:24,894
Do you have something to do with Ju Ri's wallet?

388
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:28,018
No. I really didn't take it.

389
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:29,398
Then what about the money?

390
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,721
Where did you get it from?

391
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,675
It's really my pay.

392
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:38,497
However...

393
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,602
I can't tell you where I work part-time.

394
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:44,374
I'm sorry.

395
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:47,538
All right.

396
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:49,508
I believe you.

397
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,693
Then who could have taken the money?

398
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:03,372
Just take one, okay?

399
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:06,134
You always take mine.

400
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:14,104
- Stop it.
- Come on.

401
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:15,865
Ro Bin!

402
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:23,223
He might be good-looking on the outside...

403
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:25,715
Ju Ri, are you okay?

404
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,922
Isn't he the guy who stole the money for the class shirts?

405
00:23:32,922 --> 00:23:35,404
You wouldn't suspect it from that face.

406
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:42,762
He's got no conscience.

407
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:44,054
I guess he doesn't care.

408
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:46,826
I know, right? We have to pay again too.

409
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:49,769
He's the one who stole it. Why do we have to suffer?

410
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:52,111
Whatever. This is irritating me.

411
00:23:55,105 --> 00:23:56,567
I'll get going.

412
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,027
Okay.

413
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:00,849
- What was that?
- Gosh.

414
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:04,464
He's acting like a hero.

415
00:24:05,955 --> 00:24:07,556
Seo Ro Bin!

416
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,681
Why won't you say anything?

417
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:13,362
Everyone's talking because you won't say anything.

418
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:16,395
Does it matter to you whether I say something or not?

419
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:19,617
Doesn't it make you mad that they're accusing you?

420
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:21,741
What are you talking about?

421
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:26,015
Thief? Who's a thief?

422
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:29,038
It's nothing. I'll handle it.

423
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:35,885
Ji Na, what's going on?

424
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:39,588
The thing is...

425
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:44,493
He just needs to tell us where he works for his part-time job.

426
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,635
Why won't he tell us?

427
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:49,979
He says it's a hamburger place,

428
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:51,861
but I don't think that's true.

429
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:56,206
What on earth is Ro Bin doing?

430
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:58,418
Should we follow him and find out?

431
00:24:58,418 --> 00:24:59,960
No,

432
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,961
I'll go by myself.

433
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:03,852
I'll help you. It happened to our class.

434
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,598
I was scared I would be late for gym class,

435
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:11,020
so I hastily put it in my desk.

436
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,723
But...

437
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:14,594
I put it inside my textbook,

438
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:16,175
so no one would have known

439
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:18,858
that there was a wallet inside it.

440
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:21,971
It's true that Ro Bin was the only one left in the classroom,

441
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:24,563
but Ro Bin would never do something like this.

442
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:25,906
I could just tell

443
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:28,559
something was wrong with Ro Bin by looking at his face.

444
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,891
The rumors about him are bad too.

445
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:32,302
Wasn't he forced to transfer?

446
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:34,955
But if he really did steal it,

447
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:37,937
I don't think he would have just put it in his backpack.

448
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,450
That's nothing compared to my allowance.

449
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,982
Teacher, can't I just pay for it

450
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:44,405
and pretend like nothing happened?

451
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:48,387
Teacher, he does work part-time.

452
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:51,120
Though I'm not sure why he won't tell us where.

453
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:55,565
What a hassle, right?

454
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:57,688
These theft cases are the worst.

455
00:25:57,688 --> 00:26:00,521
Whether you know who did it or not, it's still a problem.

456
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:02,172
But...

457
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:03,402
theft?

458
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:06,265
None of my students are the type to steal.

459
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,718
You're still living in a fairy tale.

460
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:11,020
Kids nowadays are so scary.

461
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,014
You must be having such a hard time, Ms. Maeng.

462
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:17,376
You in particular have a lot of trouble in your class.

463
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:20,739
I feel like I'm seeing my class from last year.

464
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:29,268
Seo Ro Bin!

465
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:34,615
Where are you rushing off to?

466
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:36,266
You didn't eat lunch, did you?

467
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:38,147
Do you want to eat? My treat.

468
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:39,848
Why would you do that?

469
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:44,253
Give me a ride on your bike next time.

470
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:46,995
It's fine. I'm not hungry.

471
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:55,044
Come with me.

472
00:27:03,293 --> 00:27:04,705
Hey,

473
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:07,257
why would you eat ox-bone soup in this scorching heat?

474
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:08,759
Don't you know to fight heat with heat?

475
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,389
This place is super good.

476
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:12,921
Girls like this kind of food too?

477
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:15,624
I used to live with my grandma,

478
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:17,526
so I like this kind of food.

479
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:20,870
Thank you.

480
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:28,738
Look at this kid.

481
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:31,700
I guess you don't know how to eat ox-bone soup.

482
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:56,336
Just try it.

483
00:28:05,695 --> 00:28:08,408
Isn't it good? I told you.

484
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:13,754
You know how to eat ox-bone soup, don't you?

485
00:28:13,754 --> 00:28:15,584
Thank you.

486
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:20,911
Aren't you tired from worrying about other people like this?

487
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:24,092
It must be in my nature. It doesn't tire me at all.

488
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:49,950
What about dinner?

489
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:52,262
I ate already.

490
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,745
Where have you been going recently?

491
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:57,758
How come you can't tell anyone where you work?

492
00:28:57,758 --> 00:28:59,939
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of myself.

493
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,752
You taking care of yourself is being accused of stealing?

494
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:05,415
Shouldn't we be doing better since our parents aren't here?

495
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:07,547
Aren't you doing just fine?

496
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:09,920
That's all that matters, right?

497
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,200
How can you talk like that?

498
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:30,901
Ji Na, I think you should just stay here.

499
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,633
We're going to lose track of him. Come on.

500
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,001
I can't believe my mouth started foaming

501
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:53,323
in the middle of a blind date.

502
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:05,826
Ajussi, lend me your phone, please.

503
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:09,278
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

504
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:14,673
Here it is.

505
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:18,878
Thank you. Here you go.

506
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:25,985
Who is this? I don't know this number.

507
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:32,543
Hello?

508
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:34,044
Who is this?

509
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:36,095
It's me.

510
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,398
Who?

511
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:40,899
It's the driver in the front seat.

512
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:44,214
Ah, right.

513
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:49,988
Who is this? I don't know this number.

514
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:58,798
- Who is this?
- I said it's me.

515
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:01,059
I'm sorry.

516
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,976
Who is this?

517
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:08,256
I don't know this number.

518
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,892
Who is this?

519
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,100
The driver right in front of you!

520
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:24,433
I think he went that way.

521
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:26,485
Let's look for him a little more.

522
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:42,040
That's Ro Bin, isn't it?

523
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,017
Seo Ro Bin!

524
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:18,358

525
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:37,717
I waited for a while but I guess you left. Let's have dinner next time.
