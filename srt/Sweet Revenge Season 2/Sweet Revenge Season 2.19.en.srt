~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:04,093
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:32,953
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:36,285
Don't just play during summer vacation.

5
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,809
You should study the subjects you find difficult—

6
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:41,190
- Why?
- We don't want to.

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,513
Fine then.

8
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:46,586
You guys did a great job this semester.

9
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:49,298
Stay healthy. I'll see you all next semester.

10
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:50,850
- Yes!
- Yes!

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,193
The semester is officially over.

12
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:58,047
- I'm so excited.
- Let's go.

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,082
Ji Na,

14
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:03,713
thanks for inviting us.

15
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:05,425
I can't believe we're going on a trip together.

16
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,026
I've always wanted to do this.

17
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:10,040
My grandma is happy that I'm bringing my friends.

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,092
She likes having a lot of people over.

19
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,473
It's such a relief that the hagwon is also on break.

20
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:16,455
Or else, I wouldn't have been able to go.

21
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:21,922
Rok Hui, are you sure you can't come? It would be great if you could join us.

22
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:24,763
Sorry, I have to take care of the gym.

23
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:27,627
What about me? Can I come instead of Rok Hui?

24
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:30,911
What the heck? Stay out of this. Gross.

25
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,594
I guess we could let you come if you bring Ro Bin.

26
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,858
Ro Bin, let's go with them.

27
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:41,571
- No, thanks.
- Come with us.

28
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,273
Let's go.

29
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:46,965
Do you think Ro Bin would go to the countryside like that?

30
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:50,288
He belongs in a place like L.A.

31
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:54,054
Ro Bin, do you want to attend an English camp in L.A. together?

32
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:56,155
I'll take you.

33
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,293
You can go to L.A. by yourself.

34
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:05,935
Let's go. Are you really not coming?

35
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:07,597
Come with us.

36
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:09,438
Gosh.

37
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,697
Hey!

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,471
Ji Na, get the door.

39
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:25,435
I invited Je Yi and Ro Bin over for lunch.

40
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,676
- Mom!
- Mom!

41
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:30,419
- Why are you telling us now?
- Why are you telling us now?

42
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:37,886
Hurry and go in.

43
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,173
Let me know if you want more. I made plenty.

44
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,525
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:53,340
Gosh, you boys eat so heartily.

46
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:57,537
By the way, when are your parents coming back?

47
00:02:57,537 --> 00:03:00,609
I don't think they'll be able to.

48
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,151
Something came up over there.

49
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:06,346
Oh no. You must miss them so much.

50
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:08,548
Then would you guys like

51
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:11,500
to go visit Ji Na's grandmother?

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,744
- Pardon?
- Ji Na's grandma lives in the countryside.

53
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,406
Ji Na is going with her friends tomorrow.

54
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,958
You guys should join them.

55
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:22,262
Mom, they wouldn't like the countryside.

56
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:25,363
No, I want to go.

57
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:27,977
- Can we really go with them?
- Of course.

58
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:31,770
Ji Na's grandma likes having a lot of people over.

59
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:37,226
I want to go. What about you, Ro Bin?

60
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,949
If you don't, I'll go by myself.

61
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:44,703
Do you think he would go?

62
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,606
You're not going, right?

63
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:50,599
No, I'm going to go.

64
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:53,562
Really?

65
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,754
- That's a surprise.
- Why?

66
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:57,666
I can't go?

67
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,900
I'll have to cook for myself if I'm alone.

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,642
I just want to go.

69
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,973
Oh my, what a delight.

70
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:07,657
Oppa, let's have a great time together.

71
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,273
I've got short sleeves, long sleeves,

72
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:17,686
sleeveless shirts, pajamas, sweats,

73
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:20,799
and socks. I've packed everything.

74
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,912
Then for my cosmetics,

75
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,686
I have base, color cosmetics, and sunscreen...

76
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,637
Oh, I need more facial masks.

77
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:30,440
I thought you didn't want to go. You look excited.

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,631
Well, I mean...

79
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,904
I wasn't excited before, but now...

80
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:38,237
Oppa Ro Bin is going too.

81
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,908
Hey, this is mine.

82
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,702
You're not going to wear it anyway.

83
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,962
I'm going to wear it. Give it back.

84
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:06,907
Stop lying. You're not going to wear it.

85
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,187
Don't be so greedy.

86
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,630
I said I'm going to wear it.

87
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,271
Give it back.

88
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,927
Give it to me.

89
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:21,341
I'll cut it in half for you.

90
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,934
- You can wear it, Sa Na.
- No, it's okay. You can have it.

91
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,137
- Then we can both wear it.
- You're right.

92
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:29,980
Sharing is caring. Let's go.

93
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,820
- Yes.
- Let's go.

94
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:35,705
My goodness.

95
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:42,892
What's that?

96
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,733
Oh my, that's soju.

97
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:48,176
Yes, I don't really like wine.

98
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:49,999
Are you going somewhere?

99
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:53,080
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.

100
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:56,206
You're going to Paris? By yourself?

101
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:59,668
Gosh, you sure are something, I guess.

102
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:01,951
You should at least go with a man.

103
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:05,024
What are you talking about? I'm going with Gi Jun.

104
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:09,178
Gi Jun booked the hotel and plane tickets for me.

105
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:12,481
Isn't he so sweet?

106
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:15,464
He's so sweet. He makes my teeth rot.

107
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:18,348
Are you sure he's normal?

108
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:21,631
Are you playing on his weaknesses or something?

109
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,172
Why are you being like this?

110
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:26,045
Gi Jun treasures me so much.

111
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:29,398
Why do you try to find faults in every guy I meet?

112
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:31,421
If I don't get married, it's all your fault, got it?

113
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:34,233
That's your problem. Why would it be my fault?

114
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,737
You were so picky about the guy I used to date.

115
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:40,209
You scared him away. Don't you remember?

116
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:43,282
I saved you from trouble. He was such a weirdo.

117
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:46,156
You have such low standards when it comes to men.

118
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,608
Oh my goodness.

119
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,591
Gi Jun is calling me. Get out.

120
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:54,214
Hello?

121
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,160
Hurry and get out.

122
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,190
Oh my.

123
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:02,080
She's totally head over heels for him.

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,335
Is she jumping the gun again?

125
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:11,832
Be careful and listen to your grandma.

126
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,262
Have a good time.

127
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:16,106
Okay, I'll call you every day.

128
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:19,779
With us and Aunt Seon Hui gone, you'll be all by yourself.

129
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,920
Will you be all right?

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,462
Of course I'll be all right.

131
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:25,324
I'll have the place all to myself.

132
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:28,167
Please take your time coming back.

133
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,061
Mom, if you get scared all by yourself,

134
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:33,512
call Dad and—

135
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,685
Don't speak such nonsense. Hurry up and leave.

136
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:38,768
- Let's go.
- Bye.

137
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:40,569
Bye.

138
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,041
My precious children.

139
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:50,189
But what is this woman doing?

140
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,243
You're not leaving?

141
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:55,526
I still have some time left before my flight.

142
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:59,079
The airport is so busy and crowded these days.

143
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,960
Hurry up and get ready.

144
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:05,925
I'll handle it on my own.

145
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,221
It smells nice in the countryside.

146
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:15,104
It's so great.

147
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:17,406
Does the Internet work here?

148
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:18,669
It's not working well.

149
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:20,840
Gosh, are you addicted to the Internet?

150
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,082
Why do you look for the Internet even on vacation?

151
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,534
Whatever. We only let you come because of Ro Bin.

152
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,666
Shut the mouth!

153
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,381
Sorry.

154
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:35,150
Gosh, you have nice shoes. Are they new?

155
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:37,858
If you step on new shoes, you'll never lose them.

156
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:39,229
Should I step on them for you?

157
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,481
Hey, stop.

158
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:44,042
Let's hurry and go. My grandma is waiting.

159
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,454
Grandma!

160
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,387
Aigoo!

161
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:09,869
My precious grandchildren are here.

162
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:12,311
Oh my goodness.

163
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:13,553
It's been so long

164
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,206
since the two of you have visited.

165
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:22,260
Sa Na, this is your first time here since then, right?

166
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,427
Oh my gosh.

167
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:30,280
It's all right.

168
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:33,784
Oh dear, Sam Sun.

169
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:36,455
I guess she doesn't remember you.

170
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:39,658
What? Sam Sun?

171
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:42,601
- That's Sam Sun?
- Yes.

172
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,690
Sam Sun,

173
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,001
you're so cute.

174
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,923
Sam Sun, let's play together later.

175
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,065
No way.

176
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,718
Where did the puppy Sam Sun go?

177
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:01,580
Sam Sun became a beast.

178
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,862
- Hello.
- Hello.

179
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:04,023
- Hi.
- Hello.

180
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:06,616
- Hello.
- You have come a long way.

181
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,477
Come in.

182
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:16,290
I shouldn't have bragged to Eonni.

183
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,467
What do I do now?

184
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:21,620
How do I tell her it got canceled?

185
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,622
Oh my, Gi Jun.

186
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:28,547
I was actually just thinking about you.

187
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:31,260
I guess we really click.

188
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,763
Seon Hui, I'm so sorry.

189
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:37,327
Something came up at work,

190
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:39,758
so I can't go on vacation tomorrow.

191
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:42,562
- What?
- I really wanted to

192
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:45,494
show you the night view of Paris.

193
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,988
Should I just quit my job and go?

194
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:50,410
No,

195
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,744
I'm not the type of person to get in the way of someone's career.

196
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:57,186
Of course work comes first.

197
00:10:57,186 --> 00:11:00,219
We can go on a trip another time.

198
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:03,082
I knew it, you're so different from other women.

199
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:05,574
Let's go once I take care of this business.

200
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:07,227
Sure.

201
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:10,239
Let me know when you're done.

202
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,231
Seon Hui,

203
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:13,783
I love you.

204
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:22,441
She'll make fun of me if I go back.

205
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:24,883
This won't do.

206
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:27,666
I better stay somewhere else for a few days.

207
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:35,174
Yes, please come at your earliest convenience.

208
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:37,676
It needs to be fixed as soon as possible.

209
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:41,970
Yes, I will see you this evening. All right.

210
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,553
Excuse me...

211
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,498
- What do you want?
- I'm just...

212
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:51,770
It's a new lunchbox we have in the store. You can eat it at home later.

213
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,583
You probably wouldn't want to cook, since the kids are away.

214
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:58,026
I told you I don't need things like these.

215
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:01,390
By the way, is something broken?

216
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,183
The front door is suddenly acting up.

217
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:05,835
It needs to be fixed right away, but they can't come until evening.

218
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:09,128
You should've told me.

219
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,991
Don't you know I was a military engineer?

220
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:14,044
I'll fix it for you. Should I go to your place now?

221
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:15,134
No, thank you.

222
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,847
I'll take care of my own place. You can get back to work now.

223
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,031
- Leave. Get out.
- But...

224
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,504
- Get out.
- Wait.

225
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,687
I said I'll do it.

226
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,327
I told you to leave.

227
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,244
How dare he try to come into my house like that?

228
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:37,066
I must not give him a chance.

229
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,472
I said I can fix it.

230
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:45,914
Wait,

231
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:49,037
the kids are gone, and Seon Hui is on vacation.

232
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,482
So isn't this a chance for me?

233
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:58,177
Nice.

234
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:04,640
Oh my gosh.

235
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,859
- I couldn't make much,
- It looks so good.

236
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:13,070
- but I hope you enjoy the food.
- This is great.

237
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,637
I took it easy on the cooking, since it's only the first day.

238
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:18,427
Grandma, this is taking it easy?

239
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:20,970
It may seem like a lot,

240
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,432
but I only put together a few ingredients

241
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:25,825
and made a ton of rice.

242
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:28,307
I totally took it easy on the cooking.

243
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,550
Eat up.

244
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,991
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

245
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,103
Put kimchi on top

246
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:36,406
and roll it up.

247
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:40,079
Open wide. Come on.

248
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:44,372
How does it taste?

249
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,136
It's delicious.

250
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,060
Grandma.

251
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:54,023
Aigoo.

252
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:56,295
Look who we have here.

253
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,598
What brings you here?

254
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,213
We borrowed this before. I've come to return it.

255
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:05,905
Aigoo.

256
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:10,240
You could've taken your time with this.

257
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,473
You guys haven't eaten yet, right?

258
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,877
Right, come and eat.

259
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:20,450
Your grandma is coming home late today.

260
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,041
Hurry and come.

261
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,533
Kids, make some room.

262
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,725
Come sit.

263
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:30,439
We only need two more spoons on the table.

264
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:32,282
Here.

265
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,856
These two are brothers.

266
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:40,470
They live right across from me.

267
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,322
The older one is Geon Wu,

268
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:45,114
and the younger one is Hyeon Wu.

269
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,596
Wait.

270
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:50,059
Geon Wu, aren't you in your first year of high school?

271
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,271
- Yes.
- That's right.

272
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:54,584
Then you're the same age

273
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:57,237
as my oldest granddaughter, Ji Na.

274
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:59,398
The two of you should get close.

275
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,132
This is my youngest granddaughter, Sa Na.

276
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:05,975
These are Ji Na's friends.

277
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,698
You guys should all get close.

278
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,171
Hi.

279
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,784
Eat up.

280
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,466
Thank you for the meal.

281
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:29,628
What? You're already done eating?

282
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,980
Have some more.

283
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,824
I'm full, grandma. We'll get going now.

284
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:37,097
All right, then. I'll give you some acorn jelly.

285
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,207
Eat it at home.

286
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:40,649
No, thank you. We're full.

287
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:58,800
Here.

288
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:18,117
These are Je Yi's shoes.

289
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:21,630
I'm sorry.

290
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,942
I just wanted to try them on.

291
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:28,717
Don't tell anyone, okay?

292
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,856
All right, I won't tell anyone.

293
00:16:36,856 --> 00:16:38,447
I promise.

294
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:40,129
Thanks so much.

295
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,390
I'm so full.

296
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,343
- I know, right?
- I'm so full.

297
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:58,917
These are Je Yi's shoes. What are they doing here?

298
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,080
Oh, this...

299
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,962
I think Sam Sun brought them here.

300
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:04,533
What? That...

301
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:09,840
Sam Sun really likes chewing on shoes.

302
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,042
Be careful, everyone. Keep an eye on your shoes.

303
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,905
What a thief.

304
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:18,157
You shoe thief!

305
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,931
Hey.

306
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:24,794
You shoe thief!

307
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,266
- Oh my.
- Stop that.

308
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,329
- Let's go back in.
- Okay.

309
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,400
What the heck? She promised not to tell anyone.

310
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:39,829
She promised.

311
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:51,901
What is this? Gosh.

312
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,541
This is where I should be right now.

313
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:08,248
Should I stay at Mi Seon's tomorrow?

314
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,210
Hey, Mi Seon.

315
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,612
Yes, why?

316
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,533
Seon Hui, I thought you were going to Paris.

317
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:15,895
Are you calling from Paris?

318
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,488
I'm so envious. Where are you? What are you up to?

319
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,301
Oh! Yes, that's right. I'm...

320
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,315
I'm on the Eiffel Tower, where I can see the whole city of Paris.

321
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,108
It's amazing. It's unbelievable.

322
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,081
Yes, that's right.

323
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,689
Sa Na,

324
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,532
how is your father doing?

325
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,946
Do you see him often?

326
00:18:57,647 --> 00:19:00,379
Why are you asking me about my dad?

327
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:02,311
Stop asking.

328
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:05,034
Well,

329
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,446
of course I would ask my granddaughter.

330
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,789
Who else would I ask?

331
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,612
I don't know. Ask Ji Na.

332
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:21,469
Even if your dad is at fault,

333
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:24,934
you can't hate him,

334
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:26,596
all right?

335
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,607
Your dad

336
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:32,360
loved you so much.

337
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,435
He even brought Sam Sun home for you.

338
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:38,527
He didn't want you to be lonely,

339
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:43,391
so he wanted Sam Sun to be like your little brother.

340
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,944
Sam Sun always

341
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:48,837
liked you a lot.

342
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:52,152
Whatever. I'm going to sleep.

343
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,070
My goodness.

344
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,087
Sa Na,

345
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:01,060
don't hate

346
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,364
your dad so much.

347
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,917
He is a pitiful person.

348
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,173
Grandma, Sa Na, Dad, Mom, Ji Na

349
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,283
What do you mean, you suddenly can't come?

350
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,024
Tomorrow morning?

351
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,087
Ajussi, then what am I supposed to do tonight?

352
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:31,310
Ajussi... Hello? Are you...

353
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,444
What is this?

354
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:40,360
What do you want?

355
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,791
You couldn't get your door fixed, could you?

356
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,414
I'll fix it for you.

357
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:46,295
How would you fix that?

358
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:49,169
Why don't you trust me?

359
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:52,522
Just let me try. We'll see if I can fix it.

360
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:56,637
Where are you right now?

361
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:58,467
I'm in front of your door.

362
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,169
The door?

363
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:24,864
Gosh.

364
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:28,257
When will he get it done?

365
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:36,415
That's strange. They said this would work.

366
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:38,408
I knew this would happen.

367
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:41,882
How could I trust Mr. Oh Empty Brains?

368
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:45,394
Don't touch it. You'll make it worse.

369
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:47,518
That's enough. You can leave now.

370
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:50,970
I have to fix this before I leave.

371
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,760
Just wait. I'll fix it no matter what.

372
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:58,077
Don't stand there and glare at me. Go sleep.

373
00:21:58,077 --> 00:22:00,859
I'll fix this and leave.

374
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:07,866
You can try all you want. You'll never be able to fix it.

375
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:10,469
Shut the door when you leave.

376
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,767
Why won't this work?

377
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,580
Eun Hui.

378
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,720
Eun Hui?

379
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:37,267
I don't think I can fix this.

380
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,694
I think I'll have to sleep here tonight.

381
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:06,745
As expected from Kim Eun Hui.

382
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:09,027
How smart of her.

383
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:29,057
Oh my gosh.

384
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:33,360
Darling.

385
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:35,164
- Darling.
- Yes.

386
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,848
Why are you here like this? Did you stay here all night?

387
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:44,183
It's already morning?

388
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:46,406
Why did you sleep here? Weren't you uncomfortable?

389
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:48,117
Well...

390
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:51,780
I just couldn't fix it.

391
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,794
I couldn't leave you here all by yourself.

392
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:58,027
I had to at least keep watch.

393
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:00,399
Gosh, you're such a fool.

394
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,773
Well...

395
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:06,104
I guess I should leave now.

396
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:14,140
Hold on.

397
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,976
Have some breakfast.

398
00:24:16,976 --> 00:24:20,490
You probably couldn't get a good night's sleep.

399
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,925
Really? Then shall I have one of your home-cooked meals?

400
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:30,450
Ro Bin's pants look hilarious.

401
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,782
It's a floral hat.

402
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:33,122
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes.

403
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:34,874
Ji Na's pants look the best.

404
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,486
- That's true.
- I know, right?

405
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:38,137
We match.

406
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,570
We've picked a lot.

407
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,403
- Let's pick this one.
- Where's the red one?

408
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:45,495
- The red one's here.
- Here?

409
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:48,548
My clothes...

410
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:50,550
I'm tired. I think we're done.

411
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,492
Bo Ra, where are the peppers?

412
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:05,515
- Gosh.
- I'm so tired.

413
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:07,506
It's so hot.

414
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:11,791
- Gosh.
- Aigoo.

415
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:17,870
I really respect farmers.

416
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,390
He is...

417
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:37,660
What are you doing?

418
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,740
Do you want me to help you?

419
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,294
Let's see.

420
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:57,336
You seem to care about him a lot.

421
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:58,747
Why do you?

422
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,660
Do I?

423
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:05,754
I just feel bad for them.

424
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:21,661
I feel bad because they remind me of me and Sa Na.

425
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:25,694
We grew up with our grandma too.

426
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:29,147
We really missed our parents,

427
00:26:29,147 --> 00:26:31,700
and they do too.

428
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,653
I care about them because I can relate to them.

429
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,446
I see.

430
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:45,544
Guys, we sweated a lot. Aren't you hungry?

431
00:26:45,544 --> 00:26:47,337
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

432
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:50,139
- I want to eat.
- Let's go.

433
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,224
I'm so tired.

434
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:56,626
I was dripping with sweat.

435
00:26:56,626 --> 00:26:59,267
- You don't know?
- I don't know, either.

436
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:04,773
What? You feel bad for us?

437
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,776
How dare she pity us.

438
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:09,849
Who does she think she is?

439
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,101
- Zero zero seven.
- Bang.

440
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,554
- Zero zero seven.
- Bang.

441
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:27,145
Zero zero seven. Bang.

442
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,869
- Zero zero seven...
- Sam Sun!

443
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:30,599
Sam Sun!

444
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,962
Where did she go? Sam Sun...

445
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:35,416
Hey...

446
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:38,739
Have you seen Sam Sun?

447
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:41,642
Sam Sun? We haven't seen her. Why?

448
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:43,483
She's gone.

449
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,635
I can't find her anywhere.

450
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:47,507
Isn't she just playing around somewhere?

451
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:49,158
No,

452
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:50,731
even if she goes somewhere,

453
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:53,253
she always comes home when it's time for dinner.

454
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:55,524
Gosh... Wait.

455
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:59,449
I heard that people steal dogs these days.

456
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:01,702
What if someone stole her and...

457
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:03,582
Oh no. What do we do?

458
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,416
No way. Don't worry, Grandma.

459
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07,708
We'll look for her.

460
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,729
All right.

461
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,301
- Sam Sun!
- Sam Sun!

462
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:13,783
- Sam Sun!
- Where are you?

463
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:16,055
- Sam Sun!
- Sam Sun!

464
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:18,357
- Sam Sun!
- Sam Sun!

465
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:20,499
- Sam Sun!

466
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,883
- Sam Sun!
- Sam Sun!

467
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:26,526
Sam Sun, where are you?

468
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:28,368
Sam Sun!

469
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:30,479
Sam Sun!

470
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:34,074
Sam Sun, let's go home.

471
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:35,835
Sam Sun!

472
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:38,699
Sam Sun's gone?

473
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:40,910
Yes, we're all looking for her.

474
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,411
Have you guys seen her?

475
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:46,936
I saw her in the hills. She's not back yet?

476
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:49,609
- I should've brought her.
- In the hills?

477
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,190
Where in the hills?

478
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,044
I saw her near the Turtle Rock on the hillside.

479
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:57,156
You're going to go look for her?

480
00:28:57,156 --> 00:28:59,799
It'll be hard by yourself.

481
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:02,842
If you tell me where it is, I'll go with my friends.

482
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:06,030
If you don't hurry, someone might steal her.

483
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:08,847
Do you want me to go with you?

484
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,000
Really? Will you come with me? Hold on.

485
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:17,617
My phone isn't getting any signal again.

486
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:19,869
If we go now, she'll still be there.

487
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,250
Let's hurry and go.

488
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,952
Hyun Wu, go ahead and go home.

489
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:25,374
Yes.

490
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:47,370
Wait, I'll be right back.

491
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:50,450
Oh, okay. You can go.

492
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:20,149
Geon Wu, are you done yet?

493
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:27,326
Geon Wu.

494
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:40,620
Geon Wu,

495
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,563
stop joking around and come out.

496
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,638
Geon Wu!

497
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,892
Geon Wu!

498
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,392
I told you to go home. Let's go.

499
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,923
Heyong, what about nuna Ji Na?

500
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:16,925
Is it all right to leave her here?

501
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:19,349
What if she gets lost?

502
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:23,390
She's not stupid. She won't get lost.

503
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,234
She'll struggle a bit.

504
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:31,361
She deserves it.

505
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:34,643
Don't worry. Let's go.

506
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:09,680
Where am I?

507
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,070
Am I going the right way?

508
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,924
Where did Geon Wu go?

509
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:20,449
No Service

510
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,553
My phone isn't even working.

511
00:32:56,515 --> 00:32:58,058
[Epilogue]
Just help me out this once.

512
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:00,610
I'm trying to get on Eun Hui's good side.

513
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,694
If I try it and can't fix it, you can go fix it tomorrow.

514
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:07,125
- But I told her I would go today.
- Come on.

515
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,748
Now call her.

516
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,361
Go on.

517
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:14,474
Hi, I'm the person who's supposed to fix your door today.

518
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:15,805
I'm sorry,

519
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:18,437
but I can't go because something came up.

520
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,860
What do you mean, you suddenly can't come?

521
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,373
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:24,975
Thank you. You can leave now.

523
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:26,716
You're the best.
