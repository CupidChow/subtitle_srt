00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:04,093
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,283
Ajussi,

5
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:46,386
what's the fine for selling alcohol to a minor?

6
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,078
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:51,642
I don't know because we've never been caught,

8
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:53,163
but I think it would be about a million won.
(≈ $895)

9
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:55,836
A million won?

10
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:58,818
Then we'll let you go for 500,000 won (≈ $447).

11
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:01,271
What? What do you mean?

12
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,794
You sold alcohol to a minor.

13
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:11,411
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:15,315
- He's a minor.
- Why are you being like this?

15
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:19,840
I checked all three of your IDs just a little while ago.

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,003
Ajussi, do you think I would get my own age wrong?

17
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:27,816
You just violated the Juvenile Protection Act.

18
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:32,432
But I mean,

19
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:35,975
if you give us 500,000 won, we'll let it go and say it didn't happen.

20
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:39,058
Mister Manager, you got lucky.

21
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,400
- Let's leave it at that.
- Come on.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,654
What in the world are you talking about?

23
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:47,817
I think you're drunk. Stop joking around,

24
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,700
finish up, and go home.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,692
We're not joking. You'll regret it later.

26
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,245
Gosh.

27
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,910
They're such weird kids.

28
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:10,340
Police

29
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:13,343
Who made the report?

30
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:16,336
I did. I'm a minor, but he sold alcohol to me.

31
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,368
- So you reported yourself?
- Yes.

32
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:23,233
I showed him my ID, and he still sold alcohol to me.

33
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,616
The lack of protection toward juveniles was disappointing,

34
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,407
so I reported myself.

35
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:31,119
You can't let stores like this get away with such things.

36
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:35,245
- What's going on?
- Are you the owner here?

37
00:02:35,245 --> 00:02:37,247
Yes, well...

38
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,501
- I'm not the real owner.
- What?

39
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,662
He's not even the real owner?

40
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:45,756
I'm an employee who works like an owner.

41
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:48,218
We received a report...

42
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:51,701
that this store sold alcohol to a minor.

43
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:54,494
What? No way.

44
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:57,056
I always thoroughly check IDs.

45
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:59,007
This man sold it to me.

46
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,733
Did you sell alcohol to him?

47
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,565
Yes, I did sell him alcohol,

48
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,397
but I checked his ID

49
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:10,309
and verified that he is an adult.

50
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:13,192
Let me see your ID.

51
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,205
Resident Card
Born in year 2000

52
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,582
An Seong In born in 2000, right?

53
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:25,835
- That's him.
- What?

54
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,718
There's no way. I...

55
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,940
When I checked inside a little while ago,

56
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,074
he was definitely not a minor.

57
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:36,016
Oh, that's right.

58
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,448
You can check the surveillance camera inside, right?

59
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:52,652
You did check their IDs, but we can't see what's on them.

60
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:54,003
Come on.

61
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:57,688
I showed him my ID, and he still sold alcohol to me.

62
00:03:57,688 --> 00:04:00,581
- He has no conscience.
- That's not...

63
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:05,045
He was definitely not a minor, okay?

64
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,438
Did you show me a fake ID?

65
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:11,170
- So now you're putting the blame on me.
- Be quiet.

66
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:16,385
- I can't believe this.
- I do think it's possible,

67
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:17,928
but unfortunately,

68
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:20,469
there needs to be proof that the ID shown

69
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,922
at the counter was fake.

70
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,064
Gosh...

71
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:28,007
Why are you laughing? You guys did wrong too.

72
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:31,000
According to the Juvenile Protection Act, only the vendor gets punished,

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,032
and the juvenile doesn't.

74
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:34,194
I know the laws.

75
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:37,216
My gosh. When you bought the alcohol,

76
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:40,701
did you even use your own ID? Are you sure it wasn't a fake?

77
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,742
If your ID is fake,

78
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,856
that's a crime of forging official documents.

79
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:49,048
Do you have proof? You don't.

80
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:52,851
You should arrest this man who sold alcohol to a minor.

81
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,183
I'm going crazy.

82
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:05,205
We have no choice

83
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,367
but to record it as a violation of the Juvenile Protection Act.

84
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:11,250
There could be penalty fines

85
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,272
as well as additional penalty fees.

86
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:17,237
Aigoo! This is so unfair!

87
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,198
Sir, please investigate this.

88
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,929
What's going on?

89
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,126
You punk! That ID earlier was fake, wasn't it?

90
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,998
Where is it? Hand it over.

91
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,458
What do you think you're doing?

92
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,210
You're the one who sold the alcohol.

93
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,543
What did you say, you punk?

94
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:35,135
- What are you doing?
- Get over here!

95
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,257
- Let go!
- How dare you?

96
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,198
- Let go of him.
- Just look for his ID.

97
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,429
- Let go.
- Gosh.

98
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:42,012
- Show it to me.
- I told you it's not fake.

99
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:43,503
- Look for his ID!
- Calm down, sir.

100
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:46,205
- What are you doing?
- Calm down!

101
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:47,497
What's going on?

102
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,188
- Look through his pockets!
- Let go.

103
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:52,011
- What are you doing?
- Calm down!

104
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:55,014
You just have to search his pockets for it!

105
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:58,067
- If you search him, you'll find it!
- Calm down.

106
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,869
- Does he want to get beaten up?
- It must be a fake ID!

107
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:01,370
You can find it in his pockets!

108
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,853
- Calm down.
- What do you mean they're minors?

109
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,825
- Dad!
- These rotten kids...

110
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,918
- What's with that guy?
- It's...

111
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,910
Ji Na.

112
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,877
Mom, let's go.

113
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:30,209
- All right.
- Let's hurry.

114
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:38,307
Mister,

115
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:41,390
we'll notify you later for now. All right?

116
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,103
My gosh.

117
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,435
You guys go home too.

118
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:47,186
- Goodbye.
- Hurry up.

119
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:49,209
- I can't believe him.
- Oh my gosh.

120
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,230
Just let it go.

121
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,622
- Let's go to an internet cafe.
- He is unbelievable.

122
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:54,344
- We did it.
- Nice.

123
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:55,716
He's in trouble.

124
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,062
Dad,

125
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:15,856
what happened? Why were the police here?

126
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:18,277
I checked his ID,

127
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:21,770
and he was definitely an adult.

128
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,574
I think it was fake.

129
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:28,077
- A fake ID?
- He totally planned it.

130
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:31,330
How could I win against those guys?

131
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,294
My goodness.

132
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,569
After they drink, they make a deal.

133
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:41,762
They tell the owners they're underage,

134
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:45,416
and make them pay settlement money so they don't get fined and shut down.

135
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,776
And all the owners give them money.

136
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:08,689
My dad wouldn't do something like that.

137
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,779
It's so strange.

138
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:14,333
My dad has been

139
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:18,468
trying so hard to get back on his feet.

140
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,231
Your face is covered now,

141
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,172
so you can cry comfortably.

142
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:20,970
You were surprised by my dad, weren't you?

143
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:25,074
I couldn't say anything because it was complicated.

144
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,896
Everyone has things they can't say.

145
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,952
You have something like that too?

146
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:36,516
Yes.

147
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:47,747
You can

148
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:52,370
tell me later if you want.

149
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:58,447
There are moments when you want to tell someone.

150
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,892
I'm sorry, Grandma.

151
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:16,085
I haven't called in a while.

152
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:19,527
No, it's all right.

153
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:23,132
I'll visit you this summer for the first time in a while.

154
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:25,085
Yes, of course.

155
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:28,387
I'll make lots of yummy food for you.

156
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:30,780
You can come with your friends,

157
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,723
and also...

158
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:36,055
Your dad can come too.

159
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:40,851
Never mind.

160
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,783
Ji Na,

161
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,885
no matter what,

162
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:48,157
your dad is still your dad.

163
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:50,169
The phone bill is going to be high.

164
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:52,061
Let's hang up.

165
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:53,713
Right.

166
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,583
Mom,

167
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,935
do you have 500,000 won (≈ $447) by any chance?

168
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:18,807
- Why do you ask?
- Well...

169
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,792
Apparently, Dad's fine could be a million won (≈ $895).

170
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,396
He wants you to pay his fine?

171
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,848
No, it's not that.

172
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:32,201
- I know how hard it is for Dad—
- He sold alcohol to minors.

173
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,363
Why would you pay for his mistake?

174
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:37,366
And why did you call him Dad there?

175
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:38,958
Ro Bin saw everything.

176
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,122
Hey, Dad even scolds students who smoke on the streets.

177
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:47,376
I have seen him thoroughly checking IDs at the store all the time.

178
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:51,051
Whether it was intentional or not, he still sold the alcohol.

179
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:54,675
That has been his problem ever since long ago. He always gets fooled.

180
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:58,178
Whenever someone asks a favor of him, he blindly trusts them and gets fooled.

181
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:02,642
Even after all his failures, he just can't get it together.

182
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:04,723
I'm so frustrated.

183
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,892
You fell for it again?

184
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,946
I told you not to trust people so much and get into hard situations.

185
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:17,406
I had no idea

186
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:21,081
that such a kind person would fool me like that.

187
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:23,292
Who is kind when it comes to money?

188
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:27,166
We can't keep this house anymore. What are you going to do?

189
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,418
What are you going to do about this?

190
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,093
I can't believe you.

191
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,764
I'm sorry, Honey.

192
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:37,366
What are you going to do?

193
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:43,972
Here.

194
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,614
I talked to the lawyer,
[Divorce Form]

195
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:56,576
and he said that if we at least want to get money for our rent deposit,

196
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,857
this is the only way.

197
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:04,143
As of right now,

198
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:07,076
we at least need to find a place

199
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,669
for you and the kids to live.

200
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:11,651
For the time being,

201
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:14,755
I think I'll have to move around.

202
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:15,965
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:18,718
I'll pay off all our debt in a few years

204
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:21,391
and do everything I couldn't do

205
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:23,503
for you and the kids.

206
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,954
Please trust and wait for me until then.

207
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,379
Gosh.

208
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,733
Don't come back.

209
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:36,176
Leave, you jerk!

210
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:38,747
Don't come back ever again!

211
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,151
I'm going to work during the day

212
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:54,874
and try to get a license too.

213
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,007
Mom, please look after the kids

214
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,720
for just a year.

215
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,563
- Did you draw this?
- Don't worry.

216
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:04,854
Yes.

217
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:07,407
They're my grandchildren.

218
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,018
Don't worry.

219
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:12,321
You can leave it to me to take care of them.

220
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,169
I'll get going.

221
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,892
Mom.

222
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:38,226
Mommy.

223
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,412
What's wrong, Sa Na?

224
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:45,976
Eonni, I miss Mom.

225
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:50,119
Eonni, where's Mom? Mommy...

226
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,904
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

227
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:57,056
Do you want me to sing for you, Sa Na?

228
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,389
Yes.

What are you up to?

240
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,857
You scared me.

241
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:49,910
Sorry. Were you surprised?

242
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,561
No, it's all right.

243
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:58,066
What happened with the store?

244
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:00,429
Oh.

245
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,273
You heard about it?

246
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:09,909
Ro Bin was worried. He said it was strange.

247
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:15,294
I understand the manager was your dad.

248
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,469
Yes.

249
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:21,160
It was complicated, so we had to live apart for a while.

250
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,102
He came back here recently.

251
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:28,618
He's not on good terms with my mom right now.

252
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:30,519
I wasn't able to tell you.

253
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,412
But you know,

254
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:36,305
he didn't look like the type to do that.

255
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,761
I have something to tell you.

256
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,016
When I went to the bathroom at the store yesterday,

257
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:50,239
I bumped into someone.

258
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:54,924
The guy with the red hat.

259
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:57,546
But...

260
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:00,939
It's strange, no matter how I look at it.

261
00:17:04,364 --> 00:17:07,808
I showed him my ID, and he still sold alcohol to me.

262
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:11,211
He has no conscience.

263
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,262
Gosh.

264
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:14,594
But I only took a glance,

265
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:16,866
so I don't know for sure.

266
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:21,071
Thanks for letting me know anyway.

267
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:23,453
His name is An Seong In.

268
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:25,654
He was born in 2000.
(In Korea, you legally become an adult at 19 not 18)

269
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:31,310
I saw him showing his ID to the police.

270
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,084
Then should we go check the surveillance camera?

271
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:39,819
Dad, show us the surveillance camera.

272
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:42,472
- Why?
- Something is weird.

273
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:45,154
We might find something while looking at the surveillance camera.

274
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:48,577
The police couldn't even do anything. What would you guys be able to do?

275
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,411
Thanks, but I'll take care of it. Go study.

276
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:55,084
Dad, show it to us just once.

277
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:57,858
Ajussi, we'll be able to find a clue.

278
00:17:57,858 --> 00:17:59,540
No, just leave.

279
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,280
Ji Na, hurry and go.

280
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,664
Ajussi, please show it to us just once.

281
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:23,563
You're right.

282
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,907
The guy who bought the alcohol had a tattoo on his neck,

283
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,600
but the guy checking the surveillance camera with the police

284
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,743
doesn't have a tattoo.

285
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:35,245
How can this be?

286
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,817
Everything is the same besides the tattoo.

287
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,319
Their height, body shape,

288
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,333
clothes, and hat.

289
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,256
Even the t-shirt and ripped jeans are

290
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:48,108
all the same.

291
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,363
What if there are two people with the name An Seong In?

292
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:59,500
What if they changed clothes inside the bathroom

293
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,990
where there's no surveillance camera?

294
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,775
Here it is.

295
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:34,514
You're right.

296
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:36,847
An Seong In switched clothes with this person

297
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,138
inside the bathroom.

298
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:41,542
The guy with the tattoo wore a red hat and bought the alcohol.

299
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:46,496
And then An Seong In called the police after drinking the alcohol.

300
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:48,598
This makes sense, right?

301
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:50,339
Nice.

302
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:08,938
Yes, sir.

303
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:13,193
- No, that's not it.
- How could you sell alcohol to a minor?

304
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:16,845
I'm going to hire someone else, so get ready to quit.

305
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:36,617
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

306
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,919
I'm a minor, but he sold alcohol to me.

307
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,921
Enter target's name

308
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:53,703
That ID earlier was fake, wasn't it?

309
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:55,054
An Seong In

310
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,928
According to the Juvenile Protection Act, only the vendor gets punished,

311
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:00,449
and the juvenile doesn't.

312
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:02,562
Target meets all conditions. We will proceed with the revenge

313
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:11,531
I heard you got that store owner good.

314
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,474
Of course I did. How dare he mess with me?

315
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:18,639
It was so embarrassing that day when I got caught being a minor.

316
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:21,541
Aish, I should've done worse to him.

317
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,704
That store manager is so pathetic.

318
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:26,917
He should've just paid the settlement money.

319
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,649
- We got it at a few other places.
- Hey,

320
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,502
other places hand it over without a word.

321
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:33,553
Even twice a week is good enough.

322
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:36,456
They can't even call the police on us because they're scared.

323
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,640
You have been selected as a revenge target

324
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,491
What is this?

325
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:45,976
- Do you like it that much?
- Yes.

326
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:48,168
I always wanted this designer bag.

327
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:49,189
Thanks.

328
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:51,110
Then shall we go drink?

329
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,274
Sorry, I have to go to school today.

330
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:55,726
- But it's Sunday.
- I know.

331
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:57,377
I have a group project for a mandatory course,

332
00:21:57,377 --> 00:21:59,118
so we're gathering at the department office today.

333
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,682
Mandatory course? Department office?

334
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:03,663
- Then you should go.
- I'll text you.

335
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:06,446
Okay, bye.

336
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:18,097
Hey, high schooler, how long did you think I'd be fooled?

337
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:21,201
This bag is compensation for the emotional distress I went through,

338
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:23,373
so keep that in mind, you high schooler.

339
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:25,225
Let me know if you ever get into college.

340
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:27,628
It'll be impossible with your stupidity though.

341
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:29,560
Darn it!

342
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,441
That bag was so expensive.

343
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:36,366
She should've just left. Why did she take that bag?

344
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:39,489
I spent all my money on that.

345
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,422
I've got to do it.

346
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:45,235
I'll have to do another one tonight.

347
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:49,808
Yes, hyeong, it's me.

348
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:55,546
- Gosh.
- Welcome.

349
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:57,197
Please show me your IDs.

350
00:22:57,197 --> 00:22:58,839
Aish, IDs...

351
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,182
Resident Card, An Seong In
Born in 1999

352
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:07,267
All right.

353
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:09,949
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

354
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:15,234
Come out.

355
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:19,087
I'm going to the bathroom.

356
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,645
It's so hot.

357
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:07,507
Hurry and give it to me. What are you doing?

358
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:09,119
You hurry and give it to me.

359
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,642
- What do you mean?
- What are you talking about?

360
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:15,354
Come out while I'm being nice.

361
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:19,479
Darn it.

362
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:27,767
What were you going to do after switching clothes?

363
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,829
Well, that's...

364
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:31,921
- These rude punks.
- How dare you?

365
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,714
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

366
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:36,165
- Please go easy on us.
- Please.

367
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:38,027
- I'm sorry.
- Forgive us.

368
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:39,739
- Please let us go.
- I'm sorry.

369
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:42,020
- We won't do this ever again.
- You'd better not.

370
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:54,124
Your revenge is complete

371
00:24:56,085 --> 00:25:00,410
Will I ever find out who the Master is?

372
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:03,752
Ro Bin,

373
00:25:06,516 --> 00:25:08,528
I need you to go somewhere with me.

374
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:13,423
Oh.

375
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:16,025
You come too.

376
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:17,356
To where?

377
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:20,970
My dad wants to thank you two. So he wanted me to bring you.

378
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,752
Let's go.

379
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:29,239
What did I tell you?

380
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:31,662
He may have failed some businesses,

381
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:34,414
but he is not the type of person to sell alcohol to minors.

382
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:36,997
He must have looked pretty stupid for those kids to target him.

383
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:40,060
If some kids did the same to you, you would've been fooled by them too.

384
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,381
I heard they fooled so many people.

385
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:44,744
The kids are the bad ones, not him.

386
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,746
All right, all right, I get it. Stop nagging me.

387
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:50,309
To be honest, where would you find a guy like him?

388
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:53,853
He was like the son our mother never had.

389
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:57,857
He even paid for my college tuition as if he were my brother.

390
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:01,420
Beside the fact that he failed some businesses,

391
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,424
he's all right.

392
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:06,697
And I think he has come to his senses these days.

393
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:08,578
Give it some thought.

394
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:11,281
Give what some thought?

395
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,203
People don't change.

396
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:15,565
I went through so much because of that guy.

397
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,207
Gosh.

398
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,031
Be quiet.

399
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:24,214
Yes, Mr. Park.

400
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:27,618
You can just come to the office.

401
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:31,180
Meet at Hidden Beer at eight o'clock?

402
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,184
You want to sign the contract there?

403
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:39,609
All right, I will see you later.

404
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:41,962
Why does he want to meet you at a bar at night?

405
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,753
He's only signing the contract.

406
00:26:43,753 --> 00:26:45,595
The more desperate one needs to go, what can I do?

407
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:48,529
Just tell him to come to the office during the day.

408
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,010
I can handle it by myself.

409
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,234
Why are you nagging so much these days?

410
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:55,495
I'm hungry.

411
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:59,068
Dad.

412
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:00,791
You're here.

413
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,483
Hey, guys.

414
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:04,044
Hi.

415
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:06,425
Thank you. Thank you!

416
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,088
No problem.

417
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:12,381
Ro Bin, I heard you were the first one to speak up.

418
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,096
What do you like to eat? From now on,

419
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,979
I will give you everything you want to eat.

420
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:21,752
It's all right.

421
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:25,065
What do you mean, it's all right? Just let me know.

422
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:27,847
Je Yi, you too. Tell me everything you want to eat.

423
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:31,601
Take your pick. Choose anything you want!

424
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:34,514
Go ahead and choose a lot.

425
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:41,070
They're both so nice and handsome.

426
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,544
Which one is the better pick?

427
00:27:43,544 --> 00:27:45,655
Better pick?

428
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:48,048
The one to be your boyfriend.

429
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:49,629
What are you talking about? It's not like that.

430
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:51,760
Come on.

431
00:27:58,098 --> 00:28:00,040
Revenge Note has been helping me

432
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,293
ever since these two moved here.

433
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:04,994
Je Yi?

434
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,458
Ro Bin?

435
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:14,282
Do you really have nothing to do with Revenge Note?

436
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:19,229
Ms. Kim!

437
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:21,790
Have a seat.

438
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:30,090
You're hungry, right?

439
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,242
No, I'm all right.

440
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:33,723
Here.

441
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:41,341
Cheers.

442
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:42,871
Yes.

443
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:54,143
You should pour me a glass too.

444
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:56,576
Yes.

445
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,003
My heart aches whenever I see you.

446
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:06,446
It must be hard for a woman

447
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,588
to raise two kids by herself.

448
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:11,962
- It breaks my heart.
- Thank you for caring.

449
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:14,464
So, I brought the contract.

450
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:16,245
You can read it over and stamp it.

451
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:18,969
Aigoo, why are you in such a rush?

452
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:20,430
Pardon?

453
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:24,124
Oh my.

454
00:29:24,124 --> 00:29:25,665
I'm saying this

455
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:28,288
because you're like a younger sister.

456
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,371
Aren't you lonely?

457
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:32,733
Don't do this.

458
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:35,685
I didn't think you were like this. How disappointing.

459
00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:38,788
You don't need to sign the contract.

460
00:29:38,788 --> 00:29:41,381
Hey, Ms. Kim.

461
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:42,832
Why are you being like this?

462
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:44,293
- Don't do this.
- Come on...

463
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:47,296
I just wanted to have a heart-to-heart conversation. Why are you so feisty?

464
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:49,319
- I told you to stop.
- Come on.

465
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,151
- I'm asking you to stop!
- Hey.

466
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:55,365
Stop it, you punk. I don't like it!

467
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:56,617
I can't believe this woman.

468
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:59,548
I signed so many contracts with you.

469
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:05,615
There should be some give-and-take.

470
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:07,646
You punk!

471
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,259
How dare you?

472
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:14,804
Oh my!

473
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:16,505
Honey.

474
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:19,158
- How dare you—
- Did you just hit me?

475
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:20,830
Who the heck are you?

476
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,662
I'm her husband!

477
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:25,354
What do you mean, husband? She's divorced!

478
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:29,128
I'm her ex-husband, you punk!

479
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,362
Gosh. Help us.

480
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:34,464
- Why, you—
- Stop it!

481
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,497
Help us.

482
00:30:37,497 --> 00:30:39,499
Please help us!

483
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:42,291
Help us. Oh my!

484
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,474
Oh no.

485
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:46,506
Let go of me!

486
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:47,958
- Come here!
- Someone help!

487
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,899
- Hey!
- Darn it!

488
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:53,302
- You pig!
- Stop!

489
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:54,804
- Hey!
- Come here!

490
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:56,276
- You!
- Hey!

491
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:58,117
Do you know who I am?

492
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:00,030
- Who are you?
- I'm going to sue you.

493
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,061
Sue me, you nasty jerk!

494
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:03,603
- Aish!
- Sue?

495
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:05,145
Yes, go ahead and sue.

496
00:31:05,145 --> 00:31:07,788
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

497
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:09,790
You'll be embarrassed for the rest of your life!

498
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,492
-Aish!
- My gosh.

499
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:14,063
-Wait...
- Hey!

500
00:31:14,063 --> 00:31:15,615
You'll be embarrassed for the rest of your life!

501
00:31:15,615 --> 00:31:17,116
Gosh.

502
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,087
How many times have I told you? I said I can take care of myself.

503
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:29,729
How did you even know where I was?

504
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,462
Your sister...

505
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:33,313
You sure look great.

506
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:35,945
You couldn't even avoid those slow punches?

507
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:39,659
- I hit him more though.
- Good for you!

508
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,513
Stop butting into my business.

509
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:44,744
That is your problem.

510
00:31:44,744 --> 00:31:46,727
You always acted on your own,

511
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:48,268
saying it was for your family.

512
00:31:48,268 --> 00:31:52,321
I'm so sick of it! I really am!

513
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:53,544
Gosh.

514
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:56,826
It's dangerous to walk alone at night.

515
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:58,578
I'll walk you home!

516
00:31:58,578 --> 00:32:00,801
Look at where I got hit.

517
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:04,263
- Gosh.
- Why is that ajussi with my mom?

518
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:06,876
Hey, don't be like that.

519
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:10,250
Your mom will handle it. Let's go.

520
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,962
Let's go.

521
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:14,454
Get away from me.

522
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,827
[Epilogue]
Oh my.

523
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:31,650
Sa Na, you're so good at drawing.

524
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,123
But why did you draw

525
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:37,468
your father so big?

526
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,950
Because I miss him.

527
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
What?

528
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:51,928
