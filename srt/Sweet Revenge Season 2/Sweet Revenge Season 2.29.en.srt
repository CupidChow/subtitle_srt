~ Revenge Note 2 ~

00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,800
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:32,703
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,636
Hey, Sa Na. Look at these.

5
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:49,058
This one or this one? Which one looks better on me?

6
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:51,542
Why are you suddenly picking out clothes?

7
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:54,725
I just need to.

8
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,187
You're going on a date with Oppa Ro Bin, aren't you?

9
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:58,589
Hurry, pick one.

10
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:00,440
This one or this one?

11
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:04,614
The right one makes you look old,

12
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:07,976
and the left one makes you look fat. Both of them suck.

13
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,788
But what are you going to do?

14
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,781
It's going to become a long-distance relationship before you even fall in love.

15
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,425
I heard that long-distance relationships are doomed to break up.

16
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:28,166
That's definitely not going to happen to us.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,222
Ro Bin

18
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,056
Ro Bin? What's up?

19
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:40,900
It hasn't even been that long since you last saw each other.

20
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,232
How would a kid like you understand the love between adults?

21
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:45,475
I'm not a kid, okay?

22
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:50,450
Sorry about that. Sa Na's being annoying.

23
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,602
What did Sa Na do?

24
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,903
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

25
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:57,377
Ro Bin, what were you doing?

26
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:58,818
Hey.

27
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,070
What's with your voice?

28
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,863
What's wrong with my voice?

29
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:04,534
Stop it.

30
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:06,797
Is it weird?

31
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:09,388
Yeah, it's weird.

32
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:11,741
Would it kill you to just say something nice?

33
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:14,684
You haven't changed one bit.

34
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:20,130
♪With those beautiful eyes ♪

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,023

Ji Na?

40
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:43,453
Ji Na, are you sleeping?

41
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,067
I guess you're sleeping.

42
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,751
You're the one who asked me to sing, and you fall asleep.

43
00:02:53,803 --> 00:02:56,727
Good night, Ji Na.

44
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:58,778
See you tomorrow.

45
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:11,360
You just hung up?

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,202
What?

47
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:15,424
When did you get in here?

48
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:18,678
Aren't you being too mean?

49
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:21,320
You clearly know how I feel.

50
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:24,414
Do you need to do this?

51
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:27,267
Well... I mean...

52
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:30,360
I didn't know you came in.

53
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,794
Hey, I'm just kidding!

54
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:37,277
- What?
- You got scared, didn't you?

55
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,929
You sounded serious.

56
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:41,700
Well, maybe I am.

57
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:46,305
I recorded your singing just now.

58
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,337
I'm going to listen to this when I'm feeling down.

59
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:50,239
Why did you record that?

60
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,841
Gosh.

61
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,743
Get away from me.

62
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,035
I said get away from me.

63
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,887
I won't.

64
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:58,658
- Then come get it.
- Come on!

65
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,119
Come and get it.

66
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,431
Stop it.

67
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:02,483
Come and get it.

68
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,580
- Gosh.
- Too slow.

69
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,475
- Give it to me.
- Then come get it.

70
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:08,698
- It's right here.
- Come on.

71
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:14,763
Hey, Su Ji. Over here.

72
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:23,152
I guess life is treating you well, Eonni.

73
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:24,974
You look well.

74
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:28,107
Well, I heard you've been picking up garbage these days.

75
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:29,979
How's that going?

76
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,112
Stop talking about that. It pisses me off.

77
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:37,778
How did the almighty Geum Su Ji end up like this?

78
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:42,703
Is it true that all of this is because of Oh Ji Na?

79
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:45,344
Of course! A while ago...

80
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:52,642
Something called Revenge Note popped up on my cell phone.

81
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,618
Revenge Note popped up...

82
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:00,179
That text is super suspicious.

83
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,512
Someone took revenge on me just as it said.

84
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:06,115
When I got that I thought it was just a spam text message.

85
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:07,728
It's not?

86
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:10,370
Oh Ji Na may not have done it herself,

87
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,373
but someone must be helping her behind her back.

88
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,871
We're going to need her cellphone if we want to find out the truth.

89
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,482
I'll get her cellphone.

90
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:26,155
She'll return to the classroom soon. I'll steal it then.

91
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:27,667
Okay.

92
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,430
She should get a taste of her own medicine.

93
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:37,967
This looks delicious.

94
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,600
People's lives can't be too different.

95
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,431
Here you go, our Mr. Choi.

96
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,287
Here you go.

97
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,350
One for our Ms. Jeong too. Open wide.

98
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:56,026
I need to lose weight to fit into my wedding dress.

99
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:58,067
What weight do you have to lose?

100
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,990
You're so thin that you could blow away with the wind.

101
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,921
Don't be like that. Open wide.

102
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:06,345
How delicious.

103
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:10,128
It's zero calories if you enjoyed it. Isn't that right?

104
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,403
But, about us dating...

105
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:15,776
I should just tell everyone already.

106
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,888
Dating in secret is just too hard.

107
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:20,910
Just wait it out a bit.

108
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,936
We promised to make a big announcement when we pass out the wedding invitations.

109
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:29,098
No way. Instead,

110
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,542
I should just tell everyone when they announce the full-time hire.

111
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,025
Have one more.

112
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:38,186
Here you go.

113
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:45,114
Jin Sang

114
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,718
What does he want at this hour? I'll be right back.

115
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:54,504
That stupid principal.

116
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:57,126
I hate that Jin Sang.

117
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:00,449
He's always bothering everyone.

118
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,835
Yes, respectable Principal?

119
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:07,447
Mr. Choi.

120
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:09,839
Something bad has happened.

121
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,732
Could you come down to Gangnam?

122
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,944
Gangnam? I'm a bit far away from there.

123
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:16,996
So you can't come?

124
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:20,920
This is a very urgent matter.

125
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,613
- Yet you can't come?
- No, sir.

126
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:25,095
I'll rush over there right now.

127
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:28,106
Yes, sir!

128
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,461
I'm so sorry, but I need to get going.

129
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,614
What happened? Does the principal want you to come?

130
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,165
What does he want?

131
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,368
I'm not sure. But I still need to go.

132
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:41,011
I guess it can't be helped.

133
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,553
Tomorrow's the announcement for the full-time hire.

134
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:45,094
Let's be patient for a day.

135
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:48,607
Let's do that. Sorry, I'll get going now.

136
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:53,582
Gosh.

137
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:59,499
Where the heck is he?

138
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:02,672
He said it was urgent, so I rushed over here.

139
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:04,443
My gosh.

140
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,566
I told you that it's my treat.

141
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:14,554
I had such a good time thanks to you, Teacher Geum Bae Ji.

142
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:16,756
Get home safely.

143
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,598
Teacher Geum Bae Ji?

144
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,329
What school is he from?

145
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,923
We need to call a substitute driver service.

146
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:26,716
Don't do that. I've already called one.

147
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,639
Where is he?

148
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,870
Mr. Choi!

149
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,351
Over here.

150
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:35,425
Here. Catch!

151
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:39,028
I'm a little drunk,

152
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,211
so could you take me home?

153
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:44,114
So the urgent matter was because you needed me

154
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:46,576
to be your substitute driver?

155
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,738
What's wrong? Do you not want to?

156
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,542
Not at all. I'll take you home.

157
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,293
Please get in.

158
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,556
All right. I'll be heading home now.

159
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,638
Get home safely!

160
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,350
Get home safely.

161
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,018
Let's be patient for one more day.

162
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,403
Hey, Ajussi.

163
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:19,037
Get him home safely. Got it?

164
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,321
Off you go.

165
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,867
Hanjong High School

166
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:35,084
I'm sure you all know

167
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:38,057
there was a selection process

168
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:41,210
for hiring a full-time gym class teacher.

169
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,884
After the approval of the board,

170
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:49,108
we have decided on a candidate for the full-time hire.

171
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,181
Congratulations.

172
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:54,013
Congratulations.

173
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:58,988
The teacher selected for this process is...

174
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,768
Come on in, Mr. Geum.

175
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,504
Hello.

176
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:26,175
I'm Geum Bae Ji.

177
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,337
I look forward to working with you.

178
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,794
Well then, get back to work.

179
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:37,547
Teacher Geum, please come to my office.

180
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:39,088
Yes.

181
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:51,141
I didn't know that Su Ji had such a talented cousin.

182
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,813
I'm growing to like you more and more.

183
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:57,747
You're just oozing with class.

184
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:01,711
I'm lucky to have my parents.

185
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:05,014
But my dad doesn't spend much on me.

186
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:08,427
But I heard you're amazing at golf.

187
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:11,681
My dad forced me to do it since I was young.

188
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:13,692
I got into college with my golf skills.

189
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:19,540
I guess early education is important.

190
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,041
But...

191
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,753
I heard your father runs a big business.

192
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:25,794
He must be busy.

193
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:31,390
My father actually was telling me that he wanted to have

194
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,852
a meal with you sometime.

195
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:35,515
He has a lot of friends in high positions on the Board of Education.

196
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:37,287
He'll be contacting you soon.

197
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:38,497
When are you free?

198
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,771
The sooner, the better!

199
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:45,485
Every day. Any time.

200
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:47,297
How could this happen?

201
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:49,409
Mr. Choi has bent over backwards for this school.

202
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,970
This isn't fair.

203
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,873
You did everything for him

204
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:56,666
and took all of his orders.

205
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,588
How could he do this to you?

206
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,865
Principal, may I have a word with you?

207
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,658
Mr. Geum, could you go outside for a bit?

208
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:20,059
Yes.

209
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:27,466
So you weren't a driver?

210
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,286
Principal,

211
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:39,700
how could you do this to me?

212
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,393
You said that if I did what you said, I could become a full-time hire.

213
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:47,477
I never complained once and did what you said.

214
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,398
I worked like a servant.

215
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:50,981
A servant?

216
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:54,574
Mr. Choi, did I force you to do any of those things?

217
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,787
You're the one who did those things on your own.

218
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:59,198
Also,

219
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,082
I really did put in a good word for you to the head of the board.

220
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,064
But what was the point?

221
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:06,877
You don't even have the qualifications.

222
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:12,071
Why didn't you try to appease him harder in the first place?

223
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,614
You need to know how to make your moves.

224
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:16,175
That's...

225
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:20,880
You know what's wrong with people like you, Mr. Choi?

226
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,492
People like you always blame others.

227
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:25,104
You don't think of your own faults.

228
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,769
I did what I could and I'm sorry that things ended this way.

229
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,762
And your contract with this school is now over.

230
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:35,384
Go ahead and pack up your things.

231
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:38,478
Are you saying I just need to leave like this?

232
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,079
Principal,

233
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,583
how could you do this to me?

234
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,606
What are you doing?

235
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:49,088
You still haven't left?

236
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:07,175
Gosh.

237
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,272
What is this? They want us to wrap our own gimbap?

238
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:16,736
"Wrap your own gimbap as if you were a mother yourself."

239
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:18,718
They've got some nerve.

240
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:21,991
They just give us the ingredients and expect us to make it ourselves?

241
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:23,453
This is too much.

242
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:27,746
At this rate, they're going to tell us to go farm the ingredients as well.

243
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,821
Hey, I asked them

244
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,834
to give us lots of pickled radish.

245
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,066
If you put in two, it might taste a little better.

246
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:38,007
Teacher, this is too mean.

247
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:41,180
Yesterday was the famine experience, and today we just get ingredients?

248
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,474
Don't be like that to Teacher Maeng.

249
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:47,937
Try it, it'll be yummy.

250
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,818
Enjoy.

251
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:58,497
Okay, let's try our best to make this yummy.

252
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,452
Hashtag: self-made gimbap experience.

253
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:05,495
Roll it up well. Press it well.

254
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:07,717
Do you want some too?

255
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,530
(secret "I love you" heart-gesture)

256
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,443
I can't even look at you guys.

257
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:48,497
Rok Hui,

258
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,661
I made you one too.

259
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:52,582
Nope.

260
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:55,045
Stop it.

261
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:57,837
When Ro Bin leaves for the States, it'll become a long-distance relationship,

262
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,269
so let them be.

263
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,840
Sure, sounds good.

264
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,662
Continue. Let's just eat, guys.

265
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,604
All right.

266
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:26,045
But doesn't this spinach smell kind of funny?

267
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,699
Mi Nam, how is it?

268
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,540
I'm fine. It's good.

269
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,762
Of course. Is there anything that you don't find yummy?

270
00:16:32,762 --> 00:16:34,663
You'll even eat rotten food.

271
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,708
Is this okay to eat?

272
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,910
Even the taste is kind of funky.

273
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,826
The food smells so good.

274
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,599
Enjoy.

275
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,272
I'm tired of eating a hotel lunch every day.

276
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,463
Do you want to switch?

277
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:57,235
Really? I would love to.

278
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:01,890
This looks fun.

279
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,586
You're good at this.

280
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:09,588
Of course I am.

281
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:16,726
The gimbap that I make is

282
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:19,338
so amazingly good.

283
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,592
The school lunch quality has really dropped, hasn't it?

284
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,654
Why did we even switch to this catering provider?

285
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:26,095
Isn't that right?

286
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,467
Isn't this a bit weird?

287
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:30,099
Even yesterday's events were a huge mistake by this provider,

288
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,261
yet we just let it slide.

289
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:35,064
They said that lots of cooks were fired while we were switching providers.

290
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:38,147
They're serving this because they're low on staff.

291
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,319
But still, this is too much.

292
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,942
I can't even look my students in the eye.

293
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:43,763
Yes, I can't either.

294
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,926
But we have to eat, right?

295
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:49,868
Ms. Maeng, Nurse, eat up.

296
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,289
Na Na Ri, it's the middle of class. Where do you think you're going?

297
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:00,791
Teacher, I need to go to the bathroom.

298
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,633
You should've gone during your break. Hold it in!

299
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,074
I can't!

300
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,256
Oh, Teacher, please.

301
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:07,887
- I think it's coming out.
- Wait.

302
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,510
- I'll get going now.
- Hey.

303
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,252
Rok Hui, you too?

304
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:15,545
Teacher Lee, I really need to go.

305
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,628
You little...

306
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:18,798
- Why you...
- Let's go.

307
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,231
Where do you think you're going?

308
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:22,463
Hey...

309
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:24,053
You little...

310
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,404
Hey!

311
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,406
- Stop!
- Please, Teacher Lee.

312
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,419
What do you think you guys are doing, fooling around as a group?

313
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:47,065
Hey!

314
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:59,068
My stomach...

315
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:04,693
Are you okay?

316
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:08,387
I think I'm going to die.

317
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:10,560
Why are you okay?

318
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,122
You ate mine as well.

319
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:20,920
- Are you okay?
- This was

320
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,623
the most dangerous moment of my life.

321
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:24,103
If I'd been just a second late...

322
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:26,625
Gosh, I almost reached the point of no return.

323
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,950
Teacher Lee looked like something was wrong with him as well.

324
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,553
Do you think Teacher Lee's going to be okay?

325
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:34,083
I think

326
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,557
the food was off.

327
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,518
What about the food?

328
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:41,651
I ate it too, and I'm totally fine...

329
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:48,197
You're a bit late.

330
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,930
Students,

331
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,054
this is Hanjong High's principal, Go Jin Sang.

332
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:56,956
Something suspicious is going on at school today.

333
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:59,709
A few students, claiming that they have a stomachache,

334
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:03,123
are overreacting as if it's the end of the world.

335
00:20:03,123 --> 00:20:07,857
But stomachaches are a condition that commonly happens.

336
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:11,651
If you don't wash your hands well or eat too much,

337
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:14,995
or even stay in front of the air conditioner too long, it happens.

338
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:19,950
In cases like this, it's best to keep your stomachs warm.

339
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,533
For your afternoon classes, let's all...

340
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,884
- Cut class short? 
- Really?

341
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:27,938
turn off the air conditioning.

342
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:29,028
- What?
- Gosh.

343
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,571
It's not even summer. You don't need an air conditioner.

344
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:33,182
You're saying that all of this is

345
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:36,066
- because of the air conditioning?
- I will be sure to check.

346
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:39,749
He only cares about the electric bill, and not the students' pain?

347
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:43,163
Our principal really is something else.

348
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:45,666
You win.

349
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,256
I'm hungry.

350
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:48,688
I pooped everything I ate.

351
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:52,321
Just wait it out. If you eat again, you're going to have to go again.

352
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,489
What's going on?

353
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,221
Did something go wrong?

354
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:02,852
- Gosh.
- This is a mess.

355
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:05,514
- My stomach...
- I'm in so much pain.

356
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:10,869
Quiet.

357
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:13,713
What's with the empty seats?

358
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:15,924
You little brats.

359
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,803
Student, how can I help you?

360
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,796
Just some flowers.

361
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:28,748
I see.

362
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:30,689
Pick whatever you like.

363
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,443
But,

364
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:36,636
by any chance,

365
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:40,159
have you been to the convenience store down the street?

366
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,571
I have. Why?

367
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:43,452
Doesn't the owner of the store look

368
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:45,365
a bit unkempt?

369
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:49,168
He doesn't look like he washes his hair, don't you think?

370
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,294
I don't know about that. I can't really tell.

371
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:58,758
But that's much better than a man who's a clean freak.

372
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:02,302
But don't you think that he looks old-fashioned

373
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:03,593
and ugly?

374
00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:06,515
No way. His smile makes him look kind.

375
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:09,028
He's kind of cute.

376
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,179
Cute?

377
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:17,386
You know, that man who owns the convenience store...

378
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:20,150
he is divorced, with two kids.

379
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,362
I'm a divorcee as well.

380
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:24,564
What's wrong with that?

381
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:29,738
Well, then...

382
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,614
That man tried a business and totally failed,

383
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,126
so he has no money.

384
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:38,779
Money is something that comes

385
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:41,701
and goes as well.

386
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:46,637
He works hard, so he's going to make a lot of money later on.

387
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:49,058
But why are you really here?

388
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:50,641
Ajumma!

389
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:53,412
Stop meeting with my dad.

390
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,606
You're so pretty.

391
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:57,626
You can meet a better guy, can't you?

392
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,419
- Your dad?
- My mom

393
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,764
is older than you, and she has a lot of wrinkles.

394
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:06,435
She's going through menopause, and she even has two daughters

395
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:09,700
and a younger sister who hasn't gotten married yet.

396
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,332
And I want to live with my dad too.

397
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:15,544
Oh my. Don't cry.

398
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:17,947
It's not like that.

399
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:19,588
Goodness.

400
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:22,051
Sa Na, what's going on? Why are you crying?

401
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:23,903
Did this woman say something mean to you?

402
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,866
It's not that. She just started talking

403
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:28,619
- and suddenly started crying—
- Be quiet.

404
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,121
She's probably crying because you said something to her.

405
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:33,473
Sa Na, what's wrong?

406
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:36,436
Mom, it's not like that.

407
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:38,126
Let's go.

408
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:50,140
Why were you crying over there?

409
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:55,044
Sa Na is quick to catch on to things.

410
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:56,416
What does that mean?

411
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
She's doing that because she's scared that her dad's meeting another woman.

412
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,211
What?

413
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:03,382
Were you really crying because of that?

414
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,705
That's what I'm saying.

415
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:08,097
You need to stop being vague and be clear with your feelings.

416
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:10,220
Either you like him, or you don't like him.

417
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,972
If you're jealous, then say it.

418
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:15,745
Jealous? What's wrong with you?

419
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,439
Or just be cool about it and let Hyeong Gang Dong go.

420
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:22,321
It's better for someone like him to make a new start.

421
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:26,004
I've already told him that I don't want to start things again.

422
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,849
You're saying that,

423
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,702
yet his socks are at our house?

424
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:33,633
You better shut that mouth of yours.

425
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:36,816
Sa Na, don't worry over silly things,

426
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:38,738
and go home.

427
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,379
Go on.

428
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:49,259
But at least Hyeong was

429
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,552
always honest with you.

430
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:55,434
Why don't you be honest with him?

431
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:59,188
If you like him, say you want to live with him. If not,

432
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:03,083
just say that you don't like him and cut ties with him.

433
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,944
Something like that.

434
00:25:04,944 --> 00:25:08,117
Hyeong isn't going to wait for you forever.

435
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:11,450
You don't truly know people.

436
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,664
Think about it, and don't regret your actions later.

437
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:16,576
I'm going to work.

438
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:22,752
Worry about your own love life.

439
00:25:24,073 --> 00:25:26,335
How dare you?

440
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:30,219
Oh my!

441
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:31,831
How dare you—

442
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,594
Did you just hit me? Who are you?

443
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:36,416
I'm her husband! Why?

444
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:40,249
Just wait. I'll fix it no matter what.

445
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:45,675
Wait.

446
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,379
-Oh my gosh.
- Oh no.

447
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:50,970
There.

448
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,412
Try turning on the light.

449
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,557
Great.

450
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:17,037
Notice of Hagok Elementary School's 32nd Reunion

451
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:18,738
A reunion?

452
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:23,103
I'm bored anyway. Should I go?

453
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,896
You still haven't seen Ji Na's phone?

454
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:27,386
I haven't.

455
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,219
I'll try to get it as soon as possible.

456
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,640
All right.

457
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,973
Come up with a good plan.

458
00:26:32,973 --> 00:26:34,984
Let's just get

459
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,517
Ji Na for good this time.

460
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:38,769
For sure.

461
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:42,591
We really are two peas in a pod.

462
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:47,437
Oh, my stomach...

463
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:49,629
Why does it suddenly hurt?

464
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,132
Me too.

465
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,403
Did I get food poisoning too?

466
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,581
Wait a minute.

467
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:02,152
Hey!

468
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:05,064
I really need to go!

469
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:08,037
I can't hold it in!

470
00:27:08,037 --> 00:27:10,661
Oh my. Sorry about that.

471
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:11,942
Hey!

472
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,723
Su Ji...

473
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:16,474
Don't you know how to treat your seniors?

474
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,695
Je Yi, when we go to the States,

475
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:28,178
I'll make you yummy food every day.

476
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:29,448
Okay.

477
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,172
But did Ro Bin go out somewhere?

478
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,174
I think he went on a date.

479
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:37,117
Ro Bin has a girlfriend now?

480
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:39,569
He didn't even tell me.

481
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:43,002
No wonder he's been so happy recently.

482
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:46,647
Yes, I think he's coming back to his old self.

483
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,839
But what about my oldest son?

484
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,291
You don't have a girl that you like?

485
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:57,197
- I don't.
- Why not?

486
00:27:57,197 --> 00:28:00,950
You're so handsome. You must be popular at school.

487
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:06,917
Do you remember the girl next door that you liked when you were younger?

488
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:09,550
Ro Bin liked her a lot too.

489
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,901
He did?

490
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:12,462
I don't remember.

491
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:16,105
You don't? I think it was when you were in first grade.

492
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:19,158
On her birthday, when he saw that you and that girl were

493
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:20,931
walking and holding hands,

494
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:25,294
he couldn't even give her the present and he just kept crying at home.

495
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:28,257
- Is that so?
- When we asked

496
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:32,552
why he didn't give her the present, you know what he said?

497
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:34,964
He said,

498
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:38,679
"Hyeong liked her first. So I'm letting him have her."

499
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,001
Isn't that funny?

500
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:44,032
It is. How funny.

501
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:52,212
Since I let him have her this time, I guess we're even.

502
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:57,696
You're getting prettier by the day.

503
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,849
They say you get prettier when you're in love.

504
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:03,452
No way. I was always pretty.

505
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,229
My stomach hurts.

506
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:11,961
It still hurts? Are you okay?

507
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:13,613
I thought I was better.

508
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:16,566
What's happening to me?

509
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:19,669
I'll go grab some medicine from the nurse's office.

510
00:29:23,102 --> 00:29:26,275
The principal at our school is totally messed up.

511
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:28,578
We need to report this to the right authorities,

512
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:30,931
but he told me not to.

513
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,482
He took away the investigation reports

514
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:35,906
and the surveys that the students wrote.

515
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:38,158
That's right. He's just covering for their mistakes.

516
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:40,951
Maybe he's got some ties with that catering provider.

517
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,131
Thank you.

518
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:51,461
Ji Na, my stomach is hurting more and more.

519
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,332
I'll be there soon.

520
00:29:58,468 --> 00:29:59,639
What's wrong with you?

521
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:01,240
Hey!

522
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:09,298
Hey, watch where you're going!

523
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:10,860
Gosh.

524
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:18,888
No way. Ji Na's cell phone?

525
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:25,013
I didn't even have to try to get this.

526
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:30,541
"Revenge Note"?

527
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,802
What's this?

528
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:33,342
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

529
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:36,575
Enter target's name

530
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:39,679
What's this?

531
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,601
Then Oh Ji Na wrote my name

532
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:45,644
and got revenge on me? Is that what happened?

533
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:48,779
No way.

534
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,320
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
