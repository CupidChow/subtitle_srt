00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:39,069
Please think about it and let me know.

6
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,840
I'll get you a good deal.

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,702
Thank you.

8
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:45,825
Have a good day.

00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:10,279
Are you still going to run the café after you get married?

11
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,871
Not too long ago, someone came

12
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,834
to inquire about your café and was very interested.

13
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,706
Gi Jun says that after we get married,

14
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:20,250
I should just go to the cultural center instead of working.

15
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,503
But I think I might get bored.

16
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:25,044
The café is not making much profit. Shouldn't you hand it over

17
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:28,047
when someone who's interested is looking at it?

18
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,800
He was a nice-looking young man.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,243
I think the ladies in the neighborhood would flock in if he took over.

20
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:39,969
Really? Should I sell it?

21
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:44,212
Welcome.

22
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:48,267
I'm calling you because I miss you.

23
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,731
Has my baby eaten lunch yet?

24
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:56,106
You don't need to be on a diet.

25
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,457
Excuse me.

26
00:01:57,457 --> 00:02:00,218
Please close the refrigerator door.

27
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:08,748
I'm going to give you a scolding if you don't eat your lunch, okay?

28
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:15,345
Excuse me. You need to pay for that before you drink it.

29
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,206
Excuse me.

30
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:19,690
I'll text you later.

31
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,091
Aigoo.

32
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:26,355
Are you afraid that I might take this without paying?

33
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,129
How much is it?

34
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:36,135
1,300 won (≈ $1.20).

35
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,068
Why is it so expensive?

36
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:41,872
Isn't this "buy one get one free"?

37
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:44,305
650 won (≈ 60¢) should be enough.

38
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:45,756
But I'll give you 700 won (≈ 60¢) for it.

39
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:50,169
Sir, you can't do that.

40
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:56,044
Then I'll have to pay with my card.

41
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,479
All right.

42
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:04,774
Here's your card.

43
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:15,014
Oh my. It's so pretty.

44
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,915
I know, right?

45
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:19,690
Of the three,

46
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,062
I think this place has the best food.

47
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,372
You think so?

48
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,445
Yes.

49
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:26,296
It's so nice to see the wedding hall

50
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:30,169
and to be able to have lunch together.

51
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,282
Wow.

52
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:52,382
Two, three, four. And one...

53
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:54,444
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

54
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:57,065
- Two, two, three, four.
- Two, two, three, four.

55
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,791
One, two, three, four...

56
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,732
- Five...
- Oh my!

57
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:07,608
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's...

58
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,478
- I was...
- Oh my goodness.

59
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,763
Is it all right for us to be doing this?

60
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:16,216
- Don't you think it's a bit too soon?
- What do you mean?

61
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:19,810
We need to make reservations early for famous wedding halls like this one.

62
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,471
So maybe we can set the date

63
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,435
about six months ahead of time.

64
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:28,839
Well, what if I suddenly change my mind

65
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,930
after setting a date?

66
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,443
Jeong Ah, please don't change your mind.

67
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,596
Ouch, that hurts.

68
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:36,797
Mr. Choi,

69
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:39,719
I'm already old to have a baby,

70
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:41,932
so let's hurry up and make reservations.

71
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,834
Yes, we need to do that.

72
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:46,255
- Let's go and make a reservation.
- Let's go.

73
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,100
- I think I'm blushing.
- Gosh.

74
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,452
- No way.
- Are we really getting married?

75
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:53,653
Is this real?

76
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:56,055
I think it's real.

77
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:58,758
Our P.E. teacher is dating our French teacher?

78
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:02,031
I don't think they're just dating. I think they're getting married.

79
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:05,084
They used to fight all the time.

80
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:08,347
Maybe they got attached to each other after fighting so much. My gosh.

81
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:22,832
You've improved so much in just one day.

82
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:25,626
I was so slow yesterday, wasn't I?

83
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,029
I'll do more today, so you can slow down.

84
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,289
Gosh.

85
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,392
You even pick up dishwashing fast because you're smart.

86
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:43,432
You want to wash my hands too?

87
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:45,565
I'm sorry. I thought it was a plate.

88
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:49,188
This is revenge for yesterday.

89
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:50,901
Hey, come on. No revenge, please.

90
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,862
Don't do it.

91
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:55,064
- Why not?
- Don't.

92
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:58,747
Hey, stop fooling around and hurry up.

93
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,138
Gi Jun,

94
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,331
I think the money will be ready by tomorrow.

95
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,233
Let me have your bank account number.

96
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,586
Money? What money?

97
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:19,468
You said you needed cash

98
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:21,440
for your investment in Paris.

99
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:26,374
I told you not to worry about it.

100
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,100
No.

101
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,272
I want to be there for you

102
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:35,846
when you're going through difficult times.

103
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:39,278
Since you need it quick, I applied for a loan

104
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:41,390
and I'm going to sell the café as well.

105
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,935
I will also have the deposit money from my sister, so it'll be all right.

106
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:47,517
I'm not

107
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:50,048
a poor woman, you know?

108
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:54,073
This is so frustrating.

109
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:56,025
Gi Jun.

110
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:58,408
Don't think of it as money.

111
00:06:58,408 --> 00:07:01,622
Think of it as me giving you my heart.

112
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,733
It's my heart of love for you, Gi Jun.

113
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:14,484
Thank you.

114
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:28,327
Hey baby, will you close your eyes for just three seconds?

115
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:29,520
Here?

116
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,021
Come on.

117
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,472
Hey, baby.

118
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,308
You are a woman

119
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:53,061
that makes me want to be a better man.

120
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:56,896
Would you marry me?

121
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:07,697
This is a ring

122
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:10,410
that my mom has treasured for years

123
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,282
to give to her daughter-in-law.

124
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:17,226
You're the first woman that I've wanted

125
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,939
to give this ring.

126
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,514
Gi Jun...

127
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:30,869
That makes me so happy.

128
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:39,679
Oppa, where are you? I miss you.

129
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,901
Oh no, what shall I do?

130
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:45,103
I have an urgent business situation to attend to.

131
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:49,139
Gi Jun, it's all right.

132
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:50,390
I'm mature enough

133
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,583
to understand the importance of business.

134
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:58,838
Banquet Hall, 10th Floor

135
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,701
Break time is already over.

136
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:04,513
It's time to go back to work.

137
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,502
Oppa, are we really getting married?

138
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:15,284
I can't believe this is happening.

139
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,007
Are you my aunt's boyfriend?

140
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:21,270
Yes, I am. You can call me Uncle.

141
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,425
It's like a dream to me too.

142
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,616
My baby, you must be tired.

143
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,077
Maybe a little.

144
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,531
It's all right. We're going to get a massage.

145
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:33,191
Of course. Let's go.

146
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:45,245
What's wrong? Do you know them?

147
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:50,801
He looked like my aunt's boyfriend.

148
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:52,542
He was linking arms with another woman.

149
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,414
No way.

150
00:09:54,414 --> 00:09:56,265
Maybe you're mistaken.

151
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,658
I'm sure of what I saw.

152
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,761
It's a twin.

153
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:04,524
My girl.

154
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:07,886
- I'm so tired. Move over.
- Why you little...

155
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:10,930
It's so heavy!

156
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,662
Oh, my shoulders.

157
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:15,064
What is this? A diamond?

158
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,608
A diamond?

159
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:19,830
Did he propose to you?

160
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,613
Haven't you seen a diamond before? You're such a country girl.

161
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:25,505
Of course I haven't! Let me see.

162
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,427
How much is this?

163
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,641
Price of an apartment building.

164
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:34,704
This is a very special ring. There's nothing like it anywhere.

165
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:36,586
Gi Jun's late mother left it

166
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:39,238
for her future daughter-in-law.

167
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,232
Of all the women he met,

168
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:45,235
he said I was the only one he wanted to give this to.

169
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:47,316
I'm so happy!

170
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,990
Your boyfriend must have watched way too many dramas.

171
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,992
I'm getting goosebumps.

172
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:53,953
Are you sure this isn't fake?

173
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,815
The diamond seems a little too big.

174
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:58,708
How would you know? You've never seen a real one before.

175
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,621
Can I try it on just once?

176
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:03,123
Are we really getting married?

177
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:05,105
It's like a dream to me too.

178
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:09,719
Aunt Seon Hui, can you show me a picture of your boyfriend?

179
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,070
Yes, show us.

180
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,084
Here, you can take a look at my Gi Jun.

181
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:27,878
There isn't one clear picture of him.

182
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:29,969
It's because Gi Jun

183
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,582
always wants to kiss me.

184
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,999
I feel like I've seen him somewhere.

185
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,261
Here, this is his new name card.

186
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,546
CEO Sa Gi Jun

187
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:47,116
He's a CEO.

188
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:50,268
Oh my. He's really something.

189
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,343
I need to go for skin care now.

190
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:55,875
Give it back to her.

191
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,836
Let me have it.

192
00:11:57,836 --> 00:11:59,038
My goodness.

193
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:04,002
I'm going to look at more dress designs.

194
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:10,571
Mom, I saw something at the wedding hall where I'm working.

195
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:13,193
I saw a man that looks just like Aunt Seon Hui's boyfriend.

196
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:15,976
He was arm-in-arm with another woman.

197
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:19,408
I just saw him for a moment, but he really looked just like him.

198
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,621
Goodness, don't be ridiculous!

199
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:24,153
It must be someone that looks like him.

200
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:25,665
Wait a minute.

201
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:28,267
When did you go out and get a part-time job?

202
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,299
You barely went up five places on your final exam.

203
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:31,671
Now you think you're a top student?

204
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:33,213
You should study harder, not work!

205
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:35,515
I shouldn't have told you.

206
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,171
Don't you think we should get a bigger TV?

207
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:43,963
I don't watch TV.

208
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,505
Why?

209
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,187
I'm only going to watch you.

210
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:52,321
Gosh! You're just too sweet!

211
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,434
You love me so much.

212
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,808
We should get a king-sized bed, right?

213
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:01,249
What kind of bedding do you prefer?

214
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:07,356
As long as we're here, we should just get everything we need.

215
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:09,268
Our new apartment is empty anyway,

216
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,260
we could just have it delivered in advance.

217
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,112
No.

218
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:16,325
I'll take care of all of our furniture and electronics.

219
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,928
You trusted me enough to invest in me.

220
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:21,261
I really want to do everything for you.

221
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:24,353
All you need to do is just move in.

222
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:27,736
Really? I'm so touched.

223
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:34,373
Excuse me for a minute.

224
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:39,247
He's so handsome.

225
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:02,082
Excuse me.

226
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,304
Excuse me?

227
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,557
Gi Jun!

228
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:08,447
I'm here.

229
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:16,467
I thought that an angel had come down from heaven!

230
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,737
My goodness.

231
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,619
You're so silly.

232
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:21,661
You're so silly!

233
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,342
Hold on.

234
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:27,608
- Come on, no hitting. 
- They're really something else.

235
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:29,109
You're so silly.

236
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:31,962
Wait, I think that man has been here before.

237
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:34,133
Come on!

238
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,412
Hello.

239
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:44,124
Who are you?

240
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:46,977
I work part-time here.

241
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,437
So?

242
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:51,020
This is really important to me...

243
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,653
I mean, this is important to my aunt.

244
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:55,004
May I check

245
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:59,469
if my aunt's boyfriend is on the reservation list?

246
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:02,952
Ask your aunt's boyfriend yourself.

247
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,003
Please leave. I'm busy.

248
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:15,275
Did it work out?

249
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,216
She won't show it to me.

250
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,169
I think I'll have to tell my aunt honestly.

251
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:28,708
- You're here.
- Yes.

252
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,350
Your aunt asked me to fill in for the day.

253
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,082
Ji Na!

254
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,583
Hi.

255
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:39,859
- Hello.
- So you're Ji Na.

256
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:43,692
We'll live close by after we get married. Come visit us often, okay?

257
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:47,747
Are we really getting married?

258
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,268
It's him.

259
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:52,321
I'm positive now that I'm seeing him again.

260
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:57,047
Here, this is my first allowance to you as your uncle.

261
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:00,200
Gosh. You're not her uncle yet.

262
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,711
Take it, Ji Na.

263
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,044
It's all right.

264
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:07,307
What's wrong? Take it, Ji Na.

265
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:10,289
I think Ji Na is sad that her aunt is getting married.

266
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,721
She must be jealous of Gi Jun.

267
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:17,087
- It's all right. Take it.
- Aunt, I'm leaving now.

268
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,737
Hey.

269
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:27,767
Are you done?

270
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:31,290
Yes, I was just wrapping up.

271
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,583
Thanks for always helping out my aunt.

272
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:35,765
Can I ask

273
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:39,057
why you don't like your aunt's boyfriend?

274
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:43,783
Well, to be honest,

275
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:47,206
I saw something strange while I was working at the wedding hall.

276
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,849
I saw him talking

277
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:51,780
to another woman about getting married.

278
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:55,626
I really hope I'm mistaken.

279
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:57,837
I think the person you saw was

280
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,369
your aunt's boyfriend.

281
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:05,906
I saw him at a club once.

282
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,988
No way.

283
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:10,149
I was really hoping that it wasn't him.

284
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:24,554
Reservations

285
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,679
Let me try it this time.

286
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:31,640
You can do it!

287
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:44,874
Hello.

288
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:47,888
How can I help you?

289
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:50,079
This is for you. It's for a bargain.

290
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,531
A bargain?

291
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:57,037
My uncle is trying to get married without the family's consent.

292
00:17:57,037 --> 00:17:59,389
I only know the place and nothing else.

293
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:02,462
If I could know the exact time, I could bring my father to the wedding.

294
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:03,863
I see.

295
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,597
Oh, my gosh.

296
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:10,930
How come she's so nice to Je Yi?

297
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,043
I normally can't do this. But seeing that you have such a kind heart,

298
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:17,066
I'll do it for you just this once.

299
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,357
What is your uncle's name?

300
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:20,120
It's Sa Gi Jun.

301
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:25,154
What did she say? Did she tell you?

302
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,568
You were right. Sa Gi Jun.

303
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:29,869
The wedding is this Saturday at 3 p.m.

304
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:33,672
The bride's name is Seo Geun Ae.

305
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:36,577
What a player!

306
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:38,678
He's seeing them both?

307
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,532
My aunt likes him so much.

308
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,454
What's going to happen to her?

309
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:48,427
That's right.

310
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,701
My aunt said she was getting a loan today.

311
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,462
A loan?

312
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,794
Then it must not be cheating, but a scam.

313
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:01,911
Please pick up.

314
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,254
Hello?

315
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:06,696
- Aunt Seon Hui, where are you?
- I'm at the bank.

316
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:08,237
Hang up. I'm getting a loan now.

317
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:09,959
No, wait! Aunt Seon Hui!

318
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:14,214
She hung up. What do I do now?

319
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,955
Let's run.

320
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:25,335
Aunt Seon Hui,

321
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:27,916
please don't send the money!

322
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,181
Thank you. Have a good day.

323
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,002
Thank you.

324
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,777
Ji Na

325
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:53,533
Why isn't she picking up?

326
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,975
She's not picking up?

327
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,910
The loan has been approved.

328
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,772
Then will you transfer

329
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:05,265
the 200 million won (≈ $180,000) to this account?

330
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:08,508
Have you received any voice phishing phone calls asking for

331
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,521
personal information in the name of a prosecutor or financial official?

332
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:12,722
Gosh.

333
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:15,175
I'm not foolish enough to fall for such a thing.

334
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:18,277
I'm sending the money to my husband.

335
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:19,750
All right, then.

336
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,351
I had to ask you as a part of the process.

337
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:31,301
Here you go.

338
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:43,524
Aunt Seon Hui!

339
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:47,207
Stop! Don't send the money.

340
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,108
It's a scam!

341
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,101
What?

342
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:56,545
I told you. That's why I was making sure.

343
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:16,175
Oh my.

344
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,668
This is amazing.

345
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:20,269
Goodness.

346
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,023
Isn't it?

347
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:27,627
What's the estimated value?

348
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:29,919
Maybe about...

349
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:36,365
About... 8,000 won (≈ $7.00)?

350
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:39,429
I'm sorry?

351
00:21:47,187 --> 00:21:49,068
Aunt Seon Hui!

352
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:50,890
Are you all right?

353
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:56,026
How could this be so well-made with just plastic?

354
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:58,077
It's really amazing.

355
00:21:58,077 --> 00:21:59,790
Gosh.

356
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,551
Goodness.

357
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:05,775
Forget him.

358
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:08,288
Don't waste your tears on that idiot.

359
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:12,842
Just think that you stepped on a big turd.

360
00:22:12,842 --> 00:22:14,443
You know...

361
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:18,277
I still can't believe it's true.

362
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,751
Maybe the wedding hall was reserved

363
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:25,155
by a man with the same name.

364
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:28,427
And the ring...

365
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:32,010
Maybe he has his own circumstances.

366
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:38,247
He said that the ring was passed down by his mom.

367
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:43,283
He might have never known that it was fake.

368
00:22:43,283 --> 00:22:46,637
Get a hold of yourself!

369
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:49,590
No, it can't be.

370
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,431
Just for me,

371
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:56,886
Gi Jun contracted to buy an expensive house.

372
00:22:56,886 --> 00:23:00,690
I shouldn't doubt him.

373
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,663
A house?

374
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:05,015
Hey. What is the address?

375
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:07,195
What if that's a scam too?

376
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:10,879
No way.

377
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:14,354
Property Purchase Contract

378
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:16,677
So the contract hasn't been signed yet?

379
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:18,697
All right. Thank you.

380
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,723
It's a scam.

381
00:23:22,723 --> 00:23:25,514
There hasn't been a deal yet because the house is so pricey.

382
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:29,718
He made a fake contract as well.

383
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:35,223
No. This can't be true.

384
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:39,429
Gi Jun.

385
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:44,234
You can explain everything, right?

386
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:47,236
Gi Jun!

387
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:49,168
Please talk to me!

388
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:52,262
- That punk! Stop looking at his picture!
- Gi Jun...

389
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,394
Oh my gosh.

390
00:23:58,948 --> 00:24:00,589
I know him!

391
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:02,702
It's him! This punk!

392
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,604
He came to the real estate office before

393
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:07,618
and asked me whether your café was on a monthly rent.

394
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:10,790
He also asked about the monthly profit. It's the same guy.

395
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,792
It really is him!

396
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:15,666
He approached you knowing that you had money.

397
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,596
He's a con artist!

398
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:30,869
Calm down.

399
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:35,856
Sa Gi Jun...

400
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:40,139
I'm going to ruin you.

401
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:54,414
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Enter target's name

402
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:58,087
I know the returns will be tenfold if I invest that sum.

403
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:00,781
You're the first woman I've wanted

404
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:01,882
to give this ring to.

405
00:25:01,882 --> 00:25:03,634
Are we really getting married?

406
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:05,244
It's like a dream to me too.

407
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:08,307
Sa Gi Jun

408
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,509
I want to be there for you

409
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,171
when you're going through difficult times.

410
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:16,446
Gi Jun...

411
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:21,591
You can explain everything, right?

412
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:27,376
Revenge Note,

413
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:30,940
please get revenge

414
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,252
for my aunt.

415
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,876
We will proceed with the revenge.

416
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:41,502
My babies...

417
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:44,154
Come on out. I'm calling you.

418
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:47,096
Come on out.

419
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,913
My goodness.

420
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:58,669
Gosh.

421
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,922
What is this?

422
00:26:01,922 --> 00:26:03,323
Gosh.

423
00:26:07,738 --> 00:26:09,909
You have been selected as a revenge target.

424
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:12,251
Revenge?

425
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:14,785
Who's getting revenge?

426
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:18,827
I've cheated so many people. I can't remember who's who anymore.

427
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,113
Baby Kim said she would send 200 million won. I wonder why she hasn't yet.

428
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:25,424
After I get this one,

429
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:28,286
I should lay low for a while.

430
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:39,369
What's wrong with this?

431
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,302
I've tried on this tuxedo more than ten times.

432
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,925
This has never happened before.

433
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:54,784
My goodness!

434
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,998
Oh my gosh!

435
00:26:59,499 --> 00:27:02,672
Excuse me. I'm so sorry,

436
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:05,195
but would you unzip this for me?

437
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:08,659
It won't open. I think it's broken.

438
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:11,040
Goodness me.

439
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,493
You're crazy.

440
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:14,533
I'm serious.

441
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,797
It's really broken.

442
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:20,049
Hey, I could just...

443
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:42,292
What is this? This is so irritating.

444
00:27:48,338 --> 00:27:49,509
Hi baby.

445
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:51,581
What are you doing, darling?

446
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:54,563
I'm doing business of course.

447
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,024
I can explain everything.

448
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:07,427
Did you call me?

449
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:09,069
Baby!

450
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,800
Me?

451
00:28:12,903 --> 00:28:14,364
Baby!

452
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:17,217
Me?

453
00:28:18,748 --> 00:28:20,649
Baby?

454
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,296
- Hey.
- You bastard!

455
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:28,868
Hey, Sa Gi Jun!

456
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:32,522
Baby, baby, baby. How many babies do you have?

457
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:34,424
Are you a ten-armed squid?

458
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:37,006
How dare you cheat on me?

459
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,389
You deserve a beating!

460
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:41,029
Asshole!

461
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:46,906
Wait!

462
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:51,040
Baby!

463
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,493
I'm going to hit his face.

464
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:04,933
Did he wet his pants?

465
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:08,959
It stinks. Gosh.

466
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,551
You really are something else.

467
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:15,986
How could you do this to me?

468
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:18,817
Did I look that easy to you?

469
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,893
Hey. Give me back my money.

470
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:25,815
I worked hard for that money. Give it back, you slimeball!

471
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,978
You will pay for this today!

472
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:30,830
I'm going to kill you!

473
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:34,203
Wait!

474
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:38,538
Look over there!

475
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,241
- Get him!
- Hey!

476
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:43,303
- Hey!
- Get back here!

477
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:45,374
- Get him!
- How dare you?

478
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:47,797
- Hey!
- Oh my!

479
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:54,594
You scumbag!

480
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,466
I knew what kind of vermin you were

481
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,347
since you caused trouble at my store.

482
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:00,289
How dare you mess with my sister-in-law?

483
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:03,713
You're going to pay for it today! You little—

484
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:06,286
Ouch.

485
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,301
- Gang Dong.
- Seon Hui.

486
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:14,413
Thank you.

487
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:16,677
Here! Over here!

488
00:30:16,677 --> 00:30:19,568
It's him. Come over here, please!

489
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:22,271
Get up.

490
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:24,153
You low-life bastard!

491
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:27,958
Hey.

492
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:31,111
You just got out of jail and you're already pulling this?

493
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:33,132
Jail?

494
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,424
That rascal has committed fraud 13 times already.

495
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:37,386
What? Did you just say "13 times"?

496
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:39,298
Thank you for reporting him.

497
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:40,451
What?

498
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:43,753
So you've been in jail, not Paris?

499
00:30:44,805 --> 00:30:47,006
- Let's go.
- Wait!

500
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:50,550
Baby...

501
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,391
Get moving.

502
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:55,894
Don't cry.

503
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:12,352
Ji Na,

504
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:14,864
let's just have a quiet meal today.

505
00:31:14,864 --> 00:31:17,026
We'll put off the birthday party for now.

506
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:19,679
That's fine with me. I'm just worried about Aunt.

507
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,642
She acts so smart all the time,

508
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:24,665
but she fell for that scam.

509
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,947
He's the bad guy.

510
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:29,649
He messed with her heart to get her money.

511
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:35,926
Ji Na, happy birthday!

512
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:38,268
Can you come up to the roof for a minute?

513
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,310
How did you know?

514
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,112
Thanks. I'll come up after I eat.

515
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:54,875
Your revenge is complete.

516
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:58,758
Thank you, Revenge Note.

517
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:03,322
No matter who the Master might be, I can't live without you anymore.

518
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,664
Please don't suddenly disappear on me.

Happy birthday.

525
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:35,544
Sit down.

526
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,070
And...

527
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:43,423
this is for you.

528
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:45,354
You got me a gift?

529
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:55,686
Wow, it's so pretty!

530
00:32:55,686 --> 00:32:57,737
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

531
00:32:57,737 --> 00:32:59,529
It looks expensive.

532
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:01,612
Did you use all the money you made from the part-time job to get this?

533
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,394
It's not that expensive. Don't worry.

534
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:06,906
Thank you.

535
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:09,950
The bracelet is so pretty

536
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,382
and the cake looks delicious too. Thank you.

537
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,198
She's on the roof.

538
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:39,479
Take a look, Ji Na

539
00:33:42,903 --> 00:33:44,444
Watch it.

540
00:33:48,739 --> 00:33:51,201
To Ji Na.mp4

541
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,681
I like you a lot!

542
00:34:13,103 --> 00:34:14,895
I like you a lot!

543
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:26,185
I like you a lot.

544
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,991
Was that you, Ji Na?

545
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,462
I like Seo Je Yi

546
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:57,697
Epilogue
I found it!

547
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:00,440
I'll take this one.

548
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,202
This must be for your girlfriend.
