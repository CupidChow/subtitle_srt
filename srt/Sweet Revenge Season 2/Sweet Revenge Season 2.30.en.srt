00:00:02,512 --> 00:00:04,093
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:39,719
- What the heck?
- Hey!

5
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:48,518
Hey, watch where you're going!

6
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:57,315
Wow! Oh Ji Na's cell phone?

7
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,633
I didn't even have to try to get this.

8
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:09,118
"Revenge Note"?

9
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:10,500
What's this?

10
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,733
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

11
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,134
Enter target's name?

12
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,268
What's this?

13
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:20,140
Then, Oh Ji Na wrote my name

14
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,932
and got revenge on me? Is that what happened?

15
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:27,226
No way.

16
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:33,321
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Oh Ji Na

17
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:36,225
Error. Target does not meet the conditions

18
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,831
What is this?

19
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:44,053
Why isn't it working?

20
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:45,484
Gosh.

21
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,237
Ho Gu Jun.

22
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:59,098
It's been a while.

23
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:00,599
What brings you to school?

24
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,933
I just came to help out at the nurse's office.

25
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:07,225
It's so weird seeing you back at school.

26
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:11,260
How are you doing, Seonbae Sa Rang?

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,533
I'm doing well.

28
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,126
Isn't it rough working at the hospital?

29
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:19,197
It's a bit rough, but it's bearable.

30
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,354
Should we go to that place for the first time in a while?

31
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,556
Sure. I was headed there anyway.

32
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,321
So what have you been up to?

33
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,063
I've just been working

34
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,045
mostly at the hospital.

35

37
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:27,056
The club room is still here.

38
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,222
Everything's coming back to me.

39
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,417
So much time has passed.

00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:04,634
What are you working so hard on?

43
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,860
Something that can help out people like me.

44
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,471
I'm developing the algorithm.

45
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,366
It's still a secret.

46
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,829
I'll tell you about it when it's finished.

47
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:49,690
Sa Rang.

48
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,399
What happened?

49
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,538
Shim Myeong...

50
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:01,140
The thing you wanted to do...

51
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,362
I'll do it for you.

52
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:05,664
So rest in peace.

53
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:13,714
After that incident,

54
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,185
I thought that you would go to the States.

55
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,339
Don't you regret staying in Korea?

56
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,930
No.

57
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,894
I had my own reasons.

58
00:05:23,894 --> 00:05:25,414
That's true.

59
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:27,127
You were able to finish

60
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,449
the things that he couldn't do.

61
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,091
If it weren't for you and Eun Wu it wouldn't have been done.

62
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:35,154
I'm glad to have helped.

63
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:37,546
I asked someone else to come.

64
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,718
Who?

65
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:40,560
It's someone you know.

66
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,604
He's a very smart, handsome,

67
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:46,666
and mysterious boy.

68
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,302
Come in.

69
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:05,393
Come on in.

70
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:11,342
Notice: The cafeteria will be undergoing construction work

71
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:13,513
I've never had jjajangmyeon* in school before.  (*black bean noodles)

72
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:16,926
I know, right? It's not a lot but I'm so excited for it.

73
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:20,601
Wait!

74
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:23,312
You can't eat it just yet.

75
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:29,659
You need to do this to mix it well.

76
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:35,095
My dad taught me this trick.

77
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,467
If you mix it faster than everyone,

78
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,758
you can get to one more sweet and sour pork.

79
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,405
Wait!

80
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,417
What now?

81
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:48,879
You're a bunch of amateurs.

82
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,469
Watch closely.

83
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,092
How is this? Isn't it cool?

84
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:04,334
- That's kind of cool.
- Not bad.

85
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:07,047
If you're eating this at school, this is a must-have.

86
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:08,929
It's hard to wash the sauce off of your uniform.

87
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,802
Of course. You're only smart when it comes to eating.

88
00:07:11,802 --> 00:07:13,943
You should use some of that smartness when you study.

89
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:15,705
You little...

90
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,850
Cut here?

91
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,751
- Over here.
- Is this right?

92
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:36,026
But why didn't Ro Bin come out with you guys?

93
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,517
He said he was lazy, so he's sleeping.

94
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:40,489
How could you be too lazy to eat?

95
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:45,355
But after all of this, now, the cafeteria is under construction.

96
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:47,237
This is too much. Seriously.

97
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:49,569
Maybe because of the food poisoning,

98
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,042
they're doing some inspections.

99
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,985
At least we get to eat jjajangmyeon because of this. Isn't it great?

100
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:59,238
I know, right? It tastes even better since we're eating it at school.

101
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:01,690
I definitely need to take a snap of this.

102
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:08,016
One, two, three.

103
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,862
Let's dig in.

104
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,007
Isn't this a picture of our cafeteria?

105
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,319
It is.

106
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,573
Someone took this photo and everyone's re-gramming it.

107
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:24,994
It's a total hot issue on social media.

108
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:27,817
Are you kidding me? Shouldn't this be reported?

109
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,329
That principal is crazy.

110
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:31,462
There isn't even any crab meat for the *gimbap.
[*Korean sushi roll]

111
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,713
I feel bad for the kids who have to eat this.

112
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,865
There's totally some corrupt stuff going on in the cafeteria.

113
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,758
Did they even donate like they said?

114
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:40,299
That's true. After I told my dad about it, he went nuts,

115
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,262
saying he was going to come to school.

116
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:44,804
- So he's coming?
- I had to stop him.

117
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:46,376
If he came, he'd just...

118
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,727
My gosh. So embarrassing.

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,073
But then again, them letting the school-wide food poisoning go

120
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,894
was kind of weird.

121
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,423
You guys keep eating. I need to go find something.

122
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,639
- Come back quickly.
- Okay.

123
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,500
What should I do?

124
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,542
Maybe I dropped it somewhere.

125
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,584
Are you looking for this?

126
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:19,820
What's wrong with you? Why do you have my cell phone?

127
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,032
You dropped it earlier, so I picked it up for you.

128
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:25,664
Give it back.

129
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,932
Oh, my. My mistake.

130
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:33,533
Sorry.

131
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:39,839
Have you lost your mind? What do you think you're doing?

132
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,352
I'm so scared. You look like you're going to hit me.

133
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,284
That crap phone doesn't even look expensive.

134
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,216
I'll buy you a new one.

135
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:48,828
What do I do?

136
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,121
I guess that phone is really important to you.

137
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:54,503
Do you have any secrets in there?

138
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,626
Anyway, sorry.

139
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:08,527
Did something happen?

140
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,572
My phone is broken.

141
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:16,826
What happened? It's all cracked.

142
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:21,570
But won't I be able to fix this if I get it repaired?

143
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:26,556
I'm not sure.

144
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,997
It won't be easy.

145
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:37,627
I'll try fixing it.

146
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,961
Really? Can you do that?

147
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,714
It won't be easy, but I'll try.

148
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:47,807
Please fix it. I need to fix it.

149
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:49,659
The stuff in this phone...

150
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,833
The chip could probably be saved.

151
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,965
I'll try it out.

152
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:06,507
Principal Go Jin Sang

153
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,950
Hello? This is Hanjong High School's Principal's Office.

154
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,283
Is this Principal Go Jin Sang? I'm a reporter from Mansae Daily.

155
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,500
I'd like to interview you

156
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,600
about the food poisoning incident that happened at Hanjong High.

157
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
What are you talking about?

158
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,473
This is the first time I'm hearing about this.

159
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,604
We heard that a lot of students got food poisoning

160
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:25,726
after eating at the school cafeteria.

161
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,328
There's no way that happened here!

162
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,647
Hello?

163
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,959
Hello? This is Korea Daily.

164
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,862
We would like to request an interview regarding the food poisoning incident.

165
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:46,915
Sorry, but you've called the wrong number.

166
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,663
These trash reporters. Gosh.

167
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:55,806
What are they even talking about?

168
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,687
Seoul Hagok-Dong High School suspected

169
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:09,649
of trying to cover a school-wide food poisoning incident

170
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,301
Hello? Is this Su Ji's mother?

171
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:24,273
Principal, you saw the article, right?

172
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:26,446
How could this get into the news?

173
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,808
Are you sure someone from the school didn't leak it?

174
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,491
No way.

175
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,143
I hid all evidence of the incident.

176
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:36,956
If the catering provider acts up like this,

177
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,729
what are we supposed to do?

178
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,191
How could you say that?

179
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:44,824
You're the one who pocketed a generous sum from this.

180
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:47,526
How could you say it like that?!

181
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,985
Anyway, this is not the time for us to be yelling like this on the phone.

182
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:57,727
I have a plan,

183
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,859
so I'll deal with this.

184
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:02,722
Yes. Goodbye.

185
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,648
She's got such a hot temper.

186
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,519
Seoul Hagok-Dong High School suspected of trying to cover a school-wide food poisoning incident

187
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,774
What have the teachers been doing for this kind of article to come up?

188
00:13:19,774 --> 00:13:21,406
A few students got a measly stomachache.

189
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:24,659
Why would they upload that crap on social media?

190
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:27,412
You all have done absolutely nothing

191
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:29,884
to prevent stuff like this from happening.

192
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:32,377
Yet you still have no problem taking your monthly pay!

193
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:35,030
If there's a problem, say something!

194
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:42,396
Anyway, let's brainstorm.

195
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,049
Ms. Jeong.

196
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:46,491
Yes?

197
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:53,147
Why don't we just investigate thoroughly

198
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,919
and clearly prove to the media

199
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,552
that it wasn't the school's fault.

200
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:00,194
There's so much fake news these days.

201
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:03,097
What's the point of making this into an even bigger commotion?

202
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:04,209
Right.

203
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,881
Try using your brain for once!

204
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:11,866
The fines aren't even that much, are they?

205
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:14,258
Should I tell my dad?

206
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:25,189
The phones are off the hook because of the students' parents.

207
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:28,553
But the way I look at it,

208
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:32,256
someone's going to have to take responsibility for this.

209
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,583
Who was in charge

210
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,315
of the lunch ingredients?

211
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:46,002
It was me.

212
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,743
Well then,

213
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:53,307
who was the one who managed the cafeteria meals?

214
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:55,119
I also d-did that.

215
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,651
How are you managing things

216
00:14:56,651 --> 00:15:01,215
for something like this to happen the moment you take charge, Ms. Maeng?

217
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:03,227
That's not—

218
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:05,671
I guess we have no choice.

219
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,132
As for this incident, Ms. Maeng,

220
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:12,236
you will have to take responsibility.

221
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:15,890
What? Me?

222
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,503
Mr. Principal, that isn't right.

223
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:19,665
That's right.

224
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,638
There's no evidence that Ms. Maeng made a mistake here.

225
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,799
Then,

226
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,741
will you take responsibility, Ms. Jeong?

227
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:28,363
Excuse me?

228
00:15:28,363 --> 00:15:30,154
It's not that...

229
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:31,947
The moment Ms. Maeng took charge,

230
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:34,450
this horrific incident happened.

231
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,202
It's only natural that we investigate it with the police.

232
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,849
I'm going to put you on standby to be transferred.

233
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:46,381
So,

234
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:48,552
don't go to class today.

235
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,866
Class?

236
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,518
But that class...

237
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:56,451
Stop complaining and just do as you're told.

238
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,279
That's not right.

239
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,492
What kind of mess is this?

240
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:09,384
He's gone too far!

241
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:10,635
He's going to put you on standby

242
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:14,440
and blame us if something goes wrong.

243
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,472
Ms. Maeng, what do we do?

244
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,238
Did you hear? Ms. Maeng got fired.

245
00:16:23,238 --> 00:16:26,491
No way. Ms. Maeng didn't even do anything wrong.

246
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:29,424
They must've blamed her because she was in charge of lunch.

247
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:31,295
Our poor teacher, what do we do?

248
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:33,597
- Teacher Maeng.
- Teacher Maeng.

249
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,722
Teacher, you can't just go like this.

250
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:40,565
Girls, don't worry.

251
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:41,897
It will get resolved soon.

252
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:43,838
This isn't fair.

253
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:46,151
Ms. Maeng, don't leave.

254
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:49,754
Ms. Maeng, please don't leave.

255
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,697
I'll be back soon.

256
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:56,370
Study hard while I'm gone. Okay?

257
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,304
Why is the food poisoning Teacher Maeng's fault?

258
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,015
How does that make sense?

259
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:23,107
Isn't there anything that we can do about this?

260
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:32,896
I heard something when I stopped by the nurse's office.

261
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:38,413
I went to the nurse's office to grab some medicine.

262
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:42,066
The principal at our school is totally messed up.

263
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,619
We need to report this to the right authorities,

264
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:47,333
but he told me not to.

265
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,004
He took away the investigation reports

266
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:52,107
and the surveys that the students wrote.

267
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:56,051
That's totally fishy.

268
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:58,473
What do we do?

269
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,825
We can't let Teacher Maeng get unfairly blamed

270
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:03,338
and fired like this.

271
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:06,380
Can't we just find the evidence ourselves?

272
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:10,316
I'm thinking the same thing.

273
00:18:10,316 --> 00:18:12,987
How would we find that?

274
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,950
If we want to catch the tiger, we need to go into its cave.

275
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,201
Of course, it's not a real tiger.

276
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,685
Maybe not a tiger, more like a raccoon dog.

277
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:21,295
A raccoon dog?

278
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:25,820
Let's break into the principal's office later tonight.

279
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,083
There's got to be evidence there.

280
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:31,837
Je Yi, could I have a moment?

281
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:41,387
Were you able to fix my phone?

282
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,358
Do you think you can fix it?

283
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,143
I think it might take a bit of time.

284
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,951
Have you eaten?

285
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:18,803
Never mind.

286
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,769
For that day,

287
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:27,182
how should I do my hair?

288
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:29,234
Should I part it?

289
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:31,736
Let's see.

290
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:33,237
No, let's do it this way.

291
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,646
I look too old.

292
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,872
I look stupid.

293
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:48,252
This is it.

294
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:50,305
I look best with a natural style.

295
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,127
What was I thinking?

296
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:55,809
Hagok-dong's Jang Dong Geon*, you still got it.
(*famous actor, he appeared on "Gentleman's Dignity")

297
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:00,315
Welcome.

298
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,372
Hello?

299
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,453
Yes, Song Hwa?

300
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:10,064
Song Hwa?

301
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:12,898
Is that Chae Song Hwa from the flower shop?

302
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,801
The preparation is going well.

303
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:18,783
But do you think I'll be able to pull it off?

304
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:21,196
I'm so nervous that I can't sleep.

305
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:23,577
It's driving me nuts.

306
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,323
What could he be nervous about that he can't sleep?

307
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:30,165
Then see you at seven o'clock.

308
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,626
Let's meet at the restaurant at the Hagok intersection.

309
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,501
I'll look my best.

310
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,131
Yes, all right.

311
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,983
Why did she just walk in and leave?

312
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,977
That jerk.

313
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:55,671
He's so nervous that he can't sleep?

314
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,093
I can't believe him.

315
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:01,015
He's already in that deep with that woman?

316
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:04,108
My goodness.

317
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:10,935
You stupid jerk!

318
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:14,379
I'm nervous.

319
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,862
My heart is racing right now.

320
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:20,635
It'll be dangerous, so only Ro Bin and I will go in the principal's office.

321
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:22,217
Just as we planned,

322
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:24,299
you just need to lure him out.

323
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,931
But if we get caught doing this,

324
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:29,604
will we get arrested?

325
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,326
If you don't get a good vibe in there,

326
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:33,147
come out right away. Got it?

327
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:35,560
Okay. I will.

328
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,464
Okay, we need to do a group cheer.

329
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,891
One, two, three.

330
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,651
- Fighting!*
- Fighting!
(Korean expression: "let's do it", "Have courage", "Good luck")

331
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:30,666
What? What jerk is messing with my car?

332
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,077
My goodness.

333
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,541
We just need to find the surveys on the incident

334
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,022
and any evidence related to the cafeteria.

335
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,931
We don't have time. We need to hurry.

336
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,753
I don't see anything.

337
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,415
Where did he hide it?

338
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,831
Who did this?

339
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,151
Who played a stupid prank on my car?!

340
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:14,199
How dare you mess with my precious car?

341
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:16,141
Gosh!

342
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,652
What do we do?

343
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:29,273
We need to buy them some time.

344
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,099
He's not answering.

345
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:46,381
Gosh.

346
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:00,686
I can't believe this.

347
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:11,816
There are so many psychos nowadays.

348
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,279
What's this?

349
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,402
Why is the door locked?

350
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:28,743
Who's playing these stupid pranks?

351
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,353
"Food Poisoning Survey Reports."

352
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:14,429
No matter how I think about it, it'd be dangerous to leave this here.

353
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:16,942
I need to go burn these.

354
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:20,924
Jin Sang, you're so smart.

355
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:43,178
Has this always been crooked?

356
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:53,928
Jin Sang, you're so handsome.

357
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:08,814
So instead of documents, you found a hidden camera?

358
00:27:08,814 --> 00:27:10,125
Yes.

359
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,336
It fell out from behind his portrait.

360
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:37,993
Press this.

361
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:39,553
Okay.

362
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:48,093
It worked.

363
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,709
It worked?

364
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:56,010
Awesome!

365
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,743
You guys are geniuses.

366
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,866
You're the best.

367
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:04,109
Shall we look at what's inside?

368
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:15,210
I got you for sure this time.

369
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,403
Go Jin Sang... You can't trust him.

370
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:20,754
I can watch him with this.

371
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:28,383
My gosh. Isn't that Geum Su Ji's mom?

372
00:28:39,824 --> 00:28:43,758
If we do this famine experience, I get some free pocket money.

373
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:51,626
You know that Su Ji's uncle is an assemblyman, right?

374
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:54,019
His son majored in Physical Education.

375
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,591
He said that he wants to try out being a gym teacher.

376
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:58,543
Is that so?

377
00:28:58,543 --> 00:29:01,066
I'll work something out then.

378
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:03,808
What a perfect timing. The freshman gym teacher's contract

379
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,931
has just expired right now.

380
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:09,634
I can just make a spot for him.

381
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:13,479
The school will definitely get donations,

382
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:16,401
and I'm sure he will put in a good word to the Board of Education.

383
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:20,605
Wouldn't it be nice for you to become a superintendent?

384
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:21,777
Aigoo!

385
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:25,099
Fate has truly brought us together.

386
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:28,913
Yes, Chairwoman.

387
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:31,846
I've dealt with everything.

388
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:35,541
As for the food poisoning incident,

389
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,843
Ms. Maeng will be taking responsibility.

390
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,925
A present for me?

391
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:44,058
It would be rude of me to refuse a present.

392
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,403
How is any of this right?

393
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:50,204
He totally took us for fools.

394
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,646
I had my doubts,

395
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:54,309
but I didn't think it would be this bad.

396
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:58,182
So he totally just blamed Ms. Maeng and got off scot-free.

397
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,364
Gosh.

398
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:02,668
Even our gym teacher being fired

399
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,858
was all because of money.

400
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:08,413
What should we do now?

401
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:10,926
What do you mean?

402
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:13,499
I'm so mad right now.

403
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:15,541
Let's report it to the police right away.

404
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:16,671
No.

405
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:20,395
Just reporting it isn't enough.

406
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:23,217
He has a lot of connections. I'm worried reporting it won't be enough.

407
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:24,469
That's right.

408
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:27,302
Who knows if someone's going to help him out for this, too?

409
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:30,074
What do we do?

410
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,275
Seonbae Sa Rang.

411
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:41,846
Hi.

412
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:45,921
Are you all right, Seonbae?

413
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:48,364
I heard things got messy at school.

414
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:52,387
It did. I can't even teach my classes.

415
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:54,830
Why aren't you fighting back?

416
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,003
Seonbae, you can solve something like this with no problem.

417
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:00,686
Well,

418
00:31:00,686 --> 00:31:03,468
I guess I'm sitting back to see how everything unfolds.

419
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:06,741
It sounds like things are going to be solved in no time.

420
00:31:10,306 --> 00:31:12,276
I heard you're going

421
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:16,791
to play some golf with Su Ji's uncle. I mean, Assemblyman Geum.

422
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:21,717
I'm worried that I'm not skilled enough to even hold a candle to him.

423
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:24,220
This is all thanks to you, Su Ji's mom.

424
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,691
I should be thanking you.

425
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:29,765
Thanks to your efforts, Golden Spoon Foods is growing

426
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:32,856
larger and larger by the day.

427
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:36,822
My goodness.

428
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:40,425
What do you want? Can't you see that I'm talking to the chairwoman?

429
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:42,807
Yes, I see that very clearly.

430
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:44,639
Principal,

431
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:47,411
take a look at this.

432
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:49,122
What is this?

433
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:55,329
If we do this famine experience,

434
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:56,942
I get some free pocket money.

435
00:31:56,942 --> 00:31:58,823
My goodness, this is so good.

436
00:31:58,823 --> 00:32:01,036
W-What on earth is this?

437
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:03,017
How did you...

438
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:05,930
- Wait a minute.
 - The money...

439
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,432
Who put that in my room?

440
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:11,435
Who installed a hidden camera?

441
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:14,238
Go Jin Sang, you can't trust him.

442
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:16,480
I can watch him with this.

443
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:23,218
- Why are you—
- Are you crazy?

444
00:32:23,218 --> 00:32:25,859
- Why are you doing this?
- How dare you install a hidden camera?

445
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:27,763
Do you want to screw us both over?

446
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:29,665
Fine, I did it. It was me!

447
00:32:29,665 --> 00:32:32,066
Do you think I would've done this if you weren't so sneaky?

448
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,648
- Have you lost your mind?
- Oh, my!

449
00:32:33,648 --> 00:32:36,801
The principal is trying to hit a student's parent.

450
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,572
You awful jerk!

451
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:40,395
What is this?

452
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:49,634
Oh, my. What are you doing?

453
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:52,757
Get away!

454
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,380
How dare she install a hidden camera?

455
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,542
She must have lost her mind.

456
00:33:00,335 --> 00:33:02,226
What do you think you're doing?

457
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,664
What's going on?

458
00:33:12,007 --> 00:33:13,137
Move!

459
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:14,389
No.

460
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:16,961
We won't move.

461
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,073
You little...

462
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:21,455
Do you all want to be expelled?!
