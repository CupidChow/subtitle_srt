~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,140
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,750
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,774
His parents aren't here.

5
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:51,547
He'll be so touched if I take care of him while he's hurt.

6
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,431
Was it apartment 401 where he lives?

7
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:59,155
- Geum Su Ji.
- Ro Bin, I heard you got hurt.

8
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:01,138
I'm all right. I didn't get hurt that badly.

9
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:03,159
You should have told me earlier.

10
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,414
My dad is good friends with the owner of that hospital.

11
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:09,446
But... what are you doing here?

12
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:11,828
Let's talk inside.

13
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,654
Sorry, I was just about to go out.

14
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:19,145
Really?

15
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,890
You should just stay home when you're not feeling well.

16
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,682
Then just take this.

17
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:26,753
I got you the most expensive Korean beef

18
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,587
and some red ginseng. Make sure to eat it.

19
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:32,479
- I'm really all right.
- Just take it.

20
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,743
But where are you off to?

21
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:41,948
Just cancel your plans and let's have a hearty meal together.

22
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:45,733
There's a grilled eel place that I go to all the time. Let's go.

23
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,203
Ro Bin,

24
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,846
Ji Na said to hurry up. She ordered beef bone soup.

25
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:56,003
So you're going to go eat beef bone soup with Ji Na?

26
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,775
Oppas, let's hurry and go eat.

27
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,581
Who are you?

28
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,754
Go on, Geum Su Ji.

29
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:08,204
Thanks for the food.

30
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:10,017
I'll go take it inside.

31
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,558
Thanks.

32
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:17,303
So this is Eonni Geum Su Ji.

33
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,386
I've heard a lot about you.

34
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:24,209
You're exactly like what I've heard about you.

35
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:28,214
I'm Sa Na, Oh Ji Na's little sister.

36
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,667
I have things to do, so I'll see you later.

37
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,610
Oppa, let's go.

38
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,870
Mom and Ji Na are probably waiting.

39
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:43,410
- Hey, wait for me.
- Hey, Seo Ro Bin!

40
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,473
I got you Korean beef!

41
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:48,895
Aish!

42
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:52,980
Oh Ji Na's sister is a total brat, just like her.

43
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,983
Oh Ji Na, Oh Ji Na!

44
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:58,105
I heard you got hurt, Ro Bin.

45
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:02,478
So I ordered an extra large portion of beef bone soup especially for you.

46
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:04,111
Eat up and get better soon.

47
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:05,993
Thank you.

48
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:08,866
I ordered a double portion of soup for you too, Je Yi.

49
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,416
Eat up.

50
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,439
I will. Thank you for your kind consideration.

51
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,251
Don't worry about it.

52
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:16,933
I'll buy you beef next time too.

53
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:19,375
I guess one of you will become my son-in-law in the future

54
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,526
and pay me back anyway.

55
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,572
- Am I being silly?
- You are.

56
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,754
When I was a kid,

57
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:30,738
my grandmother used to make beef bone soup for me when I got sick.

58
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:33,950
I always felt surprisingly better after a bowl of soup.

59
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,441
Eat up and make sure to finish the soup.

60
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:57,755
It's delicious.

61
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:00,316
Good. Drink up the soup.

62
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,968
Let's eat, guys.

63
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:03,869
Enjoy your meal!

64
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:06,732
This is nice.

65
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:09,026
Mom.

66
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:10,797
- Yes?
- I have a question.

67
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:13,170
Why is beef bone soup called beef bone soup?

68
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,101
Is the soup made out of bones?

69
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:18,705
Are sandwiches

70
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:21,307
made out of sand?

71
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:24,281
The bone helps create the rich taste. That's why it's called the beef bone soup.

72
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:28,084
Who do you take after to be so ignorant?

73
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,327
Don't worry.

74
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:34,350
I used to think that hot dogs were made out of dogs.

75
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,432
Really?

76
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:38,094
I guess you weren't always this smart.

77
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:41,959
- It's delicious.
- You should eat some more beef.

78
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,011
You're too skinny. You should gain some weight.

79
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:48,314
Okay. Thanks.

80
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:53,890
Oppa, I'll give you the kimchi.

81
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,563
- Open wide.
- I'll eat it myself.

82
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,292
No.

83
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,888
Here, Oppa.

84
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:14,009
Eat up and cheer up.

85
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:18,224
Okay. Thanks.

86
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,526
One extra-large portion to go, right?

87
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:20,647
Here you go.

88
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,258
Yup.

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,422
Mom, who are you going to give that to?

90
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:28,234
It's for your aunt.

91
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:31,118
She's not in her best condition these days.

92
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:36,142
- Tastes good.
- Doesn't she dislike beef bone soup?

93
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:37,725
I get why they say "fight fire with fire."

94
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,957
The soup tastes better since it's hot today, right?

95
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:44,480
It tastes so good. Bottoms up! Slurp it up!

96
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:53,049
Here, take your medicine.

97
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:54,400
You need to take it on time.

98
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,473
I'm not even hurting. Do I really need to?

99
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,685
They said you could get an internal infection if you don't.

100
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:04,290
Take it.

101
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:33,299
You act so cool on the outside, yet you can't even take a little medicine?

102
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,370
Goodness.

103
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:40,768
Here, open wide.

104
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,469
Just give it to me.

105
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:45,392
Oh, right.

106
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:49,205
But how did Geum Su Ji from your class find our house?

107
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,458
Does she like you?

108
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,653
I don't know either.

109
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:59,256
You two must have something going on if she came to our house.

110
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,748
This is the first time you brought a girl home.

111
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:04,510
I'm not the one who brought her.

112
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,796
Not to mention, there's another girl who's been to our house before.

113
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,336
Oh Ji Na.

114
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,212
My mom wanted me to bring you some watermelon.

115
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:19,615
My grandma sent over a huge watermelon.

116
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,610
You guys don't look like your parents.

117
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,082
Really? Everyone says that.

118
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:43,119
I need to show this to everyone.

119
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,241
Don't take pictures.

120
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:46,873
I told you not to take pictures.

121
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,224
No, it came out well.

122
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:49,746
- Give me your phone.
- Let's go, Sa Na.

123
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,817
Hand over your phone.

124
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,359
Ha Ji Man is really something else.

125
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,000
I couldn't believe it myself.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,741
Me too.

127
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,726
Hey.

128
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,879
Who do you think you are to buy Ro Bin beef bone soup?

129
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,883
And your little sister was a rude brat.

130
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,255
Don't talk about other people's families.

131
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:41,347
Why do you keep getting in my way?

132
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:42,798
Hey.

133
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:46,151
How about you stop getting in my way and move?

134
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:58,064
Look at this guy. He's already better. How are you feeling?

135
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:00,196
Are you really all right now, Ro Bin?

136
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,329
Yes, I'm fine.

137
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,451
I couldn't sleep because I was worried.

138
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:08,355
Let's go to that grilled eel place that I mentioned yesterday.

139
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,607
It's better than beef bone soup—

140
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,578
Hey, Geum Su Ji.

141
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,419
Yes? What is it?

142
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,831
Can I listen to music now?

143
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:23,039
2018 Hanjong Writing Contest

144
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,143
That's right. The school writing contest deadline is really soon, isn't it?

145
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:28,665
Did you all write yours?

146
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:32,669
I forgot. Doesn't the winner get it entered in their school record?

147
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:35,021
You get a demerit if you don't do it.

148
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,694
I guess I have to bust out my poetry skills.

149
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:40,346
"Come one step closer to me.

150
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,229
Come two steps closer to me."

151
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,662
What is that?

152
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:47,423
They're lyrics from an AOA song.

153
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:50,076
My goodness.

154
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:52,578
What do I write about for my essay?

155
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:55,081
I can't write anything without hashtags.

156
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:57,333
Hashtag, essay contest.

157
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,216
Hashtag, can we use hashtags?

158
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:02,929
Hashtag, I'm going to win this.

159
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:05,371
Hashtag, I can't write long essays.

160
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,453
Hashtag, I can't write more than a few words.

161
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:10,847
Hashtag, I'm done for.

162
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:13,790
Rok Hui, what are you going to write about?

163
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,573
I'm not sure. Maybe a poem?

164
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:23,610
This is the sound of the wind being split by my fist.

165
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,351
What was that?

166
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,963
That's right. Ji Na.

167
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:29,406
That thing you wrote in your notebook was interesting.

168
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:31,247
You should submit that.

169
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,760
Oh Ji Na, you're a writer?

170
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,162
In middle school, Ji Na even got an award for an essay contest.

171
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,544
That's amazing.

172
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:42,128
But I lost that notebook, so I can't remember what I wrote.

173
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:45,231
Maybe I'll try to rack my memory and rewrite it.

174
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:47,643
What are you going to write, Ro Bin?

175
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,797
I'm not sure. Maybe an acrostic poem?

176
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,562
Oh, Ro Bin, did you take your medicine this morning?

177
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:57,984
You didn't, did you? Hurry and take it.

178
00:10:57,984 --> 00:11:00,526
Stop nagging. Don't worry about me.

179
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,408
I'll take it later.

180
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,878
Three times a day 30 minutes after meals, avoid infection

181
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,842
What is this?

182
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:29,004
It's a reminder in case you forget. Put it on your desk.

183
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,086
Take it now.

184
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:52,239
There. I took it.

185
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:55,511
You can't take medicine well, can you?

186
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:59,956
I know, right? He acts all cool but it's all just for show.

187
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:02,669
I can't stand Oh Ji Na.

188
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:06,092
This won't lead them to become a couple, right?

189
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,504
I need to make my move.

190
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,894
Three times a day 30 minutes after meals, avoid infection

191
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,692
I like Seo Je Yi

192
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:28,405
Three times a day 30 minutes after meals, avoid infection

193
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,596
The handwriting is totally different.

194
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:40,326
I guess it wasn't Ji Na who wrote that note to Je Yi.

195
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:02,609
This soup is delicious. My goodness.

196
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,323
But it tastes a little different from when she used to cook it for me.

197
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,317
Anyway,

198
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:14,079
Eun Hui's the only one who cares this much about me.

199
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,587
Eun Hui.

200
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:22,748
Gosh.

201
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:28,324
Thank you for the meal.

202
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,185
Gosh.

203
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:33,090
You are truly the only one

204
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,191
who cares about me.

205
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,615
I made you this because I felt bad you ate that instant food every day.

206
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,928
So just leave the plates and go.

207
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,561
Why don't you open the lid?

208
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,953
I think there's something in there.

209
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:56,914
I can't believe you.

210
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:58,905
My goodness.

211
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,676
It was my first beef bone soup in a long while.

212
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:03,289
It's making me feel so strong today!

213
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,522
Why is this so crooked?

214
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,605
Gosh.

215
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:10,507
Stop overreacting.

216
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:12,628
Just leave it alone.

217
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,128
You guys are joined at the hip.

218
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,591
Oh my. It's not like that.

219
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:25,622
My dear,

220
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:28,314
I asked all my friends who work at big companies

221
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:31,608
if they had any co-workers who are single.

222
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:33,630
Something good will come along soon.

223
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,153
It's fine. As for me,

224
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:38,886
just like the modern women of today's society,

225
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:41,768
I'm not going to chase after marriage, I'll live like a strong woman.

226
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:45,162
That's not a bad idea.

227
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:48,635
You just end up with a hard life after you get married.

228
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:52,149
I personally agree with you living alone and being comfortable.

229
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,510
I decided not to chase after marriage.

230
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,553
I'm going to stay calm

231
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:59,394
and just see where the wind takes me.

232
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:03,811
Who's this?

233
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:05,642
Hello?

234
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:09,025
Hey, it's been a long time.

235
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:11,027
How are you doing?

236
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:12,669
What?

237
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:15,141
Your wedding is this weekend?

238
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:19,906
Have you lost your mind?

239
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:23,450
I can't even remember the last time I saw you. Why would I go to your wedding?

240
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,952
I'm not going! Bye!

241
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:30,487
My goodness. I can't believe her.

242
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:32,799
How dare she invite me to her wedding?

243
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,443
I'm annoyed. I don't believe this.

244
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:40,266
I guess she's not that calm yet.

245
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,219
I know, right?

246
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,721
- Honey!
- Yes?

247
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:46,573
Did you contact that guy from the big company?

248
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:48,895
Call him right now. This instant!

249
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,777
Okay, I will.

250
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:54,040
Hello?

251
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,922
It's me.

252
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,934
Are you looking for bachelors?

253
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:59,445
There's no one?

254
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:02,890
You need to find one! My life is at stake!

255
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,702
Ask everyone you know!

256
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:08,464
- Yes!
- This is a complete mess.

257
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,332
Where's Ro Bin's bicycle?

258
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,904
Here it is.

259
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:22,378
What are you doing in front of my bicycle?

260
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,871
Hi.

261
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:27,264
So...

262
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:29,516
let's go grab some healthy food together.

263
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,649
It's my treat. Let's go together.

264
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:34,360
I'm fine. You don't have to do that.

265
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,924
Then I'll buy you a present to celebrate you getting out of the hospital.

266
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,833
It's not as if I stayed at the hospital.

267
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,436
Come on. Isn't there anything that you want?

268
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:51,998
I just want to treat you to something nice.

269
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:53,339
Why?

270
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,883
Don't we have a relationship where we can do these things for each other?

271
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,855
What kind of relationship do we have?

272
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:01,728
It's fine. Don't bother.

273
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:09,265
Hey, Seo Ro Bin!

274
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:11,858
You don't think I have my own dignity?

275
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:14,700
Who do you think you are to treat me like this?

276
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:19,175
I like you.

277
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:21,467
I really like you.

278
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:28,475
I'll be honest.

279
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:30,708
I like someone else.

280
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,669
Could it be...

281
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:34,770
Is that someone Oh Ji Na?

282
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,695
I'll get going.

283
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:42,719
Hey, Seo Ro Bin, I'm not done talking.

284
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,691
Don't go.

285
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:46,643
Gosh.

286
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:59,955
Hey, kid! Don't just jump in front of cars like that.

287
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,863
I didn't actually get hit, so just leave.

288
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:07,284
Hurry up. Go away.

289
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,799
You could have gotten hurt.

290
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,340
Are you okay?

291
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,682
You're okay, aren't yo?

292
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:29,847
That car was coming so fast, and it looked like you couldn't hear it.

293
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:32,538
I just ran after you without thinking.

294
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,862
If I got there even a fraction of a second later,

295
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:37,594
you could have gotten into a big accident.

296
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,986
Sorry.

297
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,768
Does it hurt a lot?

298
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,801
What do we do about this?

299
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:51,748
I'm okay.

300
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:54,761
As long as you're not hurt, it's fine.

301
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,234
That was close.

302
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:13,641
It's just a slight scratch.

303
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:16,353
Just apply some ointment.

304
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:17,984
Just wrap it with a cast.

305
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:19,485
What?

306
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:22,539
It's not that bad. It's just a little scrape.

307
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,991
Could you just wrap it with a cast?

308
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:27,372
I'm telling you, it hurts.

309
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:33,649
Look at it. Just wrap a cast on it.

310
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:57,585
Did you get hurt badly?

311
00:19:57,585 --> 00:20:00,978
Yes. I didn't know it yesterday,

312
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:03,230
but it's cracked a little.

313
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,833
Sorry this happened because of me.

314
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,656
If you're sorry, could you help me out

315
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:10,948
until my leg gets better?

316
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:12,738
How?

317
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:29,886
What in the world? What is Ro Bin doing?

318
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:31,797
Maybe he ate something bad.

319
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:44,021
Hey, Su Ji, how did this happen?

320
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:45,862
It just happened somehow.

321
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:49,555
It must hurt a lot. You should've rested at home for a few days.

322
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:54,960
Ro Bin, I think I need to go inside and sit down.

323
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:04,770
What kind of situation is this?

324
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:09,275
Well, she is hurt. It only makes sense.

325
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:12,208
But how did she get hurt?

326
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:16,573
Oh my. A notice came up

327
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:19,627
saying the full-time teacher hire will be announced next week.

328
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:21,418
- Oh, gosh.
- Mr. Choi.

329
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:23,470
Congratulations in advance.

330
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,693
We won't really know until the announcement.

331
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:29,817
Then will you be treating us to dinner next week, Mr. Choi?

332
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:32,970
If I do get the position, I'll buy you guys ten dinners!

333
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,350
Oh my.

334
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,293
Congratulations!

335
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:38,786
What's all the noise about?

336
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:43,080
Look for ways to raise your students' grades instead of chatting.

337
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,671
Mr. Choi.

338
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,323
Bring a box of A4 paper into my office.

339
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:49,336
Pardon?

340
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:50,837
All right.

341
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:56,113
How does one person use that much paper?

342
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:58,345
You don't think he takes it home, do you?

343
00:21:58,345 --> 00:22:00,617
What? No way.

344
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:03,069
I'm telling you. He does.

345
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:08,776
Where should I put this?

346
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:12,098
Go put it in the trunk of my car.

347
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:14,991
- Yes.
- Oh, right. Mr. Choi.

348
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:18,535
Today's the day where the potatoes come in for the cafeteria.

349
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:21,188
Nowadays, potatoes are so expensive.

350
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:23,710
My wife won't stop complaining about it.

351
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,483
Nab a box for me, will you?

352
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,254
Potatoes too?

353
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:30,047
What? Is there a problem?

354
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:32,218
Not at all. No problem.

355
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,971
I'll quickly load a box into your car.

356
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:36,993
I'll be back.

357
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:41,808
Just hold it in until next week.

358
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:45,982
They gave us so little of the stir-fried potatoes.

359
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:48,195
This isn't right.

360
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:52,528
I know, right? I love stir-fried potatoes.

361
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:54,571
What the heck?

362
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,623
What's going on?

363
00:22:58,454 --> 00:23:00,957
Ro Bin is even carrying Su Ji's lunch for her.

364
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:02,538
What's going on with them?

365
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:03,960
I can't believe it.

366
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,862
Has he lost it?

367
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:09,105
Gosh. Has Ro Bin gone crazy?

368
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:11,117
I didn't think it was true.

369
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:13,449
I guess he's fallen for Su Ji.

370
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:15,993
I wouldn't doubt any other guy in the world falling for her,

371
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,525
but not Ro Bin.

372
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,794
Can I eat with you guys?

373
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:28,546
Sure.

374
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:30,376
Sit here.

375
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,396
It's been a while since we ate together.

376
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:42,478
I know, right? How have you been?

377
00:23:42,478 --> 00:23:44,179
Good.

378
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:54,632
You like these, right? Eat up.

379
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:56,133
Thanks.

380
00:23:56,964 --> 00:24:01,127
What's going on? Is a new romance budding on this side of the table too?

381
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:04,722
Are you jealous?

382
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:06,352
Here, I'll give you some too.

383
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:09,274
Gross. That's so dirty!

384
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:14,692
Are those two dating or what?

385
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:17,283
But then again, Ji Na always did have a thing

386
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:20,157
for that church-going nice guy look.

387
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:24,691
I heard your brother is really popular.

388
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,082
But he's not my type.

389
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,277
My type is...

390
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:33,170
You know who, right?

391
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,752
Just eat.

392
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:37,453
What is going on?

393
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:39,426
What's with her?

394
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:41,857
She totally wants us to hear her.

395
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,111
Whatever.

396
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:54,069
My shoelaces are untied.

397
00:24:58,154 --> 00:25:01,026
I can't do this on my own.

398
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:20,396
- Gosh.
- They must really be a couple.

399
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:21,949
- What is he doing?
- I can't believe it.

400
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:23,389
What is he doing?

401
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,622
Now he's tying her shoes for her?

402
00:25:26,473 --> 00:25:28,094
Maybe they're seeing each other.

403
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:30,607
I wish someone would tie my shoelaces for me.

404
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,020
Thanks, Ro Bin.

405
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:37,553
My stomach aches. I'll get going first.

406
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:55,482
Are you okay?

407
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:58,434
Help me up.

408
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,882
Ji Na, are you okay?

409
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:08,966
I'm okay. Aigoo, what do I do about this mess?

410
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:10,696
I'll clean it up.

411
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:13,099
Thanks.

412
00:26:35,922 --> 00:26:37,574
Now they're coming to school together?

413
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:39,737
- I can't believe it.
- Oh my.

414
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:41,529
What a gentleman.

415
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:42,880
This is weird.

416
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,710
What's with her leg?

417
00:26:49,056 --> 00:26:50,887
- Are they dating?
- I don't know.

418
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:52,728
Whatever.

419
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:57,293
Thanks for taking care of me, Ro Bin.

420
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,998
The princess has arrived.

421
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:04,201
I can't stand her.

422
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:07,373
Why is Ro Bin acting out of character and doing this?

423
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,348
Oh Ji Na, let's talk.

424
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,049
No.

425
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:32,590
Okay.

426
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,593
I'm not going home until I finish. Let's do this.

427
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:42,640
Where's Ji Na?

428
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,291
She ran to the computer room so she could get a seat.

429
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:47,555
She said she had to finish her writing contest entry.

430
00:27:47,555 --> 00:27:50,026
Gosh, she's really going for the gold.

431
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:52,048
Just watch her lose.

432
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:55,241
Should we go grab tteokbokki together?

433
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,493
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

434
00:27:56,493 --> 00:27:57,755
Me too.

435
00:27:57,755 --> 00:28:00,767
I'll think about it. Let's go.

436
00:28:06,714 --> 00:28:08,665
Title: Love Letter

437
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:11,357
"Love Letter in Joseon."

438
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,591
All right. Concentrate

439
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:17,284
and rack that memory of yours.

440
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,852
On the morning that Dad left,

441
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:27,934
Mom received a letter.

442
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:30,838
It was on a faded piece of Korean paper.

443
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:33,820
Mom said that it was a love letter given to her by her lover

444
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,192
500 years ago.

445
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:39,617
She left me with these lies

446
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,538
and disappeared

447
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:43,700
without a trace.

448
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,627
Five hundred years ago, she was a princess

449
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:53,510
and he was her guardian warrior.

450
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,312
Those two

451
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:58,614
couldn't be together, even if they could die for it.

452
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:04,169
The flowers are very pretty.

453
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,764
Your Highness, you must not touch them thoughtlessly.

454
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:11,558
It is fine.

455
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:13,969
Your Highness, you mustn't.

456
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:19,936
It was a romance that should have never begun.

457
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:23,750
Run!

458
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:32,459
Your Highness, are you all right?

459
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,714
Are you hurt? I'm hurt too.

460
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:43,711
Check the area thoroughly!

461
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:46,613
Your Highness, you're suffering because of me.

462
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:49,817
No. All I need is you, Gang Dong.

463
00:29:49,817 --> 00:29:52,268
Your Highness!

464
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:55,672
You do not need to refer to me as "Your Highness" anymore.

465
00:29:55,672 --> 00:29:57,553
Princess...

466
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:00,447
Gang Dong...

467
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:08,344
Gang Dong.

468
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,583
It's not too late.

469
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,805
Go back.

470
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:19,335
I don't want to.

471
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:23,839
My world would have no meaning without you, Gang Dong.

472
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:33,820
This is a letter of my love.

473
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:39,355
Even in another life,

474
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:42,178
I promise to love only you!

475
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,662
Gang Dong!

476
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:49,345
Don't leave me.

477
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:21,357
Mom came back.

478
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:24,950
Surprisingly, she came back with Dad.

479
00:31:25,612 --> 00:31:27,484
Mom told me

480
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:31,447
that she time-traveled to 500 years ago.

481
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:35,250
What could have happened to her?

482
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:41,327
I'm done!

483
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:46,782
Oh, my stomach.

484
00:31:47,685 --> 00:31:49,186
I can't hold it.

485
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,124
Would you like to save?

486
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:13,420
Would you like to delete?

487
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:29,505
Where is it?

488
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:33,480
Document not found. Please try again.

489
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:37,824
Document not found. Please try again.

490
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:40,157
It's gone.

491
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:44,020
It's gone.

492
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,012
What do I do?

493
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:53,850
Come on.
