00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:55,946
Have you had your dinner?

5
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:58,857
How is the new school?

6
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,342
I can trust you, right?

7
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:06,615
Call me when you get this.

8
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,944
Sin Ae, did you get home safely?

9
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:47,256
Why are you being like this too?

10
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:47,707
Would you like to download Revenge Note?

11
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:49,459
What's this?

12
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,378
What was that?

13
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,060
Oh, my gosh. It's a thief!

14
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,061
Mom!

15
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,694
- It's a thief!
- Wait.

16
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:07,256
It's a thief! There's a thief here!

17
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:08,748
It's a thief!

18
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:10,599
Wait!

19
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:14,935
What thief? Where is the punk?

20
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:16,476
Let me see that jerk!

21
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:17,517
- You thief!
- Wait!

22
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:18,818
- You—
- Apartment 401!

23
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:20,269
I'm from apartment 401.

24
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,360
A-Apartment 401?

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,663
Omo! You're the student who just moved in?

26
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,035
He lives across from us, too?

27
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,910
Look at what you did!

28
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,180
You should have looked

29
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,603
before you started screaming.

30
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:35,976
I'm so sorry.

31
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:37,877
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:40,320
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,130
I brought an egg.

34
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:44,233
Oh, no.

35
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,187
What do you think you're doing?

36
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,039
I'm sorry again.

37
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,442
Here's a towel. Aigoo.

38
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,143
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,705
Ji Na,

40
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,628
that's a rag.

41
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,342
Oh, no.

42
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,923
Truly, I am so sorry.

43
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,163
What's wrong? What happened to you?

44
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,529
It's nothing.

45
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,342
I don't need it.

46
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,675
Are you sure everything's okay?

47
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:27,937
Why?

48
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:29,978
You think I would've caused trouble?

49
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,731
No, that's not what I meant.

50
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,433
Mom called earlier.

51
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:36,476
She wants you to call her back.

52
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,668
She talked to you. That's enough.

53
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,598
A hundred won (about 10¢) is still money.

54
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:01,490
I'm late.

55
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,662
She's really a strange girl.

59
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,341
Is someone pulling a prank on me?

60
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,797
I wonder what this is.

61
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,245
- Hello.
- Hi.

62
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:17,527
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes, I am.

63
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:18,698
I see.

64
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,239
- Your dog is adorable.
- Yes.

65
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,470
Go away.

66
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,283
Go away.

67
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,297
Go away!

68
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:29,589
Oh, my.

69
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,421
Why did you pee there?

70
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,772
But...

71
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:37,105
Why didn't you move?

72
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,958
It's all right. Don't mind me.

73
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,179
- Have a good day.
- Goodbye.

74
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,151
Fried Chicken Coupon, Hogu Chicken

75
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:55,014
Heol! What is this?

76
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,638
Incredible!

77
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:02,551
Of course, such luck wouldn't happen to me.

78
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,845
My day is going south already.

79
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:16,786
She's certainly an interesting character.

80
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:34,493
Hey, look at her.

81
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:37,056
- That's the one I was talking about.
- Who?

82
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,748
- That girl.
- Oh.

83
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:41,670
Her classmates are too nice.

84
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,063
I would've pulled out all her hair.

85
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:01,851
You're apartment 401.

86
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,092
I'm Je Yi. Seo Je Yi.

87
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:08,697
I'm a student at Hanjong starting today.

88
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,599
Can you show me around?

89
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,251
Sure.

90
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:49,357
Is the guy from last night all right?

91
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:50,540
Ro Bin?

92
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,142
Yes, he is all right.

93
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:55,284
So his name is Ro Bin.

94
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,577
What's the relationship between you two?

95
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:59,288
He is my younger brother.

96
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,590
Oh, you're brothers.

97
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,972
You two look so different though.

98
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:06,024
How old is he?

99
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:07,307
He is also a freshman.

100
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,878
Then are you twins?

101
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:12,330
No, we're not twins.

102
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,413
I was born in January and he was born in December.

103
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:18,818
He never wants to admit that he's younger though.

104
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,950
Yes, he seems like the type.

105
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,143
Hanjong High School.

106
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:27,557
If you turn left from there, it's the teachers' office.

107
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:29,988
Ah, okay. Thanks.

108
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:32,362
- I'll see you later.
- Sure.

109
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:37,516
I didn't realize it yesterday,

110
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:39,669
but he is really handsome.

111
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,311
It's a long way.

112
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:43,742
You're going to eat?

113
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:45,654
You're not going to eat with us?

114
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,437
I think it's...

115
00:09:58,257 --> 00:09:59,998
Thanks.

116
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:17,036
Don't try to do anything...

117
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,417
Or should we do it to you instead?

118
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,061
It's funny.

119
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:24,292
We did a good job.

120
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,731

Seo Je Yi, I'm expecting a lot from you.

124
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:42,050
Just do as you have done so far.

125
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,853
Yes, sir.

126

Physical Education, Arts

127
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,409
That's amazing.

128
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,950
You're not only handsome

129
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,662
but you're really smart as well.

130
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:55,716
You're too good to be true.

131
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:56,666
Thank you.

132
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,758
But... Isn't there another new student coming today?

133
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,159
Yes.

134
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,361
That's right.

135
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,222
Where is your younger brother?

136
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:06,125
Well...

137
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,976
I think he is...

138
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,744
Seo Ro Bin.

139
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,915
You're late on your first day.

140
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:28,737
What's with that hair?

141
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:31,370
You better straighten up.

142
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,263
Also, at our school,

143
00:11:35,263 --> 00:11:37,116
earrings are not permitted.

144
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:40,469
He can make changes from now on.

145
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:43,563
It's only his first day. Go easy on him.

146
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:46,716
All right. Let's go to class.

147
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,498
You guys can follow me.

148
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,178
All right.

149
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,735
- I'm tired.
- We can do this.

150
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:57,236
- Have a good day.
- You too.

151
00:11:57,236 --> 00:12:00,077
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

152
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:01,951
- Guys, she's an idol singer.
- Be quiet.

153
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:04,543
- So what?
- You're doing this again.

154
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,167
Guys, be quiet.

155
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,928
I was sick.

156
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,380
Can you quiet down? We have a new friend joining us today.

157
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,033
Come on in.

158
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:17,797
We got a transfer student?

159
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:21,088
It's not even the beginning of the semester.

160
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:23,411
He looks pretty tough.

161
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:30,418
Can you introduce yourself?

162
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,822
I'm Seo Ro Bin.

163
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,746
What? That's it?

164
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,049
You're so handsome!

165
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,330
- Look at him!
- He's so cute!

166
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,863
He's cute.

167
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:46,545
Be quiet.

168
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:49,848
Is that all you have to say?

169
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:52,451
You can tell us a bit more about yourself.

170
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,533
I don't have anything to say.

171
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,137
Ro Bin, you must be a man of few words.

172
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:00,028
All right, then.

173
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:03,973
You can take the empty seat over there.

174
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:11,059
Isn't he pretty cool?

175
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:14,523
I'll have him on my social media someday.

176
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:16,436
Why does he have to sit right behind me?

177
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:18,888
What's with that jerk?

178
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:21,580
He's totally my type.

179
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:48,276
Right. If guys are too easy, they're not as attractive.

180
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:52,241
Heol!

181
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:54,483
Those are the silent seats.

182
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:57,966
I should stay away from that side of the room.

183
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,639
Let's have a good day today.

184
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,920
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

185
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,927
Look at you trying to be all cool.

186
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,740
What are you listening to?

187
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,864
Oh, hip-hop.

188
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:15,424
What's up, man?

189
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:16,956
I know how to rap.

190
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,067
♪ My name is Mi Nam ♪

191
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:18,968
♪ Mi Nam but not handsome ♪
 ("Mi Nam" is literally "pretty boy")

192
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,089
♪ You are Seo Ro Bin ♪

193
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,701
♪ La la la la, Seo Ro Bin ♪

194
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:23,692
Hey, Bro.

195
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:27,115
Hip-hop is good, but there is a true classic.

196
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,777
Su Ro.

197
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,932
It's called "AOA Rocks."

198
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:35,835
It's an independent club in Hanjong High for researching and analyzing AOA

199
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,367
academically.

200
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,439
It's not open to just anyone.

201
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,290
But I can let you in.

202
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,942
I'm President, you see.

203
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:45,925
I'm not interested.

204
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,327
Hey!

205
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,158
Don't regret it later.

206
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,150
Take the chance while you have it.

207
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:54,764
Seeing that you've transferred in the middle of the semester,

208
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:57,006
you probably have a story to tell.

209
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,878
Did you get in trouble or something?

210
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:05,584
Anyway, feel free to ask me if you have any questions,

211
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:09,120
especially ones about girls or dating.

212
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:13,323
We have gym class next. Do you have gym clothes?

213
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:16,925
Wait, where did I put my gym clothes?

214
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:20,249
Bulgogi, crab,

215
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:22,970
egg fried rice...

216
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,094
The only one that expired today is

217
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:27,126
rice with tuna and kimchi.

218
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,460
Tuna and mayonnaise is the best.

219
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:34,895
Well...

220
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,751
You should call me for this kind of work.

221
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,655
Come on. Let me do it for you.

222
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:46,175
I got this.

223
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:50,240
Sinu Real Estate

224
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,432
You haven't had breakfast, right?

225
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,263
Here.

226
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:57,917
You can drink it all you want.

227
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:00,520
Gosh,

228
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,821
that temper of hers.

229
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:04,910
Why does she act like that?

230
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,912
Line up two arm's lengths apart.

231
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:13,943
- One, two, go.
- One, two, go.

232
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:15,974
Let's stretch.

233
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,728
One, two, three, four,

234
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,130
five, six, seven, eight.

235
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,061
Turn to the other side.

236
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,635
One, two, three, four,

237
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:29,298
five, six, seven, eight.

238
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,413
Hello? Yes.

239
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:36,545
- I will be right there.
- What?

240
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,376
Class President,

241
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,879
have the guys play basketball and the girls play dodgeball.

242
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,160
I'll be right back, all right?

243
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,582
- Are we not going to have class?
- What?

244
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,724
- Go over there.
- Here.

245
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,566
Hey, pass it to me.

246
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:58,837
Pass the ball. Come on.

247
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:01,011
Ro Bin, sorry. Can you pass me the ball?

248
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,390
Or did you want to play with us?

249
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:09,689
Guys, I told you to use your wrist.

250
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:11,991
Nobody knows.

251
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,474
- Nice shot.
- Let's go.

252
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:17,736
Come on. It's my ball.

253
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,799
Come on, guys.

254
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,721
Give me the ball.

255
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,842
Hey, let's change the rules.

256
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:35,315
From now on, it's ground dodgeball.

257
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:40,139
You know, right? You won't be out just from getting hit.

258
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,672
Here we go.

259
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,616
Wait. Let's try again.

260
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:50,339
Yes.

261
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:56,646
- Good job.
- She got hit.

262
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,899
- You're out.
- Out.

263
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:01,180
The ball touched you. You're out.

264
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:13,092
She feels no shame.

265
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,665
That's why she would even cheat on a test.

266
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:19,130
Do it right. It's so boring because of you.

267
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,570
You're out.

268
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,796
- What is she doing?
- Just leave her alone.

269
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:39,349
- It's Rok Hui.
- I'm so annoyed.

270
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:42,332
Who did that?

271
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,434
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,410
The ball slipped out of my hands.

273
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:51,200
You should have been more careful.

274
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,788
- Let's go eat.
- Yes.

275
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,370
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

276
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:20,519
Aigoo, aigoo...

277
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,922
Aigoo.

278
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:25,353
That feels so good.

279
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,199
Teacher Choi, you're the best at this.

280
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,141
I heard

281
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:34,433
you are a qualified sports masseur.

282
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:38,137
Yes, I have a license from the Chiropractic Association of Korea.

283
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:41,060
Today, I feel it is worth it.

284
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,381
That feels so good.

285
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:00,209
Put it on your wound.

286
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:07,956
Thanks.

287
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,385
- I didn't know you were that good.
- Did you see her?

288
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:17,566
- She was amazing.
- She is so good.

289
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,270
- I'm so hungry.
- You were really good.

290
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,583
- I'm good.
- What are they doing?

291
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:25,565
You're always hungry.

292
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:27,877
Who is that next to Ro Bin?

293
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,929
He's Seo Je Yi, the new student in Class Two.

294
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:30,861
I heard they're brothers.

295
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:33,732
He was the reason for all the cheering?

296
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,084
I wonder if they're twins.

297
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:37,896
Even as a guy,

298
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:40,098
I can only be jealous of them.

299
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:42,822
Ro Bin is so much better.

300
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:45,154
I've already claimed dibs on Ro Bin,

301
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:47,386
so you girls better stay away from him.

302
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:48,859
Guys,

303
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:51,801
when it comes to men, the cute type like me is the best.

304
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:54,603
The cute type? You must mean the ugly type.

305
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:56,076
Hey!

306
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:59,028
- That's enough.
- He always does that.

307
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,442
- It's like this.
- What is that?

308
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,175
Don't you smell garbage from somewhere?

309
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:38,687
I can see that garbage has picked up more garbage.

310
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,260
Gosh. How could you wear that?

311
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,371
It's nasty.

312
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:51,030
Ji Na, meet me at the gym restroom after class.

313
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:07,997
Sin Ae.

314
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,014
Shut the door.

315
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:17,958
It's good to see you, Oh Ji Na.

316
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,440
Geum Su Ji, what are you doing here?

317
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,405
- Sin Ae.
- I've told you before, right?

318
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:28,908
You are so annoying.

319
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:32,441
Do the cheating by yourself. Don't bring Sin Ae into it.

320
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:36,164
Whether I cheat or not is none of your business.

321
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,960
Stop trying to act like a goody two-shoes.

322
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,113
Did I ask you to show me your answers?

323
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,537
Why did you ruin my cheating?!

324
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:49,939
The one involved didn't even say anything.

325
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:51,720
Sin Ae.

326
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:58,448
What are you glaring at me for?

327
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:01,762
By glaring at me like that,

328
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:04,564
what can you do? I'll just—

329
00:23:04,564 --> 00:23:09,198
So you'd better stay out of other people's business from now on.

330
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:13,312
Do you understand?

331
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,926
Come look at this.

332
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:22,512
Gosh, it smells like alcohol.

333
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:26,454
Ji Na, wake up.

334
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:28,417
She's totally drunk.

335
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:29,558
What should we do?

336
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:32,542
Girls, try to help her.

337
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,973
Should I upload this on the Internet?

338
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,485
It looks so real. She looks totally drunk.

339
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:55,695
I'm sorry, Ji Na.

340
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,042
We're leaving now.

341
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,484
Come out when you're sober, friend!

342
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:18,107
When did Sin Ae leave?

343
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:20,459
She probably realized that she was next.

344
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,642
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

345
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,589
Guys, don't go away!

346
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:31,871
Please open the door!

347
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:35,464
Sin Ae. Someone, please help me!

348
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:37,436
Sin Ae.

349
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:59,980
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

350
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:06,176
Enter target's name.

351
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,968
You are so shameless.

352
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,852
You shouldn't be two-faced like that!

353
00:25:12,852 --> 00:25:14,434
Oh Ji Na, that crazy girl!

354
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:17,316
Enter target's name
Geum Su Ji

355
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:19,980
Clean it up!

356
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,571
You're truly a piece of trash.

357
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:24,634
Geum Su Ji

358
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,935
Start

359
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:41,502
Target meets all conditions

360
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:43,092
We will proceed with the revenge

361
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:18,959
I'm serious.

362
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,961
I did really well on the test,

363
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,372
but we need to retake it because of Ji Na.

364
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:26,045
I was so shocked that I forgot everything.

365
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:27,918
Whose child is that?

366
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,720
I don't know. She's a bad girl.

367
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,781
Her shameless self still comes to school every day.

368
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:35,434
Mom, I'm in the library right now,

369
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:38,380
so I'll be home later. I'm hanging up.

370
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,538
You're in the library?

371
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:41,360
Stop lying.

372
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,761
What?

373
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:43,653
That's funny.

374
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:45,766
You have been selected as a Revenge Target

375
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,677
What is this? How annoying.

376
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:49,408
Let's go and have fun.

377
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,881
- Let's go!
- Let's have a good time.

378
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,511
- Yes.
- That was awesome.

379
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,845
Handmade Sushi Restaurant

380
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:55,926
Oh, no!

381
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:58,348
I'm so sorry. Please wait.

382
00:26:58,348 --> 00:27:00,590
Darn it!

383
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,712
Gosh. These are new clothes.

384
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:04,805
- Are you all right?
- What do I do?

385
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:09,339
Taxi

386
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,454
Goodbye.

387
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,900
Where am I?

388
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,781
Oh, gosh.

389
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:34,824
Ji Na.

390
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:36,836
What are you doing here?

391
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:39,279
Ji Na?

392
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:53,031
Ji Na, are you all right?

393
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:54,584
Yes.

394
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:57,246
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

395
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,572
I think you're a bit better now.

396
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:08,649
My goodness! You little brat.

397
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:12,022
You're too young to come home drunk.

398
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:13,270
You're grounded for a few days.

399
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,740
I'm going to let it slide just this time.

400
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:18,056
Don't you ever do that again.

401
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:20,498
I never drank, Mom.

402
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,212
Mom, by the way, who brought me home?

403
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:25,594
Your aunt, who do you think?

404
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:28,857
This is unbelievable. Aigoo!

405
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,481
Auntie.

406
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:44,963
Don't shake me. My head hurts.

407
00:28:44,963 --> 00:28:47,447
I heard you brought me in last night.

408
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:50,750
- Yes.
- Did you see who brought me home?

409
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,881
I did.

410
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:55,334
Who was it? Tell me.

411
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:59,098
Wait. I even took a picture.

412
00:29:08,508 --> 00:29:10,539
Why did I even take a picture?

413
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:16,055
We're home safe. Let's take a proof shot.

414
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,808
- What in the world are you doing?
- One, two, three.

415
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:20,891
- Snap.
- What are you doing?

416
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,643
Gosh, you're so handsome.

417
00:29:22,643 --> 00:29:24,184
- One, two, three.
- You have good taste.

418
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:27,036
This is ridiculous.

419
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:30,469
Here.

420
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:35,484
I can't even tell who that is.

421
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:39,388
I remember one thing clearly.

422
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:41,369
What is it?

423
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:43,363
He was handsome.

424
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,426
Maybe it's

425
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,937
Je Yi who brought me home?

426
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:08,457
Hi.

427
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,751
Come on. Let's go.

428
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:18,738
Ji Na, take your wallet.

429
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:25,785
Didn't I see you yesterday?

430
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,589
Maybe it was Je Yi after all.

431
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:38,448
W-Was it him?

432
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,600
W-Was it you?

433
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:43,223
Aigoo!

434
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:44,993
I'm going.

435
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:54,565
If that happened, you should have told me earlier.

436
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,727
I will take care of everything,

437
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:59,008
so just focus on your studies.

438
00:30:59,008 --> 00:31:00,609
Yes.

439
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,764
Video of Ji Na will be uploaded today.

440
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:07,166
- I'm going to watch it.
- It'll be a popular video.

441
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,847
Are you okay?

442
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:20,410
- Omo! You're bleeding.
- Mom!

443
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,462
Mister, pass me some tissue.

444
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:24,543
- What do I do?
- Oh, no.

445
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:26,425
My goodness.

446
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:30,189
Hey, Ji Na's here.

447
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:32,021
She's here.

448
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:40,048
What's this? Where is the revenge?

449
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:43,823
I was dumb to believe in such a thing.

450
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:55,935
Oh Ji Na didn't just cheat.

451
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:58,527
Then did she do something else?

452
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:01,741
I saw her by chance and took this video.

453
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:11,561
She's totally drunk. What should we do?

454
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:14,894
- Girls, try to help her.
- Oh, my gosh.

455
00:32:14,894 --> 00:32:17,186
- Ji Na, wake up.
- Is that Ji Na?

456
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:19,219
- That's disappointing.
- That's crazy.

457
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:21,650
I can smell the alcohol from here.

458
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:24,944
- Is that really her?
- I can smell the alcohol.

459
00:32:24,954 --> 00:32:27,658
- Gosh.
- It reeks of alcohol.

460
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:31,482
This deserves to be dealt with harshly.

461
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,852
Suspension or expulsion?

462
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:35,365
Well, of course.

463
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:40,018
Head Teacher, you heard that, right?

464
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:41,571
Also,

465
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:44,203
don't you think a retake is too much?

466
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:47,016
You don't understand how hard my daughter prepared for this test.

467
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:48,848
How can she retake it?

468
00:32:48,848 --> 00:32:50,579
My girl is still in shock.

469
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:52,803
She probably wouldn't do well on a retake.

470
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,795
You're right.

471
00:32:54,795 --> 00:32:58,277
A model student like Su Ji would definitely be

472
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:01,001
stressed in a situation like this—

473
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:02,531
Excuse me, Principal.

474
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,243
I think

475
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,105
you need to see this.

476
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:08,938
- Oh, my gosh.
- Gosh.

477
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:09,960
That is crazy.

478
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,872
Did I ask you to show me your answers?

479
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:15,294
Why did you ruin my cheating?

480
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:17,596
The one involved didn't even say anything.

481
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:21,110
What? So it was Geum Su Ji who cheated?

482
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:24,234
- Why did you ruin my cheating?
- She made her take the blame?

483
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,565
The one involved didn't even say anything.

484
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:27,216
I knew it wasn't her.

485
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,819
- So it was Su Ji.
- She lied.

486
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:33,252
- Why did you ruin my cheating? 
- This is shocking.

487
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:34,745
Why won't this turn off?!

488
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:35,926
She's a piece of trash.

489
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:37,627
- Why are you turning it off?
- Apologize to Ji Na.

490
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:39,489
It's quite entertaining.

491
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,051
This isn't true.

492
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:42,352
It wasn't Ji Na.

493
00:33:42,352 --> 00:33:44,844
I said this isn't true!

494
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:48,048
This isn't real.

495
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:50,269
Why did you ruin my cheating?

496
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:53,352
The one involved didn't even say anything!

497
00:33:53,352 --> 00:33:54,964
Oh, my.

498
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,201
My goodness.

499
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:04,214
We almost punished an innocent student.

500
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:07,406
You saw that, right? We'll deal with it according to school regulations,

501
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:10,760
Mrs. Chairwoman and Mr. Principal.

502
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:15,965
I spoke too harshly out of anger earlier.

503
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:18,037
When you're young,

504
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:20,691
who doesn't cheat at least once?

505
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:24,023
It all becomes a memory and an experience.

506
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:25,976
Don't you think so, Chairwoman?

507
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,127
Right!

508
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:29,970
At that age, they don't know right from wrong.

509
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,311
I will

510
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:33,664
overlook it this time.

511
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:36,076
Don't make a big deal out of this.

512
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,879
You can all go back to your places now.

513
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:43,453
Mr. Principal,

514
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:47,377
why is it so dry and dusty in here?

515
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,921
I think we should put an air purifier in your office.

516
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:54,144
Gosh, it's fine.

517
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:57,337
I need to make sure you're healthy.

518
00:34:57,337 --> 00:34:58,959
You are too kind.

519
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,421
I will excuse myself then.

520
00:35:00,421 --> 00:35:02,102
This way, please.

521
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:03,023
Yes.

522
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:04,484
- Let's head out.
- I will see you again.

523
00:35:04,484 --> 00:35:06,126
Let me know if you need anything.

524
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:08,228
- Take care.
- Bye.

525
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,223
- How about the punishment?
- Hey, come on.

526
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:15,355
What do you mean by punishment?

527
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:18,007
Just go get ready for your class.

528
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:27,867
It wasn't me!

529
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:30,040
You're so shameless.

530
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,742
Shouldn't you apologize to Ji Na?

531
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:33,283
What? Why should I apologize?

532
00:35:33,283 --> 00:35:35,295
You blamed it all on Ji Na.

533
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:37,908
Do you have proof? Tell me if you have any!

534
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:41,051
I do have proof. I took a video just in case.

535
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:43,273
Should I upload it on social media? It'll get hundreds of likes.

536
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:45,865
I said it wasn't me!

537
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:50,941
Follow me. You're dead.

538
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,052
- Mom, please.
- Hey.

539
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:55,755
How can you disgrace me like this?

540
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:57,327
- Gosh.
- It wasn't me, Mom.

541
00:35:57,327 --> 00:35:59,439
Do you know how much money I've spent on you?

542
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,731
- I think I'm going crazy.
- Mom, please.

543
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:02,573
Oh, my goodness.

544
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:13,483
Ji Na, I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

545
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:15,315
I'm sorry for swearing at you through text.

546
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:18,338
- I also apologize.
- I'm sorry.

547
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:21,040
It's okay.

548
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,833
The truth is out now.

549
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:26,396
Ji Na...

550
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:29,369
Do you want to go have tteokbokki with us later?

551
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:32,572
Sure.

552
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,713
- Hey, I look bigger, right?
- Look.

553
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,044
No, you actually gained weight.

554
00:36:55,044 --> 00:36:57,898
I didn't gain weight. I just look bigger.

555
00:36:57,898 --> 00:37:00,250
- Be quiet.
- I didn't get fat.

556
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,652
- What's wrong with you?
- My gosh.

557
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:05,415
Maybe, I really did gain weight.

558
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:07,897
- You did.
- I don't believe this.

559
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:18,948
Your revenge is complete.

560
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,524
What do I do?

561
00:37:37,307 --> 00:37:38,988
Did you...

562
00:37:42,142 --> 00:37:44,874
No, it can't be him.

563
00:37:44,874 --> 00:37:46,466
There's no way.

564
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:49,678
Who could have sent this?

565
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:54,134
- What?
- Isn't that right?

566
00:37:54,134 --> 00:37:55,535
That's not possible.

567
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:57,897
Was this for real?

568
00:37:57,897 --> 00:38:01,030
Master of Revenge Note?

569
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:07,697
[Epilogue]
No one even goes to the gym restroom.

570
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,953
She will pull herself together after a night of self-reflection.

571
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:15,305
- You're right.
- Let's go to the karaoke.

572
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:17,767
- Sure.
- Let's go.

573
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:36,516
She's small but she's so heavy.

574
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:39,058
I shouldn't have gotten involved with her.

575
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,344
Ji Na.

576
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:56,946
What are you doing here?
