2
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:04,133
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:32,792
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:44,775
Thanks.

5
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:47,687
Aren't you thirsty? I'll get us some drinks.

6
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:31,051
What happened? Your clothes are wet.

7
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,193
The fountain suddenly went off.

8
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,054
I see.

9
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,640
She's uglier than me.

10
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
She gets on my nerves.

11
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,560
This is me and my eonni.

12
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,685
Please rate our looks and tell us who's prettier.

13
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,755
So if you want us to rate your looks,

14
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:28,777
please send us your picture now.

15
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,034
I'm home.

16
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:45,074
Hey, Oh Sa Na, open the door.

17
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:49,468
What is she even doing in there?

18
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:52,511
Gosh, puberty really hit her hard.

19
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,435
This person says, "The eonni looks better.

20
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:06,957
"This one's a close one."

21
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,590
This comment says that "The dongsaeng* has
(* younger sibling)

22
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,771
a wide nose."

23
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,805
"She looks like the frog from Spirited Away."

24
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,066
Everyone,

25
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:19,368
comment "one" to vote for the eonni on the left

26
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:21,431
and "two" for the dongsaeng on the right.

27
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,584
Vote now.

28
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,866
- One, one, one, two...
- One, two, two...

29
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,877
I see a lot of ones.

30
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:30,129
People have the same taste.

31
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,782
Why did you leave a "666"? Are you kidding me?

32
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:35,704
Only leave ones or twos, okay?

33
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,111
You look like the frog from Spirited Away.

34
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,893
The dongsaeng has a wide nose.

35
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:46,006
The eonni wins. The dongsaeng isn't ugly,

36
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,326
but her nose is huge.

37
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:50,919
The dongsaeng needs to clip that nose with a clothespin.

38
00:04:58,568 --> 00:04:59,669
Hi.

39
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:02,241
You must be a bit startled, getting a message from a random person.

40
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:05,515
I saw the stream and messaged you because you reminded me of myself.

41
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:09,980
I used to get stressed out because of my face and nose, too.

42
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,971
It felt like everyone was looking at my nose.

43
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:13,333
I know.

44
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,644
After much thought, I decided to get a nose job,

45
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:17,256
and it turned out great.

46
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:20,340
Changing your nose makes your face look so much prettier.

47
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,243
After consulting with Lead Consultant Jang Mi In at Hidden Plastic Surgery,

48
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:25,345
all my troubles were solved.

49
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:27,578
She really understood the troubles of young students

50
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,419
and even gave a special student discount.

51
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,384
Jang Mi In's phone number is 010-1234-1234.

52
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:37,717
I hope you can become confident and happy, too.

53
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,760
010-1234-1234

54
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:50,109
Mom, I want to ask you something.

55
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:55,025
If I could fix one part of my face, which part would it be?

56
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,585
- One part?
- Yes.

57
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:58,286
One part.

58
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,012
Your mentality.

59
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:05,165
What kind of student doesn't study and talks about plastic surgery?

60
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,578
Gosh, Mom. Look at my nose.

61
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,520
- It's so ugly.
- What?

62
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,463
You have a lucky nose. It'll bring you good fortune.

63
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:18,317
What do you mean, lucky nose? I'm so annoyed!

64
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:21,330
What has gotten into her?

65
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:24,555
Oh Sa Na.

66
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:26,815
Hey.

67
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,019
Yu Na.

68
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,913
What's with you? How come you got so pretty?

69
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,754
I got my eyes done a bit.

70
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:36,105
Really?

71
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,628
You can't tell at all. That's great.

72
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:41,891
It's the trend to get subtle work done.

73
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:44,283
I have to go to the music room. Text me later.

74
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,506
Okay, see you later.

75
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:51,111
Are you close to her?

76
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,673
Yes, why?

77
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:55,924
Does she have a boyfriend?

78
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,146
Probably not.

79
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,989
Then can you introduce me to her?

80
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,482
- To her?
- Yes.

81
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:06,185
She's pretty.

82
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:08,949
Come on. You can't?

83
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:09,980
Well...

84
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,270
Daemin strawberry milk

85
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,892
I love you

86
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,663
These are my feelings for you.

87
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:16,445
It's not that I can't.

88
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:19,468
Ask her and let me know right away.

89
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,544
You confessed your love to me just the other day.

90
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,956
That jerk.

91
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:29,939
But is Yu Na really prettier than me?

92
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,761
I swear she was uglier than me.

93
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:42,281
If I could also get plastic surgery...

94
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:50,529
Do you really think that would fix your wrinkles and cheeks?

95
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:55,714
I loved looking in the mirror when I was younger,

96
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:59,780
but now I hate it.

97
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,923
If the laws of gravity start to apply to your face, it means you're middle-aged.

98
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,906
What do you mean, middle-aged?

99
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,798
I'm not even married yet.

100
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:10,449
No way. I won't believe it.

101
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,222
You need to face the facts.

102
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:15,816
If there's anyone here who has a baby face, it's me.

103
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:20,551
Last time, Mr. Park thought you were the older sister.

104
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:22,773
You think you're so funny, don't you?

105
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:24,964
When you were in your 20s,

106
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,307
your nickname was Mrs. Anseong.

107
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:31,290
- You looked like a middle-aged woman.
- Who are you to be talking about looks?

108
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,583
Shall I reveal the pictures you took before you got your eyes and nose done?

109
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,626
You looked like a female Moon Hee Jun*.(*Korean pop rock singer-songwriter born in 1978)

110
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:39,378
You said you wouldn't talk about that!

111
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:40,419
You're so mean!

112
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,112
- Moon Hee Jun.
- Mrs. Anseong!

113
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,084
- Moon Hee Jun.
- Mrs. Anseong!

114
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,834
You got a text.

115
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:51,120
Oh, my.

116
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,624
I got lost in Paris.

117
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:56,916
Oh, no. What are you going to do? Sad face.

118
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,169
Where were you going? Sad face.

119
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,982
On my way to you.

120
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:03,762
Oh, my gosh.

121
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:08,277
- Do you like him that much?
- I do.

122
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:09,248
I like him a lot.

123
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,781
When are you seeing him again?

124
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:13,522
In two weeks.

125
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,417
I should tighten up my face, right?

126
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:22,231
Forget everything else. Just make sure I look younger.

127
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,804
Tighten everything up, okay?

128
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:43,544
Let's eat. What about Sa Na?

129
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:47,276
I don't know. She said she's dieting.

130
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,100
Your skin actually looks a bit tighter.

131
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,155
I know, right? Don't I look like I'm in my 20s?

132
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:56,937
It's so true that girls need to doll up.

133
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:59,698
Now, you're just being silly. Eat up.

134
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,268
Aunt.

135
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,353
What?

136
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:16,284
Is there a hole in your chin?

137
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:17,846
It's leaking.

138
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,031
Things haven't gotten into place yet.

139
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:24,214
It's only the first day.

140
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:25,575
You're scaring me.

141
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:28,156
- Is it still leaking?
- Yes.

142
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:34,394
Hey, isn't she from our school?

143
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:37,077
She is. Isn't she the girl from Class One?

144
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:39,158
These comments are either love or hate.

145
00:10:39,158 --> 00:10:41,751
- This person says she's cute.
- Don't fall for it.

146
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:44,513
- That kind of girl is cute. Not bad.
- It's a no for me.

147
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,987
- I'd be embarrassed being with her.
- I'm not sure. She's cute but tacky.

148
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:49,258
Take down my girlfriend's picture.

149
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,247
This is pretty funny. Let's leave a comment.

150
00:10:57,247 --> 00:11:00,920
She's from our school. Should I try hitting on her?

151
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,320
What's with that guy?

152
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,342
Why did he delete my comment?

153
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:19,389
Who would upload my picture on here?

154
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,411
You weren't the one who uploaded this, right?

155
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:23,924
Of course, not.

156
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:25,526
I can't believe this.

157
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,127
For now,

158
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,188
I'll try to delete what I can.

159
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,151
I'll also try to find who uploaded it.

160
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,033
Thanks for always helping me out.

161
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:36,875
No problem. I'm glad I saw this early on.

162
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:49,670
I'm looking for Lead Consultant, Jang Mi In.

163
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,091
Take a seat, and we'll be right with you.

164
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,572
All right.

165
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,235
Go from heartbroken to a heartbreaker

166
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:20,790
Before - After

167
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,118
Get it together.

168
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,033
Hidden Plastic Surgery Client Form

169
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:39,869
You have a pretty face shape

170
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:43,403
and pretty eyes. How lovely.

171
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:46,716
But

172
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:51,070
if we put in a little bit of work, you would be perfect.

173
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,234
- Really?
- You don't like your nose, do you?

174
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:57,076
How did you know?

175
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,937
Hold this up.

176
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:04,764
I'm going to slightly lift the end of your nose over here.

177
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:06,205
And if we

178
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:09,349
slightly reduce your nostrils over here,

179
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:13,634
your face will look slimmer and your chin will look smaller.

180
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:14,674
Gosh.

181
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,317
You're going to become so perfect.

182
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,939
Really?

183
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,832
Look over here.

184
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:30,820
This was my nose.

185
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,391
What?

186
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:38,158
Really?

187
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:40,149
All I did was fix my nose,

188
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:43,122
but it looks like I fixed my entire face.

189
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,685
It really brings out my features.

190
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,638
It does.

191
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:50,079
But the thing is

192
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,450
I read on the Internet

193
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,513
that I shouldn't get plastic surgery when I'm still growing.

194
00:13:56,797 --> 00:14:00,099
I think that's the funniest thing people say.

195
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:03,492
There are so many middle school students who get work done.

196
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:05,565
They're worried that everyone would get plastic surgery,

197
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:09,068
so they just tell them to get it when they're older.

198
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:12,962
I guess there are kids who really believe that.

199
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,004
Oh, I see.

200
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:18,398
You need to get plastic surgery while you're young.

201
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:20,910
That way, people won't know that you did it.

202
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,924
If you really want to meet a nice guy,

203
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:26,415
you need to be pretty starting at a young age.

204
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:31,081
That's right. If I want to be with Je Yi, I need to become prettier.

205
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,212
On top of that,

206
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:35,335
Sa Na, you're in luck today.

207
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:38,438
If you prepay for your surgery today,

208
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:40,691
with the youth discount

209
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:44,083
and the cash discount...

210
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,226
I don't do this just for anyone,

211
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,908
but with the 50 percent discount

212
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,841
including employee family discount,

213
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:55,606
it's exactly a million won (about $900).

214
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:59,208
There's no other opportunity like this.

215
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,620
It's your last chance.

216
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:06,255
All right, then go home today

217
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:08,287
and convince your mom.

218
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,501
All right.

219
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:13,003
Jang Mi In

220
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:30,871
You need to get plastic surgery while you're young.

221
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:33,212
That way, people won't know that you did it.

222
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:36,315
If you really want to meet a nice guy,

223
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:39,247
you need to be pretty starting at a young age.

224
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:49,009
There's no other opportunity like this.

225
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:51,361
It's your last chance.

226
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:55,505
- It's 1,000 won (about $9)...
- Mom,

227
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,968
your youngest daughter has a wish.

228
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:02,822
My daughter, my wish is to not grant your wish.

229
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,517
Mom, look.

230
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:09,979
- What?
- Come on.

231
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:15,435
If I get a little bit of work done, I would become so pretty, wouldn't I?

232
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:17,236
Look at you spewing out this crap.

233
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:19,690
How can a middle school student get plastic surgery?

234
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,923
Mom, don't you know about early plastic surgery?

235
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:25,985
I need to get it done early in order to marry a nice guy.

236
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,467
Early plastic surgery? My goodness.

237
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,330
You need to study hard

238
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,833
and become a talented woman instead.

239
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,545
That hurts.

240
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:39,328
Then lend me some money for the surgery.

241
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:41,461
I'll get a part-time job to pay you back.

242
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:43,944
You want me to lend you some money?

243
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:47,677
Make your own money and do whatever you want with it.

244
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:50,489
Hello. The bank was close by, wasn't it?

245
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:51,911
Yes, it was right there.

246
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,223
Yes.

247
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,625
Thank you very much.

248
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,931
It's the correct amount.

249
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:04,603
Let me get you a receipt.

250
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:11,430
You've made the right choice.

251
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,592
This house is very nice.

252
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,276
Take the money.

253
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:29,179
You can get surgery and become prettier.

254
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,542
No way. That's stealing.

255
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,164
It's fine. You're just borrowing it.

256
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:38,939
Have you thought about how mad Mom would be if that money went missing?

257
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:42,701
No, Mom would be even happier if you become prettier.

258
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:08,348
It's your last chance.

259
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:18,268
While searching,

260
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:21,121
I found out it was first uploaded on a face-rating stream.

261
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:25,965
A face-rating stream where they rate people's looks?

262
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:28,338
Who uploaded my picture there?

263
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,121
Sa Na did.

264
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:35,285
- Oh Sa Na?
- The IP location was your house,

265
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:37,828
and it was Sa Na's username.

266
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:40,590
I am not going to let her get away with this.

267
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:46,565
Yes, Mom?

268
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:48,148
Sa Na?

269
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:50,240
I didn't get a call from her.

270
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,095
What? Sa Na stole your money and ran away?

271
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:58,619
I'll go look for her. Bye.

272
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,879
She must have lost her mind.

273
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:05,644
I'm going nuts. Why isn't she answering?

274
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,830
That little wench.

275
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,263
What do you want?

276
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:16,286
I saw Sa Na earlier.

277
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:19,930
She ran off with a very serious face. Did something happen to her?

278
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,752
There was clearly something wrong with her, and you just let her go?

279
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:25,004
She just sped off. But what's wrong—

280
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:26,336
Forget it!

281
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:29,679
Gosh, how could you be so useless?

282
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,823
She's always causing trouble. Who does she take after?

283
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:35,935
- Wait a minute.
- Goodness.

284
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:38,559
Sa Na has been causing trouble?

285
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,891
Mind your own business.

286
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:44,143
Gosh, we're not total strangers—

287
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,545
Not total strangers? Is that what you said?

288
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:51,139
We actually are total strangers. Don't get it twisted!

289
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,218
Actually, Sa Na did say

290
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:02,211
that she was going to Hidden Plastic Surgery in Apgujeong-dong.

291
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:05,764
Ji Na, don't tell her I told you, okay?

292
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:12,342
Hey, Oh Sa Na, have you lost your mind? You're stealing Mom's money now?

293
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:14,495
Let go of me. This has nothing to do with you.

294
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:16,096
Je Yi, grab her.

295
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:18,267
Why did you bring Oppa Je Yi with you?

296
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,059
I brought him to come get you.

297
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,732
Where's the money? Hand it over.

298
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,505
- I don't have it.
- Hand it over now!

299
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:26,626
I'm not lying!

300
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,767
I wired it to the clinic already.

301
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,541
Go get a refund right now.

302
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:35,074
No, I'm going to get plastic surgery.

303
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:36,546
Let go of me!

304
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:39,077
- Je Yi, get her in the elevator.
- Okay.

305
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:45,725
Hurry up.

306
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:48,018
Welcome.

307
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:51,221
She paid for a surgery,

308
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,813
but we would like to get a refund.

309
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,834
It should be under Oh Sa Na.

310
00:20:58,068 --> 00:21:01,471
Nothing was paid under the name Oh Sa Na.

311
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:03,092
What?

312
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:08,858
I wired the money to Lead Consultant Jang Mi In.

313
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:11,571
Lead Consultant Jang Mi In quit.

314
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:14,234
What are you talking about?

315
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,635
It happened again?

316
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:18,387
How many times has this happened?

317
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,220
How much did you send?

318
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,443
I sent a million won.

319
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:27,877
You didn't find it suspicious that she asked you

320
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:30,038
to send it to her personal bank account?

321
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,123
She said I would get

322
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:36,144
a 50 percent discount if I sent it quickly.

323
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:41,100
Would we be able to find Jang Mi In?

324
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,742
We need to get that money back.

325
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:45,394
We are also trying our best to find her.

326
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:48,457
She conned our patients and ruined our reputation.

327
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,650
She even stole our medicine.

328
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,322
We've already reported it to the police.

329
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:55,664
I suggest you do so, too.

330
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,888
What are you going to do about this?

331
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:11,380
What are you going to do if we can't get that money back?

332
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,255
A million won is a huge amount of money. How could you do that?

333
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,947
Do you know how much struggle Mom went through?

334
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:21,850
Do you know? Do you?

335
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:33,843
I...

336
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:37,166
don't have anything I'm good at.

337
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,119
I was a child model back then,

338
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:43,973
but now, no one even tells me I'm pretty.

339
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:46,577
I feel pathetic and anxious.

340
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:50,869
I thought I would be more confident if I became prettier.

341
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:58,308
You don't know how pretty you are.

342
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:06,357
To me, you're the prettiest girl in the world.

343
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:08,659
Eonni!

344
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:10,589
Sa Na.

345
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:15,584
- Please take one.
- Thanks.

346
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:26,125
You're pretty to me too, Sa Na.

347
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:49,460
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Enter target's name

348
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,871
If you prepay for your surgery by today...

349
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:55,525
It's a million won.

350
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:57,176
Jang Mi In

351
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:59,198
Target meets all conditions
We will proceed with the revenge

352
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:06,495
I hope...

353
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:09,798
Revenge Note will help me again this time.

354
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,878
You've been selected as a revenge target

355
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,560
What's this?

356
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:29,439
Could you get your hands off me?

357
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,542
Gosh, what is this?

358
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:45,895
Oh, my gosh.

359
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:48,748
What is this?

360
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:54,224
I did a quick dine and dash this time as well.

361
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:56,326
If you get caught in my trap,

362
00:24:56,326 --> 00:25:00,149
there's absolutely no way you can escape.

363
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:02,773
Nowadays, middle and high school students

364
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:05,515
are all crazy about getting plastic surgery.

365
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:08,889
The money is actually quite good.

366
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:11,431
Anyway, I'm going to take this opportunity

367
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:15,665
to completely change my face and start all over again.

368
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:17,227
Miss Jang Mi In.

369
00:25:17,227 --> 00:25:19,458
Yes! I'll talk to you later.

370
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,760
I'm going to be reborn now.

371
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:44,093
My hair!

372
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:47,796
My hair! Where's my hair?

373
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,811
I came here to get plastic surgery.

374
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:55,885
Why is all of my hair gone?

375
00:25:56,977 --> 00:25:59,169
It says Balding Surgery right here.

376
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:00,810
Balding Surgery

377
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,675
You agreed to shave your entire head.

378
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,375
Shaving entire head

379
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:08,989
Gosh,

380
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:12,932
you guys make me so angry!

381
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:16,036
Ms. Jang Mi In?

382
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:17,808
- Yes.
- That's you, right?

383
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:20,439
- Yes.
- We're from Gangnam Police Station.

384
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:23,293
I'm arresting you on suspicion of fraud, embezzlement and theft.

385
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:26,116
Ms. Jang Mi In, you have the right to call a lawyer

386
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:30,790
and the right to report unlawful detention.

387
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,392
Take her away.

388
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,906
No, you can't do this.

389
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:38,729
Why are you doing this?

390
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:41,021
A woman in her 30s, who ran off with people's deposit money

391
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:43,693
after offering plastic surgery at a low cost,

392
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,465
was arrested today on charge of fraud.

393
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:49,949
Jang, who worked as the lead consultant at a plastic surgery clinic in Gangnam,

394
00:26:49,949 --> 00:26:52,772
recruited patients through social media,

395
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:56,265
offering them plastic surgery at a low cost.

396
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:58,768
She is charged for stealing the deposit money.

397
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:01,482
During her arrest, Jang claimed that she was the victim,

398
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,823
saying that her head was shaved

399
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,836
- It serves her right.
- during a rhinoplasty.

400
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:08,878
I saw an article that said she embezzled

401
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,710
billions of won.

402
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,444
Who falls for that stuff?

403
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:17,847
What do you mean? Someone in our household did.

404
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,433
At least she got caught quickly and we were able to get our money back.

405
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:29,488
Sa Na, if we lost that money, you would've been kicked out right away.

406
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:31,841
From now on, you are not allowed

407
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:33,703
to put on makeup or go out.

408
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:37,056
You're not getting any allowance either. Got it?

409
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,918
- Yes.
- That's right.

410
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,259
You need to think about what you did.

411
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,521
Your revenge is complete

412
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:39,568
A gift for you.

413
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:44,244
A gift?

414
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:57,367
- That's right.
- Hurry.

415
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,700
All right, keep it up.

416
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,121
- Come on. More!
- Nice.

417
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:02,752
If it falls, you're out.

418
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:05,585
Let's have a round of applause! Congratulations!

419
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:08,128
My younger sister still uses a 2G phone

420
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:10,590
and she has been wanting a smartphone,

421
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,312
so I'm happy to win this.

422
00:29:14,263 --> 00:29:18,938
I got this from an event with Je Yi when we went to the amusement park.

423
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:25,064
Je Yi put in a lot of effort trying to get you this.

424
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:28,047
Make sure to thank Je Yi later on, okay?

425
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,134
Thanks.

426
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:48,749
While I was crying,

427
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:50,880
Oppa Je Yi told me

428
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:55,775
that I was the prettiest girl in the world.

429
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:58,458
You're pretty to me too, Sa Na.

430
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,734
But I couldn't say anything back.

431
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:16,737
Eonni, sorry and thank you.

432
00:30:16,737 --> 00:30:21,911
I'll give up my first love, Oppa Je Yi, for you.

433
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:24,272
Have a good relationship.

434
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:29,209
Bye, Oppa Je Yi.

435
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:31,151
This is where we end.

436
00:30:35,506 --> 00:30:39,428
Are you sure you want to delete this file?

437
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:46,145
Yes.

438
00:30:57,067 --> 00:31:01,180
This is how my first love came to an end.

439
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,060
Get out of the way!

440
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:37,617
Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?

441
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:52,471
My second love has begun.

442
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,394
[Epilogue]

443
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:05,010
My mom made kimchi today and told me to bring you some.

444
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,280
Again?

445
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:09,708
She really doesn't have to go through this trouble every time.

446
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:10,821
Oh, right!

447
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:14,980
We actually have a lot of fruit. Come and take some.

448
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,556
Come wait inside.

449
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:35,300
Men and women are different.

450
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,856
I was just taught this way.

451
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,391
Is that so?

452
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,300
You're smart.

453
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:58,260
Ji Na has something to ask you.

454
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,390
She wants to see you for a moment.

455
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,110
Really?

456
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:05,970
Wait right here, Sa Na. I'll be back.

457
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,710
Just in case bugs get in.

458
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,500
I don't like bugs.
