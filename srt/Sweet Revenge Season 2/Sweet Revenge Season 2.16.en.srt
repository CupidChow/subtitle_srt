~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:04,073
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:32,992
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,957
Nice going.

5
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,153
What were they doing to be caught for  indecent relations?

6
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:44,744
Notice of Disciplinary Action

7
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,277
Seo blank blank? Who could it be?

8
00:00:47,277 --> 00:00:50,399
Isn't it obvious? It's Seo Je Yi and Baek Song Yi.

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,893
They were rumored to be dating and the pieces fit the puzzle.

10
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:56,336
Seo Je Yi? The one who's ranked first in school?

11
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:59,519
Yes. The top rank can date, too.

12
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,592
- Let's go.
- Okay.

13
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,127
Did you hear that?

14
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:10,529
They're saying it's Je Yi.

15
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,243
It can't be. Je Yi wouldn't do that.

16
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:14,873
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:17,286
They got caught by the principal when he was on patrol.

18
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:21,359
They're saying the principal is planning to give them the worst punishment.

19
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,390
Look, it's Seo Je Yi.

20
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:31,851
Seo Je Yi, you really got yourself in some deep trouble this time.

21
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:34,284
You pretended to be so well-behaved.

22
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,960
You're so two-faced.

23
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,458
He still thinks he's all that.

24
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,601
How annoying.

25
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:06,146
What happened with Je Yi?

26
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:08,187
You're believing those false rumors, too?

27
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:10,190
I'm not believing them. It's just strange.

28
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,911
It's definitely a misunderstanding.

29
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:14,370
He would never do such a thing.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,823
Ji Na.

31
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,326
Ji Na.

32
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:20,800
You haven't eaten lunch yet, right?

33
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,112
Eat this.

34
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,626
Thanks.

35
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:36,645
So what happened?

36
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:40,270
I don't know. I'm not sure what happened either.

37
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,432
I stayed behind because Song Yi had to tell me something,

38
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:45,685
but the lights suddenly turned off and the teachers came in.

39
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,597
Then...

40
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:50,359
What about the rumors of you dating Song Yi?

41
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:51,890
They're not true at all.

42
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,174
I really don't know why those rumors are spreading.

43
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,948
You're so stupid.

44
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:04,623
I think Song Yi's the most suspicious one.

45
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:07,526
- You're suspicious of Song Yi?
- Why?

46
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,729
She made you stay behind.

47
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,802
Everyone knows that

48
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:16,174
the teachers go on patrol during that time.

49
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:17,837
Are you sure she didn't do it on purpose?

50
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:20,219
No way. Why would Song Yi do that?

51
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,301
I wouldn't know that either.

52
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:24,273
But she's the most suspicious to me.

53
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:28,527
Are you sure she wasn't the one spreading the dating rumors?

54
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,274
Make sure you get it done,

55
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:56,746
or else,

56
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,288
I have lots of pretty pictures of you on my phone.

57
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:02,130
Wouldn't it be embarrassing if I leaked them?

58
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,268
Wouldn't it be embarrassing if I leaked them?

59
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,529
Do the students come to school to study

60
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,811
or to date around?

61
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,075
All this is happening

62
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,516
because the teachers keep spoiling their students!

63
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:31,119
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:34,072
Come in!

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,931
You.

66
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,995
How did your parents raise you?

67
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:49,958
How could you possibly date at a sacred place like school?

68
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,402
What's the use of getting good grades

69
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,613
when you're not even civil?

70
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,614
- Teacher Jeong.
- Yes?

71
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:57,617
I really didn't do anything wrong.

72
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,760
I didn't know Je Yi would do that to me.

73
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,571
Don't cry. Speak slowly.

74
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,843
- Song Yi...
- Je Yi said he had to tell me something,

75
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:06,225
- so he made me stay behind.
- You know that's not true.

76
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,197
- Hurry and tell the truth.
- You have

77
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:11,771
no excuse. Be quiet.

78
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,673
Continue.

79
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,508
Je Yi wouldn't let me go, saying he had to tell me something.

80
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:21,731
Then the lights turned off, and he tried to hug me.

81
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:24,362
I tried to get him away from me.

82
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,375
This is so unfair.

83
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:29,649
Wait a minute, Song Yi.

84
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,321
Why are doing this? Why are you lying?

85
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:35,253
Let's step outside for a moment.

86
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,673
I've never seen someone so shameless.

87
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:46,215
What kind of ridiculous situation is this?

88
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:50,679
How could you act that way in school?

89
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,963
I can't believe I was about to give you the Hanjong Scholarship.

90
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:55,054
I never did such a thing.

91
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:56,325
Then,

92
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:58,789
are you saying all of that was a lie?

93
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,129
Why would she lie about that?

94
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,731
I don't know either,

95
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:04,094
but I really didn't do it. This is unfair.

96
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:07,016
The fact that you're even involved in something like this

97
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:09,168
makes you unqualified.

98
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:10,139
Forget the scholarship.

99
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,362
You need to go see the School Violence Countermeasure Committee.

100
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:15,554
What?

101
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:18,147
Seo Je Yi is going to the School Violence Countermeasure Committee.

102
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:21,620
Why? What happened?

103
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:24,845
Je Yi and Song Yi secretly met up,

104
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,946
but they got caught by the teachers.

105
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,870
Oh, my gosh. I'm so disappointed in Je Yi.

106
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,803
I know, right? Who knew Seo Je Yi would do something like that?

107
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,414
Stop!

108
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,147
Don't spread false rumors when you don't even know anything.

109
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:40,819
What do you know then?

110
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,702
People like him are nastier behind the scenes.

111
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:46,255
Do you think the teachers would do that for no reason?

112
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:47,567
It's Ro Bin.

113
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,578
Where?

114
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,732
Aish!

115
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,944
Does this mean

116
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,888
Je Yi is in danger?

117
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,449
What should I do?

118
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,060
Gosh.

119
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:31,531
Je Yi wouldn't let me go, saying he had to tell me something.

120
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:34,624
Then the lights turned off, and he tried to hug me.

121
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:37,285
I tried to get him away from me.

122

You are invited to an open chat. Click the link to join.

123
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,862
You haven't gone on lots of dates, right? Your life will be ruined if you date now.

124
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,892
The ace's life is ruined. This must be a dream.

125
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,231
I want you to smile like them.

126
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,804
Okay, thanks.

127
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:08,357
These are cute. Did you draw them yourself?

128
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,878
Of course.

129
00:10:09,878 --> 00:10:13,131
If you look closely, they're all smiling differently.

130
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:14,963
Oh, right.

131
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,736
Here.

132
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:20,260
These are the notes from Teacher Maeng's Math lecture.

133
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,641
I wrote down the important points.

134
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,157
I'll get going then.

135
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:38,907
Je Yi,

136
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:41,080
I believe in you.

137
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,523
So hang in there. Fighting*!
(Korean expression meaning "good luck", "do your best")

138
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,503
What if this really was all planned by Song Yi?

139
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:06,926
If that's the case,

140
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:09,838
why did Song Yi lie?

141
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,283
Song Yi is a victim, too.

142
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,208
I did everything you told me to do.

143
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:23,673
Je Yi is going to the School Violence Countermeasure Committee

144
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,965
because of my lie.

145
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:32,251
You really deleted all of my pictures, right?

146
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:35,263
How could you do this to me?!

147
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:39,539
Is this why you dated me in the first place?

148
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:43,813
Okay.

149
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,485
I won't tell anyone.

150
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,029
So you keep your promise, too.

151
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:55,705
What was that all about?

152
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,008
You...

153
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,502
You lied?

154
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:04,765
Who made you lie?

155
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,705
What are you talking about?

156
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,458
- Who said I lied?
- You just said that Je Yi is going to

157
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,730
the School Violence Countermeasure Committee because of your lie.

158
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:15,404
Who is it? Who made you lie?

159
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:17,136
Let go of me!

160
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,018
Leave me alone!

161
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,692
It's hard for me, too.

162
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,193
I knew it. I totally called it.

163
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:36,004
Seo Je Yi wouldn't do something like that.

164
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:38,877
You were so sure about it before.

165
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,889
Why is she even here?

166
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:45,673
Hey! Are we strangers? We're all students at Hanjong High.

167
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:48,417
Is that even important? Je Yi's life depends on this.

168
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:51,780
That's right. Bo Ra is going to help us.

169
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:57,936
From what I heard, Song Yi had no choice but to do it.

170
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:01,441
I think her boyfriend made her do it.

171
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,591
Really?

172
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,894
I never heard that Song Yi had a boyfriend.

173
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:06,535
Dating is banned.

174
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,098
They probably dated in secret.

175
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,288
You think so?

176
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,771
Then should we do some searching to see if she has a boyfriend?

177
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,844
Even if they kept it a secret, I'm sure there will be traces somewhere.

178
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,701
Did you find anything?

179
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:33,653
No.

180
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,122
I think I found something.

181
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,940
What's this? It's just a selfie.

182
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,291
Look closely.

183
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,502
If you zoom in...

184
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,850
That's amazing. How did you find this?

185
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,790
This is...

186
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:05,194
It's the jerk I saw at the store a while ago.

187
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:08,957
You're right. It's Jae Su, Lee Jae Su.

188
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:10,679
He's in the same class as Je Yi.

189
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:15,314
Let's do a cross-check to see if he's really her boyfriend.

190
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:27,595
Look at this. They're totally dating.

191
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:30,029
But if he's her boyfriend,

192
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,291
why would he make her do such a thing?

193
00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:36,305
I know, right?

194
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:40,388
Wait.

195
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:44,194
SJY GSLD, SJY KCJML, SJY ODO SKY

196
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:48,678
What's this?

197
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:50,599
What does this mean?

198
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,612
S, J, Y,

199
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:57,065
G, S, L, D?

200
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,490
I got it.

201
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,634
S J Y is

202
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,786
Seo Je Yi.

203
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:21,119
G, S, L, D...

204
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,001
It means he's annoying.

205
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:28,847
You're right. Then...

206
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,471
S, J, Y,

207
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:34,282
I, D, E...

208
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,846
Seo Je Yi.

209
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:39,649
the first rank is mine?

210
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:40,881
I'm getting the chills.

211
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:43,212
I think this punk targeted Je Yi and set up a trap

212
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:45,035
so he could rank first.

213
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:46,255
That's right.

214
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,877
He used Song Yi, too.

215
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,700
Seo Je Yi is such an idiot.

216
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,413
How could he get fooled by this guy?

217
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:09,338
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

218
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,380
I did everything you told me to do.

219
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,584
Then the lights turned off, and he tried to hug me.

220
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:16,005
I tried to get him away from me.

221
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:18,068
Enter target's name

222
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:21,090
Je Yi is going to the School Violence Countermeasure Committee because of my lie.

223
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,852
Expulsion would be better.

224
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:25,364
Lee Jae Su

225
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,116
Target meets all conditions. We will proceed with the revenge

226
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,718
Please...

227
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:32,020
Please help Je Yi.

228
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,140
You have been selected as a revenge target

229
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:46,154
What the heck is this?

230
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:58,287
Congratulations, you've been selected. Click the link to collect the prize

231
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:04,013
What's this? Why is it doing this?

232
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:06,636
Why isn't it turning off?

233
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:08,667
- What is it?
- What's going on?

234
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,690
- How gross.
- You pervert!

235
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,213
- What are you doing?
- What the heck? You're disgusting.

236
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:15,595
Be quiet!

237
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:17,747
Why is it so loud in here?

238
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,149
What's that sound?

239
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,912
You...

240
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:24,053
What the heck is this?

241
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,985
Hey, are you crazy?

242
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:28,938
You should be studying, not watching porn.

243
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:30,039
Come with me.

244
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,232
I didn't do this. It automatically...

245
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:34,863
It won't turn off no matter what I do.

246
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:36,717
What? It does turn off.

247
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:39,789
Follow me. You've crossed the line.

248
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:42,261
Everyone else can continue studying.

249
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,103
Don't worry about this. Come here.

250
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:54,633
Je Yi, why did you want to see me?

251
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,597
Here.

252
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,853
Why are you giving it back? Are you done studying?

253
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:04,083
I am.

254
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,246
I added some notes from the other classes.

255
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:11,651
We were supposed to study together, but we couldn't really do it.

256
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:13,902
Read through it before the exam.

257
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:23,282
My gosh. When did you do all this?

258
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:26,486
Thanks, Je Yi. I won't have to worry about the exam this time.

259
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:31,381
Je Yi, don't you worry about a thing either. It'll all work out.

260
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,210
Just trust me.

261
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:36,915
Okay, I'll trust you.

262
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:47,877
I can't believe I got sick right before the exam.

263
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,038
I'm so unlucky.

264
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,365
Gosh.

265
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:58,697
Good luck, Class One. P.S. If you do well, I'll buy you pizza

266
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,412
The equation is...

267
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:04,493
Come on.

268
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:13,152
You didn't wash your hair today either?

269
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,236
Yes. I'm not washing my hair until the exam is over.

270
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:19,079
You didn't wash your hair for the midterm and you still did poorly.

271
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,171
Oh, I was able to get that score because I didn't wash it.

272
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:26,776
- It's so itchy.
- You're so disgusting.

273
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:29,840
Don't come near me. Your dandruff will be all over my desk.

274
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,652
Nuna Mina, please give me energy.

275
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,137
Nuna Seolhyun, I'll be able to do well this time, right?

276
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:40,368
Give me energy too, nuna Jimin*.
(Like Mina and Seolhyun, Jimin is a member of AOA girl group)

277
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:42,621
Na Na Ri, what are you eating?

278
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:46,024
If I don't eat it, I won't remember it.

279
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:49,948
For the third person singular form,

280
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:52,841
you write this participle here.

281
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:56,635
In this case, this is the participle.

282
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:59,297
Got it.

283
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:01,661
Then you take this out.

284
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:09,748
- Attention.
- I'm doomed.

285
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:13,773
Those who are thinking about cheating, preparing to cheat,

286
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:16,145
and are ready to cheat,

287
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,179
try it if you dare.

288
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,869
You know that students with the flu take their tests in a separate room, right?

289
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:44,743
Shouldn't you be able to maintain your health? How did this happen?

290
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,397
Let's finish this test as fast as you're trying to get rid of this cold.

291
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,699
Good luck!

292
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,072
I can't hear anything!

293
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:05,013
You're the one who's being loud.

294
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,115
You're so annoying.

295
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:10,078
Look who's talking.

296
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,736
I totally failed this test because of you.

297
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:32,031
Don't blame me for anything. You're the one who didn't study.

298
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:34,804
I'm totally going to bomb this test.

299
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:37,085
You're so annoying.

300
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:38,958
You're more annoying.

301
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,630
The answer to number three was one.

302
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,033
The answer to number four was three.

303
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,815
Was number four's answer is really three?

304
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:48,618
I can't believe it. I got it right!

305
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:52,571
Let's move on to number five. The answer to number five is...

306
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:55,053
I'm not sure if this is right, but three.

307
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:57,116
- I got everything wrong.
- I can't believe it.

308
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,989
I got that one right, too! What's going on?

309
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:00,880
It looks like someone did well.

310
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,882
I think I did well on this one.

311
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:05,905
It's all thanks to Je Yi's notes.

312
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,036
Thanks, Je Yi.

313
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,399
I got this one right!

314
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:13,002
It's usually the long answers that are the right answers.

315
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:14,754
It's thanks to you, Nuna Mina.

316
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:16,445
Thank you.

317
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:20,059
- I guessed on this but got it right!
- Good job.

318
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:26,035
I'm Lee Jae Su, a freshman in class two.

319
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:29,048
Welcome. I'm Bang Se In of the school's media club.

320
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,562
I heard you're getting the Hanjong Scholarship. Congratulations.

321
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:34,565
- Thank you.
- We normally do the interview

322
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:37,816
after you receive it, but the principal was sure it's you.

323
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes, Teacher?

324
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,623
I'll bring them to you.

325
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:47,186
- Just wait in there for a bit.
- Okay.

326
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,509
On Air

327
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:53,061
This one looks super hard.

328
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:56,505
My mom might faint out of shock after seeing my score.

329
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:57,798
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

330
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:00,790
- I need to do better next time.
- Let's study.

331
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,062
What's that sound?

332
00:23:04,845 --> 00:23:07,547
I'm waiting to do the interview.

333
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:09,119
Seo Je Yi?

334
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,172
He's totally out of the race. It'll be a miracle if he doesn't get expelled.

335
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:18,207
Isn't that Lee Jae Su?

336
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:20,740
Oh, him? The one who's pretty good at studying?

337
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,411
Isn't that Jae Su's voice?

338
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:24,593
It was a little hard plotting his downfall.

339
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:28,788
He's not the type to do silly things like that, unlike me.

340
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,513
Who told him he could transfer here and act like a hot shot?

341
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:38,348
How dare he stand up to me? He's got some nerve.

342
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,931
I'll finish up quickly.

343
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:46,056
Sure. I'll call you again after the interview.

344
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:48,086
That little...

345
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:49,938
That punk!

346
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:14,504
Teacher Choi, are we starting now?

347
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:16,286
Get over here, you little punk.

348
00:24:16,286 --> 00:24:18,216
Pardon?

349
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:19,269
Follow me!

350
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:21,241
Why are you doing this?

351
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:23,252
- I said follow me.
- What's going on?

352
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,895
- I'll go ahead.
- See you later.

353
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:26,705
- Let's go to the noraebang.
- Okay.

354
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:27,888
Let's go.

355
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:29,930
You're not too late, are you?

356
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,671
- Let's go.
- Come on.

357
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,613
Your revenge is complete

358
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:45,984
You jerk. You got what you deserved.

359
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:49,899
I thought Je Yi would be the Master.

360
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:53,172
But I guess it's not him.

361
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:05,414
Could it be Ro Bin?

362
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,769
Now, everyone seems suspicious.

363
00:25:24,154 --> 00:25:25,896
Aren't you glad we helped you out?

364
00:25:25,896 --> 00:25:27,897
Pay for the karaoke today.

365
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:30,510
- Sure.
- Sounds great.

366
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,641
