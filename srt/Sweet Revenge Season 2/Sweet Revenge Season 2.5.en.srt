00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:32,953
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

3
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:37,646
I'll have to make it extra delicious.

4
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:41,101
Hold on. We're having visitors for the first time in a while.

5
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:45,102
I hope I bought all the meat and ingredients for japchae.*
*(stir-fried noodles with vegetables, meat, and mushrooms)

6
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:48,619
Oh, no. I forgot to buy minced garlic.

7
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:50,740
Gosh.

8
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:55,145
I don't even have time.

9
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:58,778
Should I go back to the grocery store?

10
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,323
Let's take a look at this expiration date.

11
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:06,406
It expired three hours ago.

12
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:08,027
Now, that it's nice and ripe,

13
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,610
it's the best time to eat it.

14
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:12,932
Let's see.

15
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:16,035
Welc—

16
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,918
Oh, my gosh!

17
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:20,491
I didn't think I'd be able to see you since it's your day off.

18
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:22,131
But you have shown up once again.

19
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:23,633
Where's the minced garlic?

20
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,155
Where do you think?

21
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:27,257
Gosh.

22
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:30,411
Why did you buy so many groceries?

23
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:32,583
Is it a special day today?

24
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,265
You even bought ingredients for japchae?

25
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,697
You know I love japchae.

26
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,378
It's so delicious.

27
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:42,462
Be quiet and ring me up.

28
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:44,554
I really wish I could eat japchae

29
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:47,117
instead of triangle kimbap.

30
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:50,219
I want to eat beef and chewy mushrooms

31
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,073
along with perfectly cooked glass noodles.

32
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:57,577
I want to mix it up and eat it all in one bite—

33
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,199
You can chew on the receipt.

34
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:02,242
I'm so sick of this.

35
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,826
I really want some japchae.

36
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,873
What are you doing?

37
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:15,535
This came out on the news.

38
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,867
If you hit your forehead, it'll stimulate your frontal lobe

39
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,959
and suppress your appetite.

40
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,552
Is that true?

41
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:26,455
I want to eat omogari jjigae* so badly though.
(*stew in earthen bowl)

42
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:28,718
I don't want to eat omogari jjigae.

43
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:30,450
I don't want to eat omogari jjigae.

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,782
I don't want to eat gorgonzola pizza.

45
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:35,284
I don't want to eat gorgonzola pizza.

46
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:37,176
It's so hot.

47
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,670
- Why did you buy so much?
- Are we having a party?

48
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,204
The boys next door are coming over for dinner.

49
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:47,476
They moved in a few days ago, but we didn't get to invite them over.

50
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,381
Oh, my. Where did they go?

51
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:52,922
Oh, my.

52
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,317
My glasses left a mark.

53
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,274
Welcome.

54
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,507
This is for you.

55
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,328
You didn't have to bring this.

56
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,512
Gosh.

57
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,674
- Hi.
- Hi.

58
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,294
Come in.

59
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:41,380
Oh, my. I didn't even know you guys were coming.

60
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,603
I couldn't even get ready.

61
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:46,476
Oh, my. You're here.

62
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:50,531
I didn't even see you there because I was busy reading.

63
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,290
Welcome.

64
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:58,257
Gosh, you two are so handsome.

65
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:00,249
You should come over often.

66
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:01,892
I couldn't make much, but eat up.

67
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:03,834
I hope you like the food.

68
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,555
It's so delicious.

69
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:07,877
Really? What a relief.

70
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:12,381
I felt so sorry that you got hurt because of Ji Na.

71
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,634
Oppa*,
(*lit."older brother", said by a girl, to any slightly older male)

72
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,807
you have something on your face.

73
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:19,879
- Really?
- Beauty.

74
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:28,047
Oppa, put it down.

75
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:31,041
What? I don't have anything to put down.

76
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,772
Your charm.

77
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:37,097
Isn't it funny?

78
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:39,950
So your parents are overseas right now?

79
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,283
Yes, they're doing medical volunteer work.

80
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,593
How nice.

81
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:46,536
I heard you get good grades, even though your parents aren't around.

82
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,749
Yes, Je Yi ranked first in school before transferring here.

83
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:54,615
Your parents must be so proud of you.

84
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,175
I wish Ji Na could do

85
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,468
at least half as much as you do.

86
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,812
It would be nice

87
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:05,394
if you could study with Ji Na.

88
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:08,397
If Ji Na is all right with it, I'd be all right with it, too.

89
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:09,980
- Really?
- Yes.

90
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,552
I would be so grateful.

91
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:13,753
Eat up.

92
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:15,444
Here.

93
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:17,326
Here you go.

94
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,322
Eat up.

95
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,223
Help yourself.

96
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,757
- Isn't it salty?
- No, no, it's delicious.

97
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:28,999
- Is it seasoned well?
- Yes.

98
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,739
Great.

99
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:46,866
Gosh, why isn't this working?

100
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:57,528
Would you like me to help you?

101
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:00,761
Omo! You know how to fix things like these?

102
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,914
There's nothing you can't do.

103
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:06,526
I'm installing a program to scan for viruses,

104
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:08,068
so it should be fixed soon.

105
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,630
You're so great.

106
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,443
With those kinds of skills,

107
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:16,716
could he make an app like Revenge Note?

108
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:18,718
I hope my mom

109
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:21,841
isn't hindering your studying.

110
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:25,263
It's okay. Studying together is good for me, too.

111
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,170
Let's sit over there.

112
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,651
All right.

113
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,710
Since we have a social studies quiz next week,

114
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,621
- shall we practice with some questions?
- Sure.

115
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,422
Social studies is my best subject.

116
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:56,425
This part is important,

117
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,948
so let's solve these questions here and go over our answers.

118
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:00,629
Okay.

119
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,624
Shall we go over our answers?

120
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,254
Yes.

121
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:10,509
For the first question,

122
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,673
I got it wrong.

123
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,425
For the second question,

124
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:17,997
I was so close to getting it right.

125
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,849
I got the third question

126
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,650
wrong, too.

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,062
I did worse than I had expected.

128
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:34,754
What about you?

129
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,868
Me, too.

130
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,592
- Let's try harder next time.
- Okay.

131
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:45,975
Let me take a look.

132
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:49,077
- No, you can't. I did so badly.
- Why?

133
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:32,271
- What if I fall?
- It's okay.

134
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:34,824
What is this?

135
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:37,166
- It's weird.
- Me, too.

136
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,531
- What?
- What is this?

137
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:44,574
- I almost fell.
- Be careful.

138
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,346
Wait.

139
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:50,521
- What is this? It's weird.
- Me, too.

140
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,942
- I almost fell.
- Careful.

141
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:54,274
Try closing your eyes.

142
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:55,526
No, I'll fall.

143
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:58,128
- Hey.
- Hold me this way.

144
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:00,419
- What is this?
- Be careful.

145
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,722
It feels weird.

146
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:04,354
Wait for me.

147
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,505
- I'll fall.
- Come on.

148
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,439
Hold me.

149
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:37,167
I'll be late today, make sure you don't skip your meal

150
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,158
You're always late.

151
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:49,299
Why are you so late?

152
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,401
Don't be out so late.

153
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,515
Your lights just went out, are you asleep?

154
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,547
Take out your earbuds when you walk. It's dangerous

155
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,859
Who is this?

156
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:02,130
Is he someone from school?

157
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,063
It's so creepy.

158
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,440
- Hi.
- Good morning.

159
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:35,814
Oh, my gosh!

160
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:42,401
That was a great reaction.

161
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,513
What was that?

162
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:47,738
Stop using your friends for videos.

163
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,009
I came out so ugly.

164
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,199
It's funny though.

165
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,603
See? Everyone is happy watching you getting scared.

166
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:56,255
Look at the number of likes going up.

167
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,056
The teacher's here.

168
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,173
We're switching seats today, right?

169
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:06,335
Come up one by one and draw a number.

170
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:07,587
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:10,920
You can move to the seat of the number you draw.

172
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,731
Yes.

173
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:17,997
Gosh, I'm in the front row.

174
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:19,438
Nice. I got the best seat.

175
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:21,421
- What about you?
- I'm next to you.

176
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,686
Yes! I got a good seat!

177
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,803
- I'm at the back of the room.
- It's the last one.

178
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:58,247
Welcome, Ro Bin.

179
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,682
I love this seat.

180
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:06,485
It's fate.

181
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:09,898
You'll be in those seats until the break, all right?

182
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:13,582
- Good luck today as well.
- Good luck.

183
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:18,617
Ha Yan,

184
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,941
I have poor eyesight. Could you switch seats with me?

185
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,252
Okay.

186
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,372
Guys, our first class is Art,

187
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,564
so we need to go to the Art room.

188
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:43,122
Let's hurry and go, Ji Na.

189
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,744
My stomach hurts. You go ahead.

190
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:46,936
- I'll be there soon.
- Okay.

191
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,141
You need to get here on time.

192
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,544
Take that empty seat in the middle.

193
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:07,978
Today, we're going to draw portraits using a pencil.

194
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:12,341
Pair off and draw each other, all right?

195
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:15,524
Don't draw me because you like me.

196
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:17,137
Just as we have learned...

197
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,357
Quiet down.

198
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:21,030
First, start out with big lines

199
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,551
then add some shade

200
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,564
so you can give it a three-dimensional effect.

201
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:25,766
- All right.
- Yes.

202
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,607
You may begin.

203
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:35,564
You have a gorgeous jawline.

204
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,028
I love my model.

205
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:39,979
Just hurry up and draw.

206
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,710
Let me try drawing you.

207
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,092
Don't draw me.

208
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,266
Let's wrap it up for today

209
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:09,710
and finish it by next time. You'll be graded on it, all right?

210
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,592
That is all.

212
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,749
What is this?

213
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:21,120
You look like a dog.

214
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,782
My gosh.

215
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,235
Hey, what is this?

216
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:28,187
What? I gave you a lucky mole because you look so unlucky.

217
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:29,629
I don't believe you!

218
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:35,435
It's better than how she looks in real life.

219
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:38,107
Was Oh Ji Na's nose always this sharp?

220
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,132
What is this? Did you fall asleep?

221
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:08,538
You have a make-up class here for the Math competition, right?

222
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:11,420
Yes, Teacher Maeng is leading it.

223
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:14,854
I'll sit in your seat.

224
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,706
Have a good class.

225
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,343
If he was in my class,

226
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:27,906
I would've put that face all over my social media.

227
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:30,741
We gave up on Math, so we should go home.

228
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,422
Let's go.

229
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:41,400
Thank you for coming to the make-up class.

230
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,043
Let's take a quiz today to improve our critical thinking skills.

231
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,519
This is a problem that came out on the MENSA* test.
*(largest and oldest high IQ society in the world)

232
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,612
Does anybody know the answer?

233
00:15:57,336 --> 00:16:00,119
Seo Je Yi, you're already done solving it?

234
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,270
Come up to the board and show us.

235
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:26,230
Oh, my gosh.

236
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:30,389
- That's amazing.
- He's great.

237
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,110
You can go back to your seat.

238
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,254
You don't need me to explain this, do you?

239
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:38,728
If you can treat this thinking process like a game,

240
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:40,940
math will become a lot more fun.

241
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,813
Let's solve problems on our own now.

242
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:47,698
He's so smart.

243
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,389
I can't study because he makes my heart flutter.

244
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:53,562
It bothers me that he's good at everything.

245
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:56,106
Ji Su, you might lose your top rank.

246
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:57,936
Why is that thing important?

247
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:59,729
It won't even be on the test.

248
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,190
Am I right, Seung Hui?

249
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,364
You're right. It's not important.

250
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,742
Hi.

251
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,165
Hi.

252
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,027
You're here to buy a workbook.

253
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,538
Yes.

254
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:18,608
This one has various styles of problems.

255
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:19,730
I think it's pretty good.

256
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,581
Oh, really?

257
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:24,093
Then I'll get that one, too.

258
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:25,525
Thank you.

259
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:29,939
Did I leave my wallet?

260
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,090
I'll lend you some money.

261
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:34,594
Could you do that for me?

262
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:37,037
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back tomorrow.

263
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,377
Okay.

264
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:02,602
You look like you're having fun.

265
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:05,154
I won't forgive you if you cheat on me.

266
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,460
- Hey.
- Are you all right?

267
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,383
- Are you all right?
- Get up.

268
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,535
- He must be crazy.
- Are you all right?

269
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:45,855
Stop!

270
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,049
Stop!

271
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:58,900
Stop right there!

272
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,820
Darn it.

273
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:26,715
The door is closing.

274
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:32,290
Teacher Kim, you're already here.

275
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:34,540
Yes.

276
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:39,209
- You're here.
- Yes. I'm sorry.

277
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:41,050
No, it's all right.

278
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,702
- I was reading a book.
- I see.

279
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:44,724
- Let's go in.
- Yes.

280
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:56,867
You didn't fix this yet?

281
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:59,990
We didn't. I told my mom though.

282
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,882
Hurry up and fix it. It's dangerous.

283
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,983
What's this? Did you buy a new one?

284
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:16,896
My friend recommended it to me.

285
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:18,308
I see.

286
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:19,860
- Teacher.
- Yes?

287
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,220
Can you try solving this?

288
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,003
It's kind of like a fun math problem.

289
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:25,024
They say it's good for your critical thinking skills.

290
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,200
What could this be?

291
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,290
Look. Isn't it fascinating?

292
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,864
A guy named Je Yi in my make-up class solved it within five seconds.

293
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:38,880
The kids were so surprised. They even clapped.

294
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:41,581
That's amazing.

295
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:42,851
I think

296
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,964
it's starting to hurt my pride a bit.

297
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:50,900
- I'm off now.
- Yes.

298
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,624
Oh, right. It's your birthday tomorrow.

299
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,314
Yes.

300
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,278
I've prepared a gift, so look forward to it.

301
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:01,441
You didn't have to. Thank you.

302
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:03,883
Go on in now.

303
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:06,185
All right. Goodbye.

304
00:22:24,353 --> 00:22:28,096
I have poor eyesight. Could you switch seats with me?

305
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,519
Let me take a look.

306
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,281
- No, you can't. I did so badly.
- Why?

307
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:17,828
♪ To my beloved best friend  ♪

308
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,939
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

309
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:25,614
Thank you so much.

310
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:28,178
It's my first time in middle school having a birthday party with a friend.

311
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:30,619
I'll celebrate your birthday every year from now on.

312
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,161
In regards to that,

313
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,562
I have prepared another cake.

314
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:36,275
Go ahead and cut it.

315
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:39,318
What is this? It's so pretty.

316
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:43,883
- Sorry.
- Gosh.

317
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:45,935
- That scared me.
- It got all over your face.

318
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,526
Oh no.

319
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:12,241
Lifetime friend certificate
Oh Ji Na, Bae Sin Ae.

320
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,977
We were

321
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:20,720
so happy back then.

322
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,571
Ji Na and Sin Ae will be friends forever

323
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:23,873
If my crush likes you, I can give him up

324
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:26,005
We will have each other's back, no matter what

325
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:44,194
It's my birthday

326
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,044
Should I try bringing it up with Je Yi?

327
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:29,578
Je Yi,

328
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:32,862
have you ever taken revenge?

329
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:36,766
What am I saying? That sounds weird.

330
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,241
That scared me.

331
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:45,595
Sin Ae's birthday

332
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,162
Ji Na,

333
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:55,114
do you know what day it is tomorrow?

334
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:57,796
I'll be waiting at the park we visited often.

335
00:25:57,796 --> 00:25:59,739
I'll wait

336
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,420
until you come.

337
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:08,317
Who do you think you are?

338
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:18,260
Sin Ae!

339
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,662
Do you expect me to celebrate your birthday with you?

340
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:25,183
Whatever. I'll never go.

341
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:30,750
I hope my nose gets sharper.

342
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,764
What is that? Is it a clothespin?

343
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:36,505
No.

344
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,408
This presses on your cartilage,

345
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:41,910
so if you do this ten minutes a day, your nose will get sharper.

346
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,492
Does that make sense?

347
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:45,876
What do you think? Didn't my nose get sharper?

348
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:47,856
Not at all.

349
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,510
You want to die?

350
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,230
Where are you going? To your part-time job?

351
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,381
Mind your own business.

352
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:06,606
Je Yi is always worried that you stay out so late.

353
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:09,988
I heard that your parents give you a lot of allowance too.

354
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:12,670
Why do you need to make more money?

355
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,894
You don't need to know.

356
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:17,950
I heard that you work part-time at a hamburger restaurant.

357
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,500
Bring me some leftover hamburgers

358
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,340
and French fries too.

359
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:47,670
- Our makeup is going well today.
- We look so pretty.

360
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,330
This is good enough, right?

361
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:52,803
You are sexy.

362
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:55,055
I don't think they'll ask for your ID.

363
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:57,007
I look so young though.

364
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,739
I'm worried we'll get caught because of me.

365
00:27:58,739 --> 00:27:59,889
Hey,

366
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:02,341
you'll be the first one allowed in. Don't worry.

367
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:03,832
Hey.

368
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:29,729
Wait.

369
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:31,050
Show me your IDs.

370
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,601
Hey, oppa!

371
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:34,444
We're college students.

372
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:36,496
Why are you like this?

373
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:39,099
- IDs!
- You're so strict.

374
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:41,270
We forgot to bring our IDs.

375
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:44,184
If you don't have your IDs, you cannot enter.

376
00:28:44,184 --> 00:28:46,256
Wait, oppa, we're not—

377
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:48,148
Regulations are strict these days.

378
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:50,240
Go away, babies.

379
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:52,992
- Gosh.
- Let's go somewhere else.

380
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:58,248
What do you think you're doing?

381
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,898
Why didn't you stop me?

382
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:03,363
Gosh, you don't know how to guess people's age correctly.

383
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:06,567
- This is all because of you.
- You were stopped too.

384
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:09,158
- This is because of you guys.
- Don't we look like college students?

385
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:11,640
- I know, right?
- How do we look like high schoolers?

386
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,722
Exactly.

387
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:14,484
I'm so annoyed.

388
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:17,927
Why can't we get in?

389
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:20,019
Did you say you look young?

390
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:23,172
You were allowed in right away.

391
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:26,560
His eyes are messed up.

392
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:28,288
This is annoying.

393
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:31,220
Let's prepare thoroughly next time.

394
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,511
Okay.

395
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:35,334
I'm thirsty. Let's go to the convenience store.

396
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:36,696
Okay.

397
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:39,740
You can go. I'll wait.

398
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,211
- Okay.
- All right.

399
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:49,170
Do you want to have fun with us?

400
00:29:50,077 --> 00:29:51,880
No thanks.

401
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,553
Let's go have some fun.

402
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:55,915
I said no!

403
00:29:57,177 --> 00:29:58,737
Gosh.

404
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:00,660
Did you just hit me?

405
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,191
I should just...

406
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:14,343
Darn it.

407
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,525
Who are you?

408
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,078
Hey, the police are here. Let's go.

409
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:20,959
Darn it.

410
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,431
Gosh.

411
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:25,780
- You got lucky this time.
- Hurry up.

412
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:28,177
I was so scared.

413
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:29,489
Thanks for saving me.

414
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:31,490
What are you doing here?

415
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,103
Go home.

416
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:36,416
Gosh, he's the best.

417
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,748
He's so cool.

418
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,140
What's up?

419
00:31:03,682 --> 00:31:05,545
What's up?

420
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:12,702
What's this? He's definitely been here several times.

421
00:31:14,144 --> 00:31:16,820
I caught you, Seo Ro Bin.

422
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:13,203
Be careful, Seo Je Yi

423
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:17,896
What is this?

424
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,205
Be careful, Seo Je Yi

425
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:01,320
You were really pretty today

426
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:06,075
I want to hang out and study with you every day

427
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:10,621
Sin Ae was cute wearing white socks with white sneakers today

428
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:15,334
Day by day you get prettier. I want you to be my girlfriend soon
