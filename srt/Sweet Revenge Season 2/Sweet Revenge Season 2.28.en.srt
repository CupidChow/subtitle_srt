00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,000
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

4
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:40,399
A while back,

5
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,003
when you said there was something that you didn't want to talk about...

6
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,694
Was this it?

7
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,438
Geography Report

8
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:05,764
Gang Jun Hui?

9
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:07,066
Who's that?

10
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,489
Please enter password

11
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,570
It's even password-protected.

12
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,785
What could the password be?

13
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:20,720
Maybe it's Dad's birthday.

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,003
Please enter password

15
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:26,896
That's not it.

16
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:28,860
Is it Je Yi's birthday?

17
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,470
Please enter password

18
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,805
That's not it either. What could it be?

19
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,599
Stop it already. Dad is allowed his privacy too.

20
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,793
It even has a password. He won't like it if you look.

21
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:44,813
Is it our parents' marriage anniversary?

22
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:48,148
Please enter password

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,241
I got in!

24
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:55,524
Of course that's it. Dad is madly in love with Mom.

25
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:11,041
Happy first birthday, Gang Ro Bin!

26
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:32,539
Gang Jun Hui. That was my real father's name.

27
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:37,490
My mind blanked out in that moment.

28
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,772
When I was two years old,

29
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:45,955
both of my parents passed away in an accident,

30
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:50,170
and their best friends, who are my parents now, took me in.

31
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,293
I guess my real parents didn't have any other family.

32
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,887
Happy first birthday, Gang Ro Bin!

33
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:06,455
Je Yi was speechless.

34
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,319
That's when I knew

35
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,221
there was no turning back from this.

36
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,261
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

37
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:24,494
We didn't see anything.

38
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,390
Nothing has changed.

39
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,022
I wanted to go on as if nothing had happened.

40
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:56,340
But I just couldn't.

41
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:07,107
Look at you, Ro Bin.

42
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:08,927
Awesome.

43
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:11,570
- Look at those skills.
- My gosh.

44
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,613
He's a total artist.

45
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,055
- Wow.
- Great.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,421
Awesome.

47
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:29,628
Hey, run! Let's get out of here!

48
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:33,532
My goodness.

49
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:41,871
Shock

50
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:48,388
Seo Ro Bin.

51
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,710
Do you know what time it is?

52
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,694
Why have you been like this recently?

53
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,797
Do you need me to scold you like this?

54
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,050
Enough. Let's talk tomorrow.

55
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:02,211
Ro Bin, just go to your room.

56
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:11,911
Is that why you transferred to our school?

57
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:17,420
My parents had to go abroad,

58
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:22,330
but I think they were anxious I might get into trouble.

59
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,553
They were probably just worried about you.

60
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:28,206
Think about how upset they must have been.

61
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,310
I know.

62
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,792
I didn't want to make things hard for them,

63
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:37,560
so I tried to stick it out on my own.

64
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:41,600
But in the end,

65
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,172
I was the one who made their lives difficult.

66
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,863
Don't tell anyone.

67
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,665
What? That you're a crybaby?

68
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:09,480
I won't. Don't worry.

69
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:16,084
Don't try to endure this on your own.

70
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,779
If you're having a hard time, you can always lean on someone else.

71
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:35,004
This one's 38,000 won (≈ $35)...

72
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:40,620
Why don't you stop pretending to be the kind older brother?

73
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,811
You're not my real brother.

74
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:48,918
- Mom.
- Yes?

75
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,701
By any chance,

76
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:55,434
are you hiding any secrets from me?

77
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:58,877
Maybe a secret about my birth?

78
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,021
A secret about your birth?

79
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,597
So you do remember

80
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:09,979
when you were crying under that bridge.

81
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,301
I took you in.

82
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:14,613
Oh, of course I remember.

83
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:17,316
How could I forget? Don't you think so, ajumma?

84
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:20,579
You little brat. You're so rude.

85
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,032
The truth is

86
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:25,754
my real father is the CEO of a huge conglomerate

87
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:27,306
and he lost me,

88
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,769
so you and Dad raised me, right?

89
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,609
I see.

90
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:34,313
One day, my wealthy parents will show up

91
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:36,966
and tell me that I'm their lost daughter and ask me to live with them.

92
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,597
My goodness.

93
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:40,900
What do I do then?

94
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,703
What do you mean? You should run to them and move in with them right away.

95
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:46,946
But make sure to take me with you too.

96
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,089
You owe me for raising you.

97
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:52,591
Hopefully, my daughter can help me live an even better life.

98
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,975
Okay. Mom, you're definitely coming with me.

99
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,586
Definitely.

100
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,340
Aunt Seon Hui...

101
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,172
Should I take you or not?

102
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:06,816
This sounds like some outdated drama that you're making up.

103
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,597
Hey, Oh Sa Na, wake up.

104
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:12,981
You're 1,000 percent your mom and dad's daughter.

105
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:14,573
I am, aren't I?

106
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:16,555
I'm so glad that I am.

107
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:21,039
If something like that really happened,

108
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,550
I'd be really sad.

109
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,561
Mom.

110
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,254
What's wrong, my baby daughter?

111
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:36,475
Poor thing.

112
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:40,269
It's already past midnight.

113
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,632
Forget this silly talk, and go to bed.

114
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:45,994
That's how you grow taller.

115
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:49,539
I was getting sleepy anyway. I'm going to bed.

116
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:50,900
Wait a minute.

117
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,932
Is Ji Na already asleep?

118
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,653
Why hasn't she left her room?

119
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,445
Good question.

120
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:59,158
Now that I think about it, I haven't seen her all day.

121
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:01,952
Wait, did she even come home today?

122
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,412
What are you talking about?

123
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:06,756
She came in earlier and is in bed already.

124
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,208
Without eating dinner?

125
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:12,301
I know her, and it's not like her to skip a meal.

126
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,404
She ate a lot of tteokbokki.

127
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:17,117
She said she's full.

128
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,329
Excuse me?

129
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:31,901
- Hi.
- Are you looking for the trash area?

130
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,332
Yes.

131
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,785
- It's that way.
- All right.

132
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:51,500
I heard from Ro Bin that you and your husband do volunteer work overseas.

133
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,233
Are you back in Korea for good?

134
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,664
No. That's not it.

135
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:58,077
Anyway, I heard from Je Yi

136
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,739
that you helped them out a lot.

137
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:02,681
Not at all. Je Yi was the one who helped me out.

138
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:06,325
Je Yi is handsome, kind, and smart.

139
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:09,618
I'm so glad to have a friend like Je Yi.

140
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:12,591
My mom is always saying how she wishes she had a son like Je Yi.

141
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,443
She's so jealous.

142
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:15,574
Is that so?

143
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:19,178
But it's not just Je Yi. Ro Bin is so good to me too.

144
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:22,212
What? Ro Bin?

145
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,473
- No way.
- It's true.

146
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:27,976
Back in the day, whenever Ro Bin would wake up late...

147
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:31,630
Seo Ro Bin, you're going to be late.

148
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,093
Your heong is waiting on you. Hurry up.

149
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:39,400
Mom, where are my gym clothes?

150
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,753
I told you not to play games late at night.

151
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:46,844
From now on, no more games.

152
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:48,818
Mom, anything but that!

153
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:50,310
Please.

154
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,193
Then from now on, you need to wake up early.

155
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:56,465
How nice would it be if you woke up with Je Yi?

156
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,220
Mom, stop it.

157
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,722
I'm all grown up now.

158
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:02,832
What?

159
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:05,655
You're avoiding your mom because you're a big boy now?

160
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:09,598
No wonder people say there's no point in raising a son.

161
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,400
That's not it.

162
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:18,030
What happened? Did you lose your wallet?

163
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,642
I love you!

164
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:25,325
Gosh, Seo Ro Bin. I'm getting goosebumps.

165
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,686
You're making me cringe. Stop it.

166
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,179
Do you want one too, Hyeong?

167
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,539
Take this heart!

168
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,342
Enough already. Stop it.

169
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,604
Ro Bin did that?

170
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:37,346
I didn't expect that from him.

171
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,969
But then again... He acts all strong on the outside

172
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,931
but has his cute moments when you look closer.

173
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:45,184
Sure. You wouldn't believe what a scaredy-cat he is!

174
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:48,498
He couldn't even ride an elevator alone when he was younger.

175
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:52,491
He was scared ghosts would appear. Je Yi always had to ride with him.

176
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,023
Really?

177
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:57,776
I'm so thankful that Ro Bin is my son.

178
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:01,470
I can't even imagine life without Ro Bin.

179
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:06,186
Oh, look at the time. I need to get going to school.

180
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:07,336
See you later.

181
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:09,018
Sure.

182
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:12,292
She's so energetic. What a lovely girl.

183
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:17,947
Ro Bin, you should hurry too.

184
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:20,188
Ji Na ran off that way too.

185
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,742
Mom, I'm sorry.

186
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,955
About what?

187
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,447
About the times I've made you upset,

188
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,609
saying that I won't go to the States,

189
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:32,480
and about everything else.

190
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:35,395
It's all my fault.

191
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:39,868
I won't upset you anymore.

192
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:41,940
I promise, Mom.

193
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:46,065
I'm going to be late for school.

194
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:57,045
My apologies.

195
00:12:57,045 --> 00:12:58,297
Today's the first day

196
00:12:58,297 --> 00:13:01,840
that you changed your cafeteria food provider to Golden Spoon Foods.

197
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,175
I wanted to do a good job, but we've had a few setbacks.

198
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:09,318
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

199
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:13,141
One mistake isn't the end of the world.

200
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,355
And to be honest, kids nowadays are

201
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:18,708
overloaded with nutrients. They can afford to fast for a day.

202
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,453
Thank you for your understanding, Principal.

203
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:27,047
Also, take this.

204
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:29,788
Please have this for lunch.

205
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:33,442
This is our highest quality lunch box at Golden Spoon Foods.

206
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:34,824
Enjoy.

207
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:39,177
Aigoo! You didn't have to.

208
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:43,442
There's also a special dessert inside.

209
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:46,566
Aigoo.

210
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:50,189
Thank you for always taking care of me.

211
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:53,011
- It's no problem.
- I'll get going now.

212
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:55,454
I've kept you for too long. You must be so busy.

213
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:57,527
Goodbye, Principal.

214
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,308
Goodbye.

215
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:05,624
He's so good at just taking all of these gifts.

216
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,157
Disgusting.

217
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:33,722
There's an envelope in here.

218
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,862
Why is there suddenly a meeting this early in the morning?

219
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:46,426
I don't know. I haven't heard anything either.

220
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,042
Well, today,

221
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,226
there's been a small mishap at school.

222
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:59,648
That's why I'm calling this meeting.

223
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,351
It's no big deal.

224
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:05,015
Something happened

225
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:07,276
at the new food provider that we contracted with

226
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,278
for our cafeteria.

227
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,061
So there will be no lunch today.

228
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,513
- Oh my.
- Wait, what?

229
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,025
The kids come to school to eat.

230
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,017
This is a big deal.

231
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,879
What about the kids' lunch?

232
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,071
Pipe down.

233
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,364
This is just a small mishap.

234
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:27,135
Why are you all getting so rowdy?

235
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:32,301
In my opinion,

236
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:34,953
for lunch today, we should have

237
00:15:34,953 --> 00:15:36,666
a famine experience. How about that?

238
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,937
Excuse me?

239
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,468
Famine?

240
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:41,001
All around the world,

241
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,884
there are many starving children.

242
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:47,057
So through this famine experience,

243
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:51,360
we can share their pain and suffering.

244
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,013
How does that sound? Doesn't that sound meaningful?

245
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:01,110
Mr. Choi? How about it?

246
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,583
But making the kids go hungry is a bit...

247
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:10,810
It's a good idea. A very good idea!

248
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,313
How meaningful!

249
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:17,186
Kids nowadays eat

250
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:20,240
way too much, so it's a problem.

251
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,774
We have too many obese children because of overeating.

252
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:27,396
It won't be a problem if they miss just one meal.

253
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:31,090
Then how about making a group order of lunch boxes for the kids?

254
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,953
If we hurry, I think we can make it by lunch time.

255
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:35,114
Ms. Maeng,

256
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:38,147
do you know how much that costs?

257
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,729
If you want to feed them that badly,

258
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:44,243
order it through your class money or your own personal funds.

259
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:48,337
Since this happened because the school didn't properly check,

260
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,550
I think the lunch boxes should be paid by the school.

261
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,953
Just do a famine experience!

262
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:57,677
All of you newbie teachers talk back whenever the principal says something.

263
00:16:57,677 --> 00:17:00,560
It's a madhouse in here!

264
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:05,505
Ms. Maeng.

265
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:06,546
Yes?

266
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:08,548
Starting tomorrow,

267
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:10,810
please help out the cafeteria staff.

268
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,844
We're low on kitchen staff and they need help.

269
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:17,267
It would be so nice

270
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:20,851
if you, the one who loves the students so much,

271
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:23,203
took charge of the cafeteria staff.

272
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:25,565
Me?

273
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:28,167
Why? Don't you want to do it?

274
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:31,661
I thought you would like to do something for the sake of the kids.

275
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:34,734
Yes. Yes, sir.

276
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,529
Why that...

277
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,022
Ms. Maeng, you should have just kept quiet.

278
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:46,525
Now he's out to get you for sure. Will you be all right?

279
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,969
Students,

280
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,463
today is the day for our famine experience.

281
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:57,588
Your precious meals will be

282
00:17:57,588 --> 00:18:01,391
helping children in need of clean drinking water

283
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:06,165
by being donated as funds to organizations that supply clean water.

284
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:09,950
For the sake of the poor children in Africa,

285
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,943
please take active participation in our famine experience day.

286
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:15,470
That's all.

287
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,757
What? So what's going to happen?

288
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:21,700
So there's no lunch today?

289
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,913
- Gosh.
- I'm hungry.

290
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:26,180
What's he talking about? Famine experience?

291
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:29,419
They need to tell us these things beforehand.

292
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:32,750
I only had two bowls of rice this morning.

293
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,024
I'm getting dizzy.

294
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,886
- Two bowls?
- You pig.

295
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:37,527
Lose some weight.

296
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:40,330
Our cafeteria truly has some diverse events.

297
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,563
Didn't we have a Korean War experience in first semester?

298
00:18:44,563 --> 00:18:46,446
That's right.

299
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:48,438
At least they gave us potatoes then.

300
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:51,161
We've got such a great cafeteria.

301
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:53,714
This could lead to a huge scandal soon.

302
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:56,230
I doubt it.

303
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,328
I'm extra hungry thinking about having to starve.

304
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:02,501
At least they're donating the money. Let's look at the positive side.

305
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:04,593
Do you think they're really donating?

306
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:07,827
What if the principal is just pocketing the money?

307
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,780
We need to do something.

308
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:12,072
Ro Bin, let's run.

309
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,202
Where are you going?

310
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,244
To the store.

311
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:16,956
- The store!
- Let's hurry!

312
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,988
Wait for me.

313
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,593
What are you doing? Let's run.

314
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:48,727
Where is she? How can she just leave the store like that?

315
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:53,242
Hello.

316
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,805
Oh my. What's with the flowers?

317
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:57,217
Do you already have a new man?

318
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:59,780
No. Hyeong bought them for me.

319
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,083
What? Oh Gang Dong bought those?

320
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,314
What happened? Did he eat something bad?

321
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:07,187
No, I just saw him in a flower shop.

322
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:09,840
So I went in to say hi, and he bought these for me.

323
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:12,773
Getting flowers for the first time in a while

324
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:15,254
makes me feel so good!

325
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:28,928
Did he buy them for me?

326
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,070
No. He didn't say anything like that.

327
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,520
What?

328
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:36,235
So you were expecting that.

329
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,740
What are you going to do? That wasn't the vibe I got.

330
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:44,290
Maybe he bought these to look good for the flower shop owner.

331
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:48,508
That's right. That's totally possible.

332
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:51,591
No way. That can't be it.

333
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:54,013
I'm just kidding.

334
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:56,637
But you know, that flower shop owner

335
00:20:56,637 --> 00:21:01,010
looks a bit old, but she's very pretty.

336
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,885
She was so smiley around Hyeong and nice to him.

337
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:12,601
It kind of looked like she was flirting with him.

338
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,283
Get rid of these flowers!

339
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:17,686
All they do is attract bugs. How useless!

340
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:19,700
Get rid of them!

341
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:23,231
Why are you taking it out on me?

342
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:35,805
You're pretty good.

343
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:39,087
- Really?
- Yes, I was so surprised.

344
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,752
- Well, you know me.
- Oh, wait a minute.

345
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,414
What's going on?

346
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:48,830
You must have worked hard arranging the flowers.

347
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:52,422
Thank you.

348
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:55,375
I need to learn this really quickly.

349
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,466
I'm getting impatient with myself.

350
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:00,389
Don't worry. I'll do my best to teach you.

351
00:22:17,968 --> 00:22:20,990
Mom, what's with those clothes?

352
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,802
You didn't wash your hair, did you?

353
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:25,484
I was too tired, so I couldn't.

354
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:27,747
It's only been two days. Gosh.

355
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,179
That's so dirty!

356
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:31,600
That's why Dad's been...

357
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,082
What about Dad?

358
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:35,235
What I'm saying is

359
00:22:35,235 --> 00:22:39,298
put on some makeup, and buy some new clothes.

360
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:42,221
Dress up like the other women.

361
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:44,503
I did dress up.

362
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:46,927
What's wrong with you? If I go outside,

363
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:50,199
people think I'm a young lady.

364
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:52,692
Young lady? Whatever.

365
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:16,104
He's not going.

366
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:19,688
He is going.

367
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:23,111
He's not going.

368
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:26,320
He is going.

369
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,308
He's not going.

370
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,060
He is going.

371
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:35,245
He's not going.

372
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,111
He is going.

373
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,777
This is all just a superstition.

374
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,940
I just wasted my time.

375
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,730
If you knew, why did you do it?

376
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:04,063
When did you get here?

377
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:07,896
Did you see everything just now?

378
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:09,279
I did.

379
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:17,360
You knew I was going to the States?

380
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,648
I did.

381
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:23,061
I heard when you were fighting with Je Yi.

382
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:27,677
Should I not go?

383
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:30,230
What? Why?

384
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,720
.If you tell me not to go, I won't

385
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:39,468
I remember when I first met you here.

386
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:42,741
I really thought you were a thief.

387
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:45,865
Mom, it's a thief!

388
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:47,526
Wait!

389
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:58,096
I saw you before that too.

390
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,858
You don't remember?

391
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:02,401
You picked up 100 won (≈ 9¢) for me.

392
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:06,144
Excuse me.

393
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:11,681
You dropped this.

394
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,383
I'm late.

395
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:19,900
I thought to myself that I shouldn't get involved with you.

396
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,634
She's small but so heavy.

397
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:27,930
I shouldn't get involved with her.

398
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:33,181
You were the one who carried me that time?

399
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:38,267
You were so heavy I thought that I was going to die carrying you.

400
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:39,588
Gosh.

401
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:41,770
Then what changed your mind?

402
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:44,663
I don't know.

403
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:47,285
When did I change my mind?

404
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:49,209
I don't know myself.

405
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:06,700
Just try it.

406
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,490
♫ I follow your gaze ♫

407
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,150
without realizing it

408
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:23,380
♫ I can hear how you feel ♫

409
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,630
♫ I follow you without realizing it ♫

410
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:31,730
From some moment, all I could see was you.

411
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,260
You didn't know this, you stupid girl?

412
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:50,880
Ro Bin went to the roof before.

413
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,411
If I go now, I could run into him.

414
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,970
Nice.

415
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:04,885
Je Yi, go call Ro Bin.

416
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:06,747
He's not answering his phone.

417
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:08,388
Yes.

418
00:27:23,313 --> 00:27:24,734
My number one bucket list is something else

419
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:27,750
Just say it. Why through text message?

420
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:30,789
I'm too embarrassed to say it.

421
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:38,300
Sa Na told me that unless you say that it's official, you're just flirting.

422
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:42,050
That's what I heard, at least.

423
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,823
If you don't want to, whatever.

424
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:46,755
How could I say something like that?

425
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:49,000
This is driving me nuts.

426
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:55,130
Can't we do something else?

427
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:58,276
If you don't want to, then don't.

428
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,030
I'm only going to say this once.

429
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,539
I...

430
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,182
like you.

431
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:35,895
Gosh.

432
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:39,407
Ro Bin,

433
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,430
I couldn't hear you clearly.

434
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,272
Can you tell me again?

435
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:44,744
What?

436
00:28:44,744 --> 00:28:47,766
No way. I'm not doing it again.

437
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:51,211
One more time. Just once.

438
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,093
Oh, come on.

439
00:28:57,537 --> 00:28:59,380
Listen carefully.

440
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,422
I'm really not doing this again.

441
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:12,010
Oh Ji Na,

442
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,813
I like you the most in the world.

443
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:24,960
Oh Ji Na, what about you?

444
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,760
Me too.

445
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:34,863
I like you the most too!

446
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:38,127
Who is making that noise? Can't we get some sleep around here?

447
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:39,819
- Hey!
- Quiet!

448
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,092
Are you guys dating or something?

449
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:43,042
Oh Ji Na, congrats!

450
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:45,274
- I'm jealous!
- What do we do?

451
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:48,046
Now there are rumors going around about me.

452
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:50,620
Sorry about that. Sorry.

453
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:24,520
Gosh.

454
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,820
This is so cringeworthy. I can't watch.

455
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:31,219
Do they think they're the only couple?

456
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,453
They're so childish.

457
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:41,640
Gosh. I'm cringing so hard too.

458
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,592
Ro Bin, that little brat.

459
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,675
He's a pro at making people cringe.

460
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:49,030
I'm glad it's my sister and not me who's being embarrassing.

461
00:30:49,737 --> 00:30:51,360
Oh Ji Na,

462
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:54,513
I'm going to make fun of you until the day you die.

463
00:30:57,137 --> 00:31:00,419
That's right. I'm glad it's not me.

464
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,391
I'm glad.

465
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:06,165
Ji Na...

466
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:10,329
Ro Bin has no eye for girls.

467
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,972
Sa Na, I think you're much prettier and nicer.

468
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:16,280
Oh Ji Na has no eye for boys either.

469
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:21,069
How could she like Ro Bin and not you, oppa Je Yi?

470
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:23,393
You're much better than him.

471
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:26,466
So let's just leave them to date each other.

472
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:28,076
Let's just go.

473
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:31,461
When are you going to the States?

474
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:33,641
In three weeks.

475
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,434
That soon?

476
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:42,000
Then let's do everything we want to do before you go.

477
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,895
I made a bucket list of things I want to do with my boyfriend.

478
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,051
Feed each other delicious things.

479
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:55,725
Take a picture wearing matching t-shirts.

480
00:31:55,725 --> 00:32:00,208
Talk to each other all night on the phone. Give each other nicknames.

481
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:03,693
Get our tarot cards read. Go on a train trip.

482
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:07,086
Why are there so many?

483
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:11,089
- When are we going to do all that?
- Have a snowball fight.

484
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:17,075
But... We won't be able to do this together.

485
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:20,530
You won't be here.

486
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:41,230
That was so embarrassing.

487
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,413
I wish I hadn't seen them being all lovey-dovey.

488
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:49,839
As for me,

489
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,382
I'm all right because I can give up easily.

490
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:56,406
What about you, Oppa? Are you all right?

491
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:03,830
I'm fine. I already knew this would happen.

492
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:08,247
They say time heals all wounds.

493
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,999
While you're trying to adjust to moving to the States,

494
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:13,442
you're going to feel better in no time.

495
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:17,110
Thanks.

496
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:20,159
But you're lucky you get to go to the States.

497
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,912
I want to go to Los Angeles one day.

498
00:33:22,912 --> 00:33:25,475
I heard it's nice and the weather is nice there too.

499
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:27,216
We're going to L.A.

500
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,989
Sa Na, come visit for vacation.

501
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:31,620
L.A.?

502
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,054
But,

503
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,405
as for L.A.,

504
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:39,739
I don't really want to go there because it seems dangerous.

505
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:45,184
But if you invite me, maybe I'll come to visit.

506
00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:48,037
Oppa, you have to take care of me when I go there.

507
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:50,870
Of course. I definitely will.

508
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:53,944
Let's forget our past crushes,

509
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:57,185
and here's to our future relationships. Cheers.

510
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:58,827
Cheers.

511
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:13,934
Epilogue

512
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,120
Toilet paper.

513
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:19,598
What?

514
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:21,881
Get me some toilet paper.

515
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:26,736
Ask your hyeong nicely.

516
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,589
Hyeong.

517
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,981
Hyeong Je Yi.

518
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:33,190
Get me some...

519
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:36,065
toilet paper. Please?
