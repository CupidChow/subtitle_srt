Hey, what are you doing?

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,372
Who said you could put this up?

8
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:44,464
I got permission.

9
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:48,046
Get lost. This is Samuel's spot.

10
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:52,613
Look at this. It's hilarious.

11
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:54,363
A lyric reciting event?

12
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:57,426
"Comparative analysis of literary works."

13
00:00:57,426 --> 00:00:58,918
You sure are something else.

00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,419
What an eyesore.

15
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:01,942
Who would attend these things?

16
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:03,362
Just send gifts to your idols.

17
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:04,755
We told you to get lost.

18
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:07,026
Can't you hear me, Fatty?

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,343
Give that poster back to him.

20
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:15,365
Who do you think you are?

21
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,292
- What?
- I want to sign up for that.

22
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,883
Give it to me.

23
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:35,044
I'm letting it slide this one time.

24
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:37,387
I won't go easy on you next time.

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,562
Gosh, you wuss. What a waste of your big frame.

26
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:46,004
Ha Rok Hui, you're the best.

27
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:49,279
But I'm sorry. You can't join.

28
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:50,700
Join what?

29
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:52,762
You must be a male student to join

30
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:56,745
But I guess you could be considered a guy...

31
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:58,647
Shut up.

32
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:00,410
I'll let you join.

33
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,262
No one will know you're a girl.

34
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:05,785
The seonbaes backed down when Rok Hui told them to give it back.

35
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:07,887
Rok Hui was so charismatic.

36
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,008
I know, right?

37
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,391
When I first saw Rok Hui, I greeted her super politely.

38
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,394
I thought she was my seonbae.

39
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:19,200
There were even rumors of her being a bully.

40
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,872
Gosh. Bully, my foot.

41
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,404
Goodness.

42
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:28,607
Gosh, open your mouth.

43
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,881
You should've eaten carefully.

44
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:33,413
Ha Rok Hui!

45
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,961
- Rok Hui.
- Hey, Ban Ha Ni.

46
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,105
What are you doing here? I thought you went to the States.

47
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:47,736
You're surprised, aren't you? I came back to Korea.

48
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:51,039
Really? You haven't even been gone for that long.

49
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,342
I begged my parents like crazy, saying I'd rather die,

50
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:56,025
and they finally sent me back.

51
00:02:57,346 --> 00:03:00,108
Who is this?

52
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:04,363
I'm Ji Na. Oh Ji Na.

53
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,998
I'm Ban Ha Ni, Rok Hui's best friend.

54
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:18,288
She is so cute. Is she even human?

55
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:19,999
Isn't she a fairy?

56
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,751
I know, right?

57
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:24,373
She seems to be Rok Hui's friend.

58
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:27,216
Seriously? How can that fairy be friends with Rok Hui?

59
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,909
She's trying to act all pretty.

60
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,430
Who's prettier? Me or her?

61
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,920
Of course you're prettier.

62
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:38,276
People's standards are just so low.

63
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,634
As expected, Ro Bin is different from the rest.

64
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,622
Rok Hui, let's go eat.

65
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,113
Hey,

66
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,787
can't you see that Rok Hui is with us?

67
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:59,207
Why are you taking her away like that?

68
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,304
We can eat all together. Ha Ni, let's go.

69
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:07,075
Yes, let's eat all together.

70
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,792
Why are you being so nice?

71
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:15,064
No food waste today, finish it all

72
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:18,087
You said you're from the States. Why did you come back to Korea?

73
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:22,412
The States would be so much better, since you don't have to study much.

74
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:25,385
I like Korea a lot more.

75
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:28,210
Were you homesick?

76
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,733
How do they think this is enough watermelon?

77
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,885
I love watermelon.

78
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,509
This is just not enough.

79
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,186
- What is this for?
- It's a waste to throw it away.

80
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,388
Am I a food waste disposal?

81
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,519
I'm only eating it because it's watermelon.

82
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,732
Gosh, he should've given it to me.

83
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:55,183
I love watermelon too.

84
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:57,718
Can you give me some perilla leaves?

85
00:04:57,718 --> 00:04:59,458
Okay. Take some rice too.

86
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,240
- Just a little bit.
- She took all of it.

87
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,754
This is so good.

88
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,199
It's so hot.

89
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,643
Move out of the way.

90
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:16,695
It's really hot.

91
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:20,429
You guys use so much energy just because you're not paying for it.

92
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:23,652
Do you know how high our electric bill was last month?

93
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,820
You have no conscience.

94
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:31,090
The weather isn't even that hot.

95
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:36,645
- Unbelievable.
- Gosh.

96
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,310
This feels nice.

97
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,112
It's like a sauna in the teachers' office.

98
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:55,875
I wish we could turn on the air conditioner.

99
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,018
My gosh.

100
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:02,290
The principal's office probably has it turned on at the highest level.

101
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,234
- I can't stand it anymore.
- Ms. Jeong Jeong Ah...

102
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:06,925
Whatever.

103
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,102
Let the wind blow

104
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:20,559
Didn't you hear the principal say we should save energy just now?

105
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,372
Can we please turn it on just for a little bit?

106
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:25,694
No, we cannot turn it on.

107
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:28,308
I will take this remote with me.

108
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:30,349
Manque de chance*
("No luck" in French)

109
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,811
What?

110
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:36,390
I said the weather is very hot.

111
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,777
All right.

112
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,190
That's suspicious.

113
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:47,246
Manque de chance: Lit. "Lack of luck". Bad luck.

114
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,069
I'm "bad luck"?
(The Korean translation of "bad luck" is used as an insult)

115
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:58,839
Ji Na, I heard the new tteokbokki* place near the school is really good. (*rice cakes in spicy sauce)

116
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,449
Do you want to go today?

117
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,932
- Sure.
- Sin Ae, come with us.

118
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:05,214
I can't. I have to go to the cram school.

119
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:06,246
I'll join next time.

120
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:07,986
Okay.

121
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,170
Rok Hui, what about you?

122
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:17,095
Rok Hui, let's go home.

123
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:21,110
- Today...
- We're going to go eat tteokbokki.

124
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,742
Is that so?

125
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:27,850
Ha Ni, do you want to come with us?

126
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,680
That's okay. I'll go with Ha Ni.

127
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,581
Let's eat tteokbokki next time.

128
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,193
Ha Ni, let's go.

129
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,034
Okay.

130
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,870
She's got some nerve.

131
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,694
Oh Ji Na, why did you ask her to join us?

132
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:47,025
Don't do that next time.

133
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,748
How could I not? She's Rok Hui's friend.

134
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:52,271
Gosh, you care about other people too much.

135
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,103
Wait for me.

136
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,536
The world's second spiciest tteokbokki.
It's free if you eat it without water.

137
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:59,338
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

138
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:06,795
Okay, let's eat.

139
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:13,513
It's so spicy.

140
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:17,267
By the way, isn't Ban Ha Ni a bit weird?

141
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,789
- How so?
- Is Rok Hui her property or what?

142
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:21,660
She's always clinging on to her.

143
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,063
- It's suspicious.
- They're best friends. Don't overreact.

144
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,837
I can't stand this. I need water.

145
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:30,740
No. If you drink this, we have to pay.

146
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,391
- I really need it.
- No.

147
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,374
- No, just one sip.
- You can't.

148
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:37,526
- No.
- I'll just take one sip.

149
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:49,269
Je Yi, you saved me.

150
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,700
I thought I was dying.

151
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,802
Why did you do that? You couldn't endure that?

152
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,094
You should've endured it.

153
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,545
Now we have to pay for it.

154
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:58,597
I'm sorry. Ji Na found it so spicy.

155
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:01,501
Since it's my fault, I'll pay for it.

156
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,022
No, that's okay.

157
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:05,344
- You don't need to.
- It's okay.

158
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,965
I'll get going.

159
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,501
Thank you. Enjoy your food.

160
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,763
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

161
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,702
Not just because he bought us tteokbokki,

162
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:25,394
but he's such a good guy.

163
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:37,445
- What's this?
- It's tteokbokki.

164
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:38,928
Why tteokbokki?

165
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:41,440
I just wanted some.

166
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:47,026
They say it's really spicy. Eat it slowly.

167
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:48,878
Am I a child?

168
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:06,965
I told you it's spicy.

169
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,409
Why are you smiling?

170
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:15,754
No, just one sip.

171
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,376
How cute.

172
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,430
Are you crazy?

173
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,926
Are you a child? You can't even eat that?

174
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,207
Give it to me.

175
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:30,990
Endure it like a man.

176
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,592
Do you want to die?

177
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:35,945
- Take it.
- Give it to me.

178
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,149
It's right here.

179
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,800
Yes, Mom?

180
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,263
Of course we're doing well.

181
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,986
Ro Bin is doing well too.

182
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:59,700
We ate tteokbokki together.

183
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:01,880
Okay.

184
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,474
Wait, Mom.

185
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:07,566
I'll put Ro Bin on the phone. Yes.

186
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:17,847
It's me, Ro Bin.

187
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,722
Yes, don't worry.

188
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,855
I love you too.

189
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,305
You're done eating?

190
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,093
We're walking home together for the first time in a while.

191
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:46,175
Rok Hui, do you want to go eat tteokbokki? It's my treat.

192
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:49,317
No, I need to go buy sneakers.

193
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,270
You told Ji Na you would go.

194
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,592
You don't want to go with me?

195
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:54,834
What?

196
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:57,166
You seem to be close to Oh Ji Na.

197
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,568
Are you closer to her than me?

198
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,382
What are you talking about? We're all friends.

199
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:04,243
Watch out!

200
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,470
Walk on this side.

201
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,212
You really haven't changed at all.

202
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:14,783
What?

203
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:16,885
Never mind. Let's go.

204
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,557
Those are nice. They look good on you.

205
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:56,335
Hey,

206
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,118
is this really all you've got?

207
00:12:58,118 --> 00:12:59,870
Yes, that's all.

208
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,671
What is this?

209
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:03,742
You're not as rich as you look.

210
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,695
Darn it.

211
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:09,779
Your shoes are nice.

212
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:13,442
Take them off.

213
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:16,175
- What?
- Take off your shoes.

214
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,066
I can't.

215
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:21,260
My mom bought these for me as a birthday present.

216
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,063
- Please.
- Hey,

217
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:25,465
just tell her to buy you another pair.

218
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,516
Hurry and take them off.

219
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:43,082
Should we sell these?

220
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,985
- You can just wear them.
- Should I?

221
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:46,066
They look good on you.

222
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:49,039
You guys are so pathetic.

223
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,521
Hey, hand over the sneakers.

224
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:57,165
Ha Rok Hui,

225
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:59,258
what are you doing? Are you planning on wearing them?

226
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,831
Do you have to take things like these?

227
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:04,863
I'm too embarrassed to hang out with you guys now.

228
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,558
Hey,

229
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,010
says who?

230
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,541
Says I.

231
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,273
Why? You want to try stopping me?

232
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,508
Wait.

233
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,246
Here.

234
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:12,060
Don't get them taken away again.

235
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,764
Why are you staring at me like that? That stare is piercing.

236
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,877
You gave me back my shoes last time.

237
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:31,911
You looked completely different back then.

238
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:34,625
It was so long ago. I don't even remember.

239
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,377
You don't remember? Should I show you a picture?

240
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,704
When did you take this?

241
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:50,098
Erase it.

242
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:52,500
You've changed so much.

243
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,644
By the way,

244
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:58,868
do your friends know?

245
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:02,301
That I used to be a delinquent?

246
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:04,924
- They probably don't know.
- Then,

247
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:07,497
your past is a secret between you and me, right?

248
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:09,519
Then I'm your closest friend, right?

249
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,540
You're making me cringe.

250
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,733
Excuse me. I'll take these.

251
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,366
All right, please wait a moment.

252
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:21,421
That's right. Then and now, you're still the only one for me.

253
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:27,297
Rok Hui, I have something to give you.

254
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,689
Here, take this.

255
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,202
What is it?

256
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:39,058
I have the same one. Don't lose it.

257
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,801
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

258
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:50,269
Why are there so many side dishes?

259
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:51,811
Your grandma sent them to us.

260
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,983
Be sure to call her later.

261
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:56,795
- Okay.
- Where's Aunt Seon Hui?

262
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:58,358
- She says she has plans.
- Hey,

263
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:01,200
this is an emergency situation. How does this look?

264
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,612
It's ugly.

265
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,434
- What about this?
- It makes you look old.

266
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:11,140
It looks really bad.

267
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:13,483
What should I do? I have nothing to wear.

268
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:16,145
I should've done some shopping.

269
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,750
Did that guy come back from his business trip?

270
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,201
I think so. It needs to go well today.

271
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:23,753
I know, right?

272
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:29,190
I'll get going.

273
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,400
Aunt Seon Hui,

274
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,802
good luck.

275
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,386
Even if you get stood up,

276
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,929
don't go out drinking.

277
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:41,320
Gosh, you're so annoying.

278
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,484
Eonni, I may not come home today.

279
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:45,526
Don't wait up.

280
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:48,117
Please do so.

281
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,718
6:05 P.M.

282
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,305
7:30 P.M.

283
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:28,118
I'm sitting by the window.

284
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:30,140
The traffic is bad, isn't it?

285
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,060
Take your time.

286
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,072
Did something happen?

287
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,389
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,381
I'm at the airport.

289
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:44,162
I suddenly got transferred overseas.

290
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:47,465
I can't ask you to wait for me.

291
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,868
I guess this is the end of our relationship.

292
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:53,402
- Take care. 
- Oh no.

293
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:55,445
This can't be happening.

294
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:57,407
Gi Jun,

295
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,439
I can wait for you.

296
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:07,937
I thought I would be able to get married.

297
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:13,824
Ji Na,

298
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:15,915
can you go take this watermelon to Je Yi's place?

299
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,847
You guys can eat this later.

300
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,690
- Okay.
- Me too. I want to go too.

301
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,092
You're normally so lazy. What's going on?

302
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:29,049
What's up, Ji Na?

303
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,650
Hi, Sa Na.

304
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,294
My mom wanted me to bring you some watermelon.

305
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:36,926
My grandma sent over a huge watermelon.

306
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,309
Really? Thanks.

307
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,030
Do you want to come in for a moment? I'll give you your container back.

308
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:44,604
- Sure.
- I'll take this.

309
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,511
You guys don't look like your parents.

310
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,723
Really? Everyone says that.

311
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,559
Thanks for the watermelon.

312
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,893
Tell your mom I said thank you too.

313
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:24,433
Okay.

314
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,616
It'll be hard to finish it all by yourself.

315
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:30,018
Ro Bin said he doesn't like watermelon.

316
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:32,621
- What?
- By the way,

317
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:35,424
isn't Oppa Ro Bin home?

318
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:38,487
Ro Bin is in the bathroom.

319
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:48,709
What is this?

320
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:51,210
Oh Ji Na, what are you doing in our house?

321
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:52,251
Hey,

322
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,804
your apron and rubber gloves...

323
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,717
You pretend to be all cool at school.

324
00:20:57,717 --> 00:21:00,519
I need to show this to everyone.

325
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,682
Don't take pictures.

326
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:04,224
I told you not to take pictures.

327
00:21:04,224 --> 00:21:06,496
- No, it came out well.
- Give me your phone.

328
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,848
- Let's go, Sa Na.
- Hand over your phone.

329
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,682
Bye, guys.

330
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:14,763
Let's go.

331
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,631
I better go eat some watermelon.

332
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:28,797
- Goodbye.
- We're here, ma'am.

333
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:31,731
I can't believe this.

334
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:35,054
- I said we're here.
- This is the end...

335
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:36,967
We're here!

336
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,828
Shut up!

337
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:42,432
I need to be alone right now.

338
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,146
TAXI

339
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:49,569
Oh my gosh.

340
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,160
It's that woman again.

341
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,503
Do I need to do an exorcism to get rid of her? Gosh.

342
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,468
Rok Hui.

343
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,692
She's super cute.

344
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:05,164
Rok Hui, I bought some sneakers too.

345
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,896
They're the same as yours.

346
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:10,550
Do these things with your boyfriend.

347
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:12,922
Are you going to the bathroom? Me too.

348
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:14,944
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to go alone.

349
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,066
Let's go together.

350
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:17,517
Gosh.

351
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,040
Rok Hui, what's with your lips?

352
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:36,455
- What?
- They're so dry.

353
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,048
Stay still.

354
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,234
Forget it. I'll get going.

355
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,099
I'm going to go and edit some music videos.

356
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:51,420
- Sounds good.
- Let's go.

357
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:54,445
I don't have time for a placard. I told you I need to go edit.

358
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:55,564
Rok Hui,

359
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:58,327
do you want to work on the group homework today?

360
00:22:58,327 --> 00:23:01,189
- Shall we?
- Yes.

361
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:04,594
Rok Hui, let's go home.

362
00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:08,307
You'll have to go by yourself today. I need to do something with Ji Na.

363
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:10,760
I don't want to go by myself.

364
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,152
Can't you guys do it at school tomorrow?

365
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:16,946
Ban Ha Ni, don't overdo it.

366
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:19,298
When are you going to stop following me?

367
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,349
Rok Hui,

368
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:24,374
is it annoying to be with me?

369
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:25,995
- That's not it—
- I see.

370
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:28,167
You were annoyed.

371
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,570
I guess I was bothering you.

372
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,832
I wasn't even aware.

373
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:35,475
- Ha Ni, that's not it.
- I'm sorry.

374
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:37,437
I'll get going.

375
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:47,246
Ha Ni.

376
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:50,100
Ha Ni! Wake up, Ha Ni.

377
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,272
Ha Ni, wake up.

378
00:23:53,272 --> 00:23:55,384
- Ha Ni.
- Oh, no!

379
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,107
Ha Ni.

380
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:07,286
Ha Ni, are you all right?

381
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,308
How are you feeling?

382
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:11,081
I'm all right.

383
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:15,855
I think it's because of my anemia.

384
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,827
I was so shocked.

385
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:20,299
- Were you worried about me?
- Of course.

386
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,850
Are you able to walk? I'll take you home.

387
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:26,375
I'm sorry for bothering you.

388
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,257
I can go by myself.

389
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:30,230
You can leave if you're busy.

390
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,830
That's okay.

391
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,980
Your backpack is here.

392
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:36,065
Let's go.

393
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,210
Go on in.

394
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:57,146
Rok Hui, do you want to eat at my place?

395
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:59,188
Should we order pizza?

396
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,461
Rok Hui, stay for a bit.

397
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:10,280
Yes, I bought the chicken.

398
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,822
How would I buy alcohol?

399
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:16,136
I don't want to. You can buy it yourself, Aunt.

400
00:25:16,136 --> 00:25:18,027
I'm hanging up now.

401
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:19,929
Gosh, what kind of crappy store is this?

402
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,911
- I know.
- I'm so annoyed.

403
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,432
Let's go.

404
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:28,537
Excuse me.

405
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:34,043
Are you talking to us? What?

406
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:37,936
You shouldn't do that.

407
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,259
Do what?

408
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:42,562
Why did you kick the trash can in front of that store?

409
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:45,034
- Everything spilled out.
- My gosh.

410
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:48,178
I was annoyed by the store owner,

411
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:50,459
but you're making me angrier.

412
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:53,712
So what do you want?

413
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:55,735
You want me to pick up the trash or something?

414
00:25:55,735 --> 00:25:58,830
You'll get beaten up if you talk like that.

415
00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:01,641
What are you doing?

416
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:05,025
Let's talk it out.

417
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,918
Gosh, I'm late.

418
00:26:08,918 --> 00:26:11,129
My dad will scold me.

419
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:20,650
Ji Na, what are you doing here? Let's go.

420
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,762
Ha Rok Hui?

421
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:28,748
Oh my gosh. It's really Rok Hui.

422
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:30,750
It's really nice to see you.

423
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:36,006
Is that your friend?

424
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:39,159
I guess you're actually making friends now, aren't you?

425
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:40,799
Don't bother her.

426
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,661
What if we do?

427
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:45,254
What are you going to do if we bother her?

428
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,669
When I give you the signal, run as fast as you can.

429
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:52,973
We haven't seen each other in a while.

430
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:55,375
- It'll be sad if you just leave.
- One,

431
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:58,178
two... Run!

432
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:03,212
Hyo Ju, are you okay?

433
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:04,883
Darn it.

434
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:17,486
What about them?

435
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:19,538
They can't follow us anyway.

436
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:23,273
I thought I was going to die.

437
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:24,805
You have no fear.

438
00:27:24,805 --> 00:27:27,486
How could a small person like you stand up to them like that?

439
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,419
I know, right?

440
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,321
If it wasn't for you...

441
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:36,286
By the way,

442
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:39,408
do you know those girls?

443
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:42,332
Yeah.

444
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:45,225
The thing is...

445
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:49,679
Sorry. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

446
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,402
No, it's not a big deal.

447
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:55,714
The truth is...

448
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,772
So that's why you purposely came to this school?

449
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:07,185
Yes. It was because I didn't want to run into them.

450
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:10,379
I didn't know I would see them here though.

451
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,975
Are you all right?

452
00:28:15,975 --> 00:28:17,656
What?

453
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,869
Aren't you scared of me?

454
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:23,472
I know the other kids are scared of me.

455
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:26,086
I'm not that good at talking,

456
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:28,157
and I don't give off a good impression either.

457
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:30,820
Why would I be scared?

458
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,874
Ha Rok Hui, you looked so cool when you were saving me.

459
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:38,517
By the way,

460
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,330
your kick was amazing.

461
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,831
You knew how to do those things?

462
00:28:41,831 --> 00:28:43,372
Why didn't you tell me?

463
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:45,324
I didn't keep it a secret on purpose.

464
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,475
Follow me.

465
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,988
Do it faster.

466
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:51,571
That's right. Like a bird.

467
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:55,443
Sting like a bee! Yes! That's good.

468
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,007
Ha Rok Hui, you're late!

469
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,468
I came with my friend.

470
00:28:58,468 --> 00:29:00,539
Say hi. This is my dad.

471
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:04,504
Hello, I'm Oh Ji Na.

472
00:29:04,504 --> 00:29:06,706
Oh, Ji Na.

473
00:29:06,706 --> 00:29:10,129
It's been a long time since Rok Hui brought a friend over.

474
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,560
Rok Hui,

475
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,685
Take it easy training today and show your friend around.

476
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:17,917
Let's start again! Do it faster.

477
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:19,870
Move your legs.

478
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,092
Do it like Rocky. Hey!

479
00:29:23,092 --> 00:29:24,474
Punch. Dodge.

480
00:29:24,474 --> 00:29:26,436
Training? Is it for boxing?

481
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:28,317
- Yes.
- Oh my gosh.

482
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:29,929
So you're a boxer?

483
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:31,481
I'm not a boxer.

484
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:33,533
- I just work out with my dad.
- I see.

485
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:36,205
So that's why you were so agile.

486
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:40,960
Who is that?

487
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,942
Is he a famous boxer?

488
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:45,384
You don't need to know.

489
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,946
I mean...

490
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:50,989
I get that you're young,

491
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,553
but you don't know Rookie?

492
00:29:57,557 --> 00:29:59,268
It's this.

493
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,124
You don't know this?

494
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:08,268
I'm the champion.

495
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:11,070
It's famous. You don't know this?

496
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,061
You can stop now.

497
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,824
Hey!

498
00:30:14,824 --> 00:30:16,686
She says she doesn't know.

499
00:30:16,686 --> 00:30:18,989
Rok Hui's friend doesn't know Rookie!

500
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:20,880
I know though.

501
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,704
My gosh.

502
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:27,436
I am so disappointed.

503
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:34,154
Your father must really like

504
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:36,396
that movie.

505
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,702
Rok Hui, then is your name

506
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:45,133
also from the movie?

507
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:47,707
That's right. It's from the movie Rookie.

508
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:49,588
If it's a son, the name is Rok Gi.

509
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:51,400
If it's a daughter, the name is Rok Hui.

510
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,383
That's so cool.

511
00:30:53,383 --> 00:30:55,104
I'm going to tell everyone.

512
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:57,456
You have the same name as that man.

513
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,708
Rok Hui is better though.

514
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:03,533
Then did you watch all the movies?

515
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,595
We watched them over 100 times.

516
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,447
I don't know why he's not getting sick of it.

517
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:09,749
- You really watched all of them?
- Mm-hm.

518
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:12,092
Ha Ni

519
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:14,684
It's such an old movie.

520
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:16,825
Your dad is amazing.

521
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,438
He's weird.

522
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,642
Rok Hui, why are you with Ji Na?

523
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:38,018
[Epilogue]

524
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:40,570
You just love watermelon.

525
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,314
But why did you tell Ji Na that you didn't?

526
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:47,487
Just because.
