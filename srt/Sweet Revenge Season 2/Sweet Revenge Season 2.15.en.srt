~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:04,093
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:32,792
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,699
What's that on your face?

5
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,951
This? It helps pull your chin.

6
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:44,505
Hey, you're too young for this stuff.

7
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:46,696
Give it to me. I'll put it on.

8
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,118
No way.

9
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:51,851
Plus, even if you try and do this, it's already too late for you.

10
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,624
Why you ... Seriously.

11
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:55,325
Give it to your aunt.

12
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:58,958
Don't you see her saggy chin? She looks like a bulldog.

13
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,210
Give it to her before she really becomes a bulldog.

14
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:03,362
Eonni!

15
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:06,506
You're even more annoying! Gosh.

16
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:12,281
Eonni, I'm annoyed and hungry now. Let's order some jokbal.

17
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,663
Jokbal? *.
(pig's trotters braised in soy sauce, ginger, garlic and rice wine)

18
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,487
Here you go.

19
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:18,489
That wasn't funny?

20
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:19,940
I want to eat some, too.

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,661
There's a lot of cholera in jokbal,

22
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,212
so it's good for your skin.

23
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:24,855
- What are you saying?
- Cholera?

24
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,546
I think you mean collagen.

25
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:28,338
Don't do silly things like this

26
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,939
and go study instead.

27
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,952
- That hurts.
- Seriously. What are they teaching kids nowadays?

28
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:34,724
Students Lack History Knowledge

29
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:41,991
Ji Na, you know who our first president is, right?

30
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,544
Of course.

31
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,887
Who is it?

32
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:49,530
Lee Seung Man.
(known in U.S. as Syngman Rhee)

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,371
No, it's Lee Soo Man*.
(record producer and executive, founder of SM Entertainment)

34
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:53,353
Lee Soo Man? My goodness.

35
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:55,314
I got it wrong.

36
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:58,748
From now on, don't tell anyone that you're my daughters.

37
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:00,380
I'm so embarrassed. Gosh.

38
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,673
Don't you have a test? Why aren't you studying?

39
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,305
- I will.
- When?

40
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:09,549
Look at Je Yi. He only lives with his brother, yet he studies so hard.

41
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:13,093
I do your meals, laundry, and cleaning. Why are you still like this though?

42
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:15,905
You can't compare me to Je Yi. He's ranked first in the entire school.

43
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,066
What place did you come in last time?

44
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:21,400
I was the 18th.

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,403
You were 18th? That's too low.

46
00:02:24,403 --> 00:02:26,816
You're basically at the bottom.

47
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:31,070
Mom, at least I can make it within the top 15, right?

48
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,513
Do you know how hard the high school curriculum is?

49
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,496
You're totally going to be last place once you get there.

50
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:39,479
Oh Ji Na, you'd better go up at least five ranks this time.

51
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,582
If you don't, just know that I'm going to

52
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:45,656
lock you up in a boarding academy all the way up in Jirisan, understood?

53
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:47,477
Understood.

54
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,399
That's like comparing apples and oranges.

55
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,531
How could she compare me to Je Yi?

56
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:55,745
Why did he have to live next door?

57
00:02:55,745 --> 00:02:59,638
I hate you, Seo Je Yi. I really do.

58
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,333
You hate me? Why?

59
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,427
- Why do you hate me?
- You startled me.

60
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:08,989
Sorry. Did I startle you?

61
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,821
But why do you hate me?

62
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:14,494
My mom keeps comparing me to you.

63
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,787
She keeps nagging me about my grades.

64
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:19,159
She said she would send me to a boarding academy for vacation

65
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,731
if I don't go up at least five ranks this time.

66
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,624
She sounded serious. What do I do?

67
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:27,516
Sorry. It's all because of me.

68
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:32,763
Do you want to study together? I'll help you.

69
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:36,125
Really? Are you sure it won't affect your studying?

70
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,929
- Are you sure I won't get in the way?
- We'll be studying together.

71
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:40,961
I won't be bored. It'll be great.

72
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,291
That sounds great.

73
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,234
I'm looking forward to it, Teacher Seo Je Yi.

74
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:50,740
My goodness.

75
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,192
When will we go?

76
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:55,604
She's here.

77
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:01,521
You're all studying hard for the test, right?

78
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,544
- No.
- No.

79
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,506
Everyone, if you all do well on this test,

80
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:08,567
I'll treat you to food.

81
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,572
- Yes!
- What do you guys want to eat?

82
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:14,595
- Pizza?
- Pizza!

83
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:16,096
- No, chicken!
- Chicken!

84
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,967
- How about hamburgers?
- No, chicken!

85
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,468
- Pizza!
- Pizza!

86
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:23,001
Then I'll get one pizza for every three students.

87
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,318
My wallet is just filled with cash.

88
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,830
So make sure I can spend that cash on you guys.

89
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,581
- Yes.
- Yes.

90
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:35,075
It's time for the principal's morning announcement.

91
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,538
It is almost finals week.

92
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,309
However,

93
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,371
the academic spirit has disappeared,

94
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:46,056
and things have become disorderly.

95
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:48,558
The students aren't studying as they are told,

96
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:51,801
and they're going around dating instead.

97
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,464
We have a reputation of being a school filled with dating.

98
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:57,526
I'm too ashamed to go anywhere now.

99
00:04:57,526 --> 00:04:58,969
Therefore,

100
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:02,723
I've prepared a special plan of action.

101
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:05,014
If you break these rules,

102
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:08,208
you will be punished immediately.

103
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,200
- What?
 - First, no holding hands.

104
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,722
- What?
- Seriously?

105
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:14,904
Second,

106
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:18,628
no playful hitting, pinching, or physical contact.

107
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:20,621
- Third, 
- This is scary.

108
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,662
no feeding

109
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:25,835
someone else food or snacks.

110
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,587
- Are we living in the Joseon Dynasty?
 - Fourth ...

111
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:28,818
What's with the principal?

112
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:32,542
- The principal is scary when he does this.
 - No touching each other,

113
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,824
such as putting your arm around their shoulder.

114
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,295
That's so lame.

115
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,497
- That concludes the morning announcements. 
- Scary.

116
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,511
- What was that?
- He's so scary.

117
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,643
But rules are rules.

118
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,915
Let's not get punished for something silly like this.

119
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:46,646
Just be careful for a while.

120
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,107
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,889
Class President, could you post this on the bulletin board?

122
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:53,382
What is that?

123
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:55,384
What does it say?

124
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:57,567
- What is that?
- I have no idea.

125
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,448
- I'm so curious.
- What could it be?

126
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,612
- How annoying.
- Let's take a look.

127
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,822
Let's go look.

128
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:05,054
No physical contact between male and female students

129
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:06,706
Isn't expulsion too much?

130
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:09,579
Now, I can't even tease Bo Ra.

131
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,081
For me, as long as it's Ro Bin,

132
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,194
I don't mind getting punished.

133
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:16,046
- What is this?
- I can't believe it.

134
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,639
Are we going to get punished for this?

135
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,951
You little punk.

136
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:23,743
- That hurts.
- The school clearly doesn't get it.

137
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,765
Do they think this is going to stop students from dating?

138
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,347
Yes, but it's going to be a total mess if someone gets caught.

139
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,810
I'm too scared to do anything now.

140
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,981
That's why you've never had a boyfriend.

141
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,853
All the experts do it in secret.

142
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:38,858
There has got to be some students in our class who are secretly dating.

143
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:40,489
No way.

144
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,862
Hello, Su Ji's mother and Jae Su's mother.

145
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,074
My apologies for being late.

146
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:45,785
It's all right.

147
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,738
We have the president and vice president

148
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,670
of Hanjong High School's Development Committee here.

149
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,064
You are always giving your best effort for the sake of our school.

150
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:55,836
Thank you very much.

151
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,627
Don't mention it.

152
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:00,809
My Jae Su does attend this school, after all.

153
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:05,635
That's right. I heard that the recipient of the Hanjong Scholarship was decided.

154
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:08,187
I believe his name was Seo Je Yi.

155
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:11,101
Not at all. Nothing has been decided yet.

156
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,792
He's just a candidate for the scholarship.

157
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:18,997
It's not something you can receive solely through good grades.

158
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,821
I will personally

159
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:25,445
look out for student Lee Jae Su and see what I can do.

160
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:33,462
Actually, student Lee Jae Su is

161
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:35,855
the most eligible candidate.

162
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:41,841
Isn't the Hanjong Scholarship a huge advantage for college admissions?

163
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,442
You're so lucky.

164
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:46,055
Jae Su is the best when it comes to grades and extracurricular activities.

165
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:48,808
Well, that's true. And that Je Yi student

166
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,760
could mess up on his finals as well.

167
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:57,147
- That's true.
- Of course.

168
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:59,279
You know,

169
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,741
we should put a massage chair inside the principal's office.

170
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:02,942
Shall we?

171
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:05,745
The principal must be so tired these days.

172
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,416
Isn't that right?

173
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:12,000
Aigoo. Thank you very much.

174
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,208
Are you all right?

175
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,173
Sorry. I didn't see you there.

176
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:24,893
It's all right.

177
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:30,461
It didn't crack, did it?

178
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,162
Here you go.

179
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,822
- Are you going to the teachers' office?
- Yes.

180
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,234
Let's go together.

181
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:45,965
Thanks.

182
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,829
Sorry about that. Are you hurt anywhere?

183
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,610
I'm all right.

184
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:56,096
No way. Are you kidding me?

185
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:58,688
Iron Man fell for that sly little fox?

186
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:01,050
- Iron Man?
- Seo Je Yi.

187
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,843
He's called Iron Man because he firmly rejects girls.

188
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,287
Lots of girls have confessed their love to him, but he's rejected all of them.

189
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:10,720
- Really?
- Those two are looking suspicious.

190
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,354
Oh Ji Na, you live right across from him. You don't know anything?

191
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,848
How would I know those things? Let's go.

192
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:23,423
Did you do the assignment?

193
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:26,756
I didn't finish it yet.

194
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:40,270
Je Yi, could you give this to the teacher? Sorry.

195
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,243
Song Yi!

196
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:47,347
That was so sudden.

197
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:50,850
No Entrance. Teachers are making test questions

198
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:53,853
There's no entering the office during test week.

199
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:57,306
What do I do?

200
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:00,345
No Entrance. Teachers are making test questions

201
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:03,678
Password to Ms. Jeong Jeong Ah:
Say "Milky Skin Jeong Jeong Ah" three times

202
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,287
Milky skin Jeong Jeong Ah.

203
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,672
Milky skin Jeong Jeong Ah!

204
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:22,248
Milky skin Jeong Jeong Ah!

205
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,865
Je Yi, it's you. I knew that handsome voice was yours.

206
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:31,338
Well, Song Yi was busy.

207
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,170
She was going to give these to you.

208
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,912
- Thank you.
- No problem.

209
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:39,386
Cuckoo!

210
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,383
- Hello.
- Thank you. Cuckoo.

211
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:46,814
Goodbye.

212
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:58,184
1-2
Hanjong High School

213
00:10:58,184 --> 00:10:59,996
What are you doing?

214
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:02,388
I gave the notebooks to the teacher.

215
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,223
Are you not feeling well? You don't look so good.

216
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:08,975
I'm fine.

217
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,649
Je Yi, what are you doing after class?

218
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,632
I'm going to study. Why do you ask?

219
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:18,024
My cell phone is acting up.

220
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:21,819
- I'm going to go fix it ...
- Did it break earlier when it fell?

221
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:25,061
Sorry, it's my fault. Let's go fix it together.

222
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:28,565
Could you come with me? I didn't want to go alone.

223
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:31,618
- Thanks, Je Yi.
- No problem.

224
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:33,399
Let's go inside.

225
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:38,916
Welcome—

226
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,590
Oh, my. This is a surprise.

227
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,121
What are you doing here?

228
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,292
If you needed something, you should have let me know.

229
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,416
I could've delivered it to you.

230
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,198
What kind of convenience store delivers?

231
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:54,591
- Hurry and ring me up.
- No need to pay.

232
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:55,962
I'm the manager here.

233
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,154
You're just the manager on paper.

234
00:11:58,154 --> 00:11:59,136
Just take it.

235
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,158
I have the power here.

236
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:02,929
From now on,

237
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,701
everything is free for you.

238
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,503
Are you going somewhere?

239
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,424
Your skirt is so  "slight."

240
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,687
You're looking for the word  "tight."

241
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:26,314
- That's right,  "tight." 
- It all makes sense now.

242
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,144
I wondered why our kids are so dumb.

243
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:30,337
There's no way they got it from me.

244
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:32,649
They must get it from you, Mr. Oh Empty Brains.

245
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,843
Empty Brains? Call me by my real name, Oh Gang Dong.

246
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:39,977
Don't change my name like that.

247
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:43,469
Why not? Your brain is just as empty as this can.

248
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:51,427
Slight and tight mean the same thing anyway.

249
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,482
Aunt Seon Hui, why aren't you here yet?

250
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,864
I made plans to study with Je Yi later.

251
00:12:57,864 --> 00:13:00,097
Since when do you study?

252
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:03,590
Fine, I'll be there soon. Just wait a bit.

253
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,673
You know how to make coffee for customers, right?

254
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:08,324
I can do it better than you. Just hurry up.

255
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,824
Welcome.

256
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:20,176
Mango smoothie, no ice.

257
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,718
A smoothie?

258
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,203
Without the ice, it's just juice.

259
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:29,686
Just give it to me the way I ordered it. How dare a part-timer talk back?

260
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:33,150
Yes. A mango smoothie with no ice.

261
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:47,444
Here's your drink.

262
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,977
Goodbye.

263
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,757
You call this a drink?

264
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:02,809
Do you see this? There's a bug in here!

265
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:09,346
How did that get in there? I'm so sorry.

266
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:11,338
I'll give you a refund and make a new one.

267
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,270
You drink it.

268
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,394
- Excuse me?
- You're the one who gave me this to drink!

269
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:18,565
So why don't you try drinking it?

270
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:20,648
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

271
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:22,459
Forget the apologies.

272
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,860
Drink it right now!

273
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,433
If you don't, I'm going to sue you!

274
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:48,075
It's all gone now. Are you happy?

275
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:50,966
- Who are you?
- I'm just a customer.

276
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:54,390
Sorry about that. I'll give you a refund.

277
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:59,286
- Here you go.
- You little brat ...

278
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:01,648
I'm never coming back again! How annoying!

279
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,492
Why did you drink that? There was a bug in it.

280
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:08,365
It's fine. I'm not going to die from it.

281
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,146
Anyway, thanks.

282
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:13,159
I'll give you something for free. What do you want?

283
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,821
Anything.

284
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:17,243
Anything? Okay.

285
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,448
Are you here to study, too?

286
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:26,423
- Study?
- Yes.

287
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:29,286
I made plans with Je Yi to study later.

288
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:31,548
Isn't that why you're here?

289
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:37,894
Hey!

290
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,657
Hey! You punk!

291
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:50,437
What's going on? Did Ro Bin do something wrong?

292
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:52,870
No, it's nothing.

293
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,042
Je Yi, do you want to drink something before we study? I'll make you something.

294
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:59,956
Really? I'm all right with anything.

295
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:01,768
Anything for you, too?

296
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:04,030
You guys really are brothers, aren't you?

297
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,286
Studying isn't everything.

298
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,749
Is that a diary?

299
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,091
It's cute.

300
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:42,833
Decorating diaries is my hobby.

301
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:48,299
The one I had before this one was much prettier, but I lost it.

302
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:53,355
Really? You must have been so sad.

303
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:56,358
I really was. That was my secret notebook.

304
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,660
I wrote anything and everything in that.

305
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:02,174
What if ...

306
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:04,906
someone picked up that diary?

307
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:08,240
I'm going to kill them.

308
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,583
I can't let them live after seeing all my secrets.

309
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,363
Hold on!

310
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:23,185
Wait!

311
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,071
What should I do?

312
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:37,228
Oh Ji Na, Hanjong High School Class 1-1.

313
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:40,882
That's right. I almost forgot.

314
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:43,504
This is a must.

315
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,993
Hashtag, studying hard,

316
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:55,077
coffee, going to be an all-nighter.

317
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:58,349
Are you finished? Shall we start studying?

318
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:03,325
Not yet. I was going to start at exactly six o'clock.

319
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,254
It's so hot. Air conditioning is the best.

320
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:25,958
Hey, go home if you're going to sleep.

321
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,421
Do you think this is your living room?

322
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:31,012
Sleeping? No one was sleeping.

323
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:34,015
Tell me that after you wipe your drool. You're spilling everywhere.

324
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,315
What? It's already almost seven o'clock.

325
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:48,150
- You should have woken me up.
- Sorry.

326
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,403
I fell asleep, too.

327
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:54,907
Then I'll start at exactly 7:30 p.m.

328
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,678
Ji Na ...

329
00:19:56,678 --> 00:20:00,162
I don't think I can study any longer. I have plans.

330
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,955
Really?

331
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,647
Then it can't be helped.

332
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,739
Go ahead. I'm going to study a bit more.

333
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,073
Sorry. Let's study all day tomorrow.

334
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:13,334
- Sorry.
- See you later.

335
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,623
Je Yi—

336
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:37,189
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

337
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:02,264
Let's see what Je Yi is studying.

338
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:13,486
"To the world,

339
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,617
you may be

340
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:17,990
one person.

341
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:22,374
But to one person,

342
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:25,766
you may be the world."

343
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,234
What are you doing?

344
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:33,955
You can't tell? I'm studying.

345
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:41,222
"To the world, you may be one person.

346
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:44,385
But to one person, you may be the world."

347
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:49,312
Your pronunciation is so good. But do you know what it means?

348
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:53,345
In this world, you may be just one person.

349
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:57,059
But you could mean the world to one person.

350
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,212
You're so weird.

351
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,925
Who studies on the rooftop?

352
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,798
Wow! You brought watermelon.

353
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:17,929
How did you know I love watermelon?

354
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,142
You're the best, Sa Na.

355
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:23,736
What are you doing?

356
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:26,699
What's gotten into you all of a sudden? Gross.

357
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:28,510
Get away from me.

358
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:32,315
Ro Bin, you were here, too?

359
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:35,487
Oppa, you must be having such a hard time studying so much.

360
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,338
Have some.

361
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:40,632
I don't study though.

362
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:42,053
What?

363
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:44,927
I see.

364
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:48,940
That's true. I guess

365
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,083
you could take it easy on the studying.

366
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:54,116
You could do anything with that handsome face.

367
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:59,850
The watermelon is yummy. Eat up, Oppa.

368
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,347
Ji Na, there's a seat there.

369
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,053
Sorry, I'm a little out of it because I stayed up all night.

370
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:22,814
It's all right.

371
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:30,391
Je Yi, there's a seat there.

372
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:37,630
I saw those two yesterday.

373
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,211
Je Yi and Song Yi?

374
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:41,284
Really? Where?

375
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:43,776
They were together at the cell phone shop.

376
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:47,019
No way. Do you think they're getting matching cell phones?

377
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:50,072
It can't be. Seo Je Yi is mine.

378
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:52,725
What are you talking about? Why would he be yours?

379
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,705
He's for everybody.

380
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:58,381
Iron Man fell for that sly little fox?

381
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:01,654
Lots of girls have confessed their love to him, but he's rejected all of them.

382
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:04,726
- Really?
- Those two are looking suspicious.

383
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:07,250
- This is on today's test, right?
- It is.

384
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,112
- I couldn't study everything.
- Same here.

385
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:15,658
Really?

386
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:17,460
- That's strange.
- This one?

387
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:21,424
- Done.
- Do this side, too.

388
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,158
Is that enough?

389
00:24:26,158 --> 00:24:27,479
Perfect.

390
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,911
Take a picture of it.

391
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,744
What is this?

392
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,692
Hashtag, life is good.

393
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:43,346
Everything is fun during test week, except for the tests.

394
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:46,599
This is my absolute favorite way to study,

395
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:50,353
and it brings in super good results. What you do is ...

396
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:53,764
Let's say you're studying general science.

397
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,087
Nuna Mina's

398
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:59,792
non-metallic elements can easily become negative ions with electrons.

399
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:04,307
And you know that at room temperature, they are mostly gases or solids, right?

400
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:08,680
It's hard? It's hard for me too, Mina.

401
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,893
If you do it like this, it just sticks in your mind.

402
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:13,505
Hey, that's brilliant.

403
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:15,227
I'm going to do it, too.

404
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:17,599
Use this one.

405
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:19,822
What's with her?

406
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,135
Did Min Ju catch a cold?

407
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:26,639
No, she's wearing that so she can study and not talk to anyone.

408
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:27,930
Really?

409
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,432
Heol!

410
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:31,122
Ro Bin.

411
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:33,596
I couldn't take notes in social studies.

412
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:35,147
Can I look at yours?

413
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:36,829
Mine?

414
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,732
Thanks.

415
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:56,797
You are such a tidy man.

416
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,206
Hey, look over there.

417
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:14,015
Are they really dating?

418
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,829
Thanks.

419
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:25,027
Look at her being sly and pretending to be weak.

420
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:29,431
- Give it to me.
- I thought only fools fell for that.

421
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:30,982
I can't believe Seo Je Yi fell for it.

422
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,806
- Here you go.
- I thought

423
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:35,748
Je Yi liked you.

424
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:38,789
What are you talking about? There's no way.

425
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:45,086
Je Yi, I have to tell you something.

426
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:52,114
Hanjong High School

427
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:03,695
Hi.

428
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:06,128
I'm glad we're in the same classroom for the evening free study.

429
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:08,170
Let's walk home together after this.

430
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,491
Okay.

431
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,088
Seo Je Yi, are you studying hard?

432
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,002
Not really. It's the same as usual.

433
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:23,005
Look at the bags under your eyes. Stop pretending like you're not studying.

434
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:24,986
What about you? Are you studying hard?

435
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:28,430
Not at all. I was too busy watching  "Let's Have Dinner Together."

436
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,014
Hey, "Let's Have Dinner Together"  is super rad.

437
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:35,567
Hey, Lee Jae Su, last night's episode was canceled.

438
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:41,314
Hey, Jae Su ...

439
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:43,666
I heard you're a candidate for the Hanjong Scholarship.

440
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,757
I heard Je Yi's basically a shoo-in for that scholarship.

441
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:47,460
Says who?

442
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,361
We'll see about that. Seo Je Yi.

443
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:53,344
I'm going to make first place this time.

444
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:58,509
Sure. Try your best.

445
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:25,387
Oh Ji Na, you're going to snap your neck like that.

446
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,859
Yes.

447
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,664
My goodness.

448
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:49,120
What's up?

449
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:53,195
Je Yi, I need to talk to you.

450
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,521
Bo Ra, let's go.

451
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,343
I'll get going.

452
00:29:09,712 --> 00:29:11,383
What's going on?

453
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:15,217
We can't be in the classroom for too long. Hurry and tell me.

454
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:17,499
The thing is ...

455
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:23,706
We could patrol the school on our own.

456
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:27,259
You didn't have to come all the way out here yourself.

457
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:30,502
As the principal, I need to kindly show you the ropes

458
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,965
so that the school can function at its best.

459
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:35,738
This is what you call leadership.

460
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:37,029
Leadership? I see.

461
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:41,263
Let's make one full round and go out for drinks later.

462
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:43,546
That sounds great. I'll look for a good place.

463
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:46,428
- Sounds great.
- All right then.

464
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:50,632
Je Yi, remember when you said that you have someone you like?

465
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:52,424
Who is it?

466
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,506
What?

467
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:56,548
That person you mentioned last time. I'm just curious.

468
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:02,823
That's what you wanted to ask me? If that's all, I'm going to go now.

469
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,981
Let's go.

470
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:15,667
Je Yi, wait a minute. I'm scared.

471
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,781
Hey.

472
00:30:24,617 --> 00:30:26,767
What are you two doing here?

473
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:48,039
[Epilogue]
 No entrance. Teachers are making test questions

474
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:55,425
Teacher Choi, it's me, Seo Ro Bin.

475
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:57,768
- Did you call me?
 - What's the password?

476
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,143
Password to Mr. Choi Gang: Sing and dance to Wanna One's "Pick Me."

477
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:07,228
♪ The main star tonight is me ♪

478
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:11,381
♪ The only one left is me ♪

479
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:15,025
What's the password?

480
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:28,328
- Look at Ro Bin.
- Awesome.

481
00:31:28,328 --> 00:31:30,501
Look at those moves.

482
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,734
- He's so good.
- I can't believe it.
