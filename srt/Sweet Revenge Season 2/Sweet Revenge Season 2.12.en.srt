~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,295
Did you spend all your time doing manicure instead of studying?

5
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:39,149
I've always been good at these things.

6
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,700
You think you're so perfect, don't you?

7
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:45,805
Anyway,

8
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:48,347
Ji Na just went to go buy some chicken, but she hasn't come in yet.

9
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:50,280
Is she raising the chicken or what?

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,342
I'm so hungry.

11
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,006
I'm back.

12
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,019
Where on earth were you?

13
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,320
- Where's the chicken?
- I don't know.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,863
I almost died getting chicken.

15
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,724
I'm going to wash up.

16
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:09,930
Hey, Oh Ji Na, you should've at least called then.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,092
- We could've had it delivered.
- Hey,

18
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:15,335
you didn't eat the chicken all by yourself, did you?

19
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:16,747
If you ate it by yourself,

20
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:20,039
that chicken will be going to your cheek fat.

21
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,842
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,443
He's cold but handsome.

23
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:45,626
He would look so sweet if he smiled,

24
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:47,867
but he just doesn't smile.

25
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,219
Oppa,

26
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,581
what will get you to smile?

27
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,740
Ro Bin, what are you up to?

28
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:05,254
I'm not doing anything.

29
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,037
BTW, Ro Bin,

30
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:11,270
what kind of girls do you like?

31
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:14,544
Why do you ask?

32
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:17,237
I'm just asking.

33
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:21,350
Do you like girls with cat-like faces or dog-like faces?

34
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:28,857
What are cat-like and dog-like faces?

35
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,865
Sa Na has a dog-like face,

36
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:37,307
and I have a cat-like face.

37
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,153
Whatever. I like human faces.

38
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,795
Gosh, you're so cold.

39
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:48,368
What song do you like these days? What food do you like?

40
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,950
What food do you dislike? What's your favorite season and color?

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,083
Why are you asking so many questions? Stop.

42
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,376
Wait, I have one more question.

43
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,749
What do you think of Sa Na?

44
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:02,172
What do you mean?

45
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:04,545
Isn't Sa Na really pretty?

46
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,486
I'm not saying this because she's my sister,

47
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,968
but she is kind, pretty, and cute.

48
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:10,319
Anyone who gets to date her is

49
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,304
the luckiest guy in the world, right?

50
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,417
Sure. Sa Na is cute.

51
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:20,009
But why are you suddenly talking about her?

52
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,363
He says I'm cute.

53
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,318
I'm just telling you to treat her nicely.

54
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:29,839
My eonni...

55
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:33,013
I mean, she's a hundred times better than Ji Na.

56
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,555
You're Ji Na.

57
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,166
Why are you talking like you're not?

58
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,788
Oh, you're right. I'm Ji Na.

59
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:41,721
My mom is calling for me. Bye, Ro Bin.

60
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,646
Who are you texting for that long?

61
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,781
Just someone. You don't need to know.

62
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:01,260
Ro Bin, your smile cheers me up.

63
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,984
If a vitamin was a human, it would be you.

64
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,065
You're a human vitamin.

65
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:08,989
So smile a lot from now on.

66
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,960
What's gotten into her?

67
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:14,404
I'm a human vitamin?

68
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,299
Gosh, I almost got caught.

69
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:24,934
What?

70
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,359
Sa Na, what were you doing with my phone?

71
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,582
I wasn't doing anything. Don't accuse me.

72
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,491
Don't use my phone ever again.

73
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,994
You're so petty. I won't use it, okay?

76
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:05,815
- I support this.
- Me too.

77
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:07,616
We need a pen.

78
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,791
Rok Hui, can I borrow a pen?

79
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,366
Thanks.

80
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,527
What's this?

81
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,909
Gosh, she should be here soon.

82
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:22,812
- Why isn't she coming?
- I know, right?

83
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:24,063
Rok Hui.

84
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:26,065
She's here.

85
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:29,279
Here. Eat this.

86
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,011
Here you go.

87
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:37,956
- She's about to give us some too.
- Me too.

88
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:43,532
Gosh, she's cute and kind on top of that.

89
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:46,225
- I'm not eating this. I'm saving it.
- Don't take mine. I won't give it to you.

90
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:48,248
- What about Ji Na?
- I want yours.

91
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,020
- Can't you give it to me?
- I'm sorry.

92
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,712
I'm all out.

93
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:56,306
It's okay. I'd get fat from eating it anyway.

94
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:57,987
It's okay if you get fat.

95
00:05:57,987 --> 00:06:01,450
Your cheek fat is so charming the more you look at it.

96
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,134
Gosh, you are so cute.

97
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:05,394
I'm envious.

98
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:07,806
It hurts.

99
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,001
I'm sorry. You're just so cute.

100
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,983
I don't have any cheek fat

101
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,305
so I get envious of those things.

102
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:26,145
She's trying to insult you, isn't she?

103
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:27,958
Did you do something wrong to her?

104
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,698
I don't know.

105
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:34,554
It hurts.

106
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,555
That pen is...

107
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:43,111
I have the same one. Don't lose it.

108
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,747
That hurt.

109
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,852
Does it still hurt a lot?

110
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:25,454
Drink this and cheer up.

111
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:27,176
Thank you.

112
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,191
Give it back!

113
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:34,374
- No way.
- Come on.

114
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:36,777
Sorry.

115
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:38,917
Hey, Ha Seon Su!

116
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:47,557
Rok Hui, I was looking for you. Where were you?

117
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:49,258
I was in the bathroom.

118
00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:59,538
With Ji Na?

119
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:05,444
Ha Rok Hui

120
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,258
Those gym clothes...

121
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:09,909
Are they Rok Hui's?

122
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,831
Yes.

123
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:14,734
Rok Hui lent me her clothes because mine got wet.

124
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:16,706
It's time for class. Let's go.

125
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,648
Ha Ni, we'll get going.

126
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,221
- What?
- Never mind.

127
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,012
It's nothing.

128
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:45,194
What's wrong with this?

129
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:46,755
Ji Na.

130
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:50,290
Ji Na, do you want to go on a blind date?

131
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,410
Blind date?

132
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,084
He's handsome and tall. He's super cute.

133
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,957
Why would a guy like him go on a blind date with me?

134
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,080
Why not?

135
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,111
I showed him a picture, and he said you were cute.

136
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:03,802
Try meeting him.

137
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,597
Oh Ji Na, are you going on a blind date?

138
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,259
No, I didn't say I would do it.

139
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,430
You're going on a blind date?

140
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,962
You shouldn't do it.

141
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:15,345
- Why?
- I feel bad for him.

142
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,397
He'd basically be doing charity work.

143
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:21,190
What? Charity work? You jerk.

144
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,982
Ha Ni, I'll do it.

145
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:24,705
He called me cute, right?

146
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:27,346
You want to do it? I'll set it up right away.

147
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:28,827
Okay.

148
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,267
Why do you treat Ji Na like that?

149
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,899
Isn't Ji Na kind of cute?

150
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,981
What do you mean, cute?

151
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,993
Why isn't it coming out?

152
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,751
All right!

153
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:54,805
Who is that?

154
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:56,265
He's a guy I know.

155
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,088
I'm setting him up with Ji Na tomorrow.

156
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:00,049
Ji Na?

157
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,462
Ji Na said she would do it?

158
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:04,223
Yes, he's out of her league.

159
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,780
Rok Hui, what should we do tomorrow?

160
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,163
I want to go to Namsan Tower. Do you want to go together?

161
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,356
I hate crowded places.

162
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:20,080
Just once.

163
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,402
Fine.

164
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,144
- Really?
- Yes.

165
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:39,959
- Have you seen my charger?
- I told you to knock.

166
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,221
I'm asking if you've seen my charger.

167
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:44,714
I think it's on the kitchen table.

168
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:46,295
Is that so?

169
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:49,298
What were you watching?

170
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:51,211
Why were you so startled?

171
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,532
Do you feel guilty about something?

172
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:55,575
What do you mean, guilty? It's not what you're thinking.

173
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:57,866
What am I thinking?

174
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,731
Even I haven't watched it.

175
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:03,792
I guess you really are the older brother.

176
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:10,330
Aish! It's seriously not what you're thinking.

177
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:13,031
Aish...

178
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,829
What are you doing?

179
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,960
Is there something wrong with your bicycle?

180
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,261
What?

181
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,534
Do I look weird? Does it not suit me?

182
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:55,956
Yeah.

183
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:59,098
You look weird. It doesn't suit you.

184
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:02,551
Mind your own business. I shouldn't have asked.

185
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,667
Ji Na,

186
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:11,590
where are you going dressed all pretty?

187
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,153
Are you going on a date or something?

188
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:15,884
I don't know.

189
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:22,302
Is she really going on a date?

190
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,586
Anyway,

191
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:29,017
doesn't Ji Na look really pretty dressed like that?

192
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:31,612
Doesn't she?

193
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,402
I don't know.

194
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,388
Do you kids know anything?

195
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,772
What a jerk.

196
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,334
How could he come right out and say I look weird?

197
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:46,976
I'm so annoyed.

198
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,279
I wonder if Ji Na's blind date is going well.

199
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:04,893
Don't worry. He's a good guy.

200
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:09,208
By the way, how did you get close to Ji Na?

201
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,402
You were always alone.

202
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:13,404
If it wasn't for Ji Na,

203
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:15,524
I would still be alone.

204
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:20,369
- I can't believe it.
- Wait, I said it wrong.

205
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,292
I'm serious.

206
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,494
I said I was right.

207
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:26,947
Are you all right?

208
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:29,770
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

209
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,022
Yes, I'm all right.

210
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:34,614
What's with her? She bumped into me.

211
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,696
Isn't that Rok Hui?

212
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,448
- I guess she tripped her.
- Didn't Rok hui push her?

213
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:41,701
I think she did. How scary.

214
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:42,772
She's so mean.

215
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:45,585
Hey, that's not what happened.

216
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:51,811
You bumped into her. Why are you taking it out on Rok Hui?

217
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:54,024
It's your fault for not watching where you were going.

218
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:55,934
Apologize to Rok Hui.

219
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:06,787
What's with them? She was the one who bumped into her?

221
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:09,578
- Whatever. Let's go.
- Let's go.

222
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:18,106
What's with her?

223
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:22,541
She is so nosy.

224
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:25,875
I see.

225
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,877
I need to use the bathroom.

226
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:34,523
How did it go?

227
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:36,385
She's not there yet?

228
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,319
She'll be there. Just wait.

229
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:42,892
Messing with her shouldn't be hard for someone like you.

230
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:44,795
Just mess with her

231
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:47,477
and make sure she knows her place.

232
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:50,180
I just don't like her.

233
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,581
I'm hanging up.

234
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,821
What do you mean, mess with her?

235
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:04,534
- Was that about Ji Na?
- No...

236
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:06,455
It's not like that.

237
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,769
- It's about someone else.
- You're lying.

238
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:11,772
Tell the truth. What have you done to Ji Na?

239
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,833
Well...

240
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,456
I was just trying to joke around

241
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:19,338
because you were only hanging out with Ji Na.

242
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:22,991
It's true. So Rok Hui...

243
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,785
Seo Ro Bin, Ji Na isn't picking up her phone.

244
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:46,465
Go find Ji Na.

245
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:48,578
Why? What happened?

246
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:50,811
We need to stop Ji Na's blind date.

247
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:54,283
I can't go right now, so you need to find her.

248
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:22,601
Oh Ji Na, are you all right?

249
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,575
What happened to your clothes?

250
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,926
Oh, this...

251
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:28,367
It's nothing. I just fell.

252
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,040
What are you doing here?

253
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,503
I heard you had a blind date.

254
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:36,125
- Did that asshole do that to you?
- What are you talking about?

255
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,697
It's not that.

256
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,841
I couldn't even go on the blind date.

257
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:43,112
I'll pick it up later. Yes.

258
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:45,714
- Just leave it to me. Yes.
- I'm so annoyed.

259
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:50,349
Thank you very much. Bye.

260
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,574
Oh my.

261
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:06,275
Teacher Jeong, your shoes!

262
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,258
You forgot your shoes, Teacher!

263
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:10,450
Your shoes!

264
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,211
Teacher!

265
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,077
That hurt.

266
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:25,164
Is there an accident?

267
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:32,010
Teacher!

268
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,794
Are you Oh Ji Na from Class One?

269
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:37,618
Teacher, here are your shoes.

270
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:40,109
Oh my. I must have lost my mind.

271
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:43,322
Oh my gosh. This is so embarrassing.

272
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:47,266
Ji Na, thank you. Thank you very much.
(in French)

273
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,540
But let's keep this a secret

274
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,842
from the other kids.

275
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:53,672
It's a secret.

276
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:07,076
Oh, right. The blind date.

277
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:09,469
What do I do?

278
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,892
So you couldn't even meet him?

279
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,555
No.

280
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,606
He was so angry.

281
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:19,309
It was my fault for being late though.

282
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,112
But then again, handsome guys are out of my league.

283
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:25,795
I'll take you home. Hop on.

284
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:28,257
I'm really all right. You don't have to give me a ride.

285
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,090
I said I would give you a ride, remember?

286
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,610
Hop on.

287
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:28,928
I'm heavy, aren't I?

288
00:19:28,928 --> 00:19:31,180
Yes. At least you know.

289
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,112
Hey, to be honest,

290
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:34,934
I only look chubby because of my cheek fat.

291
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:37,176
- Without my cheek fat—
- Just your cheek fat?

292
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,748
You're just...

293
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,133
Good. That's a relief.

294
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,837
Until I tell Ji Na myself,

295
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:28,738
please keep it a secret.

296
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:31,690
Yes. Thanks.

297
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:36,726
Why did you do that?

298
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,408
Why did you do that to Ji Na?

299
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,371
I was just joking around.

300
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:44,274
You wanted him to scare her and mess with her.

301
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:47,127
- You call that joking around?
- Nothing happened.

302
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,588
Isn't it fine then?

303
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:50,961
Are you kidding me right now?

304
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:52,942
Ban Ha Ni,

305
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,314
were you always this kind of person?

306
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:58,547
How can you say that to me?

307
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,532
Is Ji Na that precious to you? Even more than me?

308
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:04,953
What are you talking about? You're the one at fault.

309
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:07,688
Apologize to Ji Na immediately.

310
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:08,789
No.

311
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,540
I won't. I can't.

312
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,382
You won't?

313
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:18,117
Then I won't see you ever again.

314
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:19,660
Okay, fine.

315
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,452
I'll do it. I'll apologize.

316
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:23,914
I'll say sorry.

317
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,325
Don't scare me like that.

318
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:41,840
What's up? Why did you want to talk here?

319
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:46,767
Ji Na, I'm so sorry.

320
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:48,167
It's all my fault.

321
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:51,250
Why? What happened?

322
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,984
There's someone else who needs to apologize to you.

323
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:56,275
I'll tell you everything once she gets here.

324
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,997
I think I got something in my eye.

325
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:08,709
Let me see.

326
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:10,379
I don't see anything.

327
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,672
Really? It feels like there's something there though.

328
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,944
Stay still.

329
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:20,099
I can't believe I have to apologize to Ji Na. I hate Rok Hui.

330
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,151
But I still made a promise with Rok Hui.

331
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:27,155
- Are you okay?
- No.

332
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:44,685
I knew it.

333
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:48,548
Oh Ji Na, are you trying to steal Rok Hui away from me?

334
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,244
I will never let that happen.

335
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:15,183
What happened? Tell me.

336
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:18,128
To be honest...

337
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,210
Why would Ha Ni do that to me?

338
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,084
She was jealous of you.

339
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:37,677
But she agreed to reflect on it and apologize to you.

340
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:40,279
I guess something came up.

341
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,702
I'll talk to her again after class.

342
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:57,697
I'm going to the snack bar. What about you?

343
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,219
I want to go too.

344
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:01,451
Get me an ice cream.

345
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:08,457
Did you see Ha Ni yet?

346
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:10,599
I can't get in touch with her.

347
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,663
She wouldn't be causing trouble, right?

348
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:15,916
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

349
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,887
You're a boxer.

350
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,194
- Move your shoulder forward.
- Like this?

351
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:26,115
That didn't feel right.

352
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:28,347
That's not how you do it.

353
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,004
- Your shoulder.
- My shoulder?

354
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:35,905
It feels so awkward.

355
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:02,181
Oh Ji Na, this is all your fault.

356
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:17,777
Ji Na!

357
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,485
Rok Hui!

358
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:29,660
Rok Hui, are you okay?

359
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,241
Rok Hui.

360
00:25:32,452 --> 00:25:34,705
I...

361
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:36,925
I hit Rok Hui...

362
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:41,071
- Rok Hui!
- Rok Hui!

363
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:42,713
- What do we do?
- Rok Hui.

364
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,133
- What happened?
- Are you all right?

365
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,885
- The flower pot fell.
- Oh my gosh.

366
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:47,678
- What should we do?
- Are you all right?

367
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:49,519
Are you all right?

368
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:17,166
Rok Hui, I'm sorry.

369
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,839
It's my fault...

370
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,312
How did I end up like this?

371
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:26,646
I only wanted to be your friend,

372
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:30,549
but I hurt you like this.

373
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,642
What should I do about myself?

374
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:37,556
I wish you could just forget about me.

375
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:52,382
Hey, Ban Ha Ni, what are you doing here?

376
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:58,477
I was worried that Rok Hui might have gotten badly hurt.

377
00:26:58,477 --> 00:27:01,291
You were worried? You're the one who did this.

378
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,553
You're so shameless.

379
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:08,509
It's so noisy.

380
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:10,651
I can't sleep because of this noise.

381
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:14,293
Rok Hui, you're awake.

382
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:17,687
What are you doing? Don't hug me.

383
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:21,021
Rok Hui, I'm sorry.

384
00:27:21,021 --> 00:27:22,912
I'm so sorry.

385
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,994
Who...

386
00:27:28,318 --> 00:27:31,300
Who are you? Why are you apologizing to me?

387
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:35,354
Rok Hui, what's wrong?

388
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:38,417
I said I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

389
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,421
Forgive?

390
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:42,111
Forgive you for what?

391
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:46,126
Rok Hui, are you joking around?

392
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:49,880
Why would I joke around with someone I just met?

393
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,802
I'm Ha Ni, Ban Ha Ni.

394
00:27:51,802 --> 00:27:55,373
I followed you wherever you went. Do you really not remember me?

395
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:03,382
You're lying. There's no way you can forget about me.

396
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:06,316
Remember me. Remember my name!

397
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:10,500
Stop. What are you doing to a patient?

398
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,440
Get out.

399
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:28,898
That's right.

400
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:31,992
Rok Hui ended up like that because of you, Ha Ni.

401
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:36,426
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Enter target's name

402
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:42,832
Remember me.

403
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:44,644
Ban Ha Ni

404
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:51,070
Target meets all conditions.
We will proceed with the revenge.

405
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,899
Thankfully, it wasn't a direct blow, so she didn't suffer any severe injuries.

406
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:00,550
But we need to keep an eye on her recovery,

407
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,552
so she'll have to be hospitalized for a few days.

408
00:29:02,552 --> 00:29:04,705
Thank you.

409
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:08,378
We met last time, didn't we?

410
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,560
We're seeing each other often.

411
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,212
Yes.

412
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:14,343
You have been selected as a revenge target.

413
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:18,918
Revenge? What's this?

414
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:36,835
What's wrong with this?

415
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:41,190
Why is it doing this?

416
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:46,044
No!

417
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,859
Is it all right for you to come out like this?

418
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:01,611
I'm fine. I didn't suffer any severe injuries.

419
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:07,456
Is your memory still the same?

420
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:10,109
I guess so.

421
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,902
The doctor says it's temporary

422
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:14,985
and my memory will come back soon,

423
00:30:14,985 --> 00:30:17,656
but I don't care even if it doesn't come back.

424
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:22,382
Is Ban Ha Ni still the only one that you don't remember?

425
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:24,984
Yes. Even I think it's so strange.

426
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:27,487
Why is she the only one I can't remember?

427
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:29,418
By the way, isn't her name hilarious?

428
00:30:29,418 --> 00:30:31,361
It sounds like "bunny."

429
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:33,692
It was so funny when I first heard it.

430
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:54,934
Is she all right?

431
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:01,601
Ro Bin, your smile cheers me up.

432
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:05,124
If a vitamin was a human, it would be you.

433
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:11,141
I can do it.

434
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:13,032
I can do it.

435
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:35,475
I heard you visited Rok Hui in the hospital.

436
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:38,658
Yes, Rok Hui has gotten a lot better.

437
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:41,572
What about you? Are you all right?

438
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:43,534
I'm all right.

439
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,516
But I feel like it happened because of me.

440
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:47,556
I feel bad.

441
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:06,185
What is this?

442
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:10,090
I'm crying.

443
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,313
Hey, Seo Ro Bin, what is this?

444
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:13,894
I wanted to cheer you up.

445
00:32:13,894 --> 00:32:17,396
You said that my pictures cheer you up.

446
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:26,808
Sa Na, that little—

447
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:28,560
That wasn't me.

448
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,411
I think it was Sa Na joking around.

449
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:35,553
Erase it immediately.

450
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,818
But it did cheer me up. Thanks.

451
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:41,160
It was the biggest laugh of my 17 years of life.

452
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,994
You better not tell the other kids.

453
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:00,539
Gosh, why did I send that?

454
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:11,250
I shouldn't have sent it. Why did I do that?

455
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,423
It's driving me crazy.

456
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,387
Rok Hui, are you all right now?

457
00:33:27,387 --> 00:33:29,849
Yes, I'm very healthy.

458
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,972
Oh, brother!

459
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:34,374
With you gone, I couldn't even see Ha Ni. It was so boring.

460
00:33:34,374 --> 00:33:35,775
Then is Ha Ni coming back too?

461
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:37,938
You guys are clueless, aren't you?

462
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:40,610
Ha Ni dropped out of school yesterday. You didn't even know?

463
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,442
No way. Why?

464
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:47,867
- Is it true?
- Why are you asking me?

465
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:50,189
I wonder if she went back to the States.

466
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:52,452
I don't know.

467
00:33:52,452 --> 00:33:55,925
- Ha Ni.
- Ha Ni, no!

468
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:58,628
- I miss Ha Ni.
- Come back.

469
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,950
Me too.

470
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,541
Should we go to the States?

471
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,294
- How much is it?
- I don't know. It's really expensive.

472
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:10,060
We can't go. What do we do?

473
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,392
Your revenge is complete.

474
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:21,361
Why are you asking me?

475
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:23,744
I wonder if she went back to the States.

476
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:25,906
I thought she couldn't remember.

477
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,538
That's so funny.

478
00:34:27,538 --> 00:34:30,220
What is that?

479
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,753
She never forgot about Ha Ni?
