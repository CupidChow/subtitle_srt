~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,900
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:32,953
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,599
Take this.

5
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,378
Daemin Strawberry Milk

6
00:00:48,378 --> 00:00:51,300
There are several kinds of milk in this world,

7
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,304
but the milk I want to give you is "I love you."

8
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,390
These are my feelings for you.

9
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,169
Oh, my.

10
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:02,392
Thanks so much. I'm so touched.

11
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:06,540
Did you think I'd say that?

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,672
Sorry, but you're the farthest thing from my ideal type.

13
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:17,075
So you can forget your feelings.

14
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:19,119
What don't you like about me?

15
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,371
What is your ideal type?

16
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:27,516
You see,

17
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:30,380
my ideal type is...

18
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:42,572
a guy who jumps with his long legs

19
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:46,855
and grabs the rebound first while playing basketball.

20
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:52,752
With his veins bulging out of his arms

21
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:57,195
and his Adam's apple moving every time he takes a sip of his drink.

22
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:10,439
I like it when it moves in a sexy way.

23
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:13,944
So basically,

24
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:16,586
everything that's not you.

25
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,538
All right, bye.

26
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:27,947
You're so popular, Oh Sa Na.

27
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,779
Whatever. I have no interest in little kids.

28
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,202
I'm so annoyed.

29
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:35,123
- Let's go get some tteokbokki.
- Let's go.

30
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:38,678
That's right.

31
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:40,529
He is cute though.

32
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,380
Get out of the way!

33
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:57,637
Sa Na, are you okay?

34
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,631
Yes, Oppa.

35
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,612
You're not hurt, are you?

36
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:05,995
That was a close one.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,882
Why is my heart beating so fast?

38
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:15,445
Was Oppa Je Yi always this hot?

39
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,862
I'm okay, Oppa.

40
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:27,417
Poor thing. You must have been startled.

41
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,638
At least you're not hurt.

42
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,602
I'll get going now. Bye.

43
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:39,687
That's how I had my first love at the age of 15.

44
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,330
Oh, my gosh. Who is that guy?

45
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,183
He's so hot.

46
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:46,015
"Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?"

47
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:48,647
He's so dreamy!

48
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:50,699
What's your relationship with him?

49
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,151
Are you...

50
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,975
He lives next door to me. He treats me well.

51
00:03:54,975 --> 00:03:56,646
- Oh, my gosh!
- I'm so jealous!

52
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,658
I want to move into your building.

53
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:01,181
I'm really jealous.

54
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:09,008
You're not hurt, are you?

55
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:11,430
That was a close one.

56
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:18,166
Poor thing. You must have been startled.

57
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,229
At least you're not hurt.

58
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:27,246
Hey, Sa Na.

59
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:28,697
Are you going crazy?

60
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:31,479
Mind your own business.

61
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,333
Anyway, why are you pretending to study these days?

62
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,146
I've been putting in effort, but it's hard.

63
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:41,239
How do you solve this one again?

64
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,542
- Should I ask Je Yi? - No!

65
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,990
You scared me. What's wrong with you?

66
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:49,048
You see, the thing is...

67
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:52,051
Asking that kind of stuff this late at night is rude.

68
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:54,223
Stop talking to me. I'm busy.

69
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:56,355
I wasn't talking to you though.

70
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:11,481
My first love finally came to me.

71
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:13,272
Je Yi Observatory Diary

72
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:17,045
His name is Seo Je Yi.

73
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,012
Hi.

74
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:25,935
Oppa Je Yi's smile,

75
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:29,488
just like the cream inside my favorite strawberry cream puff,

76
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:32,332
- is soft and sweet.
- Bye.

77
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:36,926
Hi, Ji Na.

78
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:38,747
- Hi.
- But...

79
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:43,201
I don't like how he smiles like that for other girls, too.

80
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,367
Oppa Je Yi likes to read books on the rooftop.

81
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,040
Could he have been an angel?

82
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,252
Oh, no!

83
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:15,896
- Gosh.
- Oh, my. This is a twist.

84
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:18,637
Oppa Je Yi is afraid of bugs?

85
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,319
But even him being scared

86
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,961
is just so cute.

87
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,559
I caught it. You're scared again?

88
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,269
- I should just...
- Hey, hey!

89
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,202
You're scared of this? What's so scary about this?

90
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,815
Stop it.

91
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:37,756
I told you to stop. Gosh.

92
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,779
I was going to catch it for him.

93
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,274
That airhead Ji Na is getting on my nerves.

94
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,681
Sa Na, eat up.

95
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:57,025
I think Oppa Je Yi has already opened up his heart to me.

96
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,929
Giving up the chicken leg is a sign

97
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:02,981
that he's able to sacrifice everything.

98
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:06,790
Thanks.

99
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,691
I think Oh Ji Na is going to get in the way of my love.

100
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,916
Oh Ji Na!

101
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:25,616
Oh Ji Na.

102
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:32,962
Gosh!

103
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:36,515
Sa Na, let's go eat at your aunt's place.

104
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:38,247
Okay.

105
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,546
I hate my nose.

106
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,273
I have a flat nose because I take after you.

107
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,995
You don't look like me.

108
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,836
You're a total duplicate of your dad.

109
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:59,599
- No way.
- You are.

110
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:07,025
Why didn't they finish this? What a waste.

111
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:12,522
I see you're hitting the booze early in the day.

112
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:15,975
It's not that. This was left over by a customer.

113
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,848
It just seemed like a waste.

114
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:19,228
Wait a minute.

115
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:21,120
Sa Na, wait here.

116
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:26,936
Take this, Sa Na.

117
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:29,260
You like ice cream, right?

118
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:31,771
I don't want it. I'm not a kid.

119
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:34,844
Hey, just take it. You must be having a hard time studying.

120
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:39,317
Keep it in the freezer and share it with your sister later.

121
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:43,721
You're getting prettier by the day just like your mom.

122
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,404
She doesn't look like me.

123
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:47,626
She's a complete copy of her dad!

124
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,298
Let's go. Hurry.

125
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,343
Take this and eat it later.

126
00:08:56,596 --> 00:09:00,400
Fine. The ice cream did nothing wrong.

127
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:04,204
Try it.

128
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:09,840
Since we brought the sandwiches, you'll be providing the coffee, right?

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,550
No.

130
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,403
Just pay for it. I'll give you a coupon.

131
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:17,426
You little wench.

132
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,903
It's a shame we couldn't see each other because of my sudden business trip.

133
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:27,176
Here's a photo of the Parisian sky with my warm regards.

134
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,299
Oh, gosh.

135
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:32,831
I can't believe it.

136
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:34,033
Am I late?

137
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,136
You're even prettier than your pictures.

138
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:38,688
Shall we have dinner together?

139
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:45,684
He sent me the Parisian sky.

140
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:47,967
- You're still talking to that guy?
- Yes.

141
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,688
He went on a business trip

142
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:52,231
and sent me a picture of the Parisian sky.

143
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,043
He must be head over heels for me.

144
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,285
Oh, my gosh.

145
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:57,556
You said you were foaming at the mouth then.

146
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,039
Are you sure he's not a weirdo?

147
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,650
Shut up. You little...

148
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,663
You see,

149
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:06,174
when it comes to a man and a woman,

150
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,948
you need an intense moment

151
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:10,750
to really fall in love.

152
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:18,708
Sa Na, are you okay?

153
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,560
That's true. You're right.

154
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:48,747
Hey, what's with the laughing?

155
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:49,960
Give me that.

156
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,070
I can't.

157
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,151
I said give it to me!

158
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,770
Hey! Are you guys rating the girls based on their looks?

159
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,861
- What?
- Are you serious?

160
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,605
Why you little...

161
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,365
Seriously?

162
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,417
Na Na Ri's face is like a mandu*.
(steamed dumpling)

163
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,630
She looks exactly like a dim sum.

164
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,401
Don't you think so? It's so funny.

165
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:15,865
What? Why am I a mandu?

166
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:17,756
My gosh!

167
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:22,201
Park Saem Na looks like a pickle.

168
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,124
- Her face is super long.
- Gosh!

169
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:26,376
A pickle?

170
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,478
Bae Sin Ae is pretty, but she looks old.

171
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,269
She looks like an eldest sister.

172
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:32,081
Ji Na.

173
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:34,553
- Do I look old?
- No way.

174
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,175
Jeong Bo Ra looks like my aunt.

175
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,188
My eldest aunt was born in 1958.

176
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,999
What? I look like your aunt?

177
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,381
My aunt is super pretty.

178
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:46,185
What's so funny? You guys are all trash!

179
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,207
Geum Su Ji has a crappy personality,

180
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,359
but she has the best face.

181
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,712
Nah... She would look bad without makeup.

182
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,374
Gross.

183
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:57,307
Hey, Gang Ha Jun. What did you say about my makeup?

184
00:11:57,307 --> 00:12:00,799
- What about Ha Rok Hui?
- Is she even a girl, though?

185
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,783
No, please. Don't hurt me.

186
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:05,490
I'm sorry. I really am!

187
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,538
- You want to die?
- I'm sorry.

188
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:27,096
Bonjour.

189
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,518
Bonjour mademoiselle.

190
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:31,830
What's with the boys today?

191
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,213
Did you all get beaten up or something?

192
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:40,279
Today, we are learning an expression

193
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,120
that you use when you meet a beautiful person.

194
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:47,747
Si belle*.
("So beautiful" in French)

195
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,018
Si belle.

196
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,790
- Si belle.
- Si belle.

197
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,982
The next expression is used

198
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:55,104
when you meet a handsome man.

199
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:56,725
What could it be?

200
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:59,238
Change the adjective to a masculine form

201
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,740
and add "homme"* at the end.
("man" in French)

202
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,493
Si bel homme.

203
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,765
Si bel homme.

204
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,006
Si bel homme.

205
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:11,570
- Si bel homme.
- Si bel homme.

206
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,712
Let's see.

207
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,895
Lee Ha Yan, why don't you try?

208
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,530
Si bel homme.

209
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,362
Your pronunciation is a bit rough.

210
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:25,665
Let's see.

211
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:28,807
Ro Bin, why don't you try?

212
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:35,275
- Si bel homme.
- Wow, très bien! ("Very good" in French)

213
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:37,316
My goodness.

214
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,068
Your looks are exotic,

215
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,911
and your pronunciation is good as well.

216
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:43,382
Si bel homme. Good job.

217
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,494
Now, everyone. Si bel homme.

218
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:47,386
Si bel homme.

219
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:57,036
Guys.

220
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,739
You know that the amusement park field trip is tomorrow, right?

221
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,110
Yes.

222
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,104
Wear casual clothes and meet at 9 a.m., all right?

223
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,435
Yes.

224
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:06,746
You're excited, aren't you?

225
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:12,110
- Let's go and relieve all our stress tomorrow, yes?
- Yes.

226
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,366
Where are you going?

227
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,447
To the convenience store.

228
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:20,069
I'll buy some snacks for the field trip tomorrow.

229
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,431
Really? I should go buy some, too.

230
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,304
- Okay.
- What is this?

231
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:26,385
They're together again.

232
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,591
Oppa Je Yi, we've been running into each other a lot recently.

233
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,184
I know, right?

234
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,597
You're not even going to greet your own sister?

235
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:40,290
Seriously?

236
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:44,845
Hi, Ji Na.

237
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:46,690
Hello.

238
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,007
Hello.

239
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:50,309
Sure.

240
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:54,804
Sa Na.

241
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:00,829
I'm going to get the same thing as you.

242
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,852
Mister, do you have milk tea here?

243
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:14,043
If it's not there, we don't have it.

244
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,976
Choose quickly and close the fridge door.

245
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:17,630
Ah, sure.

246
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:21,239
Why do you keep looking? Close the door.

247
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,871
What's with him?

248
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:25,454
Je Yi, your skin is so nice.

249
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:28,737
Nice skin? He just looks pale.

250
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:32,122
How can a guy have such pale skin? Gosh.

251
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:36,050
My goodness.

252
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,052
It won't open? Give it to me.

253
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:45,654
I'll open it for you.

254
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:54,453
This is so strange. Hold on.

255
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,116
Forget it. Just give it to me.

256
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:57,426
Should I give it a try?

257
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:59,949
This one is weird. Try another one.

258
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:07,015
Nice.

259
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:12,441
Gosh, he's all brawn and no brains.

260
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,364
He's useless.

261
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:15,954
What?

262
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:29,128
What's taking so long? Move.

263
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,880
What's with you?

264
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:35,785
You're getting on my nerves, Oh Ji Na.

265
00:16:36,856 --> 00:16:38,727
What's her problem?

266
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:40,269
That's right.

267
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:43,733
Who said you could wear my clothes?

268
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,355
The sleeves and collar are stretched out now!

269
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,992
You only wear this at home. It was already stretched out.

270
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,205
You're wrong! I wear it when I go out, too.

271
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:58,127
Just don't wear my clothes!

272
00:16:58,127 --> 00:17:00,549
What's with that girl?

273
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:03,500
Hey, you wear my clothes, too.

274
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:07,336
What's with her? Puberty must have hit her hard.

275
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:24,864
Who turned off the lights?

276
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:26,926
- Hey, Oh Sa Na!
- Oh, my.

277
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:29,038
I didn't know someone was in there.

278
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,263
But you can still take a dump even with the lights off, right?

279
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:35,593
Just do it.

280
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:37,456
- Hey, get over here.
- Mom.

281
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,708
- Ji Na is hitting me.
- What now?

282
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,819
Both of you be quiet.

283
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:42,523
- Give this to your aunt.
- Mom, Eonni is...

284
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:44,754
Shut your mouth.

285
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,287
Go quickly.

286
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:55,055
Oh, my gosh. You're still talking to that guy?

287
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:56,957
I am.

288
00:17:56,957 --> 00:18:00,590
He sent me a picture of the Parisian sky.

289
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,203
Isn't it so romantic?

290
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:05,916
Seeing as he goes on business trips to Europe,

291
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,526
he must be really successful.

292
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:11,261
Of course. Doesn't he already look smart?

293

Hey!

00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,457
Don't mess it up this time.

296
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,898
Don't get all drunk and messy again.

297
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,180
Hey.

298
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,964
You make it sound like I'm some drunk, messy girl.

Hi, girls.

302
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:34,874
This is from Mom.

303
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:36,637
- Just leave it there.
- Oh, my.

304
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:40,009
Ji Na, you've gotten so big. You're a grown woman now.

- Hello.
- Hello.

Sa Na, you've grown a lot, too.

Ji Na, you've gotten so pretty.

308
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,441
I know, right? She's a new woman now that she's in high school.

309
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,754
Not at all. You're all more elegant.

310

Oh, my. You even talk like a lovely woman.

311

- She was.
- Now that she's older,

313
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:06,495
she looks a bit different. Doesn't she?

314
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,760
We'll get going then. Goodbye.

315
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:15,926
Gosh, how annoying!

316
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:18,357
Why are those ajummas rating my looks?

- Gosh.
- Oh Sa Na, wait for me.

Hey!

321
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,408
We'll now begin rating your looks.

322
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,579
Everyone, send in your pictures quickly.

323
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,673
If you send them in quickly, we can rate your looks right away.

324
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:46,725
We've got a picture.

325
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:49,948
What's this?

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,352
What on earth is this?

00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:55,805
You see the comments, right?

328
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:58,958
"Why are you so swollen? Did you eat ramen before going to bed?"

329
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,160
Don't send these kinds of pictures.

330
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,534
Send one where you actually look good. What is this?

331
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:06,587
Wait a minute. Don't rate my looks.

332
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:08,147
- Don't do that. 
- What's so funny?

333
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:10,960
- Don't rate his looks. Rate their looks.
- Don't rate my looks.

334
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,753
- Rate their looks.
- Why are you watching stuff like this?

335
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:16,286
- This is not a good picture.
- So what? Mind your own business!

336
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:17,726
You're so annoying.

337
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,130
That little...

338
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,773
I should write her name in Revenge Note.

339
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:29,309
I'm letting you off the hook this time.

340
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,700
Gosh.

341
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,690
I won't let that happen.

342
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,065
If you continue to stay quiet, what about Ro Bin?

343
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:47,560
You want him to continue being called a thief?

344
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:51,350
Aren't you tired from worrying about other people like this?

345
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,334
It must be in my nature. It doesn't tire me at all.

346
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:04,144
Seo Ro Bin!

347
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:17,937
Do you want me to teach you a bit?

348
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,810
I'm not sure about this.

349
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,493
I really don't know this one.

350
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:27,617
Maybe our textbooks are different.

351
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:30,379
For the first question, I got it wrong.

352
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:34,724
For the second question, I was so close to getting it right.

353
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,395
I'm going to make some ramen. Do you want some?

354
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:58,398
- No.
- Don't try to eat some of mine then.

355
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,456
Eat up.

356
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:49,170
You quit your part-time job, right?

357
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:54,730
If Mom finds out, she'd be worried.

358
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:56,865
Don't do that job.

359
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,737
Mom, please buy me a smartphone. Other kids—

360
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:20,861
If I buy you one, you're going to play games and not study.

361
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:23,724
Mom, when have you ever seen me play games?

362
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:26,896
I might've looked at pictures of idols*, but I've never played games. (*Korean pop singers/dancers)

363
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:28,779
Go away. It's hot.

364
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:31,291
Then rank first in your class.

365
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,994
Why do you want me to rank first in class all of a sudden?

366
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:37,377
Mom, please buy me a smartphone. Just once.

367
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:40,490
Rank first in your class. Just once.

368
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,913
Mom, please buy me a smartphone.

369
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,345
Pipe down.

370
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:47,687
Mom, I'm the only one without a smartphone.

371
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,689
Everybody else has a smartphone.

372
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:55,374
- It's so hot today.
- I know.

373
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:56,876
I'm so excited.

374
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:02,212
What about Ji Na? Where is she?

375
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:04,655
- Oh Ji Na!
- Why are you so late?

376
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:06,617
You need to walk faster.

377
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,597
- Sorry.
- Everyone, get together.

378
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:10,180
- Why?
- Well...

379
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,791
- We need to take our first picture.
- With what?

380
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,642
With the camera.

381
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:15,115
Here we go.

382
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:17,628
- Do a funny face.
- Make it super funny.

383
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,641
Let's go!

384
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,475
I'm so excited!

385
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:28,038
- Oh, my.
- Hey.

386
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:30,250
- Let's take a picture there.
- Let's do it.

387
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,731
Let's go.

388
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,396
- Ready?
- Rok Hui, a little lower.

389
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:38,127
- Say "cheese."
- Look at the camera.

390
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:41,311
- Look over there.
- One, two, three.

391
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:43,322
Hashtag amusement park, field trip,

392
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:46,445
Charlie's Angels, who's the prettiest?

393
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,443
It's boring if we just ride it. Let's do a dare.

394
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:55,055
How does this sound?

395
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:57,886
Let's see who can put on lipstick while riding it.

396
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,312
I'm down. That sounds hilarious.

397
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:06,336
- I'll do yours for you.
- Don't you dare.

398
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:17,426
Oh, no!

399
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,729
Good job!

400
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:23,703
This is scary.

401
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:26,406
This is too much.

402
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,859
Get me off this ride.

403
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,692
You're one to talk. Look at your teeth.

404
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:35,193
That is so funny.

405
00:25:35,193 --> 00:25:37,507
- How'd you get it on so nice?
- What's with her?

406
00:25:37,507 --> 00:25:40,010
- She did it so nicely.
- I did it perfectly, didn't I?

407
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,791
- I'm good at this.
- Look at her.

408
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,905
- You look so funny.
- I tried really hard, okay?

409
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:47,107
- Let's take a picture.
- Okay.

410
00:25:47,107 --> 00:25:48,738
- Everyone, get together.
- This is hilarious.

411
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:50,409
This is so fun.

412
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:51,731
Okay.

413
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:54,313
One, two, three.

414
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,595
Everyone, let's go ride the boomerang.

415
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:57,927
- That one's scary.
- It's super fun.

416
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:00,269
- It's scary.
- It sounds fun though.

417
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,232
You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.

418
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:04,873
- Go ahead.
- Hurry and come.

419
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,825
- Let's go.
- I'm excited.

420
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,989
Why are you crying? Who made you cry?

421
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:11,461
My balloon...

422
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,504
I'll get it for you. No more crying, okay?

423
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:21,831
There.

424
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:23,363
Here you go.

425
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:25,205
Thank you.

426
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:28,117
- Thank you.
- No problem.

427
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,792
This looks delicious. Thank you.

428
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:43,373
Are you a freshman?

429
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:45,185
Yes.

430
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:48,760
Aren't you bored by yourself? Hang out with me.

431
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:51,360
It's okay. I came with my friends.

432
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,523
Why not? We'll make sure you have lots of fun.

433
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,336
Why are you doing this?

434
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:01,120
You waited a long time, didn't you?

435
00:28:02,142 --> 00:28:04,063
I did.

436
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:05,624
Let's go.

437
00:28:09,548 --> 00:28:11,251
Thanks, Je Yi.

438
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:13,063
Why are you walking around alone?

439
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:14,984
Something else got my attention.

440
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,508
We're looking for the best couple in the area.

441
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,911
It's the hottest, heart-racing event.

442
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:23,292
We'll have five couples come up on stage.

443
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:24,975
Come on. We have one.

444
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:26,216
First Place Gets the Latest Smartphone

445
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:28,538
They're giving away the latest smartphone?

446
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:31,160
We're only having five couples.

447
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,774
- So we'll be taking one more pair.
- Are there any couples out there?

448
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:36,086
Here is our last couple. Come up on stage.

449
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:38,929
Look at this good-looking couple, a handsome guy and a beautiful girl.

450
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:41,191
Let's give them a round of applause. Great.

451
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:46,056
We've got a handsome guy over here.

452
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:47,537
Who are you and where are you from?

453
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:51,111
Please give us a brief self-introduction.

454
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:54,293
My name is Seo Je Yi and I'm from Hagok-dong.

455
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:57,446
We've got Seo Je Yi from Hagok-dong.

456
00:28:57,446 --> 00:29:00,320
Hey, isn't that the guy who lives next door to you?

457
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,802
What's the prettiest part of your girlfriend?

458
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:05,225
Oh, my gosh. He has a girlfriend?

459
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:06,806
What?

460
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:08,297
Is it because she's pretty all-over?

461
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:11,110
She has pretty eyes, a pretty nose, and a pretty mouth.

462
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,763
That makes her pretty all-over. Okay.

463
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:16,015
Isn't that your sister?

464
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:18,157
Oh, my gosh. They're dating?

465
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,469
That's crazy.

466
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:20,830
Hey.

467
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,022
Why would they be dating?

468
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:25,875
They're just friends. They're close friends.

469
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,778
Oh Sa Na, are you jealous right now?

470
00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:31,160
Who said I was jealous?

471
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,322
Sure, whatever. This is crazy.

472
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:36,546
What game are we playing next?

473
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:40,490
Everyone knows this game. It's the Pepero game.

474
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,031
Pepero game!

475
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,454
All right. Please, tell us the rules of this game.

476
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:45,595
Take one.

477
00:29:45,595 --> 00:29:48,437
If things get too steamy and you eat it all, you're out.

478
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:50,990
Whoever has the shortest cookie in the end is the winner.

479
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,123
So if their lips touch, they're out.

480
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:55,454
Everyone, get ready.

481
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:57,708
Start.

482
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:25,786
Let's go. This is boring.

483
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:29,639
Come on. Let's watch some more.

484
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:31,770
I said let's go.

485
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,894
I guess Oh Sa Na really is jealous.

486
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:36,597
- Hey!
- It's getting good.

487
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:39,178
- Come on. More!
- Nice.

488
00:30:39,178 --> 00:30:40,830
If it falls, you're out.

489
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,582
All right. Keep it up.

490
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:44,364
Just a little more.

491
00:30:48,748 --> 00:30:52,332
Hey! Where did you go? I was looking for you.

492
00:30:52,332 --> 00:30:55,265
