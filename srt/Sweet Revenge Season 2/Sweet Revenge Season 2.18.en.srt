00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:59,739
Mom

5
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:04,794
- Yes, Mom.
- Je Yi,

6
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:07,828
how are you? Are you eating well?

7
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:10,579
Of course. Don't worry about me.

8
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:13,923
I'll be there soon, so hang in there.

9
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:17,626
I'm doing fine. I even got the highest scores on the final exams.

10
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:20,139
That's amazing.

11
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:23,282
But I'm a bit disappointed to hear

12
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:25,945
that you're doing so well without me.

13
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,848
By the way, why isn't Ro Bin picking up my calls?

14
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:31,620
Tell him to call me once in a while.

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,083
I will.

16
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,130
Ro Bin.

17
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:44,194
Seo Ro Bin.

18
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:47,947
Hey,

19
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:50,870
how can you just fall asleep anywhere like that?

20
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,410
You should wipe your drool.

21
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to my part-time work.

22
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:58,257
Hey,

23
00:02:58,257 --> 00:03:00,390
you're just going to leave?

24
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,392
You're not going to practice some more?

25
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:16,000
This...

26
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,144
Miss Seon Hui,

27
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:37,726
cheers.

28
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,634
Are you not much of a drinker?

29
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,186
I'm not really used to it.

30
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,949
It's just a glass of wine.

31
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:52,391
You can relax when you're with me.

32
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:54,944
Let's do this again. Obama.

33
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,217
Why did you say "Obama"?

34
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:02,282
Because I'll take care of you the way he does. Obama.

35
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:07,556
Wait. Aren't I older than you?

36
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,610
Age is just a number.

37
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,675
You're so adorable.

38
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,637
I'll be the oppa you can rely on.

39
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,851
You're making me blush.

40
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,823
I'll be right back.

41
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:39,679
This tastes expensive.

42
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:54,022
I met someone really special recently.

43
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,606
I hope this song will

44
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,901
make her smile.

55
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,673
What's going on with Mi Nam?

56
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:08,238
He even ran away from home. What's going on?

57
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:11,471
Ro Bin, did he contact you by any chance?

58
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,461
No.

59
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,484
He isn't answering my calls.

60
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:17,927
Actually,

61
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,989
Mi Nam has been acting strange recently.

62
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,253
He kept smiling into his phone.

63
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:27,475
He said strange things about being in a special relationship with Mina.

64
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,059
[Jimin is so cool]

65
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,601
[Seolhyun is the best]

66
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,420
What are you doing?

67
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,308
What?

68
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,720
It's nothing.

69
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:46,580
What is it? What's making you smile?

70
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,808
Well...

71
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,721
It's supposed to be a secret.

72
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:57,526
Actually, Mina and I have

73
00:06:57,526 --> 00:07:00,069
a very special relationship.

74
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,632
- What?
- How?

75
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,089
You saw it, right?

76
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,573
Saw what?

77
00:07:14,573 --> 00:07:18,897
You have to promise not to tell anyone.

78
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:23,682
It's a special heart sign that Mina is making for me.

79
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:26,756
Sorry to make you two feel left out, but it's true.

80
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:28,757
You guys must be so upset.

81
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:30,460
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,654
But this is part of the regular choreography.

83
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,365
No, it's different from the usual.

84
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:38,017
The heart is bigger.

85
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:40,970
And when she winks, it's more pronounced. Can't you see it?

86
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,742
Let's say that it is.

87
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:47,037
But why would she send you a sign?

88
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:48,677
That's...

89
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,892
a secret.

90
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:56,055
I wondered if he was losing his mind.

91
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,628
Isn't that pretty serious?

92
00:07:57,628 --> 00:08:00,400
It is. I thought it was because he's such a huge fan.

93
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,573
But, a few days ago, he asked me if I could lend him money.

94
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:08,410
Really? He borrowed money from me too.

95
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,669
I lent him some too.

96
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:13,532
Actually, so did I.

97
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:15,084
I was going to keep it a secret.

98
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:16,897
How much did he borrow?

99
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,588
- That's what I'm wondering.
- Why...

100
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:21,760
didn't he ask me?

101
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,740
He probably thought you'd beat him up.

102
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:29,538
He hasn't gotten into an accident or anything, right?

103
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:34,572
I don't think that's the case. Don't worry.

104
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:37,607
He ran away from home, but his love for them never ends.

105
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:40,739
He reposted an AOA video 37 minutes ago.

106
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:44,915
That's right. I heard AOA has interviews at their management company today.

107
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:48,318
Really? Then maybe Mi Nam went there.

108
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,693
Oh, right. I have to go to the hagwon* today.
(cram school)

109
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:58,197
And I have to go to the gym.

110
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:01,600
- Bye.
- Sorry.

111
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:07,066
Ro Bin, won't you come with us?

112
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,477
I'm not going.

113
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:12,671
- He could have said that nicely.
- Rude.

114
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:19,968
An Mi Nam keeps bothering me.

115
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,962
Hey, I'll go with you.

116
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:33,522
It's Mi Nam.

117
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,807
That's him.

118
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:39,439
- Mi Nam!
- Hush.

119
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:41,371
Let's follow him first.

120
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,552
Mina's Future Husband

121
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,252
I don't see him. We must've lost him.

122
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:15,584
He's somewhere nearby though.

123
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,829
Police

124
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:30,279
There's been a misunderstanding.

125
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,881
I'm telling the truth.

126
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:38,006
It's Mi Nam. What should we do?

127
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:40,100
Let's find out what's going on.

128
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,922
No, let's contact Ms. Maeng first.

129
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:47,036
It's better if she goes to the police station.

130
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:51,410
Police

131
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,480
Mi Nam.

132
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,530
Teacher Maeng!

133
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,326
I'm his homeroom teacher.

134
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:07,536
What's going on?

135
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:11,511
He was trying to sneak into a girl group's apartment.

136
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:13,893
- What?
- I told you, that's not true.

137
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:16,717
Mina caught a cold, so I was going to give her medicine.

138
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,959
It's not trespassing. I was just going to surprise her.

139
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,913
Mina and I have a special relationship.

140
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:26,305
You know there are countless students like him.

141
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:29,299
If it were up to me, I'd make him pay his dues in jail.

142
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:32,410
But I won't press charges, since he's a student.

143
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,756
Please make sure this doesn't happen again.

144
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:38,088
Yes. I apologize.

145
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,949
I'll make sure he understands.

146
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,931
I'm so sorry.

147
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:44,323
You should know that a sasaeng fan* isn't a real fan.
(an over-obsessive and invasive, stalking fan)

148
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:47,997
A sasaeng fan? Mina and I really have

149
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:50,229
a special relationship.

150
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,513
You must've had a long day. Let's head home for now.

151
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:04,915
I'll take you home.

152
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:06,566
Mi Nam!

153
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,463
How did you all get here?

154
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,799
Teacher, we'll take Mi Nam home.

155
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,301
Please don't worry. We'll take care of him.

156
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,824
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

157
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:26,875
I'll go with them.

158
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:30,199
All right, then. Go home with your friends.

159
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,270
We'll talk some more tomorrow.

160
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:44,123
Mi Nam, have you eaten?

161
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:49,960
You never skip a meal. How could you not eat?

162
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,781
Let's go eat something.

163
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,456
Enjoy your meal.

164
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:10,250
You know how to eat stuff like this?

165
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,602
Someone said it tastes good this way.

166
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,475
Mi Nam, what happened?

167
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:30,679
What have you been doing since you ran away? Tell us the truth.

168
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:36,535
There is a really famous AOA fan named Maem Ma Ma.

169
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:40,600
She told me about a secret account that Mina uses.

170
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:44,984
Since then, all these miracles started to happen.

171
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:52,111
You really became friends with AOA?

172
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:53,642
Yes.

173
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:57,777
Mina is having a hard time these days, so I've been talking to her a lot.

174
00:13:57,777 --> 00:13:59,920
We tell each other everything.

175
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,283
We have a special relationship.

176
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,285
We talk one-on-one every day through DMs.

177
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:08,158
DMs? So you haven't met in person?

178
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,659
Of course not. She's a celebrity.

179
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:14,373
She's so busy, and there are lots of people watching her.

180
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:18,727
Despite the risks, she still messages me.

181
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:24,524
Then how did you end up at the police station?

182
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,686
That's because...

183
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:33,042
It'd be nice to see you, even if for a little while.

184
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,734
It's probably too much to ask though.

185
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:39,028
Sorry. I'm not feeling well today,

186
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:41,471
so I can't go out.

187
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:47,598
Pharmacy

188
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:49,099
Mina was sick,

189
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:52,311
so I went to her apartment with some medicine to surprise her.

190
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:54,063
But the manager, who doesn't know anything,

191
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:57,005
reported me because he thought I was a sasaeng fan.

192
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:59,960
Am Mi Nam, don't you think someone might be pranking you?

193
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,281
Why would an idol star talk to a high schooler like you?

194
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:04,323
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Why doesn't it?

195
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:07,576
You want to see evidence? I'll show you.

196
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:16,996
Mina, have you eaten yet?

197
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:19,379
Please don't get sick, Mina.

198
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,412
Mi Nam, what about you?

199
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:23,883
I was so busy today. I'm so tired.

200
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:26,225
Your manager should really give you a break.

201
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,047
I'm sending you good wishes.

202
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:31,100
I'm so sorry. I couldn't think straight after the accident.

203
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,643
I couldn't rely on anyone except for you.

204
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,665
What's this?

205
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:36,947
No, it's okay.

206
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,487
Thanks for reaching out to me.

207
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:41,550
That person keeps contacting me. I'm scared.

208
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,253
What if I get kicked out of the group?

209
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:45,124
I just sent 3,500,000 won (≈ $3,150) to your account.

210
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:48,639
- You sent her 3,500,000 won?
 - Thank you so much.

211
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,210
You're the only one I can rely on now.

212
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,645
This isn't just a prank. It's a scam.

213
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:56,765
- Hey, Jeong Bo Ra!
- Mi Nam,

214
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:59,027
don't get upset.

215
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:01,790
Why did you send this money?

216
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,396
Mina was having a hard time.

217
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:10,839
She was driving and got into an accident.

218
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,833
She needed settlement money.

219
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:18,777
If her family or manager found out, she could've been kicked out of the group.

220
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,890
I was the only one she could rely on.

221
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,925
The money you borrowed from us couldn't have been enough, though.

222
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:27,790
I had money I'd been saving since I was little.

223
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:30,999
I also sold my camera.

224
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,903
Wasn't that your dad's?

225
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:38,397
She said she'd pay me back once she gets paid.

226
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,749
I'm going to pay you guys back too.

227
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,933
Nuna doesn't have anyone else to rely on right now.

228
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,716
I couldn't help it.

229
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,268
You're really out of your mind.

230
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:51,741
What kind of idol star would borrow money from a fan?

231
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:53,403
It doesn't make sense.

232
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:55,834
Why don't you believe me?

233
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,908
I'm going to pay you back. So mind your own business!

234
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:05,215
Mi Nam!

235
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,079
What do we do?

236
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,671
He's really convinced.

237
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:15,004
Was that the fan?

238
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:16,807
You're Mi Nam, right?

239
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:20,138
That's a very nice camera.

240
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,464
He's been acting strange

241
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:27,307
ever since he met her.

242
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:33,410
I'm suspicious of her.

243
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:39,080
How can they say that? They don't know anything.

244
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,783
Mina, are you feeling better?

245
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:57,407
Something really upsetting happened to me.

246
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,288
I'm feeling really down.

247
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,051
Hanjong High School

248
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:18,740
So this is what they've been doing?

249
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,192
We're all here because of you, so take a seat.

250
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:40,240
Mi Nam, we did some research.

251
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,332
There have been a few incidents like this before.

252
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,757
People pretend to be celebrities and trick people into sending them money.

253
00:18:46,757 --> 00:18:49,167
Who is the fan you were talking about?

254
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,430
Is she really someone you can trust?

255
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,734
Why are you being like this? Do I look that pathetic to you?

256
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:02,401
Mi Nam, we want to believe you too.

257
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,725
Why don't you ask Mina to meet you?

258
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:07,317
Tell her you bought a present for her that you want to give her personally.

259
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:10,119
Set up a meeting with her.

260
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,273
If you two really have something special, wouldn't she meet you?

261
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:17,077
You're also in a bad place right now.

262
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,848
It would cheer you up to see her.

263
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,295
Okay.

264
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:27,276
I'll try.

265
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:31,191
But if I prove it to you, you have to believe me.

266
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:35,264
Okay, I'll do it for you.

267
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:38,217
I'll lie to my manager to see you.

268
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:41,230
The café near the intersection is quiet. I'll wave to you from the second floor.

269
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,003
Stand in the street across from the café, okay?

270
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:46,145
Really? Thanks so much.

271
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:49,559
I'll ask the person at the counter to give you your present.

272
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:08,407
It's Mina.

273
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,581
I told you she would come to see me.

274
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,569
Thanks so much for making time to see me.

275
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:32,462
My manager are waiting for me, so this is all I can do.

276
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:33,792
I'm sorry.

277
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:37,086
I'm so happy I got to see you. I really am.

278
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:39,049
You should get going before my manager catch you.

279
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,040
Okay, I will.

280
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:02,182
Let's go.

281
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,620
You two should wait here.

282
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,594
We'll go in. Let's go.

283
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,820
This mask is so stuffy.

284
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,942
He's so annoying.

285
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:56,730
This is the present? How cheap.

286
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:02,280
He acted like he had all this money, but it was all for show.

287
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:07,436
I'll get about two million won (≈ $1,800) more from him and then finish up.

288
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,664
I knew it. Something smelled fishy.

289
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:27,467
You saw her wave to me, right?

290
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,419
Do you believe me now?

291
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:33,292
Mi Nam, take a deep breath and look at this.

292
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,612
This is the present? How cheap.

293
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,325
He acted like he had all this money, but it was all for show.

294
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,468
I'll get about two million won more from him and then finish up.

295
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,084
I can't believe it.

296
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:01,029
It's exactly as you just saw.

297
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:03,942
That fan was lying to you.

298
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:06,324
How...

299
00:23:06,324 --> 00:23:08,447
How can this be real?

300
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:14,625
Mi Nam!

301
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:18,168
For the videos I uploaded yesterday,

302
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:20,059
the deadline is tomorrow, so keep it in mind--

303
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:23,202
How can you do this to me? Did you lie to me?

304
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,553
Is that what happened?

305
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:27,807
- What are you saying, Mi Nam?
- Did you trick me for money?

306
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,269
Give me my money back!

307
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:33,132
It's a misunderstanding. Hold on.

308
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:47,620
You can report it to the police if you want.

309
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:51,890
But what do you think will happen to Mina if you do that?

310
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,010
I'm going to say that Mina made me do it. So you do what you want.

311
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,590
Why did you do that to me?

312
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:04,543
You looked gullible when you were bragging about your expensive camera.

313
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,977
Who do you think you are, anyway?

314
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:11,081
Did you really believe that an idol star would have a relationship with someone like you?

315
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:13,573
Get a grip.

316
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,224
Mi Nam, don't cry. Why are you crying?

317
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:28,127
I just feel so pathetic.

318
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:32,290
Everything she said is true.

319
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:34,434
I should have known.

320
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:37,236
What's wrong with being who you are?

321
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:39,709
The person who scammed you is the bad one.

322
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,992
That's right. Don't blame yourself.

323
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:43,842
To be honest,

324
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:46,770
I didn't have any friends until middle school.

325
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:50,280
Life for me was always lonely and difficult.

326
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:54,192
Listening to AOA songs by myself

327
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,636
was the one thing I liked to do.

328
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,050
Then one day,

329
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,294
I saw AOA filming near our school.

330
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:08,468
But

331
00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:12,350
some other students ignored me and pushed me to the back.

332
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,313
- Where do you want to go?
- Let's go to an Internet café.

333
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:16,436
Good idea. Mi Nam, hurry up!

334
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:18,348
- Gosh, keep up.
- Hurry.

335
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:21,281
- They're filming something over there.
- Let's go see.

336
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:23,533
- A shoot?
- Who is it?

337
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:28,037
I was the one carrying all their bags.

338
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:31,841
When they pushed me, I fell.

339
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,617
At that moment,

340
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:40,138
someone offered me a hand.

341
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,653
It was nuna Mina.

342
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,250
Are you all right?

343
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:50,420
Are you a fan? What's your name?

344
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,611
An Mi Nam.

345
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:54,763
That's a great name.

346
00:25:57,838 --> 00:26:00,020
What's going on?

347
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,632
- What show is this?
- What's going on?

348
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:03,863
- Who's that?
- My gosh.

349
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,296
What is happening?

350
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:10,500
Guys, look after Mi Nam, okay?

351
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,603
He's a really special fan to me.

352
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:26,566
That brief encounter

353
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:29,018
gave me so much courage.

354
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:32,112
And after that,

355
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:35,394
the other kids didn't look down on me.

356
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:39,758
That's how I became her fan.

357
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:43,123
I just wanted to help her too.

358
00:26:44,463 --> 00:26:48,880
Maybe that's why I fell for the scam so easily.

359
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:57,466
Don't cry.

360
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:59,117
Stop crying.

361
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,730
You didn't do anything wrong.

362
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,434
Her agency can't know about this, so keep it a secret.

363
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,408
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Enter target's name

364
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:20,399
I'm closest to Mina out of all the members.

365
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,223
I just sent 3,500,000 won to your account.

366
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:27,858
I'm going to say that Mina made me do it. So you do what you want.

367
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:30,549
I'll get about two million won more from him and then finish up.

368
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,313
Maem Ma Ma

369
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:35,576
Target meets all conditions.
We will proceed with the revenge.

370
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,632
Revenge Note,

371
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:44,873
please help my friend.

372
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:53,222
You have been selected as a revenge target.

373
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:56,656
What is this? How annoying.

374
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:09,838
My camera!

375
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,501
This was so expensive!

376
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,279
- Seolhyun.
- She's your favorite?

377
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,960
- Don't you like them all?
- Chanmi is the best.

378
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,883
- Chanmi is cute.
- Who's your favorite?

379
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:27,366
- You're young.
- She's great.

380
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:28,378
Hello.

381
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:30,469
Hi.

382
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:31,851
Hold on.

383
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:33,602
S.H.

384
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:36,500
This was my gift to Seolhyun.

385
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:39,179
No, I bought this myself.

386
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,330
Don't you see these initials?

387
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,532
- What's going on?
- What the heck?

388
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:45,434
Have you been taking the presents?

389
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:48,537
You said you would give them directly to the members.

390
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,700
Have you been taking all our gifts?

391
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,462
- Don't let her get away!
- Get her!

392
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:54,173
- Stop there!
- Hey!

393
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,405
- Let me go!
- You have to explain.

394
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:57,136
- Move!
- You're not going anywhere.

395
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,869
- What in the world...
- Move!

396
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:00,750
- Let go!
- Tell us the truth!

397
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,672
- These are all our gifts.
- Let go of me!

398
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:04,064
- Get a hold of her!
- Let go!

399
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:06,756
- Don't let her go!
- Why do you have all our presents?

400
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:08,287
- Let me go!
- You tricked us!

401
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:11,099
- We trusted you!
- Let me explain!

402
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:19,158
I'm here to meet Dr. Ho Gu Jun.

403
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,710
Oh, yes. Please wait here.

404
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:25,604
Were you looking for me?

405
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:29,308
May I ask who you are first?

406
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:30,791
Surprise! I'm Kim Jin Sil.

407
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,682
Did I surprise you, didn't I?

408
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:36,336
Ta-da! Look! I made a lunchbox for you.

409
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:37,577
Who are you?

410
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:42,091
Come on! Stop joking.

411
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:45,444
I guess you have the wrong person.

412
00:29:45,444 --> 00:29:48,048
We had our 100-day anniversary the other day.

413
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:50,550
You said you love me on social media yesterday.

414
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,051
Social media?

415
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:54,163
I don't have any social media account.

416
00:29:54,163 --> 00:29:57,285
What? What are you talking about?

417
00:29:57,285 --> 00:29:59,107
This is your photo, right?

418
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,793
This sure is my photo,

419
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:06,915
but I never sent anything like this.

420
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:09,458
Someone must have used my photo without permission.

421
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,121
I should report this to the police.

422
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:14,163
But I've got surgery to attend. I've got to go now.

423
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:17,076
Gu Jun! Gu Jun! Gu Jun!

424
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,159
I can't believe this.

425
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,554
Then, who the heck extorted my designer bag?

426
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:38,880
Your revenge is complete.

427
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:42,701
Revenge Note helped me this time too.

428
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:55,835
I'm getting suspicious of Ro Bin.

429
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:05,485
Ro Bin, is it you?

430
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:21,761
What?

431
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:23,882
Never mind. Go back to sleep.

432
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:33,151
What happened to the fan?

433
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:35,534
She got kicked out of the fan club,

434
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:38,558
and she paid for all the gifts she stole.

435
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:40,170
The management company pressed charges.

436
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,163
What about your money? Did you get it back?

437
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:47,280
They said my evidence was weak, so I didn't get all of it back.

438
00:31:47,955 --> 00:31:51,851
It's my fault, so I'm going to work on the weekends to pay you all back.

439
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:55,404
Of course you should. Pay me back with interest.

440
00:31:55,404 --> 00:31:59,048
I'm glad that it turned out okay. Don't feel too bad about it, Mi Nam.

441
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:02,152
Thanks. You guys really helped me.

442
00:32:03,432 --> 00:32:04,945
- They're so cute.
- Adorable.

443
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:05,985
- They're good.
- What a great duo.

444
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:07,326
- Look at them.
- Nice.

445
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:10,169
So are you still an active fan?

446
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:12,671
No, I'm going to take a break.

447
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:16,056
- Why?
- I fell for that ridiculous lie.

448
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:19,829
I feel sorry for Mina. I was so self-absorbed.

449
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:22,672
Who would like someone like me?

450
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,354
Why do you say that?

451
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:28,296
You're really cute. Cheer up, Mi Nam.

452
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,162
Be careful.

453
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:49,568
Remember what I'm about to say.

454
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,141
I'm a butterfly.

455
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:53,883
I'm a butterfly.

456
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:59,489
I'm a butterfly.

457
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:08,107
They're good.

458
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:20,830
You're good.

459
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:23,583
Do I look like a butterfly?

460
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:34,863
[Epilogue]
Hey, Mi Nam,

461
00:33:34,863 --> 00:33:37,666
starting today, you're taking a break from being an AOA fan.

462
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,349
Fine.

463
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,221
It's Mina from AOA.

464
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,794
Stop teasing me.

465
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:46,395
- Look!
- It's Mina!

466
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:48,177
It really is her.

467
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:49,589
I told you to stop teasing.

468
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:51,301
It's really her, though.

469
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,240
My goodness.

470
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:06,576
Did you see her?
