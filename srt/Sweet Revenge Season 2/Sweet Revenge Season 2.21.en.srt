~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:04,133
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:33,042
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,719
All right. Get in.

5
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,771
I'll ride up front.

6
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:55,695
You want to?

7
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:57,898
Sure, go ahead.

8
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:00,300
- Okay.
- Let's go.

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,971
Put your seat belts on.

10
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,979
Sam Sun has grown so much.

11
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:12,782
I thought she was a wolf at first.

12
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:14,583
Really?

13
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,037
Yes. And Grandma fed us so much.

14
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:18,858
I gained so much weight.

15
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:22,931
Aigoo. It doesn't look like it though.

16
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:27,296
It looks like you two had

17
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,511
a lot of delicious food at Grandma's house.

18
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,662
You both look a little rounder.

19
00:01:32,662 --> 00:01:33,893
Tell me about it.

20
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,687
Grandma fed us nonstop.

21
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:38,759
I'm so tired.

22
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,061
I gained 3 kg in three days. I need to go on a diet.

23
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:48,367
What's this?

24
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,371
Isn't this a man's sock?

25
00:01:52,282 --> 00:01:55,074
Mom, was Dad here?

26
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,536
Oh my.

27
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,380
No, it's mine.

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,822
But your feet are smaller than mine.

29
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,984
My feet have been swollen lately,

30
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:07,947
so I bought some bigger socks.

31
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,489
Who is it?

32
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,410
Seon Hui, it's me.

33
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,073
Oh, Gi Jun,

34
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:36,396
you startled me.

35
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:39,268
Why did you want to meet here?

36
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:43,442
Will you come with me?

37
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:50,870
Surprise.

38
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,148
Oh my gosh.

39
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,844
When did you prepare all this?

40
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:06,797
I just wanted to do something romantic.

41
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:09,479
It's for you, Seon Hui.

42
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:25,964
Seon Hui,

43
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,328
I love you.

44
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,429
Gi Jun,

45
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:43,191
thank you for this lovely balloon and the food.

46
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:46,176
Gi Jun,

47
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,278
I'm so moved.

48
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:51,199
Even your words are beautiful.

49
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,337
Seon Hui, could you wait a moment?

50
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:06,315
(Gibberish trying to pass for French)

51
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,097
Salut!
("Bye" in French)

52
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,724
Sorry about that.

53
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:29,178
Is there something going on?

54
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:31,171
It seemed serious.

55
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,233
Well, it's...

56
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:38,829
My company has an exclusive partnership with a French company

57
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,520
to supply organic snails

58
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,443
for escargot, the famous French dish.

59
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:47,087
But we don't have enough startup capital.

60
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,169
If we had enough investment, we'd be on the highway to success.

61
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,772
I see. For escargot...

62
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:56,926
Well...

63
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:59,458
How much do you need?

64
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:03,432
Maybe I could help.

65
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:06,916
I only told you this because I don't want us to have secrets.

66
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,839
I'm not the kind of man who borrows money from a woman.

67
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,931
Please don't say that ever again.

68
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:16,344
All right. I won't.

69

Package Tours

71
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:31,190
This one looks good.

Package Tour Deals

73
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,254
Package Tours

74
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:38,326
It's 700,000 won (≈ $630)?

75
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,601
Maybe I should get a part-time job.

76
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,769
Mom, was Dad here?

77
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,221
No, it's mine.

78
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:55,864
It was definitely Dad's sock.

79
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:58,968
If they go on a trip together,

80
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,300
their relationship will improve.

81
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:08,277
Bo Ra, I'm looking for a part-time job during the break.

82
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,899
Do you have any leads?

83
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,782
Of course I do.

84
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:15,325
I knew you would help.

85
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:19,519
- What kind of job is it?
- It's a weekend gig, but it pays well.

86
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,052
It's basically the boot camp of part-timers though.

87
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:25,644
It's hard work. Do you think you can do it?

88
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:56,967
I like Seo Je Yi

89
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:30,370
Hey, Seo Ro Bin, take out the recycling.

90
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,152
I'll do it later.

91
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:35,756
When? I've been doing it all this time.

92
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:39,288
- Later.
- It has to get done today.

93
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:47,967
Seo Ro Bin.

94
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:51,200
- What?
- Let's fight it out.

95
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,233
- You want to fight?
- Yes.

96
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:56,215
Let's fight.

97
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:58,236
Don't regret it later.

98
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,451
Look at these solid moves. Let's go!

99
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,334
Okay, try me!

100
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,706
It looks like someone has gotten rusty.

101
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:22,561
Get ready to take out the trash.

102
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,963
No, it's definitely going to be you!

103
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,220
Shoot.

104
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,585
- No.
- That's right!

105
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,593
You always try to fight even though you lose.

106
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,715
I'm going to borrow your charger.

107
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,462
Darn it.

108
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,810
I like Seo Je Yi

109
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,556
Wait!

110
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:28,529
Oh Ji Na Hanjong High School Class 1-1
August 8th: my birthday

111
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:36,896
Ji Na, what are you up to?

112
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:38,819
I'm starting a part-time job tomorrow,

113
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,179
so I'm getting ready.

114
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,314
A part-time job?

115
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:51,251
Yes, I want to work a bit before school starts again.

116
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:55,954
Would you mind if I joined you?

117
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,962
Really? That would be great.

118
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:04,344
But Bo Ra said it's a really tough job.

119
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:06,435
She said it's like boot camp.

120
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:11,189
That's okay. I want to try it too.

121
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:16,245
What are you doing?

122
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:18,827
Well... Nothing.

123
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,547
I shouldn't have bought this chocolate-flavored one.

124
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:29,198
I'm gaining more weight.

125
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:31,291
Look at all these calories.

126
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:34,934
That's a nice car.

127
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,527
I've never seen it here before.

128
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,533
I had such a good time today, Gi Jun.

129
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,758
Good night,

130
00:10:47,758 --> 00:10:49,159
baby.

131
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,603
Oh my. We're in front of my house.

132
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:56,065
I'm so embarrassed.

133
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:58,438
He must be her boyfriend.

134
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,169
What a surprise.

135
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:02,191
He's really handsome, though.

136
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,374
Shush, be quiet.

137
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:09,528
- Aunt Seon Hui.
- When did you get here?

138
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,432
Hello. I'm her niece, Oh Sa Na.

139
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:16,205
So you're Sa Na.

140
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:17,847
I've heard a lot about you.

141
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:21,391
Gosh, you look so joyful

142
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,874
just like your aunt.

143
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,484
Thank you.

144
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,318
Anyway, are you my aunt's boyfriend?

145
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:32,802
Yes, I am. You can call me Uncle.

146
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:38,909
Here's some pocket money for you.

147
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:42,512
You don't need to do that.

148
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:46,526
You didn't need to, but thank you.

149
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:49,589
I'm curious though.

150
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,881
Have you ever had drinks with my aunt?

151
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,575
Have you seen her old photos?

152
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:58,246
Gi Jun, I hope you have a good night.

153
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,930
Sleep well, Seon Hui.

154
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,923
Did I keep you waiting?

155
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:15,014
I'm heading there now.

156
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:17,085
I'm on my way.

157
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,318
Where is he?

158
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:32,412
Hey, how much is this?

159
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:34,353
It's 2,000 won (≈ $2).

160
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,671
- What about this?
-That's 1,400 won (≈ $1.30).

161
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:45,925
- What about the bulgogi one?
- That's also 1,400 won.

162
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,276
This too?

163
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:49,329
That's 2,300 won (≈ $2.10).

164
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,283
Your total is 5,000 won (≈ $4.50).

165
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,046
Here.

166
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:59,288
I have received 10,000 won (≈ $9).

167
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,273
Here is your change.

168
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:04,974
When did you get here?

169
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,709
- What are you doing?
- Why, did you not like that?

170
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:12,221
You tossed your bill at him, so I did the same thing.

171
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,462
- Eun Hui.
- Why? How did it feel?

172
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:16,556
You spoke impolitely and even tossed the bill.

173
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:19,679
Rude customers in convenience stores can be penalized by law.

174
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,331
- Don't you know that?
- What are you doing?

175
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,363
Gosh.

176
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:27,556
What kind of store is this?

177
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,231
My goodness.

178
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:35,845
Customers like that are the norm.

179
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:38,967
You don't have to stand up for me.

180
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,172
Why did you leave this at my house?

181
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,293
They're smelly.

182
00:13:56,176 --> 00:14:00,039
I love this smell of fabric softener.

183
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,851
It smells so nice.

184
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:17,677
Excuse me. We're the part-timers for today.

185
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:21,641
Oh, you're the ones who signed up.

186
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,824
It's not the easiest job, but welcome.

187
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:26,926
Now... Here are your gloves.

188
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,528
These are for you

189
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:30,319
and for you.

190
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,151
Put these on too.

191
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:35,285
Once you've put them on, I'll give you instructions.

192
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:46,305
You'll be washing these dishes over here.

193
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:48,868
Rinse away the food waste

194
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,660
and then put the dishes

195
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,154
on this belt to go in the dishwasher.

196
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:56,776
It's simple, right?

197
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:59,389
The customers will be here soon.

198
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,150
All right then. I'll leave it up to you.

199
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,869
Since they have this machine,

200
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:11,571
I don't think it'll be that difficult.

201
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:14,304
But he was wearing so many pain relief patches.

202
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:25,273
Please be quick with these. We have a thousand more coming in.

203
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,139
I get why he was wearing so many pain relief patches now.

204
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,422
The heat from this hot water is making me even more tired.

205
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,964
I feel like we've already washed a thousand dishes.

206
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,062
You should take a break. I'll keep going.

207
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:54,665
No, we'll never get done that way.

208
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,746
You're slower than me.

209
00:15:57,798 --> 00:15:59,578
I guess that's true.

210
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,523
There are suds on your face.

211
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:08,788
Sorry. You have more.

212
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:11,682
- You did that on purpose, didn't you?
- No, I didn't.

213
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:13,083
- It's unfair.
- Stop.

214
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,735
What do you mean, it's unfair? It wasn't on purpose.

215
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:18,157
- Of course. Let me just...
- Listen to me. Stop.

216
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:21,050
Hurry up! There's no time to play around.

217
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,911
Gosh.

218
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:29,589
Good work, both of you.

219
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,721
Thank you for your work today.

220
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,604
Don't forget about tomorrow.

221
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,164
- Yes.
- Thank you.

222
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:36,786
Goodbye.

223
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:44,133
The pay is really good.

224
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,255
But it's definitely not a long-term job.

225
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,279
- Let's go buy some pain relief patches.
- I'm all right—

226
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,901
Ah! Wait...

227
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:55,043
I guess not.

228
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,259
What happened to your bracelet?

229
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,350
You always wore it.

230
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:04,234
Did you leave it in the dishwashing area?

231
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:05,464
No,

232
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:08,809
I think I dropped it when I got lost on that hill in the countryside.

233
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:10,961
I really liked that bracelet.

234
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,691
There's no finding it now.

235
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:16,185
Let's go, Je Yi.

236
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:30,260
Wow.

237
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,545
Do you want to go in and take a look?

238
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,246
Should we?

239
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:48,699
My gosh.

240
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,929
It's so beautiful here.

241
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:55,264
My aunt might get married soon.

242
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,798
I should recommend this place to her.

243
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:04,945
Je Yi.

244
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,436
Je Yi, where are you?

245
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:49,278
Je Yi, that was amazing.

246
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,032
This song is called, "Kiss the Rain."

247
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,444
It's such a beautiful song.

248
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:58,098
Is there anything you're not good at?

249
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:01,861
There are lots of things. Let's go buy some patches now.

250
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,538
The door is closing.

251
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:14,034
Go to Room 5902 at Hidden Apartments.

252
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:17,195
The pass code is 5678.

253
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,788
Wow.

254
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:40,401
It's totally new.

255
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:42,862
It's so nice here.

256
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:45,805
But where am I?

257
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:02,772
Wow.

258
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:09,189
Go to room 5902 at Hidden Apartments

259
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:16,336
Where is Gi Jun?

260
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,403
Open the cabinet next to the oven.

261
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,289
Property Purchase Contract

262
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:41,952
Purchaser Sa Gi Jun

263
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:55,115
Baby, let's live together

264
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,865
in this house.

265
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:01,371
Baby, do you like it?

266
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:03,483
It's where we're going to live.

267
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:10,040
I don't know what to say.

268
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,332
You keep surprising me.

269
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:20,641
It's cozy and luxurious with a nice view.

270
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:23,353
I wanted to find a place that suits you.

271
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:26,285
This place felt just right.

272
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,590
I really like this place.

273
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,051
It feels like a dream.

274
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,292
Wait.

275
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,257
Something is dripping from your mouth.

276
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:40,540
Am I drooling?

277
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,322
No, that's not it.

278
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,417
My baby's voice is like honey. That's all.

279
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:49,108
It's so sweet.

280
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,771
Gosh.

281
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:54,093
You are so sweet.

282
00:21:57,827 --> 00:21:59,708
Hold on for a moment.

283
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,111
Hello?

284
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:10,000
Where will I find 200 million won (≈ $180,000) all of a sudden?

285
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,312
Yes, I know the returns will be tenfold

286
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:14,534
if I invest that sum.

287
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,798
I already sent you the amount we agreed upon. And now this?

288
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:22,190
Anyway, I'm doing something important right now. Let's talk later.

289
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,572
What's going on?

290
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:34,754
I'm sorry. It was an urgent call.

291
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,556
Well...

292
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,908
If you need 200 million won,

293
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:42,121
I could try to come up with that money.

294
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:44,184
I told you not to say things like that.

295
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:46,537
Seon Hui, you shouldn't worry about these things.

296
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:49,529
I just want to make an investment.

297
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:52,962
You said investing 200 million won would return ten times as much.

298
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:55,495
Let me make an investment too.

299
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:00,701
I don't want to receive even 1,000 won (≈ 90¢) from you.

300
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:04,344
I just have to sell this place.

301
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:05,895
No, you can't.

302
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:08,377
This is our first home.

303
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:11,351
We're going to live here together. You can't sell it.

304
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:14,354
When we get married, I'm going to stop running the café.

305
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:17,055
So I'll have the deposit from that.

306
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:27,217
I'm sorry I made you worry.

307
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,230
Please just trust me

308
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,882
and don't worry about it.

309
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,511
Hi, Oppa Geon Wu.

310
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:44,013
Did Sam Sun eat well today?

311
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:47,648
Really? She had two bowls?

312
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:50,939
I think she turned into a pig.

313
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,815
I bought a present for my sister and I'm on my way home now.

314
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,446
It's her birthday soon.

315
00:23:57,446 --> 00:24:00,579
Okay Oppa, I'll call you later.

316
00:24:08,158 --> 00:24:10,760
- I'm tired. Let's head out.
- Okay.

317
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,475
Babe, come over here.

318
00:24:15,475 --> 00:24:17,256
Babe?

319
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,771
Do you know me? Do you?

320
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:23,763
- Let's just leave.
- No, let go of me.

321
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,154
Explain yourself.

322
00:24:25,154 --> 00:24:28,017
- Let's just go.
- No, this is sexual harassment.

323
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:29,529
Call the police!

324
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:31,752
I'm sorry.

325
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:34,023
It's you again?

326
00:24:34,023 --> 00:24:35,374
Hello.

327
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:38,528
If you're going to drink, keep your hands to yourself.

328
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:41,461
- That guy is up to no good again.
- Hey!

329
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:43,032
- Get out.
- Ouch.

330
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,824
- Who is he?
- He's the one

331
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:48,387
I've had to kick out a few times for harassing women.

332
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,750
He stopped coming for a while, but he's back.

333
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:56,005
Ro Bin.

334
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:01,311
Ro Bin, I saw that you're pretty good at dancing.

335
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:03,362
- Can you fill in for the dance party?
- Excuse me?

336
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:06,136
The dance party today is a really important event for us.

337
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:08,117
I hired a few people,

338
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:11,561
but they didn't show up. These jerks...

339
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:15,504
We need to maintain our reputation as a club.

340
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:20,540
You're a pretty good dancer. Let's just do something short.

341
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,112
I don't think I can do it. I'm sorry.

342
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:24,735
If the audience response is good,

343
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:26,886
I'll give you the one million won (≈ $900) prize.

344
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:29,078
I bought a present for my sister and I'm on my way home now.

345
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:31,520
It's her birthday soon.

346
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:50,389
Let's see make your move.

347
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:52,341
Come on.

348
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,092
Ouch, my arms...

349
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,062
Hey,

350
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:43,752
Eonni.

351
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:45,965
You know...

352
00:26:45,965 --> 00:26:48,228
Do you have something to say? Tell me.

353
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:50,741
When we moved into this house,

354
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:55,034
I paid half of the deposit, right?

355
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:58,439
Could I get that money back?

356
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,629
Oh...

357
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,144
Gi Jun just bought a new place for us.

358
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:05,634
Take a look.

359
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:09,628
You can see the Han River from there. Isn't it luxurious?

360
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,262
It's a great place.

361
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:13,933
I don't want to buy

362
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,346
cheap furniture and appliances.

363
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:19,199
He already bought a place?

364
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:21,279
Doesn't it feel a bit rushed?

365
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:24,483
He says he wants us to live together

366
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:27,085
as soon as possible.

367
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,711
All right. I'll look into getting a loan.

368
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:34,803
Sorry about this, Eonni.

369
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:39,418
I want to contribute to the seed money for Gi Jun's company,

370
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:42,561
but I think I'll do that after I close the café

371
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,935
or get a loan.

372
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:48,077
Why would you invest in his business?

373
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:50,130
You should do some research first.

374
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,762
I think he spent most of his money

375
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:55,696
on buying the house.

376
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:58,207
I want to help him somehow.

377
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:06,396
Hello.

378
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:08,337
Welcome.
Sinu Real Estate

379
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:09,959
Please take a seat.

380
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:17,928
How is the commercial district here?

381
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:19,889
I'm looking into a store location.

382
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:21,891
The commercial district here is great.

383
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:24,765
Our restaurants and clothing stores all do well.

384
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,166
What kind of business are you opening?

385
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:29,379
What about the café across the street?

386
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:31,250
Is the deposit there high?

387
00:28:32,301 --> 00:28:33,894
Or is it a monthly lease?

388
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:37,427
That café isn't for sale.

389
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:40,810
Right. If the café sells quickly,

390
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,604
I won't have to give Seon Hui her deposit right away.

391
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:47,888
The deposit there is 200 million won (≈ $180,000).

392
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:49,378
It's a great spot for business.

393
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:51,921
I heard they earned the deposit back in less than a year.

394
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:55,805
If you're interested, I'd be happy to look into it.

395
00:29:01,622 --> 00:29:05,294
Please think about it and let me know. I'll get you a good deal.

396
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:07,146
Thank you.

397
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:10,238
Have a good day.
