~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:04,173
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:32,792
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:46,867
I like you a lot.

5
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:50,940
I like you a lot.

6
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:55,916
Is this real?

7
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,698
Je Yi confessed to me?

8
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,223
Am I on some hidden camera show?

9
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:07,286
If that's the case, you're dead, Seo Je Yi.

10
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:14,203
What's wrong with you? Have you finally lost it?

11
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:16,375
You little...

12
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,569
Come in.

13
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:20,440
Come on in. It's all right.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,073
I met them in the hall. They said they were going to buy food.

15
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:25,576
So I told them to just come over and eat with us. That's okay, right?

16
00:01:25,576 --> 00:01:27,296
Of course.

17
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,368
Welcome, Oppas.

18
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,512
I've got the steamed meat.

19
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:33,954
Daughters, place it nicely on the table.

20
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:35,836
That's right.

21
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:37,376
All right.

22
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,359
Where's your aunt?

23
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,232
She said she's not eating. She's still crying.

24
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:45,676
All because of that wretched con artist.

25
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:48,658
Never mind. Let's just eat. Enjoy your meal.

26
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:50,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

27
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:57,477
It's summer vacation, yet Je Yi heads over

28
00:01:57,477 --> 00:02:01,099
to the library to study hard.

29
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,944
But this girl...

30
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:07,256
School starts very soon, and she's still playing around like this.

31
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:08,679
She drives me crazy.

32
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,910
Mom, you're embarrassing me. Stop.

33
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,893
So you are ashamed of yourself?

34
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:17,437
Thanks to you though, her grades went up just a little.

35
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,298
But what's the use?

36
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:21,400
It's all down the drain now.

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,844
We can study together this time too

38
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,355
if Ji Na is okay with it.

39
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,598
Of course she's okay with it.

40
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,311
What's there to not be okay with? Thanks, Je Yi.

41
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,183
Eat up.

42
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,079
Didn't I lose weight over the vacation?

43
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,941
- Not at all.
- Seriously.

44
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,404
We'll see.

45
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:45,025
Are you dieting?

46
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:47,176
- That's so hard.
- Isn't it easy?

47
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:50,299
Bae Sin Ae, you got so pretty over the vacation and didn't even tell us.

48
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:51,912
Did you do something to your face?

49
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:54,744
No. I must have just lost some weight.

50
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:56,586
I'm so jealous.

51
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:59,849
I put on my uniform for the first time in a while and the zipper wouldn't close.

52
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,841
Oh my, I can tell.

53
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,683
Do you have a death wish?

54
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:10,431
Hi, Ro Bin.

55
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,811
Did you have a good vacation?

56
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:13,934
- Yes.
- You're here early.

57
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:16,205
- Where's Ji Na?
- I don't know.

58
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:18,277
Why are you asking me?

59
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:28,036
If you're ever feeling stressed, let me know, okay?

60
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,802
Look at the class president taking care of Yi Deun.

61
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:33,954
He's the king of affection.

62
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:35,416
I know, right?

63
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,498
When Yi Deun was out sick, he would take care of him then too.

64
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:41,250
Right. He also gets really good grades.

65
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,274
They're making an advanced class for Hankuk University admissions,

66
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:46,086
and he's basically a shoo-in.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,600
I heard it's super hard to get into that class.

68
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,900
Yesterday,

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,172
I met with the principal of Jongnan High

70
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:05,414
for the first time in a while.

71
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:07,237
He couldn't stop bragging

72
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,529
about how their students got first place

73
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,742
in the math competition.

74
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:14,615
I was so mad that I nearly exploded.

75
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:17,466
Well, that's because Jongnan High has been

76
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,710
known as a prestigious school for a long time.

77
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,120
What?

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,506
So you're saying we can't do the same because we're not prestigious?

79
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:29,720
I've been too loose with all of you.

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,551
From now on,

81
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:35,935
I'll make sure to rank the students solely on their grades.

82
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,478
First,

83
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,730
the class with the highest test scores

84
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,451
will get to eat lunch first—

85
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:42,912
Principal,

86
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:45,625
you cannot discriminate against them when it comes to their meals.

87
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,527
We must take responsibility not just for their grades

88
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:48,798
but for their character as well—

89
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:50,090
You can do that

90
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,203
when you become principal then.

91
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:56,096
This is my stance.

92
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,908
Those who can, can, and those who can't, can't.

93
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:01,561
Those who can, can, and those who can't, can't.

94
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,374
We need to exclude the incapable students

95
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:07,937
and focus on the capable students.

96
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:11,882
From now on, don't bother with the inadequate ones

97
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:16,175
and focus on the ones who actually have potential.

98
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:18,907
That's all.

99
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:24,984
Ms. Maeng,

100
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:26,885
may I see you for a second?

101
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,444
Is Ha Ji Man preparing well for his math thesis?

102
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:39,890
Yes, I think he can become a candidate for the competition.

103
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,834
He can't just be a candidate. We have to make sure he wins.

104
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,046
You know,

105
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,899
I have to say I'm expecting a lot

106
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,921
from Ha Ji Man.

107
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:53,924
So don't let Ha Ji Man do all the work by himself.

108
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:56,226
You should also...

109
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:59,309
You know what I mean?

110
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,061
Pardon?

111
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,164
If Ji Man doesn't do his own thesis by himself,

112
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,354
who would?

113
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:07,246
My goodness.

114
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:10,720
Do I really need to explain it to you?

115
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:15,405
You can leave now.

116
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,065
Yes, sir.

117
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:28,108
This woman is just so dim-witted.

118
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:30,969
You need to explain everything to her.

119
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,925
What did he say?

120
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:39,319
I agree grades are important, but isn't this too much?

121
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,411
My gosh. He's so annoying.

122
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,865
What are you all doing gathered together like that?

123
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:48,447
Are you all bad-mouthing someone?

124
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,773
Break it up, now. Quickly.

125
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:58,137
Mr. Choi, could you come to my office?

126
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:07,736
Come in.

127
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:13,963
Yes, how can I help you?

128
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:15,355
Yes, Mr. Choi.

129
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:19,118
I don't know if it's because of all the stress lately,

130
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:21,300
but my shoulders are feeling a bit tense.

131
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,745
I wanted to get one of your massages for the first time in a while.

132
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,085
Yes, leave it to me.

133
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,365
Mr. Choi,

134
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:39,430
did you say you learned massage techniques in Thailand?

135
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,022
Yes. When I went to Thailand as an exchange student,

136
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:46,556
I lived there for a while. That's when I learned Thai massage.

137
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,789
Well then,

138
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,541
you must speak a bit of Thai.

139
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,044
Yes, I know a few easy words here and there.

140
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:57,316
Yesterday, when I was talking to the principal of Jongnan High,

141
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,719
he mentioned that he signed a sister school agreement

142
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:02,683
with some international school as part of their global strategy.

143
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:06,646
He said that kind of stuff plays a big part in principal evaluations.

144
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:10,750
You wouldn't believe how much he bragged about it.

145
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,314
So I said we do that kind of global stuff too.

146
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:17,256
I told a little lie.

147
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:19,458
But he was saying something

148
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,632
about how we need video materials for the evaluations.

149
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:25,785
So I was wondering if you could

150
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:28,117
help out with that.

151
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:30,950
Pardon? How can I help with that?

152
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,764
I'll say that we became sister schools with a Thai high school.

153
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,716
So all you have to do is

154
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,968
pretend to be a Thai person.

155
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,721
Oh my. Principal,

156
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,593
how could I do that?

157
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,455
Isn't that technically fraud?

158
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,847
You don't want to?

159
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,829
I guess it can't be helped.

160
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,392
It's not like I'm doing it for myself.

161
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:55,525
I'm doing it for our school's name.

162
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:58,207
When I meet the chief director

163
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:01,360
and he asks about hiring regular full-time teachers,

164
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,494
I was going to put in a good word for you.

165
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:07,287
I'm actually a really good actor.

166
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:10,510
I'll do it. Leave it to me.

168
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:20,009
Hello. Thank you.
(In Thai)

169
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,612
Hello. Thank you.

170
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:25,134
Nice to meet you.
(In Thai)

171
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:30,140
I'd like to be your friend. So, right now, I'm very happy.
(In Thai)

172
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,714
Thank you. Hello.
(In Thai)

173
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:37,687
That was all a lie.
(In Thai)

174
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:40,158
Oh Jin Sang, you are very silly.
(In Thai)

175
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,094
Thank you. Hello.

Hanjong High - Thailand High
International Exchange MOU

177
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,542
So am I out of the competition?

178
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,913
Yes.

179
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:58,017
They only selected a few for the advanced class for Hankuk University admissions.

180
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:00,800
They only picked ten students in our entire district.

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,193
Let's apply again next time.

182
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:06,697
Anyway, how's your math thesis for the competition coming along?

183
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:10,990
The principal expects a lot from you, so do your best, all right?

184
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,041
Yes, Teacher.

186
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:34,863
Yi Deun,

187
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:37,806
where are you going?

188
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,062
I'm going to the bathroom.

189
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:45,655
Really? I was on my way there too.

190
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,316
Let's go together.

191
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,232
What are you doing? Come on.

192
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,545
Sorry.

193
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,808
It's okay. It's not your fault.

194
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:24,174
Ro Bin, wait a minute.

195
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:25,755
What?

196
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:27,757
I'm going to be home late today.

197
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,888
I'm going to the bookstore with Ji Na.

198
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:33,102
We're probably going to get dinner too.

199
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:34,884
Go ahead.

200
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:48,027
I wasn't sure which book to buy. Thanks for helping me choose.

201
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:52,530
It has the notes written out step-by-step, so it'll be perfect for you.

202
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,955
So this book is going to help me ace this next test too?

203
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:57,246
You have to study to ace a test.

204
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:59,710
Well begun is half done.

205
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,682
Je Yi, aren't you hungry?

206
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:03,773
I'll get you a burger since you helped me.

207
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:06,856
Really? You don't have to do that.

208
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:10,430
It's okay. My mom gave me some allowance because I'm studying with you.

209
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,931
Let's go.

210
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,049
Oppa Ro Bin.

211
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,414
- Sa Na?
- What are you doing here?

212
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:36,165
Are you by yourself?

213
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:37,968
I'm by myself too.

214
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:39,469
I can't believe we're meeting like this.

215
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:42,502
It must be destiny, don't you think?

216
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,179
Sa Na, look over there.

217
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:52,351
Isn't that your mom and dad?

218
00:12:57,406 --> 00:12:59,098
It is them.

219
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:02,122
What are they doing here?

220
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:04,634
How long has it been since we watched a movie together?

221
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,685
I know, right?

222
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:10,280
Let's watch this one. I heard it's really good.

223
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,121
Are they on some secret date?

224
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:15,605
Since when are they this close?

225
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,858
You can't watch scary movies.

226
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:20,619
- Come on.
- Gosh.

227
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:25,004
Oppa, let's watch that movie too.

228
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,596
But that's...

229
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:28,688
Just once.

230
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:32,391
I just want to know if my mom and dad aren't fighting anymore.

231
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,853
Please?

232
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,269
Fine, let's watch it.

233
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,932
So don't cry, okay?

234
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:48,708
I'm watching a movie with Oppa Ro Bin thanks to you guys.

235
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,891
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

236
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,753
Is this our seat?

237
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:55,554
All right.

238
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:00,048
This is a good seat.

239
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,584
- Have some.
- Will you be able to watch this?

240
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,364
Don't worry.

241
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,312
What is this?

242
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,545
This is a horror movie?

243
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:28,358
It is. You didn't know?

244
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,460
It has ghosts in it.

245
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,982
What do I do? I can't watch scary movies.

246
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:40,370
Play with me.

247
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,025
Is Ro Bin afraid of ghosts?

248
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,626
Oh no!

249
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:54,654
- Be quiet.
- Aigoo!

250
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:57,007
- Is it gone?
- Play with me.

251
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,718
It's gone.

252
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:00,761
I said we shouldn't watch a scary movie.

253
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:03,493
You're so embarrassing. Stop it.

254
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,597
Please don't do this to me.

255
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:11,320
Research has shown

256
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,574
that watching horror movies brings your love closer.

257
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:20,460
This is all part of my big picture.

258
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:24,714
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:27,997
Relax.

260
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,329
Oh no!

261
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,623
That was scary.

262
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,898
Why did you scream so much?

263
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,500
I thought it was an erotic movie.

264
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,721
You're so silly.

265
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,347
Oppa, are you all right?

266
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:51,750
Yes.

267
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,126
You're not going to follow them?

268
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,168
No.

269
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:01,411
They're on a secret date. I don't want to bother them.

270
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:03,824
Oppa, do you want to go eat tteokbokki?

271
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:06,496
Since you got the movie, I'll get the tteokbokki.

272
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:07,958
Aren't you going to go home?

273
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,159
I will.

274
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,170
But we have to eat tteokbokki first.

275
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,392
Let's go.

276
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:14,854
I'm so full.

277
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:16,967
I know, right? We ate so much.

278
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:20,659
- Thanks.
- No problem. You helped pick out my book.

279
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:25,244
What's up?

280
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:27,656
Let's take one of those.
Photo Booth

281
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:30,289
A photo booth?

282
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,552
I've never taken one before.

283
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:35,554
I want to try it. Let's take one together.

284
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,398
Okay. Let's take one.

285
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,707
- Is it on?
- Yes.

286
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,359
Now you just have to pose.

287
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,830
What pose should I make?

288
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,672
What should we do?

289
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,285
- What should I do?
- Do a flower pose.

290
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:57,876
- Flower pose?
- Yes.

291
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,330
- Let's make hearts.
- Hearts?

292
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,831
Yes.

293
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:05,604
It's the last picture.

294
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,855
I can totally tell it's your first time. You're so stiff.

295
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:17,737
When you take these pictures, you have to look up slightly

296
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,970
and hide your face with a peace sign or flower pose to look cute.

297
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,074
You're right.

298
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:27,747
Then should we take them like that next time?

299
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,889
- What?
- I'm just saying

300
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,642
we should continue being good friends.

301
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:36,005
You seem uncomfortable since I confessed to you.

302
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:38,968
I'm not uncomfortable. I'm not like that.

303
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm always happy to have friends like you.

304
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:44,223
It's getting late. Let's go.

305
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:45,895
Okay.

306
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:07,968
You don't look so good. You look tired.

307
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,721
I don't know. I'm just really tired.

308
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,222
Is that so?

309
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:16,254
I'm hungry after eating just a burger.

310
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:37,296
Ro Bin,

311
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,359
do you want some ramen?

312
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,980
I'm fine.

313
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:47,597
You're really not having any, right?

314
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:13,162
I Like Seo Je Yi

315
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:18,256
I like you a lot.

316
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:29,408
Why does it have to be Je Yi?

317
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,145
Eat up.

318
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,791
Where are you going?

319
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:59,588
Why do you have double the amount of pork cutlet?

320
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:05,666
The cafeteria ajumma is so mean.

321
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,697
You don't know why she did that?

322
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,169
Isn't it obvious?

323
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:10,369
Gosh.

324
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:14,183
I'm twice Ro Bin's size. She should've given me more.

325
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:23,803
You're so skinny. Where does it all go?

326
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:32,362
Can I sit next to you?

327
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:35,204
Do whatever you want. It's not my seat.

328
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,863
I'm so full.

329
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,685
You didn't even eat anything.

330
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,830
I have a small stomach, so I get full just eating a little.

331
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:05,254
Ro Bin, do you want more?

332
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:09,257
- Really?
- I'm so full. I can't have anymore.

333
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,290
Yes!

334
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,313
Thanks, Su Ji. I'll enjoy this.

335
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:27,747
That's so like Ro Bin. That's why I like him.

336
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,111
What?

337
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,642
Is there something on my face?

338
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,205
Yes.

339
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:37,757
Over here.

340
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,461
What is this?

341
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:45,185
Ro Bin, I'm not normally like this.

342
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:46,295
I'm going to go.

343
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:48,839
Let's go together.

344
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,520
Give me your leftover pork cutlet.

345
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,294
I'll get going too.

346
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,991
Hey, Seo Ro Bin, how could you just leave like that?

347
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:03,283
I have something to give you.

348
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:04,664
Forget it.

349
00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:07,757
Don't be like that. Let's go together.

350
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:17,586
Okay.

351
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:31,089
I have to give this back to him.

352
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:40,108
It's all right.

353
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,654
This is chocolate that's super trendy in L.A. right now.

354
00:22:53,654 --> 00:22:56,175
I stood in line to get this.

355
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,958
I don't want it. I don't like chocolate.

356
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:02,843
Isn't it the thought that counts? Take it.

357
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,493
I said I don't want it.

358
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:08,519
If you don't take it, I'm going to throw it away.

359
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,211
You want me to throw it away? I will.

360
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:12,852
Give it to me.

361
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:16,596
It's mine now, right?

362
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,137
It is.

363
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:20,839
Na Na Ri.

364
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:26,016
Here. You can have this.

365
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:29,189
I can have this? Really?

366
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:31,691
You look like you would enjoy it the most.

367
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:37,076
Hey, Seo Ro Bin, do I look easy to you?

368
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:40,118
Why do you treat me like this?

369
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,644
These are really good.

370
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:48,108
Hey, Na Na Ri!

371
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:49,669
- Give it to me.
- No way.

372
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,061
- Hey.
- Oh no.

373
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:52,862
These are so good.

374
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:27,517
The brightest star shines in the darkest of nights

375
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,931
Hey.

376
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:33,272
I've been here since earlier.

377
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:36,486
Sorry, I thought no one was here.

378
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:38,488
I'll leave.

379
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:41,240
No. Stay.

380
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,332
I'm leaving now.

381
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:56,716
I don't know what's going on,

382
00:25:56,716 --> 00:25:58,457
but chin up.

383
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,398
Today is your basic physical fitness evaluation.

384
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:21,170
Put all your strength into it, got it?

385
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,405
Anyone who has any strength left over after these exercises

386
00:26:24,405 --> 00:26:26,657
will have to do laps. Got it?

387
00:26:26,657 --> 00:26:28,598
- Yes!
- Yes!

388
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:40,981
- Oh my gosh.
- Look at her.

389
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:43,942
- She's so fast.
- Amazing.

390
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:49,279
- Seo Ro Bin!
- Seo Ro Bin!

391
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,350
- Seo Ro Bin!
- You can do it!

392
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,975
Ro Bin got 6.72 seconds. That's the fastest in this class.

393
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:57,707
- Mi Nam, run. Just a little more.
- What are you doing? Hurry up.

394
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:59,540
- Just a bit more.
- Come on, Mi Nam.

395
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,321
Good job.

396
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,734
Mr. Choi, I'm going to throw up.

397
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:06,765
Sure, go do it over there.

398
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:10,451
- Wow.
- He's so cool.

399
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:12,162
I didn't know Yi Deun was this fast.

400
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:13,804
- He's doing great.
- He's so cool.

401
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:16,526
I don't know what's going on,

402
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:18,568
but chin up.

403
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:25,945
Look at Ji Man.

404
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,218
- Yi Deun won.
- Ji Man, come on.

405
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:30,531
Impressive, Yi Deun.

406
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:34,034
Yi Deun, you're pretty fast. 7.35 seconds.

407
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:36,065
Okay.

408
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:37,978
Are you all right, Class President?

409
00:27:37,978 --> 00:27:39,819
- Yes.
- It's fine.

410
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:41,872
Our class president may get good grades,

411
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:43,753
but he isn't so good at sports.

412
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:45,275
A man has got to be physically fit

413
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:47,266
just like Yi Deun. Fitness!

414
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,949
Good job, everyone. Go ahead.

415
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:50,709
Yes, sir.

416
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:55,435
Next up is running in place. Let's move.

417
00:27:57,558 --> 00:27:59,338
- No way.
- I'm so tired.

418
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:01,501
- I could faint.
- Come on.

419
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:05,855
Are you all right, Yi Deun?

420
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:09,679
Teacher Choi, I don't think Yi Deun is feeling well.

421
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,211
I'll take him to the nurse.

422
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:13,864
I could tell. Yi Deun was putting in too much effort.

423
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:16,786
- Go on.
- Yes.

424
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:18,508
I'll take him.

425
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:21,710
Let's go.

426
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:38,458
What are you doing? Let's go.

427
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,609
Let's go.

428
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,595
Hey, Bo Ra.

429
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:50,691
This isn't about me, but it's about a friend.

430
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:53,614
She's just a regular girl. Super plain.

431
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:56,907
But a hot guy from her school confessed to her.

432
00:28:56,907 --> 00:29:00,800
What? I'm so jealous. I don't have any hot guys.

433
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:06,917
So is she bragging to you about how happy she is?

434
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,709
No.

435
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:11,240
My friend hasn't given him an answer.

436
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,873
She must think she's hot stuff.

437
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:18,418
Are you sure she doesn't like someone else?

438
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:20,971
No, not at all.

439
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:23,423
Okay, gosh. Why are you overreacting?

440
00:29:23,423 --> 00:29:25,335
Then she's playing hard to get.

441
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:27,728
Your friend must play all the guys.

442
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,569
She's not like that.

443
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,843
Okay, I got it. No need to get mad.

444
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:36,496
Whatever. I shouldn't have told you. I'm leaving.

445
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:40,890
Hey, wait for me.

446
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,862
Are you hurt?

447
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:06,495
Don't worry about it.

448
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:18,699
Gosh. What's with him?

449
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:21,621
Hanjong High School

450
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:34,222
Come on. Watch where you're going.

451
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,636
You...

452
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:42,061
Hey. Stop right there.

453
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:48,437
Aren't you going to apologize?

454
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:50,821
Shouldn't you be apologizing?

455
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:52,091
You bumped into me.

456
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:55,163
You got some nerve talking back to a seonbae like that.

457
00:30:56,365 --> 00:30:58,287
Do you have a death wish?

458
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:07,877
Hey, Yi Deun!

459
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:10,629
Wake up. Yi Deun!

460
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:15,074
Hey, wake up.

461
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,947
Yi Deun!

462
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:18,637
You...

463
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:27,737
Yi Deun.

464
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:29,839
What happened?

465
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,272
Yi Deun, wake up.

466
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:33,792
Yi Deun.

467
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:36,235
Are you all right?

468
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:39,919
Yi Deun, open your eyes.

469
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:42,912
Yi Deun.

470
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:47,127
What should I sing at the noraebang?

471
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:49,590
I want to sing "Bingle Bangle."

472
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,841
Good idea.

473
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:54,974
There are a lot of places to go here.

474
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:58,449
- Seo Yeon.
- What?

475
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,090
I don't think I can hang out today.

476
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,771
Really? Why not?

477
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:04,384
We said we would go to the noraebang today.

478
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:06,607
I know. I'm so sorry.

479
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:10,690
I forgot that my mom told me to come home early. Sorry.

480
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,783
Gosh. You got me excited for nothing.

481
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:15,546
I even cut class at my hagwon.

482
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:18,409
I'm so sorry. I'll buy you pizza later.

483
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,800
- Really?
- Yes.

484
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,502
I'm going to the bathroom first, so you go ahead.

485
00:32:22,502 --> 00:32:24,665
Go home. Quick.

486
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:26,406
Bye.

487
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:35,805
Oppa Ro Bin.

488
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:37,237
Sa Na?

489
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:39,559
What are you doing here?

490
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,181
Are you by yourself?

491
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:42,993
I'm by myself too.

492
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,435
I can't believe we're meeting like this.

493
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:47,706
It must be destiny, don't you think?
