~ Revenge Note 2 ~

3
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,957
Our goal this week is to have zero food waste.

4
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:39,079
When you get your lunch, take only what you can eat

5
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,121
and finish all of it, all right?

6
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:43,141
Yes, ma'am.

7
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:47,406
- Oh my gosh.
- What is that?

8
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:50,900
- Confess.
- Confess your love.

9
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,282
Confess your love.

10
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:53,402
Mr. Choi,

11
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:56,165
it flusters me if you suddenly do this.

12
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:58,657
I'll accept it for now,

13
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:00,020
but when the kids are watching—

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,503
No, this is for Bae Sin Ae in Class One.

15
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:09,189
Hey, who sends these kinds of things

16
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,142
to the school in the morning?

17
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:15,384
The security guard brought this to the teacher's office.

18
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:17,287
And now I have to deliver this to you?

19
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:18,768
Take it.

20
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:20,189
This isn't for you.

21
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,536
- Oh my.
- How nice.

22
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:30,680
- I'm jealous.
- "Happy birthday."

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,554
Happy birthday to you, indeed. Take it.

24
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:35,766
Have a good day. Happy birthday

25
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,998
Teacher, who sent this?

26
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,062
How would I know? It was probably your boyfriend.

27
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:44,625
Kids do all sorts of things these days.

28
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,927
Anyway, congratulations. Have a good class, Ms. Maeng.

29
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:48,680
- Thanks.
- Yes.

30
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,576
- You got flowers.
- I'm envious.

31
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,888
Everyone, be quiet.

32
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,142
Have a good class.

33
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:04,122
Yes.

34
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:10,158
There's a card.

35
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:12,442
I'll read it later.

36
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:16,755
You think I've never gotten something like this before?

37
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:18,858
Stop showing off.

38
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:21,150
It's tacky.

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,822
Who sends flowers these days?

40
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:24,603
Getting food would be so much better.

41
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,556
Let's go.

42
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,050
Sin Ae,

43
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,213
can I borrow your flowers for a moment?

44
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:34,683
Sure.

45
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:45,215
Thanks.

46
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:49,209
Someone sent these to me this morning. Who are you?

47
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,562
I'm so popular. Gifts are better than flowers.

48
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,555
Happy birthday.

49
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:01,500
Why is it so noisy in here?

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,693
Who's your homeroom teacher?

51
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:06,054
You don't even get good grades.

52
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:09,608
Are you at school to play or study?

53
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:15,214
- Whatever.
- He's so annoying.

54
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:20,400
This class is quiet.

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,073
You guys probably get good grades. All right.

56
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:28,417
- What was that?
- What's up with him?

57
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,950
- It's so funny.
- I know, right?

58
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,522
Congratulations on your 17th birthday.

59
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:36,344
Aren't you dying to know who I am?

60
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:37,907
Just wait a little longer.

61
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,329
We will be

62
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,871
together soon.

63
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:45,234
From your eternal love.

64
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:57,395
Hey, what happened to your face?

65
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,440
Yesterday...

66
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,352
Oh my, Je Yi.

67
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:04,044
What happened?

68
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:07,276
This?

69
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,720
I was standing at a crosswalk yesterday,

70
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,663
and someone suddenly pushed me.

71
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:14,734
What?

72
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,066
Who? Why?

73
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:19,290
I don't know. He just pushed me and left.

74
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,532
It must have been a close call. Did you catch him?

75
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:23,814
No,

76
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:26,945
but I saw his face.

77
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:29,828
That's scary. Such a strange thing, too.

78
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,900
Bae Sin Ae, where is your textbook?

79
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,547
Why are you acting so differently now?

80
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:50,019
Even if you were good in the beginning,

81
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:52,700
you'll fall behind quickly if you start acting this way.

82
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,630
Avertisssement.
(French for "warning")

83
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:56,385
I'm warning you.

84
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,240
Look at your book.

85
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,593
She's out of her mind. That's what dating does to her.

86
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,077
Ji Na, do you want to go to the noraebang*?
(*=karaoke place)

87
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:19,620
- Today?
- Why?

88
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,321
Do you have plans?

89
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,837
No, I don't have any plans.

90
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:29,289
Let's go to karaoke and relieve our stress.

91
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,402
Okay. Rok Hui, come with us.

92
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:35,310
Really? Karaoke sounds great.

93
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,717
- Let's join them.
- Let's go.

94
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:40,499
Why are you joining us?

95
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,831
Let's go.

96
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:52,311

Oh my gosh. Look at him!

100
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,438

00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:31,310
Sin Ae, look at her.

119
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,030
What? I'm not Sin Ae.

120
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,650

Hey, where are you going?

135
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,927
Bo Ra, Oh Ji Na left because you were trying to act all cool.

136
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,558
What?

137
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:18,780

That scared me.

You scared me there.

142
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,185
Sorry. Were you scared?

143
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:39,358
I saw you as I was passing by.

144
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:40,439
What are you doing here?

145
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:42,731
- I'm waiting for a friend.
- I see.

146
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:45,043
I'll take you home.

147
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,396
I even brought my car.

148
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:50,359
That's all right. I want to wait a bit longer.

149
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:53,001
But it's your birthday.

150
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:55,705
I'll buy you something delicious. Let's go.

151
00:09:57,607 --> 00:10:01,010
It's all right. You can treat me next time.

152
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,562
Next time?

153
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:06,725
I waited so long for this day.

154
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,188
Let's go.

155
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,400
Let's go.

156
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
Just come with me, Sin Ae.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
- I'll buy you something delicious.
- It's okay.

158
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,800
- Let's go.
- Why are you doing this?

159
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
I'll buy you nice food and everything.

160
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
- It's all right.
- Come with me, Sin Ae.

161
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,100
Please come here. Get in the car.

162
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,400
If you get in the car, I'll explain everything.

163
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll explain it all to you,

164
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
- so get in the car!
- Let go!

165
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
- Sin Ae!
- Why are you doing this?

166
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,800
It's your birthday.

167
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Get in the car. I'll explain everything.

168
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
- Isn't that Sin Ae?
- Please.

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
- What do I do?
- Why are you doing this?

170
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,000
- Listen to me. Get in the car—
- Police officer, come here!

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,800
I heard a scream from here!

172
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,800
Sin Ae,

173
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,800
this is all a misunderstanding,

174
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,400
and I'll explain it all later, so...

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
L-Later. This isn't what I wanted...

176
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,300
Darn it!

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,400
Sin Ae...

178
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,700
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,000
I came too late, didn't I?

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
No, Ji Na.

181
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm sorry. It's my fault...

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
No. Don't be sorry.

183
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm really sorry.

184
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Sorry, Ji Na.

185
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:59,228
I'm sorry, Ji Na.

186
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
By the way,

187
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,400
what happened to the policeman?

188
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,000
I lied about that

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,800
because that ajeossi* was forcing you into his car.
(*older man, mid-30s onward)

190
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:19,830
But... who was that man?

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,200
He's my tutor.

192
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
What?

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Kim So Heon?

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,100
He's that tutor who looks like Kim So Heon?

195
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,200
What happened?

196
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
At first,

197
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,900
I just thought someone liked me, so I didn't really care.

198
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,600
I couldn't even tell my mom.

199
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,500
I thought I could just ignore it.

200
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,800
I didn't know you were going through this.

202
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,000
No. I'm the one who should apologize.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But...

204
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,200
Ji Na.

205
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,700
Then...

206
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
are you forgiving me?

207
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,000
What do you mean, forgive?

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,900
I forgot about it all.

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,300
Ji Na.

210
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,200
By the way,

211
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,300
don't we need to report him?

212
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,400
If I report him,

213
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,300
everyone else will find out, and it worries me.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,400
I wonder why he did that.

215
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,300
Hello?

216
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
Yes, I'm on my way.

217
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,000
You're going to be late today?

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,300
Okay.

219
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,174
Yes.

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,100
- Let's get on the bus.
- Okay.

221
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,900
It could get more dangerous if I let this slide.

222
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Sin Ae, you're not hurt, right?

223
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Sin Ae, can you call me?

225
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,900
If it's giving me a signal again,

226
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,000
it means Kim So Heon really is the stalker.

227
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,900
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

228
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,800
Enter target's name.

229
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,600
Kim So Heon

230
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,000
We will proceed with the revenge.

231
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Gosh, Sin Ae.

232
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,300
Please give me a call.

233
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You have been selected as a revenge target

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,600
What is this? Revenge...

235
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,800
Is this voice phishing or what?

236
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Gosh.

237
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,300
66 OH 5162

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,100
It looks painful. Does it hurt a lot?

239
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,000
It hurts a little.

240
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This won't do. You should put some ointment on it.

241
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
Go on in first. I'll stop by the pharmacy.

242
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,400
It's okay. I can just put a bandage on it.

243
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,800
We can't let it leave a scar. Go ahead first.

244
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:35,455
I ♥ you

245
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
Sin Ae,

246
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,800
happy birthday.

247
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,700
Why is it doing this again?

248
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,700
Sin Ae,

249
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
shall we blow out the candles together?

250
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,200
One, two, three.

251
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,400
My mom will be

252
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,800
coming home soon.

253
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,200
Your mom?

254
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Your mom said she would be late today.

255
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
I heard it all.

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,600
You even listened in on my phone calls?

257
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm doing this all for you.

258
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't want weird guys around you.

259
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,800
You're the weird one.

260
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Why are you doing this to me?

261
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,300
Me?

262
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,300
I'm the weird one?

263
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,600
You seduced me first.

264
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,400
You smiled at me

265
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,500
and said you wanted a boyfriend like me.

266
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,400
Who is this?

267
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
It might be hard to believe, but she's my girlfriend.

268
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
- Really? - Yes.

269
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,600
She is so pretty.

270
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,500
No, you are so much prettier.

271
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Gosh, I really wish

272
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,400
I had a boyfriend like you.

273
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
You'll date someone much better.

274
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,900
No, I don't even have one.

275
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:46,966
66 OH 5162

276
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,900
This car...

277
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,000
Sin Ae.

278
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,400
No way.

279
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,800
Oh, right.

280
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,100
I need to give you your present.

281
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,300
Here's your present.

282
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,300
Open it.

283
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Hurry up!

284
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,000
Do you like it?

285
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
Is it pretty?

286
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,200
Would you like to try it on?

287
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,800
Sin Ae,

288
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,000
you want to try it on, right?

289
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,400
Isn't it pretty?

290
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Do you want to try it on?

291
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,400
It looks so good on you.

292
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,800
Sin Ae,

293
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,600
you are so pretty!

294
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,500
Why do you look so surprised?

295
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,300
Do you like it that much?

296
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,400
Do you really like it?

297
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,600
You lunatic.

298
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,200
He's...

299
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,700
not dead, right?

300
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,500
No way.

301
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,300
Let's call the police first.

302
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,800
But...

303
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,200
shouldn't we tie him up?

304
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,900
Where am I?

305
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,600
Oh my gosh! Why am I so high up?

306
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,000
What do I do?

307
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,600
I'll just do it.

308
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,200
What is this? Why is this here?

309
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,900
Darn it.

310
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,900
What is he doing?

311
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,500
Why is he doing that?

312
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Please.

313
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,100
- Oh my gosh.
- He's running away.

314
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
I must be careful.

315
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,300
Oh my gosh.

316
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,800
- What is he doing?
- What's going on?

317
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Please don't take pictures.

318
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
- He's a pervert.
- I'm not a pervert!

319
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm working out.

320
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,600
- What's wrong with him?
- Sir, it's dangerous. Come down.

321
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,800
- He must be a pervert.
- It's dangerous.

322
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,000
- What is he doing?
- He is a pervert.

323
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
He can't go that way.

324
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
- Oh no.
- What do we do?

325
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,300
This isn't right.

326
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
Is he okay?

327
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
- Is he okay?
- Oh my gosh.

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,200
- Is he all right?
- What do we do?

329
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
- Is he dead?
- Do you think he's okay?

330
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,600
- Should we go down?
- Are you okay?

331
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Oh no.

332
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
Call the police.

333
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
- I'm alive.
- Oh my.

334
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,700
- Is he hurt?
- Look at him.

335
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
- Oh my gosh.
- Why is it so crowded here?

336
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
Move! Move over!

337
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,600
Don't take pictures! I'll report you!

338
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,600
Stop taking pictures!

339
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,200
What's wrong with him?

340
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,700
Gosh.

341
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Watch where you're going, punk.

342
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,100
Aren't you...

343
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,600
The crosswalk?

344
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,200
What are you... Darn it.

345
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,500
Gosh.

346
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,600
Where are my glasses?

347
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
What is this?

348
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
These punks really...

349
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,200
Hey, get this off of me.

350
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,800
You better get it off before I do.

351
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
You're not going to get it off?

352
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,200
One, two, three...

353
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
Four...

354
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,000
- Please listen to me.
- Look at him.

355
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,800
- Mister, it hurts. Go easy on me.
- Gosh.

356
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
- Darn it. Please...
- Goodness.

357
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
- This guy is a mess.
- What?

358
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,400
Look at this. He secretly took pictures of girls.

359
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,800
He did it to dozens of people.

360
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
You are under arrest for public indecency,

361
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,900
violation of the Criminal Act on Sexual Crimes of Violence,

362
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,100
and physical assault.

363
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,000
It looks like he'll be in jail for a long time.

364
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Je Yi, what are you doing here?

365
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,800
This student caught him.

366
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
You seem to be a high schooler. You did a great job.

367
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,800
- You're really amazing.
- No, I'm not.

368
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,600
I caught him with Ro Bin's help.

369
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,800
With Ro Bin?

370
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,500
Excuse me. She is my girlfriend.

371
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,300
If you listen to my girlfriend, she'll explain what happened.

372
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,000
Sin Ae, please tell them.

373
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
We only loved each other.

374
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,300
Please tell them about me. This is so unfair.

375
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,800
What are you talking about? Take him away.

376
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,000
Sin Ae, are you really going to let me leave like this?

377
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,800
Sin Ae!

378
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
- Sin Ae, save me.
- Gosh, stay still.

379
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,400
- Go easy on me. I'm in pain.
- Cover his mouth.

380
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,200
I seriously can't get in this car!

381
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,031
Police

382
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:51,000
So you got hurt yesterday

383
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,100
because of that stalker?

384
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm sorry. You got hurt by that stalker because of me.

385
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,200
No. He's the bad guy.

386
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,500
Are you okay though? Are you hurt anywhere?

387
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,100
Yes, I'm okay.

388
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,600
That was a close call. Be careful.

389
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,000
You don't need to go to the hospital, do you?

390
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
I'm okay.

391
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,700
That's a relief.

392
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,800
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

393
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,900
I think I'm okay too.

394
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,781
Please listen to me.

395
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,600
I only threw a birthday party for my girlfriend.

396
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,800
- Be quiet.
- Is that a crime? Is love a crime?

397
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,600
- Shut up.
- Gosh.

398
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,400
I told you to go easy on me. Why are you so rough with me?

399
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,600
That scared me!

400
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
Hey!

401
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,900
Did you just sit on me?

402
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

403
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,400
So you can sit on someone just because you didn't know?

404
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
No, I cannot.

405
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
This won't do.

406
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,800
We'll have to teach him a lesson.

407
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
- Guys.
- Yes.

408
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
- Cover him.
- Okay.

409
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,400
- All right.
- But I'm a well-educated person.

410
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
- You're too loud.
- You don't have to do this.

411
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,000
- How dare you?
- Wait. Please stop.

412
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,400
-Who do you think you are?
- Please...

413
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,500
I'm hurt. Stop hitting the same spot.

414
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,800
- I'm sorry.
- Hey!

415
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,600
Please stop! Please...

416
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,900
Punk.

417
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,200
Hello, it's nice to meet you. My greetings were late.

418
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
I respect you!

419
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,100
Your revenge is complete

420
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,000
I wonder why it suddenly started blinking, before.

421
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,100
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Listen to me. Get in the car.

422
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,800
Why is it doing this again?

423
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
It looks so good on you.

424
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,100
Does it signify an emergency situation?

425
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,600
You even have a function like that?

426
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,600
What in the world are you?

427
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:38,038
Your revenge is complete.

428
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,200
- Ji Na!
- Yes?

429
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,700
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

430
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,800
The weather is so nice today.

431
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,200
- It's so nice.
- Shall we go play?

432
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Sure.

433
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,100
- Your hair looks good today.
- I know, right?

434
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,200
I wanted a sharp nose with no chin fat. Was it that difficult?

435
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,400
I gave you long ears and a tongue. What more could you want?

436
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,600
My eyes, nose, and lips are just circles.

437
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,400
I told you to erase the mole.

438
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,600
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

439
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh.

440
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Je Yi dropped this in the make-up class.

441
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,400
Can you give it to him?

442
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
Okay.

443
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,700
You and Je Yi look really good together.

444
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,600
What do you mean, we look good?

445
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,300
Je Yi was worried about you a lot that day.

446
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,800
It's because we're next-door neighbors.

447
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:50,691
[Epilogue]
