~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:04,133
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:32,993
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:47,105
No matter how I see it, Ji Man looks suspicious.

5
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,962
What in the world am I imagining?

6
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,695
Let's not worry about it.

7
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:08,367
Ban Yi Deun

8
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,392
How is Yi Deun?

9
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:27,807
Well... He's fine.

10
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,651
Where did it go?

11
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:36,706
What? Are you looking for something?

12
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:39,878
No, it's nothing.

13
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,369
Darn it.

14
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,784
Ban Yi Deun

15
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,754
What in the world

16
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:07,476
happened to me?

17
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,773
He's a devil dressed as an angel.

18
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:17,316
I experienced hell today.

19
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,660
What is this? "Devil"?

20
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:26,947
We're back to school.

21
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,749
The devil was at it again today.

22
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,363
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:38,567
Nobody knows and I want to tell them all

24
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,781
that they're being fooled.

25
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:48,087
Sorry.

26
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:51,250
It's okay. It's not because of you.

27
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:54,483
Did it happen then too?

28
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,861
When they were together...

29
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:07,928
The devil was the worst at the nurse's office today.

30
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,218
Darn it!

31
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:11,301
Will this ever

32
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,934
come to an end?

33
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:16,306
The devil is

34
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:18,768
so powerful.

35
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:20,980
Yi Deun went to the nurse's office

36
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,063
during the last gym class.

37
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:26,125
Mr. Choi, I don't think Yi Deun is feeling good.

38
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,308
I'll take him to the nurse.

39
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,572
Then

40
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:34,874
is Ji Man the devil?

41
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:39,169
Hey. Do you have a problem?

42
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,261
I'm asking you.

43
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,084
Hey,

44
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,847
don't be scared. I won't hit you.

45
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:59,079
Nurse's Office

46
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,102
You feel dirty, right?

47
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:03,944
Darn it!

48
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:08,658
Yi Deun, what's wrong with you?

49
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,254
Please...

50
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,438
save me.

51
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:33,943
Hand it over.

52
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,615
I don't want to.

53
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:40,139
Is everything written in here true?

54
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,852
Do you think it would be?

55
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:43,722
Of course it's not.

56
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,376
Yi Deun is a bit...

57
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:49,569
What do you call it?

58
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,503
He's a bit sick. Mentally and physically.

59
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,725
You're not even the type to care about others.

60
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,760
So hand it over and go on with your day.

61
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:11,570
I heard you transferred here after causing trouble.

62
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,555
Gosh, it won't do you any good

63
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:17,367
if you cause a scene here.

64
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,809
Worry about yourself, not me.

65
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,633
What would you do if I exposed this?

66
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,534
Yi Deun made it all up.

67
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,407
You better not show that to anyone!

68
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,288
Seo Ro Bin!

69
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:39,989
Hey!

70
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,431
Darn it.

71
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,205
Hey, I don't feel sleepy today.

72
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:49,570
Ji Man, are you checking up on Yi Deun?

73
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,131
Yes. They say he's recovering,

74
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,654
so I'm going to check on him.

75
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,015
You're doing so much for Yi Deun.

76
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:58,518
Shouldn't we give you an award or something?

77
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:02,001
What do you mean, award? It's something I should definitely do.

78
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,773
Let's go.

79
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,215
You're so nice.

80
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:07,055
No, I'm not.

81
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:13,032
You know Ha Ji Man, the class president?

82
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:14,194
What kind of guy is he?

83
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:16,015
I'm not sure.

84
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:18,037
He's just the class president.

85
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:20,790
He gets good grades and treats his classmates well.

86
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,584
Everyone likes him because he's nice.

87
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,644
Are you sure

88
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:28,498
he doesn't have another side to him?

89
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:29,960
The class president?

90
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,542
You might as well call Rok Hui a boy.

91
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:36,145
Stop the nonsense. Let's go.

92
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:47,787
Medical Checkup Front Desk

93
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:03,953
You startled me.

94
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:05,695
Why are you here?

95
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,838
I'm worried about what you said earlier

96
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:11,001
about Ji Man.

97
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:13,092
You're not the type to say things like that.

98
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:15,324
Is there a reason why you said that?

99
00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:24,583
I'll explain later.

100
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,440
It's such a relief

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,491
that he wasn't hurt badly.

102
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:37,366
It's all my fault.

103
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,968
I said I would be by his side.

104
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,341
I can't believe that happened.

105
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:43,993
No.

106
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:47,627
You've always been there for Yi Deun.

107
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm so thankful for you.

108
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:59,188
I think the class president is crying.

109
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,291
It's all acting.

110
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,344
He could totally be an actor.

111
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,045
What?

112
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,180
He's coming this way.

113
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:20,459
We're back at school

114
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,881
The devil was at it again today

115
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,721
Is this all true?

116
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:35,174
The devil mentioned here is the class president?

117
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,376
I think it's all true.

118
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:40,230
Then we should do something about it.

119
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,831
Let's go.

120
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:48,728
Hello,

121
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,950
I am Yi Deun's classmate,

122
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,743
Oh Ji Na.

123
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:55,384
This is Seo Ro Bin.

124
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:59,569
You must be here to visit Yi Deun.

125
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,652
It's such a shame

126
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:04,334
that he's still sleeping.

127
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:07,206
Actually,

128
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:11,009
we're here to tell you something about Yi Deun.

129
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,585
- Would you like to read this?
- What?

130
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:16,936
What's that?

131
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:20,189
This is Yi Deun's notebook.

132
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:22,040
You should take a look at it.

133
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:24,805
Please don't be too shocked.

134
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:27,727
Why would I be shocked?

135
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,032
Hi, oppa Je Yi.

136
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:44,874
Hi, Sa Na.

137
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:49,580
Oppa, where's Oppa Ro Bin?

138
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,631
He's visiting someone at the hospital.

139
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:54,814
Ji Na said she was visiting someone at the hospital too.

140
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:58,158
Are they together again?

141
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:00,510
Oppa,

142
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,883
I really want things to work out with you and Ji Na.

143
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,345
So, good luck!

144
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:07,637
Fighting, fighting!

145
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:10,750
Sure, thanks. Fighting.

146
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:15,225
Look at this.

147
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:17,527
You can read all the things

148
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:19,860
that Ji Man did to Yi Deun.

149
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,282
Please. Get your facts straight.

150
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:25,065
Ji Man's name is never mentioned there.

151
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,588
Ma'am, Yi Deun's mother is only suggesting that it's Ji Man,

152
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,589
based on the circumstances—

153
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,180
Ms. Maeng,

154
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,332
don't butt in, stay out of it.

155
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,416
Even this time, he was with Ji Man

156
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:40,250
when he fell down the stairs.

157
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,963
Ji Man definitely pushed him.

158
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:46,676
Do you have proof that my son did that?

159
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:49,758
Don't accuse someone without any proof.

160
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:53,683
Principal,

161
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:57,267
you know what my Ji Man has done for Yi Deun all this time,

162
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,557
don't you?

163
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,651
Of course I know.

164
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:03,513
Because of Ji Man's great personality,

165
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:06,807
I even recommended him for the service award.

166
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,578
What?

167
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:10,550
You're giving him the service award?

168
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,952
Ma'am.

169
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,745
I am positive

170
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:20,671
that Ha Ji Man would never do such a thing.

171
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:23,943
You can't be like this after reading some things

172
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:25,546
written in a notebook.

173
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:27,857
If you keep acting this way,

174
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:29,859
it won't be good for Yi Deun.

175
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:33,583
Principal, this is absurd!

176
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:37,006
- Ma'am—
- Ms. Maeng!

177
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:39,047
Stay seated.

178
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:41,651
By the way,

179
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:44,695
Ji Man's award won't be canceled or anything

180
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,297
because of this, will it?

181
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:51,702
My Ji Man worked so hard to get that award.

182
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:54,914
Don't worry. It won't be affected at all.

183
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,397
Those who can, can, and those who can't, can't.

184
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:59,610
That's my motto.

185
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,292
I will always support students like Ha Ji Man

186
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:06,737
for having a good influence on our school.

187
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,638
Right.

188
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,596
Excuse me.

189
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,937
Hello.

190
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,060
You're the one who visited before.

191
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,602
Yes.

192
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:24,923
I wanted to ask how it went.

193
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,677
Well...

194
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,412
Yi Deun's mother!

195
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:34,214
From reading what Yi Deun wrote,

196
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,886
he seems to be mentally unstable.

197
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:40,479
He should get some psychiatric treatment while he's at the hospital.

198
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,253
What did you say?

199
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:45,675
Yi Deun is like this because of your son.

200
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:48,509
You do know that Ji Man's dad is a lawyer, don't you?

201
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:51,131
We'll sue you if you say anything,

202
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:53,172
so watch out.

203
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,911
Ji Na,

204
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:03,603
thank you.

205
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:06,396
Don't worry too much.

206
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:10,129
I'll be going to see Yi Deun now.

207
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,790
Unbelievable.

208
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,312
I have to do something about this.

209
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,350
I experienced hell today.

210
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:35,305
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Enter target's name

211
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,428
Will this ever

212
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,619
come to an end?

213
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,282
Ha Ji Man

214
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,658
Save me.

215
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:53,173
Target meets all conditions.
We will proceed with the revenge.

216
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,685
You have been selected as a revenge target.

217
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:08,156
I'm a target for revenge?

218
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:11,179
Who sent this?

219
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,144
Is it Yi Deun?

220
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:20,620
Gosh, what a fool.

221
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,573
- Darn it.
- Are you all right?

222
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,815
I'm so sorry. It was an accident.

223
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:38,297
Are you all right?

224
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:41,291
Does it hurt a lot?

225
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,192
Class President, what's wrong with you?

226
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,773
Are you hurt somewhere?

227
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,527
No, it's just...

228
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,599
Go to the nurse if it hurts.

229
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,662
By the way, the math thesis was due yesterday.

230
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,183
Why didn't you turn it in?

231
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,706
It was such a good opportunity for you. What a waste.

232
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,621
What? I sent it to you, Ms. Maeng.

233
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:13,362
You did? I didn't get yours though.

234
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,876
There's no way.

235
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:18,208
I definitely sent it.

236
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,762
Failed to send mail

237
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,285
No way.

238
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:27,386
Aish—

239
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:32,311
Teacher Maeng, can I just turn it in now?

240
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:35,245
Sorry, but rules are rules.

241
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:38,097
Class President...

242
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,201
What's wrong with him?

243
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,862
I'm scared.

244
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,209
Hey, was it you?

245
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:52,411
Were you the one that told Yi Deun's mom?

246
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:55,615
So what if I did?

247
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:57,548
So you did.

248
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:59,529
You're in big trouble now.

249
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:01,120
Do you think I would let this go?

250
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,103
Do whatever you want. Move.

251
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,030
Just wait and see, Seo Ro Bin.

252
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:18,638
Why are you here?

253
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:20,299
When did you wake up?

254
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:22,612
They said they would let me know.

255
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:24,825
- How mean of them.
- Stay away.

256
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:26,806
Because you

257
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:29,980
just had to write those things in your notebook,

258
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,321
I almost got in trouble.

259
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:35,505
Of course

260
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:38,176
no one believed it, though.

261
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:47,247
Why? Do you feel wronged?

262
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:49,108
Yes.

263
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,029
I feel wronged.

264
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:54,964
That's why

265
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,235
I'm not taking it anymore.

266
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,632
Then,

267
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:04,193
what are you going to do about it?

268
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,185
Are you

269
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,646
depending on this?

270
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:17,247
Are you?

271
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:20,330
You pitiful boy.

272
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,422
Delete

273
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:28,258
Stupid and incompetent people like you

274
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:30,460
do these things.

275
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,632
Deleting that

276
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:36,266
won't get rid of the things you've done.

277
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,968
Hey, be quiet.

278
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:41,350
Do you want me to break your legs too?

279
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,073
Yi Deun,

280
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:46,706
my dad is a lawyer.

281
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:48,307
Don't you know what that means?

282
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:50,180
No matter what I do,

283
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,402
I won't get in trouble.

284
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,164
Also,

285
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:58,216
when I think about all the trouble you've caused...

286
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,407
So,

287
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,438
if you don't want to get hurt more,

288
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:11,211
say that everything in your notebook was made up.

289
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,803
Okay?

290
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,310
Listen to me, all right?

291
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:37,978
[Chatroom comments]

292
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:40,190
Hey, what is this?

293
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,902
- Turn it off right now.
- I don't know.

294
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:44,222
I didn't do this.

295
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,210
Darn it.

296
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,203
Yi Deun, you damn...

297
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:01,400
Boramae Hospital

298
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,428
How are you feeling?

299
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:10,019
I'm okay.

300
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,102
Why did you want to see me?

301
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:17,518
I wanted to thank you.

302
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:19,458
You might not know this,

303
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,120
but you gave me courage.

304
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:30,030
I don't know what's going on,

305
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,931
but chin up.

306
00:19:55,535 --> 00:20:02,542
The brightest star shines in the darkest of nights

307
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,039
Let's stop this.

308
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:23,813
Anyway, you're pretty smart.

309
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:26,957
Ha Ji Man got in huge trouble.

310
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:28,468
Weren't you the one who did that?

311
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,150
Me?

312
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,570
No.

313
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:34,805
Sure, let's leave it at that.

314
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:36,985
It's seriously not me.

315
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:44,043
Come to the park immediately

316
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,916
if you don't want your brother to get beaten up.

317
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,107
Sorry, Yi Deun.

318
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:59,168
Why isn't he picking up?

319
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,732
Please pick up.

320
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:22,242
Ha Ji Man, are you just losing it now?

321
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:27,276
Look at you now. You shouldn't have pushed that kid.

322
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:28,788
You can't make it obvious.

323
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,611
Shut up.

324
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:32,552
You can't be accusing me too.

325
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,454
It's seriously not me.

326
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:36,716
Yah, sure.

327
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,639
I saw your face that day.

328
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,872
- How dare you lie?
- How dare you?

329
00:21:41,872 --> 00:21:43,163
Gosh.

330
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,104
Anyway, why did you call me over?

331
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,337
I'm on the student council. I'm not like you.

332
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:49,048
Well,

333
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,271
you said before

334
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:54,403
that you don't like Seo Ro Bin because he's arrogant.

335
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,528
Seo Ro Bin?

336
00:21:57,528 --> 00:21:59,918
We can't have earphones in school?

337
00:22:01,742 --> 00:22:03,143
All right then.

338
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:06,787
Hey, aren't you going to apologize?

339
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:09,068
Shouldn't you be apologizing?

340
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,142
I'll be sure to repay you,

341
00:22:12,142 --> 00:22:13,593
so punish Seo Ro Bin for me.

342
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,096
Okay, I'd be down.

343
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:18,447
I've always wanted to punish him.

344
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:24,975
5 missed calls from Seo Ro Bin

345
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,383
- Hello?
- Hey, are you okay?

346
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:35,566
Where are you at the park?

347
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:37,337
What do you mean, park?

348
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,200
Hey, he's here.

349
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,716
- Seo Ro Bin.
- Was it you?

350
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:58,689
- Did you send that text?
- Gosh,

351
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:00,010
you're so fast.

352
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,252
You must be close to your brother.

353
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:07,657
What are you doing here?

354
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,922
How rude. You don't even recognize your seonbae.

355
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:13,733
I'm Song Do Min, Song Do Min!

356
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:16,857
I know. I was just checking.

357
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:19,530
You look like a rascal,

358
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,221
not a student council head.

359
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,391
You little...

360
00:23:27,957 --> 00:23:30,399
You can just stop now and leave.

361
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,433
Hey. Are you scared?

362
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:36,215
You're full of beans because I went easy on you.

363
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,977
- You're dead meat.
- Do you fight with your mouth?

364
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:45,975
Are you nuts?

365
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:48,147
Hey, get him!

366
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,181
What are you doing here?

367
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,853
I knew you'd be doing this.

368
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:30,340
What is this?

369
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:34,884
He's not dead, is he?

370
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:37,427
- What are you guys doing over there?
- Run!

371
00:24:37,427 --> 00:24:38,928
Damn it.

372
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:40,929
Stop right there!

373
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:46,016
Ro Bin, wake up.

374
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:47,937
Ro Bin,

375
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:49,959
wake up.

376
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,593
Somebody help!

377
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:02,883
Oppa,

378
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:04,765
are you all right?

379
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:06,136
Why do you ask?

380
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:09,379
You got a bruise here.

381
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,794
Really?

382
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:16,275
I'm all right. It's not a big deal.

383
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:20,720
Are you sad that my eonni only pays attention

384
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,232
to Oppa Ro Bin?

385
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:27,887
No.

386
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:50,180
Failed to send mail

387
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,974
Your revenge is complete.

388
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:06,996
When did you become so important to me?

389
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,207
You're up. Do you want some water?

390
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,541
Don't go.

391
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,186
Aren't you thirsty though?

392
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:20,009
You need to drink a lot of water to be healthy.

393
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,700
Ro Bin!

394
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:48,077
Ro Bin, what happened?

395
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:50,259
He's not hurt that badly.

396
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:52,121
Shut up.

397
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:54,684
How did you guys know I was here?

398
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:57,376
I swear I only told Bo Ra.

399
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:00,379
Of course we should come when a friend is hurt.

400
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,962
Let's take a picture.

401
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:04,004
Everybody gather round.

402
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:07,045
One, two, three.

403
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:10,299
Nice.

404
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:15,244
So Ha Ji Man did all this?

405
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:18,368
It's so shocking. How could the class president do that?

406
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:21,121
There's a petition saying he should be punished.

407
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,902
Even if his dad is a lawyer,

408
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:25,486
he won't be able to get away with it this time.

409
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,657
At the least, he'll be expelled.

410
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:30,510
That wouldn't be enough for him.

411
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,923
Hey, stop eating so much.

412
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:35,714
This is for Ro Bin. Why are you eating it all?

413
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:37,957
I'm getting a food coma now.

414
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:39,809
Ro Bin, move over a bit.

415
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:42,002
Hey, Ro Bin's a patient.

416
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:44,184
Never mind. You guys should just leave now.

417
00:28:44,184 --> 00:28:45,506
Oh Ji Na, are you serious?

418
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:48,286
Are you Ro Bin's girlfriend or something?

419
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,892
But why did the class president push Yi Deun?

420
00:28:52,892 --> 00:28:54,933
I don't know.

421
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,937
- Maybe he was angry.
- He dug his own grave.

422
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:00,521
Everything was revealed because of that.

423
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,331
I thought of something important.

424
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:06,066
Now that the class president is gone, shouldn't we elect a new one?

425
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:08,157
Why? Do you want to be class president?

426
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:09,298
Don't even think about it.

427
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:11,951
Why not? I would be good at it.

428
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:14,954
Rok Hui, you should be class president instead.

429
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,566
I'm not the class president type.

430
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:18,529
You're better than him though.

431
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:21,371
See? I'm the only potential candidate.

432
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:22,683
What are you saying?

433
00:29:22,683 --> 00:29:24,173
Sin Ae would be better.

434
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:26,074
- That's true.
- You're right.

435
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:31,010
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

436
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,845
Why are you suddenly acting abnormally?

437
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:37,247
Don't bother me anymore.

438
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:39,519
Are you rebelling now?

439
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,352
I wrote down everything you've done to me.

440
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:44,634
If you don't stop, I'll show this to everyone.

441
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,667
You're making me so angry.

442
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,529
Go ahead and try it.

443
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,981
Who would believe you?

444
00:29:51,981 --> 00:29:54,074
Quit the nonsense and hand it over.

445
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:56,256
Give it to me.

446
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:58,888
Hand it over.

447
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,640
Give it to me.

448
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,062
- Stay away from me.
- Hand it over.

449
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:04,943
Stay away.

450
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:08,818
Give it to me!

451
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:11,041
Hand it over!

452
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,702
Darn it!

453
00:30:12,702 --> 00:30:14,703
I told you to hand it over!

454
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,598
Somebody,

455
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,691
please

456
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:27,015
save me.

457
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,341
Please save me.

458
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:47,668
You're Seo Je Yi, right? You were here once.

459
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:49,169
You're from Hanjong High School, right?

460
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:50,900
Hello.

461
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,192
Who are you here for?

462
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:54,715
My brother got hurt.

463
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:56,445
It's your brother this time?

464
00:30:56,445 --> 00:30:59,047
It's not good to be at the hospital so often.

465
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:02,562
Do you want something to drink?

466
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:06,455
Young lady, go ahead and pick one.

467
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:08,207
Thank you.

468
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:09,840
- Je Yi, you too.
- Oh, yes.

469
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,360
Thank you.

470
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,074
How is the girl you came with last time?

471
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,537
Yes, she's doing well, thanks to you.

472
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:20,268
Really? That's good to hear.

473
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:24,022
This is for Ro Bin.

474
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:27,217
I'll see you guys later.

475
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:36,696
Are you close to that doctor?

476
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:40,130
Yes, I met him last time.

477
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,103
But how does he know Ro Bin's name?

478
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,004
I'm not sure.
