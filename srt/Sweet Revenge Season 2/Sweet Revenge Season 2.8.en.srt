2
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:32,953
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

3
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:56,865
So you work here?

4
00:00:58,018 --> 00:01:00,390
That's why you couldn't say anything.

5
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:05,024
Should I just tell everyone?

6
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:20,640
Stay quiet.

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,841
If you tell people, I'm going to get you.

8
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,809
That's Ro Bin, isn't it?

9
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:36,316
Seo Ro Bin!

10
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,916
Is this a hamburger shop?

11
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,978
I told you to stay out of my business.

12
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,793
- So this is why you can't tell anyone?
- Let go.

13
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,908
Can't you just be honest and tell everyone?

14
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:11,710
If I'm unlucky, I could even get expelled.

15
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:14,644
First of all, quit this job immediately.

16
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:16,436
Don't worry about me.

17
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,998
Just go home.

18
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:30,570
You're Seo Je Yi from Class Two, right?

19
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,311
Aren't you Ro Bin's older brother?

20
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,174
And you didn't know Ro Bin worked here?

21
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,668
Hey, are you listening to me?

22
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:40,370
So he can't tell anyone.

23
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,292
And if we want to clear his name, we need to find the real culprit.

24
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:45,966
We can do that. Don't worry too much.

25
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,267
Let's go.

26
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,329
Hey!

27
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:53,432
Hey! Are you ignoring me?

28
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:55,585
Hey, Oh Ji Na!

29
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:05,153
Who could have taken Ju Ri's wallet?

30
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:11,631
I wish Revenge Note could tell me who the culprit is.

31
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,056
Revenge Note,

32
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,458
tell me who the culprit is.

33
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,215
Of course it doesn't work that way.

34
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:02,543
Hanjong High School

35
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:16,556
He's shameless.

36
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,434
Hi.

37
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,857
Hey.

38
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,401
You don't care even if he's a thief?

39
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,933
You still like him?

40
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,476
It isn't him.

41
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,197
He's being falsely accused.

42
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,580
She's totally blinded by love.

43
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,792
- She's calling a thief innocent.
- Do you guys have a death wish?

44
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,024
The only thing Ro Bin stole

45
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:48,417
is my heart.

46
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,600
She's totally lost it.

47
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,012
There's no cure for this.

48
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:56,946
You're okay, right?

49
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:59,158
Everyone,

50
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:02,061
they already made the t-shirts.

51
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:06,065
So we can't cancel the order and we have to send the money by tonight.

52
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:08,478
Let's just collect the money again.

53
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,111
Even if you don't have money, try to borrow some.

54
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,423
- You want us to pay 20,000 won (≈$180) again?
- Why do we have to pay?

55
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:16,596
Class President, make the thief pay for it.

56
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:20,580
We'll get the money back once we catch the thief.

57
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,593
- Let's just collect it again.
- But we already caught him.

58
00:05:23,593 --> 00:05:25,665
We clearly know who did it.

59
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:28,838
It's ridiculous that the whole class has to suffer.

60
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:31,259
- Ro Bin didn't do it.
- Ro Bin didn't do it.

61
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:35,744
- There's no proof.
- There's no proof.

62
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:40,189
- You can't do that.
- You can't do that.

63
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:47,047
I heard that there was exactly 400,000 won (≈ $360) in the envelope Ro Bin had.

64
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,887
What do you think now?

65
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,813
Everyone, stop.

66
00:05:55,526 --> 00:05:58,709
Don't treat Ro Bin like that.

67
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,720
It might not be someone from our class.

68
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:05,494
It's my fault for losing it and not managing it better.

69
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:08,878
Why is that your fault? You're the victim here.

70
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:11,060
We all didn't want to collect it,

71
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,422
and you took charge and did it.

72
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:15,425
She's right. It doesn't matter who collected it.

73
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,066
That person would have stolen it anyway.

74
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,598
Don't worry about it.

75
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,732
Gosh, this is so annoying.

76
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,946
Don't worry about it.

77
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,033
She's so scary.

78
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,818
- Pass the ball!
- Give him the ball.

79
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:39,238
- Pass it.
- Pass the ball.

80
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:41,139
- Over here.
- Pass it.

81
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,628
Come on!

82
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,288
Why are they playing by themselves?

83
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:51,411
- They should've passed it.
- I know.

84
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,880
Come out.

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,012
What's going on? What's wrong with them?

86
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,584
Catch it!

87
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,936
You need to pass it to Ro Bin.

88
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:09,149
You're not going to score playing like that.

89
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:12,221
My gosh.

90
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:20,189
But how did Su Ji know where to find Ro Bin?

91
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:24,664
Pass it here. Pass...

92
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:34,405
- Who did that?
- Sorry.

93
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:36,465
My hand slipped.

94
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,342
This is so frustrating.

95
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:45,224
Try using your brains.

96
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:49,128
If there's a thief on the team, how is that going to look to the others?

97
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:52,161
What do you think?

98
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,024
So what do you want us to do?

99
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:56,146
What I'm saying is...

100
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:58,857
Let's pull him off the team.

101
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,471
I'm against that.

102
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,684
Could we even win without Ro Bin?

103
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,544
He's the ace of the team.

104
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:06,657
What are you talking about?

105
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,158
I'm here. Don't you trust me?

106
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:10,329
That's right, An Mi Nam.

107
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,051
We can totally win without Ro Bin on the team.

108
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:14,734
Let's take a vote.

109
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:17,748
Raise your hand if you're against pulling Ro Bin off.

110
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,004
It's over.

111
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,767
You see this, right?

112
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,329
You're out.

113
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,470
Okay, then.

114
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,223
Ha Sweong Su, you're in.

115
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:36,025
Really? All right!

116
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,707
You'll do good, right?

117
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:49,778
Whoever didn't pay for the shirts, pay up.

118
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,772
Come on.

119
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:55,294
Class President, I'll pay next time.

120
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:57,296
- Here you go.
- That's for me.

121
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,818
- This is Ha Jun's.
- Okay.

122
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,856
That's right.

123
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,266
I used my money at the cafeteria.

124
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,255
Hey, Ju Ri.

125
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:20,058
Sorry, but could you lend me 10,000 won (≈ $9)? I'll pay you back tomorrow.

126
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,432
Sure.

127
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,486
Thanks.

128
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:37,206
What is this?

129
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,339
Where's my money?

130
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,217
Is this...

131
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:50,782
Ji Na, what are you up to?

132
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,102
- Come with me.
- Me?

133
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,827
So this is the money you paid?

134
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:59,690
I think so.

135
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,691
Look at this.

136
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,313
When I paid this, this exact mark was on the bill.

137
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:05,764
Why did Ju Ri have that?

138
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:11,320
Do you think goody two-shoes Ju Ri stole this?

139
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:15,284
Everyone, stop.

140
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:18,528
Don't treat Ro Bin like that.

141
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:24,003
Your notes are definitely something else.

142
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:26,345
They're awesome.

143
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,599
I'm not too sure.

144
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:33,092
The money I paid was definitely stolen.

145
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:35,325
But why does Ju Ri have it?

146
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:37,306
So Ju Ri pocketed the money,

147
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:40,198
and she made it look like someone stole it.

148
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:45,314
Then this should be proof that will clear Ro Bin's name, right?

149
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:47,357
- No.
- Why not?

150
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:50,279
You're just saying that mark is yours.

151
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,051
What if they say you're lying because you're Ro Bin's friend?

152
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,516
We need more solid proof.

153
00:10:57,516 --> 00:10:59,099
Jeong Bo Ra.

154
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,040
You have that video you took during gym class, right?

155
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,682
I do. Why?

156
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,174
The teacher wants you to edit it to upload on the school website.

157
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,426
Okay. When does he want it?

158
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:10,168
Right away. Edit it and send it.

159
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,852
Let's go to the computer room for now.

160
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,166
This is your last chance.

161
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,858
Tell me where you worked to get this money.

162
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:22,372
You little brat.

163
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,044
Will you keep doing this?

164
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:25,855
I didn't steal it.

165
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,857
Seo Ro Bin...

166
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:29,430
That's why

167
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,402
I'm telling you to tell me where you worked to get this money.

168
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:34,022
Teacher!

169
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,660
He really did earn that money.

170
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,622
I can't tell you the details now, but it definitelywasn't Ro Bin.

171
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:44,765
But the proof is all there.

172
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:47,106
If you admit your wrongdoings now and reflect on yourself,

173
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,519
we could end this with just some school clean-up.

174
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,053
If you don't come clean, this could go to the disciplinary council.

175
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,873
Do you want that?

176
00:11:57,977 --> 00:11:59,179
Go on.

177
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,370
Let's talk next time.

178
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,122
Mr. Lee.

179
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:23,122
- I told you not to say anything.
- Just tell them about the club.

180
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,564
That's better than being a thief.

181
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:26,086
I told you I can't.

182
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,669
I don't want the club to suffer because of me.

183
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:32,711
I'd rather drop out of school.

184
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:37,046
Hey!

185
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:47,927
So you're saying

186
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:51,280
that this is all a fabricated story that Ju Ri made up?

187
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,552
I think so.

188
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:55,905
She definitely had her wallet up until gym class that day.

189
00:12:56,696 --> 00:13:00,559
But I have no idea when she pocketed it.

190
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:09,379
Bo Ra, this is the video that you took during gym class, right?

191
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,210
It is.

192
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,133
But I didn't film just our classmates.

193
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,285
But this video could help us out.

194
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:17,065
I'll take a look at it.

195
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:34,694
It's as we thought.

196
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:36,527
We can't tell just by this video.

197
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:39,989
I didn't keep filming the bleachers.

198
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:41,120
Wait a minute.

199
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,451
- What?
- What?

200
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:43,853
At first,

201
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:46,626
there's no water bottle near Ju Ri.

202
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,589
But here, there's a water bottle near her.

203
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:57,156
So during gym class, Ju Ri went back to the classroom

204
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:58,698
for a water bottle?

205
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:00,850
If she went there and back,

206
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,723
then she had time to hide the wallet.

207
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,795
But why would Ju Ri do that?

208
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:07,356
She's a model student.

209
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:08,758
I know, right?

210
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,311
This is so shocking.

211
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:14,162
That might not be her true self.

212
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,528
Let's find out

213
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,359
why she did it.

214
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,823
Baek Ju Ri

215
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:37,256
I didn't know Ju Ri was into designer brands.

216
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:40,269
You can't buy a designer-brand wallet for only 400,000 won.

217
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,593
What about a used one?

218
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Luxury bag for sale!!!

219
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,700
Oooh!

220
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,419
Baek Ju Ri, I'll send you the money right now

221
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:13,874
She wrote that she wanted to buy a designer brand bag a few days ago.

222
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:17,326
She even wrote that she was buying it on the day the wallet disappeared.

223
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:20,360
She did all of this just for a bag?

224
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:23,463
No way.

225
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:30,690
Give me a second.

226
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:40,970
Does this mean

227
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,034
that the culprit is Ju Ri for sure?

228
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:46,555
Isn't he the guy who stole the money for the class shirts?

229
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,408
You wouldn't suspect it from that face.

230
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:49,660
Make the thief pay for it.

231
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,721
He's got no conscience.

232
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,552
I guess he doesn't care.

233
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,550
That's right.

234
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,891
I can't let Ro Bin continue to be accused of stealing.

235
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:08,107
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

236
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,211
Enter target's name

237
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,352
Baek Ju Ri

238
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:16,086
Target meets all conditions.
We will proceed with the revenge.

239
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:30,039
But we can't clear Ro Bin's name with just this alone.

240
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,603
We need solid proof that Ju Ri is the culprit.

241
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:35,505
That's right. What should we do?

242
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,595
How about this?

243
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:46,346
Everyone.

244
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:48,117
Did you hear?

245
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:51,221
Teacher Maeng said that if the money doesn't show up by tomorrow,

246
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:53,073
she's going to call the police.

247
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,373
Really?

248
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:57,667
If the police come, they'll play the security camera footage.

249
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,418
Then they'll find the culprit right away.

250
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,581
What a relief. I hope they find the person quickly.

251
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,735
My dad knows a ton of people in the police.

252
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:06,336
Should I tell my dad?

253
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:09,009
Whoever it is must be shaking in their shoes right now.

254
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:12,482
If we catch the culprit, we'll all get our money back.

255
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:14,223
What if the culprit spent it all already?

256
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:17,697
Ju Ri, isn't that a relief? Now you don't have to worry.

257
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:20,601
I know. What a relief.

258
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:23,252
I hope they catch the culprit soon.

259
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:26,566
- What a relief.
- Yes.

260
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,819
You have been selected as a revenge target.

261
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:30,899
"Revenge target"?

262
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:39,919
What is this? Who could have sent this?

263
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,724
You have been selected as a revenge target.

264
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:46,276
- I'm so hungry.
- I know, right?

265
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,577
This calls for tteokbokki.*
(rice cakes in spicy sauce)

266
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:49,299
That sounds good.

267
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:52,452
They already called the police?

268
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:53,753
Let's go.

269
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,396
- Let's go eat tteokbokki.
- I'm going home.

270
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:12,012
What is this? This is annoying.

271
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:13,753
Darn it.

272
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,653
It's finally here.

273
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:26,164
You've come from so far away.

274
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,242
My bag. Where's my bag?

275
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:35,003
Did I just get conned?

276
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:40,840
My bag!

277
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:05,065
Seo Ro Bin

278
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,145
Why didn't you put it in?

279
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:44,565
I really could have become the culprit

280
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:47,046
if you put it in my locker.

281
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:48,609
Why didn't you put it in?

282
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:50,611
Isn't that why you're here?

283
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:52,072
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:55,134
I didn't originally intend to do this.

285
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:57,357
I was caught up in the moment.

286
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,971
I didn't think you would be accused.

287
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:03,062
You think that's a good excuse?

288
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:05,394
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

289
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:08,397
Ro Bin, I'm begging you.

290
00:20:08,397 --> 00:20:13,161
Please keep this a secret from our classmates.

291
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,547
I won't let that happen.

292
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:26,065
You want to stay quiet?

293
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:28,098
What about Ro Bin?

294
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:29,750
You want him to keep being called a thief?

295
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,793
I know I'm asking for the impossible,

296
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:35,234
but if the other students know...

297
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:39,198
Please do this for me. I'll do anything.

298
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,221
Please just keep this a secret.

299
00:20:45,835 --> 00:20:47,687
Okay.

300
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:49,630
I'll keep this a secret from the other students.

301
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,732
Really?

302
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:54,735
What are you talking about? You're not going to say anything?

303
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:57,467
You're going to keep being called a thief?

304
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,008
You can't do that.

305
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,410
She's the one who did wrong.

306
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,664
Ro Bin, why should you get punished instead?

307
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,805
I'm okay being called a thief.

308
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:09,399
But she's not.

309
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:12,152
It's better that I just say I did it.

310
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:13,934
Ro Bin,

311
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,255
thank you so much.

312
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,677
And I'm sorry.

313
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,590
I won't do this again.

314
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,943
Ro Bin, but still...

315
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:27,307
Ro Bin has such a big heart. He is so cool.

316
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:28,948
Ro Bin,

317
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,701
that's so cool of you.

318
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,489
Teacher.

319
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:43,262
Teacher Maeng, what brings you here?

320
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:45,594
I'm on night duty today.

321
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:48,818
I was making my rounds and saw you guys come in here.

322
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:51,631
Sorry, I heard everything.

323
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,796
Ro Bin, that's cool of you.

324
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:59,428
But I don't like you talking about how you're already branded as a thief.

325
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:02,932
Ju Ri, what you did was very wrong. You know that, don't you?

326
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:06,056
- Yes.
- And you know you deserve punishment,

327
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:07,537
don't you?

328
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,660
Okay.

329
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,241
You deserve to be punished,

330
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:15,945
but telling the others isn't the only way.

331
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:19,109
Reflect on your actions, and make sure to return everything.

332
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,211
I'm sorry to the others.

333
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:24,533
I'll return the money to them and take my punishment.

334
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:25,826
All right then,

335
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,707
as long as you know what you did wrong.

336
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:29,759
I'll take care of this and make sure

337
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,722
you're both unharmed.

338
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:33,874
How are you going to do that?

339
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:36,166
Just leave it to me.

340
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,498
It's late, so you should all go home.

341
00:22:39,498 --> 00:22:41,370
Oh.

342
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,944
This is a secret between us, okay?

343
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,566
Ms. Maeng

344
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:18,086
looked so cool earlier.

345
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:21,610
What?

346
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:30,189
You scared me. Don't sneak around like that.

347
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,463
Why were you at the classroom earlier?

348
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:37,086
I just wanted to go.

349
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,702
You made it so that the culprit would come by, didn't you?

350
00:23:41,702 --> 00:23:44,695
Well, we did.

351
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:46,896
Even though it was no help.

352
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:49,428
Hey.

353
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:52,280
Thank...

354
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,043
Thank...

355
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:58,277
What? Are you thanking me?

356
00:23:58,277 --> 00:24:00,840
What was that? I can't hear you.

357
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,631
You're really thankful?

358
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:05,805
Don't worry. I know.

359
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:07,467
It's written all over your face.

360
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:11,210
Fine, thank you. Thanks, all right?

361
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,263
Your face is getting red.

362
00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:15,013
What are you talking about?

363
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,470
He has a cute side to him.

364
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:47,136
What is this?

365
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,947
I have one too.

366
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:54,253
What is this? Is this a surprise from Teacher Maeng?

367
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:59,309
Hey, are people from Office of Education coming today?

368
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:00,650
The bathrooms are spotless.

369
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,713
The boy's bathroom, too?

370
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:05,065
The girl's bathroom is completely clean.

371
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:07,427
Then who did it?

372
00:25:07,427 --> 00:25:09,839
This week's cleaning duty? You?

373
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:16,806
Attention, everyone. I have good news.

374
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,558
There's been a series of things that have gone missing at school.

375
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:22,893
So the police came to our school, and after their investigation,

376
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:25,796
they found Ju Ri's wallet among the stolen items.

377
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:29,368
Ju Ri, take a look and check if this is really yours.

378
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:32,682
Yes, this is mine.

379
00:25:32,682 --> 00:25:36,416
Then Ro Bin wasn't the culprit?

380
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:37,436
That's right.

381
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:40,650
The wallet thief wasn't someone from our class.

382
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,273
If there's someone who suspected him,

383
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:44,464
reflect on your actions,

384
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:46,696
and make sure you apologize.

385
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:48,598
I paid for the class shirts,

386
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:50,280
so you guys can take your money back.

387
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,032
I knew it.

388
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:53,864
I told you guys that there's no way it could be Ro Bin.

389
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:55,265
Then what was that money he had?

390
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:57,437
He earned that money from working.

391
00:25:57,437 --> 00:25:58,919
Have some faith in your classmates.

392
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,580
Sorry.

393
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,152
Today is the school ball game competition.

394
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:04,374
You can do well, right?

395
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:06,716
Yes!

396
00:26:06,716 --> 00:26:10,501
If you win, I'll treat you to something nice.

397
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:13,282
- Yes!
- All right!

398
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:16,225
Do your best.

399
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:18,147
- We will.
- We will.

400
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:29,369
- Sorry for doubting you.
- Sorry.

401
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:31,250
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

402
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,492
- Sorry.
- Sorry for misunderstanding.

403
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,626
I was going to eat this, but you can have it.

404
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:37,797
Don't even lie. You hate apples.

405
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,420
I'm sorry too.

406
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,310
Me too.

407
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:45,003
Sorry.

408
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:48,517
Take it.

409
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,575
Class One, let's cheer!

410
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:56,806
- Ready to cheer?
- Ready!

411
00:26:56,806 --> 00:26:57,977
May your

412
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:02,302
armpit sweat be plentiful, Class One!

413
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,020
- Class One!
- Class One!

414
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,272
Your revenge is complete.

415
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,525
- Class One!
- Class One!

416
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:25,626
But

417
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:28,478
was Teacher Maeng really at school because she was on night duty?

418
00:27:28,478 --> 00:27:30,519
- Class One!
- Class One!

419
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,957
Teacher, what brings you here?

420
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,169
I'm on night duty today.

421
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:44,334
I was making my rounds and saw you guys come in here.

422
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:48,116
Could Teacher Maeng be the Master?

423
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,803
- Class One!
- Class One!

424
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:56,637
No way. It can't be.

425
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:58,287
As if we're going to lunch!

426
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:01,190
Let's go! Do your best!

427
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:05,816
Ha Rok Hui!

428
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,317
- Ha Rok Hui!
-Ha Rok Hui!

429
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:09,949
- Ha Rok Hui!
- Ha Rok Hui!

430
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:17,456
- Baek Song Yi!
- Baek Song Yi!

431
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:19,159
- Class One!
- Baek Song Yi!

432
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,862
- Baek Song Yi!
- Baek Song Yi!!

433
00:28:21,862 --> 00:28:23,123
Baek Song Yi!

434
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:24,463
- Go!
- Go!

435
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:26,505
- Go!
- Go!

436
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:33,472
Let's win, Class Two!

437
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:36,336
Let's win, Class One!

438
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,023
- Class Two!
- Class Two!

439
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:58,438
Isn't Je Yi so good at this?

440
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:00,079
Ro Bin's better.

441
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,702
No way. Je Yi's better.

442
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:03,583
I don't think so. Ro Bin's better.

443
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,934
- Je Yi.
- Ro Bin.

444
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,366
Je Yi.

445
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,083
Who do I cheer for?

446
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,797
Ji Na, cheer for our class.

447
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:48,187
Right?

448
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:51,239
- Do your best, Seo Ro Bin!
-Go, Ro Bin!

449
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:17,557
- Seo Ro Bin!
- Seo Ro Bin!

450
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:20,200
- Seo Ro Bin!
- Seo Ro Bin!

451
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,683
- Seo Ro Bin!
- Seo Ro Bin!

452
00:30:23,683 --> 00:30:26,935
It's the first time I've seen Ro Bin smile so brightly like that.

453
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:38,969
[Epilogue]

454
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,492
It looked easy. Why is this so hard?
