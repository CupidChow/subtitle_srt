00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,632
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:02,632 --> 00:00:04,263
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:33,232
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,274
All right.

5
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:37,207
Let's have a toast for Ji Na and Ro Bin's long-distance relationship.

6
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:39,229
When I say "Love",

7
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,801
you say, Forever, okay?

8
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,593
Love.

9
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:46,236
- Forever.
- Forever.

10
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:50,430
Don't judge a guy by his looks. Look closely at his personality.

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,813
It's not good if a man is too handsome.

12
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:56,687
So is that why you married Gang Dong?

13
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:59,269
He ended up looking that way

14
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,732
because he went through a lot.

15
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:04,404
In the past, he was

16
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:06,256
the Jang Dong Geon of Hagok-dong.

17
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,324
Are you all right?

18
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:48,968
Are you all right? Were you startled?

19
00:01:56,707 --> 00:01:58,679
It's embarrassing that I said that.

20
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,730
I'll take it back.

21
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,521
He wasn't that handsome.

22
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:11,240
Even though Ji Na tried to look happy,

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,172
I could tell she was very sad.

24
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:17,296
Be good to Ji Na.

25
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,738
I will.

26
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,093
Why are you caring so much about someone else's girlfriend?

27
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,444
What do you mean?

28
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,676
Are you being petty and jealous right now?

29
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:28,398
No.

30
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,320
Actually, if I hadn't given her up,

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,082
you two wouldn't have been able to date.

32
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:35,284
After all, I'm better than you.

33
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,748
That's true.

34
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:40,069
You're a lot better than me.

35
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:45,406
What's going on?

36
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:46,877
Why are you suddenly like this?

37
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:49,078
I'm very thankful,

38
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,914
Hyeong.

39
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,081
What's with him? I'm cringing.

40
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:08,357
That's why you should be good to me.

41
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:09,650
I can't breathe. Let go of me.

42
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,471
I don't want to. Call me "hyeong".

43
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,833
I don't want to. Let go.

44
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,073
I don't want to. Say it.

45
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:16,286
- I don't want to.
- I'll let you go if you do.

46
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:18,408
- You're so heavy.
- Hurry up.

47
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,380
- This is really heavy.
- One more time.

48
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:28,667
Watch out!

49
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:49,398
Are you all right?

50
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:59,139
Aren't you Ji Na's little sister, Sa Na?

51
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,760
How did you know?

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,002
Ji Na showed me lots of pictures of you.

53
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,974
Are you her friend?

54
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:08,688
Yes. You're a lot cuter in real life.

55
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,733
I'm Rok Hui, Ha Rok Hui. Nice to meet you.

56
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,716
Ha Rok Hui.

57
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:18,638
What a great name.

58
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,640
I'll see you again next time.

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,270
Bye.

60
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,775
It's Ji Na's friend again this time.

61
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,117
Ji Na is always in the way of my love.

62
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:41,670
She can't interfere again. I'll never tell her this time.

63
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,736
Rok Hui, Ro Bin...

64
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:48,577
Maybe I have a thing for names starting with Ro.

65
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,676
Will you go on a diet or not?

66
00:04:56,676 --> 00:05:00,309
I will. I don't have any weight to lose though.

67
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:02,792
Rok Hui is so mischievous.

68
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:05,284
- It hurts.
- Will you go on a diet or not?

69
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,416
- Say, "Yes, I will, boss Rok Hui."
- I will.

70
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,718
Say, "Yes, I will, boss Rok Hui."

71
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:10,019
Yes, I will, boss Rok Hui.

72
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,522
- That's right.
- I'm cute though.

73
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:15,554
Stop with the nonsense.

74
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,328
We meet again.

75
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:20,910
Hi, Sa Na.

76
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,132
Yes. Hello.

77
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,919
Aren't you hungry?

78
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,111
I'm so hungry.

79
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,983
What should we eat?

80
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:38,358
Hello. We meet again.

81
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:41,579
I know, right? We keep bumping into each other.

82
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,713
I guess we're meant to be.

83
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:49,119
Take this, since we've met again.

84
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:51,121
Enjoy.

85
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:54,112
Okay. Thank you.

86
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,265
Awesome. Who is he?

87
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:57,517
Are you close to him?

88
00:05:57,517 --> 00:06:00,280
He's so cool.

89
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,413
Don't even think about it. He's mine.

90
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,466
Can't you tell by the way he gave me chocolate?

91
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:11,241
He is so cool.

92
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,720
This is

93
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,893
another place of remembrance for us.

94
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:25,444
That's right.

95
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:52,683
You can't come here and cry again when you miss me, okay?

96
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,534
I won't.

97
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,567
There's no one

98
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,958
who will put a hat on me now.

99
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,974
By the way,

100
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:05,596
you can text me,

101
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:08,098
but you can send me letters too.

102
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,640
It's more romantic.

103
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,662
Letters?

104
00:07:12,662 --> 00:07:15,024
I can't write well.

105
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:18,027
Can I call you every day instead?

106
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:19,298
Why?

107
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:22,922
You were good at writing that acrostic poem for the contest.

108
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:24,383
Oh.

109
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:26,385
That was short.

110
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,249
What did you write again?

111
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,111
You used the principal's name, right?

112
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:33,723
G.

113
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:37,758
"Go Jin Sang is..."

114
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:41,591
- J.
- "...just a tyrant."

115
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:45,223
- S.
- "Such a major tyrant."

116
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:49,478
Do one for my name too.

117
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:53,682
O.

118
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:00,138
Oh, I have something to tell you today.

119
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:03,002
J.

120
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,147
Ji Na.

121
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:11,600
N.

122
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,128
Nevertheless,

123
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:21,330
can you wait for me?

124
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,519
Oh, right.

125
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,650
I have something to give you.

126
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:35,976
What is it?

127
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:38,708
It's an early birthday present.

128
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,862
Your birthday is in December,

129
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:45,203
but I won't be able to see you then, so I'm giving it to you in advance.

130
00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:57,846
Don't lose it this time.

131
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,634
It's the same one as yours.

132
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:06,355
Yes, they're matching bracelets.

133
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:26,406
If blond-haired girls try to flirt with you in the States,

134
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:29,159
show this to them and say, "I have a girlfriend."

135
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,262
You need to reject them.

136
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:35,253
Okay, I'll do that.

137
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:39,969
Come back safely.

138
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,344
Okay. Take good care of yourself.

139
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:33,323
Ro Bin, are you doing well?

140
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:36,845
It's quite chilly here now.

141
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:41,400
What is it like over there?

142
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,523
How is the weather?

143
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:46,206
What color is the sky?

144
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:48,778
Do you still ride your bike?

145
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:50,810
I'm curious about everything.

146
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:57,456
I'm doing really well.

147
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,588
You're curious about the others, right?

148
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:02,021
Hello.

149
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:04,354
I'm your host, Bo Ra.

150
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:08,036
We're doing a mukbang show today, so we have a special guest.

151
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,732
Hello, I'm Na Na Ri, a freshman

152
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,182
of Hanjong High School.

153
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:16,345
Yes. Na Ri, what's your favorite food?

154
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,218
I believe that foods should not be

155
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:20,229
ranked or prejudiced against.

156
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:23,774
I love all the foods in this world.

157
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,126
So what will we be eating today?

158
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:27,628
It is

159
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:31,520
the Korean fast food loved by all high school girls.

160
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,323
Should we start eating?

161
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:35,995
No.

162
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,676
Try it.

163
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,781
You can't eat tteokbokki like that.

164
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:47,627
- This way...
- Bo Ra recently became a video streamer,

165
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:49,859
and she's been doing well.

166
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:52,822
Na Ri appeared as a special guest on her mukbang broadcast,

167
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:55,574
- and she was really funny.
- She is the goddess of mukbang.

168
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:58,679
If you're with a lot of people and there isn't enough tteokbokki,

169
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,829
use this method.

170
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:08,237
Mi Nam started dieting for the first time in his life.

171
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:11,180
He recently had a physical exam,

172
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,363
and his biological age turned out to be 47.

173
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:15,796
What's shocking is

174
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:18,998
that his father is 45 years old.

175
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:21,451
He was so shocked that he started exercising,

176
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,733
and his trainer is...

177
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:27,547
Ha Rok Hui.

178
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,479
Rok Hui is training him really hard.

179
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:33,443
An Mi Nam, do it right.

180
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:35,315
One, two, three.

181
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,016
Do it right!

182
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:39,528
- I'm dying of exhaustion.
- One, two, three!

183
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:41,771
One, two, three!

184
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,472
One,

185
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:46,206
two...

186
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:52,741
Do it right.

187
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:55,194
I can't do any more.

188
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:57,256
Get up.

189
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:59,138
Watch and learn.

190
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,900
Hurry and move.

191
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,358
One,

192
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:11,351
two,

193
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:13,203
three.

194
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,134
- By the way,
- I want to eat chicken.

195
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:36,827
- I haven't seen Su Ji
- I want to eat pizza too.

196
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,098
- since she transferred to another school.
- That sounds good.

197
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:42,433
But a few days ago, Bo Ra and Sin Ae ran into her on the street.

198
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,673
Isn't that Geum Su Ji?

199
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:49,789
It is her.

200
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,071
Gosh.

201
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,216
Hi, Su Ji.

202
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,198
Have you been doing well? It's been a while.

203
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,401
Don't talk to me. Go on your way.

204
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:04,623
Her face didn't look that great,

205
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:07,106
but her temper was exactly the same.

206
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:10,659
Doesn't she look a bit strange?

207
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:16,906
Also,

208
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:19,999
Our teacher Maeng has completely changed.

209
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,024
- Really?
- Can you believe it?

210
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:26,636
What about us?

211
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:28,579
What do we do? Should we go to a café?

212
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:29,689
- That's not a bad idea.
- Right?

213
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:30,861
- Shall we?
- Let's do that.

214
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:33,983
- Sounds good.
- Kim Su Geun and Park Su Ro.

215
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,837
- Teacher Maeng?
- Teacher Maeng?

216
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,284
You can't even recognize your own teacher?

217
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,147
Is that really you, Teacher Maeng?

218
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:51,771
I'll see you at school.

219
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,793
I'll get going. Take care.

220
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:58,628
Su Geun and Su Ro saw her on the street and almost fainted.

221
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:01,010
I feel like there's something

222
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,293
special about Teacher Maeng that we don't know about.

223
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,208
My mom and dad eat together

224
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,872
- on the weekends these days.
- It's spicy.

225
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:13,673
Try this.

226
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,895
The two are becoming more and more affectionate.

227
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:17,587
- They make us cringe.
- Isn't it good?

228
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:20,549
It's good. Have some too. Here.

229
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:26,906
You look handsome when you eat.

230
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:28,908
- Really?
- According to Sa Na,

231
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:31,811
they'll be getting back together soon.

232
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:34,403
I hope it happens soon.

233
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,587
- Hello, I'm Kim Yi Dong.
- You're here.

234
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:40,920
- Hi.
- I couldn't join them last week,

235
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,382
but my future uncle came too.

236
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:44,535
Oh my goodness. They went to the same elementary school,

237
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:47,426
reunited after 30 years, and are getting married now.

238
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:50,390
It must be fate.

239
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,992
I know.

240
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,974
I really think it's fate.

241
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:56,586
I can speak casually, right?

242
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:59,469
Of course, Hyeongnim. Please do that.

243
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,942
Seon Hui is like

244
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:06,225
a real sister to me.

245
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:08,278
If you hurt her,

246
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:11,931
I will ruin your face...

247
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,914
I won't let it go.

248
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:16,787
Yes, sir. I will make her happy.

249
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:18,608
Worry about yourself,

250
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,170
please.

251
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,991
All right.

252
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:28,137
Sa Na, what's wrong with you?

253
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:30,949
Do you have any questions for your uncle?

254
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:36,575
He's not my uncle yet.

255
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,711
Ajussi,

256
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,154
how much do you love my aunt?

257
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:46,566
Well...

258
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,218
I'm not sure.

259
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:51,670
I love her a lot.

260
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:59,228
When I was little,

261
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,282
I would cry

262
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:05,424
if my mom wasn't home, and my aunt

263
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,438
would carry me on her back until I fell asleep.

264
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,241
For athletic events at school,

265
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:14,364
my mom wasn't able to come because she was so busy.

266
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:18,337
So my aunt would come instead and get first place in running for me.

267
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,649
And...

268
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:22,552
she bought me a lot of pretty clothes,

269
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:25,654
so I could be confident when I was with my friends.

270
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,509
My aunt is

271
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:32,222
a really good person.

272
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:35,786
Please treat her well.

273
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:37,706
Sa Na...

274
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,831
I'll live close to you

275
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:43,903
even after I get married, okay?

276
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:45,905
Gosh, why are you crying?

277
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,277
My goodness.

278
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:50,469
I'm so glad to have a cute niece like you.

279
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,061
Sa Na, you're my niece now,

280
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,838
so this is the first allowance I'm giving you.

281
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:01,520
You don't need to.

282
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,942
It's all right. Take it.

283
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:05,735
Eat some delicious food with your friends.

284
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:07,697
Thank you, Uncle.

285
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:09,850
- You're the best, Uncle.
- Yes.

286
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,991
All right.

287
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:15,104
On a good day like this, we must have a drink.

288
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:17,908
- Right.
- We must check to see if you have

289
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:20,580
any bad habits when you're drunk.

290
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:23,283
Take a shot.

291
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,025
You should drink slowly.

292
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:32,511
All right. Bottoms up!

293
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,293
Bottoms up.

294
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:43,923
Seon Hui,

295
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,565
forget about that con man

296
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:49,138
and live happily.

297
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,861
You must hurry

298
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,763
and forget about guys like that.

299
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:56,857
Hyeongbu*, what are you...
(husband of one's elder sister)

300
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:59,277
What are you saying?

301
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,502
I'm talking about that guy.

302
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:05,795
You know, the jerk who fooled you.

303
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:08,087
He gave you a fake diamond ring

304
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:11,761
and was about to get married to some other woman.

305
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:14,775
I went there to teach him a lesson,

306
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:17,538
and the police came—

307
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,709
Gosh, please shut your mouth.

308
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:22,623
My dad got drunk and caused a bit of trouble.

309
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:23,673
Gang Dong!

310
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:26,977
But I think my future uncle loves my aunt a lot.

311
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:29,029
- He's a pathological liar.
- What?

312
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,670
When is Ji Na coming?

313
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:35,173
She's late again.

314
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,290
Hi.

315
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:47,026
Hello.

316
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:48,798
We meet again.

317
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:50,520
Yes. Hi.

318
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,962
Oppa Rok Hui,

319
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:54,464
you shine brighter than ever today.

320
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:57,887
Guys, Ji Na wants to meet us at the noraebang because she's running late.

321
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,758
We can leave now.

322
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:04,893
Rok Hui, fix your skirt.

323
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,508
Gosh.

324
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,536
Skirts are so uncomfortable.

325
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,932
Why is Oppa Rok Hui wearing

326
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:24,132
a skirt?

327
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:27,566
Is he...

328
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:30,229
No way...

329
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,251
Oppa.

330
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:44,393
Oppa?

331
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:46,827
Are you...

332
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:47,978
a girl?

333
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:50,750
Sa Na thought Rok Hui was a guy

334
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,672
and liked her for quite a while.

335
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:57,987
They said Sa Na almost fainted that day.

336
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:00,441
It's not true, right?

337
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:02,282
It's not...

338
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:04,244
There's no way.

339
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:07,648
Tell me it's not true.

340
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:12,010
After all, Rok Hui does look cooler than most guys.

341
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:16,986
Ro Bin,I've got to go. Bye.

342
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:20,260
are you doing well too?

343
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:25,374
I miss you...

344
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,056
a lot.

345
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:13,883
Hi, Robin.

346
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,294
Hi, Stephanie.

347
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,126
I saw you play basketball yesterday.

348
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:19,098
You played so well.

349
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:21,280
You were really cool.

350
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,603
Well, it wasn't my best.

351
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:26,285
Robin, if you're okay,

352
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:27,957
maybe this weekend

353
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:30,989
would you... want to go on a date with me?

354
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:35,886
I'm sorry. I have a girlfriend in Korea.

355
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:37,406
Look.

356
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:42,041
I gotta go. Bye.

357
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,131
I miss you,

358
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,045
Oh Ji Na.

359
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Searching

365
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:07,800
♫ On that day when you briefly passed me by ♫

366
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:09,848
I like Seo Je Yi

367
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,140
♫ I was just walking ♫

368
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:25,130
♫ silently after a long day passed ♫

369

♫ I mean the day I started to yarn for you ♫

376
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,856
(Behind the Scenes) 
What are you going to do

377
00:26:25,856 --> 00:26:28,799
if you stare at me like that. You little...

378
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,912
Actually we're really good friends.

379
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:33,673
What was that?

380
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:38,898
To the world, you are just one person.

381
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,339
(Robin continues to act)

382
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:43,593
But to someone, you could be the whole...

383
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:44,654
NG!

384
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:46,315
But to someone...

385
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:50,390
But to someone you could be the whole world.

386
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,022
(Back to serious mode)

387
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:56,296
To the world, you are just one person.

388
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:58,667
But to someone...

389
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:04,513
you could be the whole world.

390
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:08,498
Goodness.

391
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,651
(She forgot her line.)

392
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:11,891
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:13,463
Goodness.

394
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,847
- Let's try once more.
- What am I saying.

395
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:19,277
Wait, stop!

396
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:22,101
I caught it!

397
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:23,874
It's okay. Don't worry.

398
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:25,134
Wait for me.

399
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:26,946
( All the students go out to the hallway.)

400
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:28,769
Cut! That was good.

401
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:30,230
(Chic Ro Bin changes to mood-maker Samuel)

402
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,713
♪ I want you ♪

403
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:35,304
♪ Why won't you answer me? ♪

404
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:37,016
Let's try that one more time.

405
00:27:37,016 --> 00:27:39,097
(Hit with a blooper and hit with reality.)

406
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,484
If she changed in a bathroom without a CCTV...

407
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:47,266
- Let's try that again. It's CCTV.
- CCTV. Okay.

408
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,198
- Okay.
- Cue.

409
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,006
Sorry.

410
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:59,188
- It's CCTV, right?
- Yes.

411
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:02,052
When you're ready...

412
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:03,723
If there weren't a CETV...

413
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,655
I'm sorry.

414
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,051
- Don't laugh.
- Let's try again.

415
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:14,482
Okay, start.

416
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:28,979
- Wait.
- Stop laughing.

417
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:30,090
Your ice cream is melting.

418
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,231
(He has to eat her ice cream.)

419
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,023
You really need to eat it.

420
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:34,524
(Made a mistake because he was too shy.)

421
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:39,640
- Great!
- Cut! It was good.

422
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,104
(Yi Deun is scared because he is being bullied.)

423
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:47,436
- I'm going to kill you.
- Cut. That was good.

424
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:50,500
(He changes completely and acts cute to Ji Man.)

425
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,272
Stop laughing. Let's start.

426
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:55,424
Stand by.

427
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,736
Cue.

428
00:28:56,736 --> 00:29:00,010
(Ro Bin gets into character and acts chic.)

429
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,781
(But it doesn't last long.)

430
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,584
(I have to hold it in.)

431
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:09,419
(His lips start to quiver.)

432
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:13,803
- Cut. Let's try that again.
- No, wait...

433
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:17,005
It's because Ro Bin keeps smiling.

434
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,669
Ji Na.

435
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:24,664
You look pretty.

436
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:27,848
Let me try this again. I'm so sorry.

437
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:30,140
(Ro Bin has to drink juice with a bug in it for Ji Na.)

438
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,193
(Gulp, Gulp)

439
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:35,696
(No matter how much he drinks, the juice is still there.)

440
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:39,088
(He messed up the scene.)

441
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:40,790
(Coughing)

442
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,332
(Mom and dad are acting while wearing a historical drama costume.)

443

(They have to jump off a cliff.)

444
00:29:58,347 --> 00:29:59,949
(Another side of Rok Hui.)

445
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:02,161
Come on. You are going overboard.

446
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:06,946
(They build teamwork by doing the wave.)

447
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:09,098
(Mi Nam finishes it off by doing a wave dance.)

448
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,801
Start slowly as if you are walking. Like this.

449
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:14,233
You're doing great.

450
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:16,947
Cut. Okay.

451
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:18,678
(Rok Hui's dad Jo Jae Yoon & Choi Ki Seop from physical comedy group The Ongals)

452
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:20,340
That was good.

453
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,554
Seriously, this is so annoying!

454
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:30,791
Okay, cut!

455
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,252
If I look too ugly, let me try again.

456
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:33,573
(No, you are pretty, Bong Sun.)

457
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:35,875
What's going on?

458
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,777
Goodness.

459
00:30:37,777 --> 00:30:39,448
(Deok Su played a stalker tutor.)

460
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:42,012
No, wait. Not yet.

461
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:44,383
That picture is so not fair.

462
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:46,116
They're saying it's ramyeon.

463
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:48,748
(Ongals' Jun Woo and Ha Bak seem like real broadcasters.)

464
00:30:48,748 --> 00:30:50,971
How did you know that?

465
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:52,782
Let me see.

466
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:54,103
(An Sang Tae has become a shaman.)

467
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,396
Let me see.

468
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,297
Mister.

469
00:30:58,297 --> 00:31:00,681
- It's too much.
- Is it too much?

470
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:02,072
You look possessed.

471
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,294
I overdid it, didn't I?

472
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,482
(It seems like French.)

473
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:14,404
(But it doesn't seem like French.)

474
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:20,640
(Hyun Woo Sung plays the character Sa Gi Jun perfectly.)

475

(Mina from AOA made a special appearance.)

476
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:38,497
How old are you?

477
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,450
(Shy)

478
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,823
Why can't you look her in the eye?

479
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:45,786
(Mi Nam is a fan of Mina from AOA.)

480
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:47,768
(Today is the last day of filming.)

481
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:52,170
- Is there anything you want to say?
- Good work everyone!
