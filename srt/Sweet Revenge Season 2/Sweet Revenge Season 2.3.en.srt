00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,000
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Our beautiful school gives, shares and cares

3
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:32,953
~ Revenge Note 2 ~

4
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,700
Why won't it open?

5
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,400
Maybe it doesn't work all the time.

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,900
And what is a Master?

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, no! I'm late!

8
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
What? You didn't leave yet?

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,600
I went to bed late last night. Why didn't you wake me up?

10
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,800
What? Don't you know our family is all about surviving individually?

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
- Whatever. I'm off, goodbye.
- All right.

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,400
Give me some water.

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,700
Aunt, I'm late. Sorry.

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,900
I can't believe she just left. Aigoo!

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,900
Come over here.

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,700
I heard you went on a blind date. Did it go well?

17
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,300
It wasn't that good. It was too short.

18
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,100
Too short? You mean his height?

19
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,100
It was from here to here.

20
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,200
I can't stand guys who have short forearms.

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,500
They're the worst.

22
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,600
Are you running out of brain cells?

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
I should beat some sense into you.

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
- I need something to hit you with.
- Calm down.

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,400
- I need to hit you.
- Don't do that.

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,600
To Hagok-dong, Yeongdeungpo, Shinchon Station

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,800
That's right.

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,500
I haven't shaved in a while either.

29
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,300
I'm nervous.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Ouch, my hair!

31
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,800
Oh, no!

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm so sorry.

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,900
What are you doing?

34
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
What?

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Aren't you that weirdo from last time?

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Excuse me. Here, catch.

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,500
You are that weirdo!

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,800
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

39
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,300
Are you out of your mind?

40
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you nuts?

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,600
I'm so sorry. It was an accident.

42
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm really sorry. I apologize.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,500
Jo Eun Yeon

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Gosh. What's wrong with her?

45
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
She's a freshman at our school, right?

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Do you remember her face?

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
My head hurts.

48
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,400
The next time I see her, she's dead meat!

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,800
I almost ruined my day from the start.

50
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Wait! Please wait!

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,400
Please wait!

52
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,900
What are you doing?

53
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,500
Thanks.

54
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,200
Thank you for helping me last time, too.

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
Last time?

56
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,400
For getting me out.

57
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,800
You're out.

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,300
I only did that because the game was getting boring.

59
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,600
Anyway, thank you.

60
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you want some?

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,400
I'll have the orange one.

62
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Great. Orange is my favorite, too.

63
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
Here.

64
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,500
Wait for me!

65
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,000
- Check this out.
- She's too cute, right?

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
I know.

67
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,000
- It's brown.
- Why isn't she coming?

68
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,200
That's what I'm saying.

69
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
Kang Daniel

70
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,000
Kang Daniel is calling me.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,500
Really? Who are you to get a call from him?

72
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, Mom?

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Right, I got it. Talk to you later.

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,800
Did your mother change her name?

75
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
G-Dragon

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,400
Call

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Hi, G-Dragon. What's going on?

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
I'm G-Dragon?

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
What about me? What did you save me as?

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
An Mi Nam

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Can you just stop calling me?

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,600
Come on!

83
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Save me as "Mina's* Husband."
(*Shim Mina, South Korean singer and dancer).

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
♪ I'm Mina's husband ♪

85
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Please?

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,100
Then I'll take "Seolhyun's* Husband."
(Kim Seol Hyun, singer, member of the girl group AOA)

87
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,824
What's that sigh for?

88
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:28,316
Is something going on?

89
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:31,069
I think I made another mistake.

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,500
Ouch, my hair!

91
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,500
I think her name is Jo Eun Yeon.

92
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,200
She seemed like a seonbae* at our school. Do you know her?
(*older/senior student)

93
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,100
Of course. Everyone knows her.

94
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,042
Why do you ask?

95
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:46,395
She looked really scary.

96
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
- Is she that famous?
- She is.

97
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,000
She's the meanest fighter in the Gangseo area.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,800
She even gave a senior a double nosebleed with one blow.

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,400
Now, people don't mess with her, thinking she's crazy.

100
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:01,630
You didn't bother her, did you?

101
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,923
Should I transfer to another school?

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,200
Hey, it's Geum Su Ji.

103
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
- Hi.
- Why is she back already?

104
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,800
It must be nice to be rich.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,300
- I wish I had that much money, too.
- Gosh.

106
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,400
- That's impressive.
- It is.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,200
Su Ji, you must have had a hard time. Are you all right?

108
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,700
I'm fine.

109
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,000
Thanks to someone.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I went to Japan and had some sushi.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
I had a nice break for a few days.

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,000
It was so boring here without you.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Let's have a welcome back party later.

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Let's go to a buffet. My treat.

115
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,900
Really?

116
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Awesome!

117
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,200
- That sounds yummy.
- Right?

118
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
Can you get out of the way?

119
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Trash.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,400
What?

121
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
I need to empty the trash bins.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm in charge of it this week.

123
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,200
I'll help you. Let's do it together.

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,500
Oh Ji Na is butting in again.

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,600
Ha Rok Hui annoys me, too.

126
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
I can do it on my own.

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
I'll help you. It takes longer on your own.

128
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
That's why the other kids think you're a pushover.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,400
What?

130
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
You should have some discretion even if you're nosy.

131
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,700
It's how I am, so I can't fix it really.

132
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,600
Let's hurry.

133
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
Are you late again today?

134
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Mind your own business.

135
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,600
I set an alarm for you. Didn't you hear it?

136
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,800
This is

137
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,400
the best seat in the restaurant.

138
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Then, on your left will be the French teacher. On your right, will be the Math teacher.

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,900
And the head teacher will be at the end.

140
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,400
It's a perfect arrangement.

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,700
Mr. Choi.

142
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,100
You're so talented when it comes to things like this.

143
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
Good job.

144
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,900
Thank you, Principal. I'll make the arrangements then.

145
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,600
Attention, please.

146
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,500
Attention!

147
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,400
Today, our wonderful principal has announced

148
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,600
a faculty get-together in the evening for teamwork.

149
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
Here is the seating arrangement for the dinner.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
Please take note and sit accordingly.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,700
What's this now?

152
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,300
It's so sudden!

153
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,200
I had plans this evening.

154
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
I can't just skip, right?

155
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,700
Don't you know our principal?

156
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,400
You could miss a class,

157
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,400
but missing a faculty dinner is asking for a year of hell.

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,800
Honey, I'm going to be late today.

159
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,400
Why?

160
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,800
We have a last-minute faculty dinner tonight.

161
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Who is this dinner for?

162
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
What party tricks should I prepare?

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,092
If you cannot attend tonight's dinner hosted by our respected principal,

164
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:04,574
due to unavoidable circumstances,

165
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:06,896
please raise your hand.

166
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,729
No one, I see.

167
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:22,420
Then let's have a great time this evening.

168
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,255
I'll take that to mean voluntary attendance by everyone.

169
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:31,009
He's so annoying.

170
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:40,600
He's handsome.

171
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,175
Ajumma!*
(form of address for a married woman over 35, also used for housekeepers, cleaners and eatery owners)

172
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:48,977
Ajumma!

173
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,413
Ajumma!

174
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,867
Who are you asking for?

175
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,259
Can I get a refill on my coffee?

176
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:06,306
Refills cost an extra 1,000 won (about 90¢).

177
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,096
And...

178
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:11,319
I'm not an ajumma.

179
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,173
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,466
Is that really something

181
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,008
you need to spill water over?

182
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:20,679
Come on.

183
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,582
Sinu Real Estate

184
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,534
Hello.

185
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:27,596
Thank you, ajumoni*.
(polite form of "ajumma")

186
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,110
The café is nearby, though.

187
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,933
You could have just come to the café.

188
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:35,453
I'm really busy with work.

189
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:39,720
No, you're not. Your café is deserted.

190
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:44,974
Don't worry about her.

191
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:48,217
Let me show you this other property.

192
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:49,558
Aish!

193
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,310
How can they treat me like that?

194
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,573
I'm so annoyed!

195
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:55,075
Good morning.

196
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,307
It's afternoon, not morning!

197
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:59,479
Good afternoon, then.

198
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,632
Excuse me.

199
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,487
- Do I really look like an ajumma?
- What?

200
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,809
What are you talking about?

201
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:13,993
You look like you'd get your ID checked when you buy alcohol.

202
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:16,305
That's a total lie.

203
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:18,968
Well, can I ask

204
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:21,120
who that creepy-looking man at your sister's office is?

205
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,421
I don't know.

206
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,904
I heard he's a rich guy from the neighborhood.

207
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:29,377
But I can't tell if he's interested in my eonni* or the building.
(*older sister, said by a woman)

208
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:37,447
Gosh.

209
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:39,588
Look at him.

210
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:43,452
That playboy face. Look at that smile.

211
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:45,605
Darn it.

212
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,429
What? Why does he need to shake her hand?

213
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:51,681
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

214
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:55,715
He can just sign the document. A handshake is not necessary!

215
00:12:55,715 --> 00:12:58,246
- Could you please wait a moment?
- Sure.

216
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:00,679
Ridiculous!

217
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,191
Wait!

218
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:04,412
Hey!

219
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,378
Fine, I won't look. I don't want to look anyway!

220
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:10,669
Hey! You little...

221
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,773
Darn it.

222
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,926
♪ From my head, ppum ppum ♪

223
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:21,199
♪ To my toes, ppum ppum ppum ppum ♪

224
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,744
You're better than Momoland!

225
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:25,815
You have talent!

226
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,099
I think you could become a celebrity.

227
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,370
Why don't you audition?

228
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,542
I think you'd be photogenic too.

229
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,295
I did use that to my advantage in the past.

230
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,837
I used to be a child fashion model.

231
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:39,179
Really?

232
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,240
You've got the looks for it.

233
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,005
If only my dad hadn't disapproved.

234
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,707
I wish I'd just continued modeling.

235
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:51,039
Why did he disapprove? What does your dad do?

236
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,922
What?

237
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:55,113
He's...

238
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:57,917
Silicon Valley's High-Tech Business Info Session

239
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,909
He works in Silicon Valley.

240
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,141
Silicon Valley?

241
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,093
You mean that place in America?

242
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,224
I see.

243
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:07,087
Oh.

244
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:08,977
Hey, it's on the poster there.

245
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:12,792
"An IT hub of high-tech businesses for geniuses."

246
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,433
That's amazing.

247
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,525
Your dad works there?

248
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:19,388
Yes, he's into software programming.

249
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:20,921
That's amazing.

250
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,172
When did he go?

251
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:23,923
That's so cool!

252
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:26,565
About five years ago.

253
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,759
Let's watch another one. Let's go.

254
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,982
It looks like the entire faculty is here. I'll take attendance.

255
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:34,414
Ms. Jeong Jeong Ah?

256
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,235
- Yes.
- French teacher to the left. Here.

257
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:37,646
Please sit here.

258
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:42,550
Everyone else can take your seats according to the arrangements.

259
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,300
-Ta-da!
- Oh my.

260
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,923
Now let's listen to our respected principal's toast.

261
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:54,944
Well,

262
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:58,327
today's get-together was

263
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,063
organized abruptly,

264
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:05,314
but the entire faculty

265
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:09,219
voluntarily attended.

266
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:12,622
I thank you all for that.

267
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,797
What does a king say when he doesn't want to go home?

268
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,026
- The palace can wait.
- "The palace can wait."

269
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,747
That's hilarious.

270
00:15:28,747 --> 00:15:30,739
I see.

271
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,682
Our Teacher Maeng.

272
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,296
It's nice to see you teaching so passionately at your alma mater.

273
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:39,839
When you were a student here,

274
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,260
Mr. Lee must have been there too.

275
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,122
Of course, I taught her.

276
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:44,793
I see.

277
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:47,997
Then back then, was Teacher Maeng as sluggish

278
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:50,760
as she is now?

279
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,833
She was a bit slower than average,

280
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,596
but she did so well in her studies.

281
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:59,099
All the teachers adored her and called her a genius.

282
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:01,001
If it wasn't for that incident,

283
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,363
she might be working for NASA in the States now.

284
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,276
Don't you think?

285
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,329
French teacher.

286
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:11,270
- Yes?
- Would you sing a song for us?

287
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,551
Me?

288
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,173
I'm not very good.

289
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,967
♪ Didn't you know that you were my love? ♪

290
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:20,530
- ♪ Did you really not know? ♪
- Let's all dance!

291
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,323
♪ Do you know that you are my happiness? ♪

292
00:16:23,323 --> 00:16:26,145
- ♪ Do you understand now? ♪
- Get up.

293
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:27,398
I really can't dance.

294
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:30,209
- Just let go and dance.
- ♪ I met you ♪

295
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,253

296
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,606
- Oh, my.
- Oh, no!

297
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:37,950
Principal, are you all right?

298
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,613
It's done.

299
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,556
Let's see.

300
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,491
What is that?

301
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:54,824
This?

302
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:57,336
These help you get double eyelids just by wearing them.

303
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:58,859
They're called double-eyelid glasses.

304
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,430
That's amazing.

305
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,032
Let me try them too.

306
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:05,374
- Take the glasses off.
- Okay.

307
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:07,036
These are amazing.

308
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:09,099
My eyelids have been droopy lately.

309
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,790
Let me wear them for a while.

310
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,852
Give them back.

311
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:14,965
Your lids are droopy already. They're beyond repair, anyway.

312
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,617
You're too ugly for these glasses to make a difference.

313
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:18,969
I'm the prettiest in my class!

314
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,011
We basically have the same DNA. How can that be true?

315
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:24,343
Isn't your nose a bigger issue than your eyes?

316
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,995
I told you not to talk about my nose.

317
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:28,438
What are you doing about your cheeks?

318
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:31,080
I told you not to talk about my cheeks!

319
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,002
I just remembered.

320
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:36,767
It's our turn to clean the common entrance today.

321
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,747
That's right.

322
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:41,410
You can keep working. I'll do it, Mom.

323
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,362
Thank you, my daughter.

324
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,445
- Hello.
- Hello.

325
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:47,627
- I have other things to do.
- I have homework.

326
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:50,649
- I'll get to work now.
- Gosh.

327
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,264
Now, let's begin.

328
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,408
- It suits you.
- Well...

329
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:22,141
I wish I had put on different pants.

330
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:24,575
I'll help you. What should I do?

331
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,468
We just need to sweep

332
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:30,559
and mop the floor.

333
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,730
Hey. Did you just laugh at me?

334
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,883
He just laughed at me, didn't he?

335
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,815
Just ignore him.

336
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,837
Let's focus on cleaning.

337
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,121
But... Where is he going at this hour?

338
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,773
He works part-time at a hamburger shop.

339
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,397
Should we start?

340
00:18:58,397 --> 00:19:00,200
Sure.

341
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,319
Fix the lighting here.

342
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,581
Yes, sir.

343
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:02,623
Hold on.

344
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:04,875
I haven't seen him before.

345
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:07,838
I hired him a few days ago.

346
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:09,468
He's not a bad worker.

347
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,802
Isn't he a high schooler? He looks young.

348
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,516
The patrols are really strict lately. Are you sure about his age?

349
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:18,768
Of course, I'm not new at this.

350
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,730
Ro Bin.

351
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,021
Yes.

352
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:26,776
Can you show me your ID?

353
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:34,574
Resident Registration Card, Seo Ro Bin

354
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:40,039
Can you work into the early mornings?

355
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,831
I'll pay you for overtime.

356
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:43,163
Yes, I can.

357
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:45,956
Get going.

358
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:49,209
You can never be too cautious.

359
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,671
Yes, sir.

360
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,066
Get away from me!

361
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:09,569
Why? What is it?

362
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,481
There are bugs over there.

363
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:14,154
There are so many of them.

364
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:15,785
I really hate bugs.

365
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:20,870
This is scary to you?

366
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:24,043
- How is this scary?
- Hey, get it away from me.

367
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,796
So you do have a lame side to you.

368
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:29,088
Bugs are the worst.

369
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:45,855
Ji Na, I'm so sorry.

370
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:47,938
[I'm sorry.]

371
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:59,158
What's this? A 2,000,000 won (≈ $1,800) loan?

372
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,370
I keep getting spam messages.

373
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:03,412
You can block them.

374
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:05,035
Give me your phone.

375
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,341
I installed an ad filter.

376
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:14,634
So you won't be getting them anymore. Here.

377
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,388
You're good at this kind of stuff too, aren't you?

378
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:25,726
Are you good with computers as well?

379
00:22:25,806 --> 00:22:26,856
Well,

380
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:30,109
I like to play with computers.

381
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:32,312
I see. Do you play games?

382
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:34,314
Sure, I play games.

383
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:36,026
I also like coding.

384
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:38,238
Coding?

385
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,199
What's that?

386
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:42,242
It's how you create a program.

387
00:22:42,823 --> 00:22:43,953
It's pretty interesting.

388
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,828
So that's your hobby. I see.

389
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,584
Do you make apps too?

390
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:54,714
Yes,

391
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,797
I've made a few for fun.

392
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:00,761
Is he the Master?

393
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:03,893
Now that I think of it,

394
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:06,185
Revenge Note showed up the day after he moved here.

395
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:09,398
Why are there so many bugs?

396
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:10,771
I hate them.

397
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:13,814
Maybe not.

398
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:22,783
Ji Na.

399
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:28,619
Bo Ra!

400
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:34,003
- Make a V.
- V!

401
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:47,057
Seo Ro Bin.

402
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:50,730
Is Seo Ro Bin late again?

403
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:52,481
That's worrying.

404
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:55,105
I have to penalize him if he keeps being tardy.

405
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:59,860
All right. Have a good day, everyone!

406
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:01,572
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:05,405
Finally.

408
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:08,328
What's this?

409
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:09,580
Isn't this yours?

410
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,750
It stings.

411
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:12,162
It's awesome.

412
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,793
No, it isn't.

413
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,256
It's...

414
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,218
It's mine.

415
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,234
Be quiet.

416
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:38,528
- No, she lied!
- Really?

417
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:40,239
Are you sure?

418
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:54,333
Did you see that?

419
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:55,755
It's awesome.

420
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:57,086
The other day, I thought

421
00:24:57,336 --> 00:24:59,129
I saw a girl in the boy's restroom.

422
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:00,510
Red lipstick...

423
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,633
Did you fight with Sin Ae?

424
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:04,214
Why are you so cold to her?

425
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:06,176
It's not that.

426
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:16,566
He's late every day.

427
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:18,598
He walks in as if he's done nothing wrong.

428
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:21,501
I heard a rumor that he got forcibly transferred.

429
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:24,104
- It might be true.
- It's true. I heard.

430
00:25:24,104 --> 00:25:25,114
Really?

431
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:27,136
Good morning, Ro Bin.

432
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:34,633
The more I look at him, he's my type.

433
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,685
How do I attract him?

434
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:40,460
The spread of coffee

435
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:44,104
Behind every social phenomenon

436
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:46,596
is a historical background and context

437
00:25:46,596 --> 00:25:48,258
that brought it to its form today.

438
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:50,460
Everyone knows about coffee.

439
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,933
He has some nerve to be sleeping in Mr. Lee's class.

440
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:55,626
I know, right? It's making me anxious.

441
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:58,268
During the sixth century, coffee was grown in the Ethiopian highlands.

442
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:01,270
Then later it spread to the Arabian Peninsula...

443
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:07,297
Wake up Seo Ro Bin.

444
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:11,281
Hey, get up.

445
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:15,484
Seo Ro Bin, take out your textbook.

446
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:17,666
Don't you have a book?

447
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,839
I didn't bring my book.

448
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,603
You little...

449
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:28,577
If you're going to act like this, quit interfering with class and get out.

450
00:26:32,212 --> 00:26:34,664
- He's actually walking out.
- What?

451
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:37,767
Attention, everyone! Attention.

452
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:41,080
If you don't want to pay attention, you can walk out too.

453
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:55,364
Where is Ro Bin?

454
00:26:57,037 --> 00:26:58,527
Je Yi!

455
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,694
The teacher asked me to bring the class's homework with you.

456
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:08,088
Ah... sure.

457
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:13,723
Ji Na, I'll help you—

458
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:16,346
Je Yi, we need to do this now.

459
00:27:22,603 --> 00:27:25,303
It's fine. I can do it myself.

460
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,549
What is this? A fire?

461
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:41,920
Fire.

462
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,784
It's a fire!

463
00:27:46,336 --> 00:27:48,128
Where? Where is it?

464
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:50,068
Over here.

465
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:56,575
Darn it.

466
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:06,144
You little brats. Are you out of your minds?

467
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,636
Follow me.

468
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:11,250
Follow me!

469
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,424
Mr. Lee!

470
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,966
It hurts!

471
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:19,939
Oh Ji Na.

472
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,261
You're done for.

473
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,313
I told you to follow me!

474
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,471
Hey, Oh Ji Na, come out!

475
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:35,315
Oh Ji Na, you better show up when we say it nicely.

476
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:37,737
Oh Ji Na, get over here!

477
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,621
Where is Oh Ji Na's seat?

478
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,000
Here.

479
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:46,446
Oh Ji Na, I'll make you pay.

480
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,924
Stop right there!

481
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:59,798
Hey! You sneaky little wench.

482
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:01,701
Come here!

483
00:29:04,504 --> 00:29:06,226
When I catch you, you're dead meat!

484
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:07,768
Why is she so fast?

485
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:10,179
Just wait until I get my hands on you!

486
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:13,101
Darn it.

487
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:15,695
Hey, Oh Ji Na!

488
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:18,618
- Stop right there!
- Hey!

489
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:21,881
Stop!

490
00:29:22,643 --> 00:29:25,654
I told you to stop! Hey!

491
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,671
- Are you a pervert?
- Quiet.

492
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:56,135
Oh Ji Na, I'm not letting you go today.

493
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:57,957
Get out of there.

494
00:29:57,957 --> 00:30:01,100
The longer you make me wait, the angrier I'm gonna get.

495
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,582
Just come out!

496
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:05,394
Where has she disappeared to this time?

497
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:11,410
This is a men's restroom.

498
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:18,207
Isn't there a girl in there?

499
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,540
Why would a girl come in here?

500
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,989
Let's just go.

501
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:39,459
Thanks.

You really dug your own grave, didn't you?

507
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:33,252
Lock the door.

508

Ji Na.

516
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:32,101

It's okay. Come out.

521
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:49,578
