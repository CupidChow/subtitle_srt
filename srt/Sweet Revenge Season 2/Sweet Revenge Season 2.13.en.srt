Sinwu Real Estate

5
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:39,799
- Ms. Kim Eun Hui? A flower delivery for you.
- Yes?

6
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,022
Yes, I'm Kim Eun Hui.

7
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:43,753
Are you sure this is for me?

8
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:47,737
Yes, it's addressed to 907-1 at Sinwu Real Estate.

9
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:50,169
Your name is Ms. Kim Eun Hui, right?

10
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:52,611
Yes, it is.

11
00:00:57,217 --> 00:00:58,967
Have a good day.

12
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,573
What's that?

13
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:05,244
Who sent her those?

14
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:07,377
Who could have sent these?

15
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:13,602
What's the occasion? Why the flower arrangement?

16
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:20,770
I didn't even want to know anyway!

17
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,380
Who could have sent these?

18
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:37,806
Five minus three equals two. Two plus two equals four.

19
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,678
Do you know what this means?

20
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:41,722
"If you take three steps back from a misunderstanding,

21
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:43,102
you come to understand each other.

22
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:47,235
And understanding becomes love."

23
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:49,629
Sincerely, The one who wants to get to know you more,

24
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,321
Mr. Park.

25
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,162
Mr. Park?

26
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:56,586
This is so lame.

27
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:59,739
Who still uses these pick-up lines?

28
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:08,207
Who could have sent those to her?

Job Shadowing

00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:22,070
These are your future dream job surveys,

33
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:26,274
but they're a mess.

34
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:29,239
Kim Su Geun wants to be a member of the National Assembly.

35
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,261
"Because it looks like they just hang out all day."

36
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:33,943
You little—

37
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,986
Next, we have Oh Ji Na.

38
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:39,999
Why did you write so much?

39
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:41,922
"Teacher, Nurse, Social Worker,

40
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:44,883
Policewoman, Chef, Psychologist."

41
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,356
- You're going to do all of those?
- Well,

42
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:50,710
I want to do a job that helps people, but I haven't decided on what job I want.

43
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,292
You're full of dreams, aren't you, Ji Na?

44
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:54,764
Yes.

45
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:58,647
But before helping others, shouldn't you be helping your own grades?

46
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:01,190
He wasn't even kidding.

47
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,933
That's so true. Gosh.

48
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,995
Next, we have Geum Su Ji's dream job.

49
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,228
-  "Paris Hilton?" 
- Yes.

50
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:12,061
Just like Paris Hilton, I want to inherit lots of money, make my own businesses,

51
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:14,344
and buy lots of brand-name stuff.

52
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:15,865
- That's so silly.
- I know, right?

53
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:17,927
My goodness. Your father must

54
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:20,629
really hate having to work hard just for your silly dreams.

55
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,052
Gosh.

56
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:26,164
Next, Na Na Ri.  "A pretty nuna who buys dinner for her boyfriend." 
(reference to successful drama Pretty Nuna who Buys me Food)

57
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,269
Next, An Mi Nam.

58
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,691
"The winner of High School Rapper Three?"

59
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:35,044
Yes. I want to become a rapper, the most popular profession these days.

60
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:38,027
I want to do a collaboration with AOA!

Let me show how to really rap.

69
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:58,888

76
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,162
That was too much.

77
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,513
Yeah ...

78
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:17,916
Sit up straight.

79
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,782
Seo Ro Bin.

80
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:25,223
Why didn't you write anything?

81
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,836
I don't have a dream.

82
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:28,447
You little—

83
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:31,149
You should be dreaming big at your age!

84
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,294
You're kidding me. Submit a new one to me by next class.

85
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,677
Next, Ha Ji Man.

86
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:40,049
This one's a good one, as expected of the class president.

87
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,760
Tell the class yourself.

88
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:45,705
I wrote that I want to be a civil worker.

89
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:47,747
I want to get into Hankuk University's Economics major,

90
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:51,050
and become the youngest one to pass the Civil Service Exam in my first year.

91
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,553
I want to become a rank-five civil worker and help out our nation.

92
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:58,708
- Good job.
- You saw that, right?

93
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,661
You need to make a solid plan for your dreams, like the class president.

94
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:07,245
This time, you will be asked to visit your parents at work.

95
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,458
We're going to make groups of six.

96
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,891
Then you will submit reports. Understand?

97
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,333
Yes.

98
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,503
That's all.

99
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:16,676
- Who did that?
- I don't know.

100
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:20,369
- What?
- My goodness.

101
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:22,481
Hey, guys.

102
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:25,133
Resident Card, Born in 1999

103
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,436
- Isn't this awesome?
- What is this?

104
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:30,039
"Year 1999?"

105
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,511
How did you get this?

106
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:36,895
Be nice to me. I can get you beer, soju, and whisky.

107
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:39,509
My gosh!

108
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,991
This totally looks like the real thing!

109
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,032
But how did you make this?

110
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:46,254
This? The seniors made this for me.

111
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:47,347
Guys,

112
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,978
I really respect those seniors.

113
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:53,081
You know you have to pay when you're drinking?

114
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:56,715
But they actually get money instead of paying.

115
00:05:56,715 --> 00:05:59,948
- They drink and get money?
- No way.

116
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:01,550
How?

117
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:06,185
After they drink, they make a deal.

118
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:08,368
They tell the owners they're underage,

119
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,650
and make them pay settlement money so they don't get fined and shut down.

120
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,844
And all the owners give them money.

121
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:16,205
- Isn't that awesome?
- I totally respect them now.

122
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:19,108
We should have taken something like that when we went to the club.

123
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:20,901
- I didn't do it.
- She took mine.

124
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:24,122
- What?
- She has a lot of those.

125
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:31,161
Finals are coming up. You guys are studying hard, right?

126
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:32,663
- No.
- No.

127
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,495
- It's so difficult.
- Not at all.

128
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,005
I don't want to.

129
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:40,199
Those who want to free study at night, submit your forms.

130
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,553
When did you write that?

131
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,614
Do you want me to join you? You'll feel bored.

132
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,216
Really? That'd be great.

133
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:50,850
Thank you. Thank you.

134
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,873
I want to, but I have way too many after-school academy classes.

135
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,886
I guess it can't be helped. Let's go.

136
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,618
Hey, Seo Ro Bin.

137
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,210
We're getting graded as a group, so you better cooperate.

138
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,233
Do whatever you want to. I'll just follow.

139
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:08,148
- But where should we go?
- Should we go visit my mom?

140
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:09,679
What does your mom do?

141
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,641
- She's a housewife.
- I don't want to watch her wash dishes.

142
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,435
Why not? Being a housewife is a completely respectable job.

143
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,067
My family runs a restaurant, so it'll be pretty boring.

144
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,000
Ro Bin, what do your parents do?

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,122
They're doctors.

146
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:27,555
But they went abroad to do volunteer work.

147
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:29,879
- That's surprising.
- What about you, Sin Ae?

148
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,253
Both of my parents work as office workers, so they'll be too busy for us.

149
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,965
My mom does real estate.

150
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:40,780
And meeting my dad isn't really possible.

151
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,782
My parents got divorced.

152
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:46,666
Good for them.

153
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,429
Divorce is much better than my parents who fight like crazy.

154
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:56,020
Rok Hui, how about we visit your dad?

155
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,981
- Could you all handle it?
- Why?

156
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,702
What does your dad do?

157
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:06,675
You'll see. Make sure to wear sports clothes when you come.

158
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,620
Then it's been decided, right?

159
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:28,458
Gosh.

160
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:32,401
That guy irritates me, but he shows up so often.

161
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:37,777
Could it be him who sent that flower arrangement in the morning?

162
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,839
Hello, Mr. Park.

163
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,933
- I was in the neighborhood and stopped by.
- I see.

164
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:51,200
I hope you enjoyed the present that I sent you.

165
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,183
Yes, they're beautiful.

166
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,795
You didn't have to send these.

167
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:59,168
Just doing business together is enough.

168
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:00,980
It's just a little something from from my heart.

169
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:05,655
Oh, my. Mr. Park, you're so romantic.

170
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:08,566
Are you here to see more places?

171
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,493
I heard there's a new building at the intersection.

172
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,866
Mr. Park, you're always up to date.

173
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:19,628
Yes, it's a four-story building. Would you like to go see it?

174
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,673
It's time for you to get off work, right? Shall we go together?

175
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:33,692
What's this?

176
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:37,070
Are those two going somewhere together?

177
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:41,041
So the owner isn't there?

178
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:45,263
I'll call back later then. Thank you.

179
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:47,536
I'm so sorry, Mr. Park.

180
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:52,110
I don't think we can go see the building at the intersection.

181
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,745
Well then, I guess we can just have dinner since we're already out.

182
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,976
I know a good sushi place.

183
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,478
You like sushi, right?

184
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:02,742
Actually, my kids have finals coming up.

185
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:04,094
I should go home early tonight.

186
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,797
- Kids all study on their own anyway.
- Yes?

187
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:08,768
- Let's go eat dinner.
- No, it's all right...

188
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,570
- I should eat dinner with my kids.
- Come on.

189
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,622
- No, no, it's fine.
- Hey!

190
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:13,573
Cut it out already.

191
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:17,627
She said she doesn't want to go. What's with this guy?

192
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:19,529
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

193
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:20,850
I'm—

194
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,213
He owns the convenience store across the street.

195
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:26,154
I think he misunderstood the situation.

196
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:28,207
Are you crazy?

197
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,912
Mr. Park, I'm so sorry. Please, go ahead.

198
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:36,355
- I will contact you in a few days.
- All right.

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,403
Get home safely.

200
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,839
Who do you think you are?

201
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,009
Look.

202
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,952
You said you didn't want to go. Why was he dragging you into his car?

203
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,253
What a creep!

204
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,376
Do you know how important of a customer he is to me?

205
00:10:57,376 --> 00:11:00,840
Whether I get in a car or a train, just butt out of my business.

206
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,161
My goodness!

207
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,963
Wait ...

208
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,966
Oh, gosh.

209
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:09,509
Misunderstood?

210
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,112
A thank you would be nice for helping you out of a bad situation.

211
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:15,844
What's with her attitude? I can't believe this ...

212
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:25,834
That man signed a contract for two buildings just this month.

213
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,307
It looks like he's really into Eonni.

214
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:31,150
He must be a rich widower.

215
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,413
I want to just push her to meet him so she can snag him.

216
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:36,210
Darn it.

217
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:43,502
Don't regret your actions once the opportunity is gone.

218
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,054
Just do better from the start.

219
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:53,153
My goodness!

220
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,367
That little ...

221
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:05,184
Hello, my daughters.

222
00:12:07,156 --> 00:12:09,347
Are they sleeping already?

223
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,010
Why are they sleeping so early?

224
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:26,590
She's just like her dad, sleeping with her arms up like that.

225
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:51,780
- One pack of cigarettes, please.
- May I see your ID?

226
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,284
I lost my ID card a few days ago.

227
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:57,526
- I'm an office worker.
- I see.

228
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,138
An office worker?

229
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:05,444
- So what school do you go to?
- Hanjong High School.

230
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,620
Get out.

231
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:12,160
Two bottles of soju and two packs of cigarettes, please.

232
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,184
- I guess you came out of the Marines.
- Yes.

233
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:17,626
May I see your ID?

234
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,098
Ajeossi ...

235
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,141
I told you I came out of the Marines.

236
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:23,462
- It's on my shirt.
- I see.

237
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:28,967
Sorry, but you need to show your ID when you're buying alcohol and cigarettes.

238
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:32,491
I was discharged last year. I'm a real man.

242
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,832

00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:45,584

- It does.

246
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:56,195
- I'm getting this too, okay?
- Okay.

247
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:01,140
- How much is it?
- May I see both of your IDs?

248
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,721
Our IDs?

249
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:05,614
We must be a young-looking couple.

Born in 2000?

What do you mean, born in 2000? The machine must be broken.

263
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:52,251
What's going on? You're a high school student?

264
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:55,694
I knew something was fishy.

265
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,088
Don't contact me again. How annoying.

Gosh.

What?

268
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:09,368
What's going on today? There are so many rude customers today.

269
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,580
I can't believe it.

270
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,490
Aish, I did all of this for nothing.

Is he crazy?

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,563
He makes a marine do some silly clapping gig?

274
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:26,105
So what now? You broke up with your girlfriend?

275
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,036
That's crazy.

276
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:31,340
Wait a minute. Does that mean we can't meet those college girls anymore?

Darn it!

278
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:36,635
I can't believe that guy.

279
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,888

Rok Hui, we're here!

Welcome.

286
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,861
This is your dad's workplace?

287
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:34,763
It is. He owns this gym.

288
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:38,989
- That's so cool.
- So that's why Rok Hui's so cool!

289
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:41,300
Follow me. I'll show you all around.

290
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,712
Okay.

291
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:49,850
This is a punching ball. You use it to practice dodging.

292
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,091
Gosh.

293
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,303

Me? Sure.

But why are there so many movie posters around the gym?

00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,274
The thing is ...

307
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,006
Rok Hui's dad is a fan of this movie.

308

Even Rok Hui's name came from the movie title, Rookie.

No way. There's no way her dad was lazy with her name like that.

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,972
Go. One, two!

327
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:45,635
That's right.

328
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:48,098
I'm not making that noise with my mouth.

329
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:50,428
It's the wind in my fists!

330
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,344
I'm pretty sure he's making that noise with his mouth.

331
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,005
I know, right?

332
00:18:57,277 --> 00:19:00,320
Very nice. You're doing great, Mi Nam.

333
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,280
That's it.

334
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,703
Don't dance. That's it.

335
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:13,902
Do you want to try it?

336
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:16,686
Hong Cheol.

337
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:18,167
Yes.

338
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:22,120
All right. Let's see some jabs.

339
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,010
Jab. One, two!

340
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,627
Relax a little. One, two!

341
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:30,309
Put your guard up and jab. One, two!

342
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:37,507
Boy, do you have any thoughts of becoming a professional?

343
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:40,919
- What?
- You have natural athletic skills,

344
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,793
and you're pretty good-looking.

345
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:46,495
You remind me of myself when I was younger.

346
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,948
What?

347
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:53,803
All right. Get in position!

348
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:55,716
Get your fists ready!

349
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,817
One, two!

350
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,069
One!

351
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,950
You see this, right?

352
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,543
You're not doing lots of jumps.

353
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:06,676
Instead, tread lightly. Do it as if you're walking or jogging.

354
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:09,108
Do it as if you're walking slowly.

355
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,500
This is how you do it. Good job.

356
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,523
Come on.

357
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:35,345
Aunt Seon Hui,

358
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:39,308
I thought you said you had to diet. Now, you're eating stuff like this?

359
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:42,331
- I don't have to anymore.
- Why not?

360
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,393
Did you break up with your boyfriend?

361
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:48,328
You got dumped, didn't you?

362
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,601
Did he dump you because you're old? Or is it because of your fat arms?

363
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:54,714
Did he want to break up because you have a weird personality?

364
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:57,296
I know. It must be because you're always drunk.

365
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:59,089
I'm right, aren't I?

366
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,170
You hit it right on the dot.

367
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,002
Now I'm going to hit you on the dot!

368
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:05,485
There you go again.

369
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:08,057
You just exchanged a few texts and now you're all gloomy.

370
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:09,990
Move on and go on a blind date.

371
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,131
No way, Eonni.

372
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:14,813
This one was different.

373
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:17,336
Love will always come back.

374
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,278
You're too far gone in your fantasy.

375
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,952
Right. Punch a little bit more. Good.

376
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:23,193
One, two!

377
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:24,794
One, two! Jab!

378
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:26,466
Good job!

379
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:28,809
Very good. Next.

380
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:31,300
One, two! Stronger! One, two! Jab!

381
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,514
One, two! One more time. Good job!

382
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:36,585
Move swiftly! That's how you do it!

383
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:39,169
What is this belly? What is this?

384
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,509
Try again. Out!

385
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:41,461
Next!

386
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,533
Come on! One, two!

387
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,175
Concentrate harder!

388
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:48,607
Very good. One, two! Hold it firmly!

389
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,371
One, two! Very good! You're doing great!

390
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:57,210
I'm so thirsty.

391
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,569
Hey.

392
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,282
Why didn't you warn us that we would be doing this?

393
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:05,935
We're here to do our homework, right?

394
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:09,258
That's why I asked if you could handle it.

395
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,900
He's totally meant for this.

396
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,855
Maybe the rumors of him getting into fights back then are true.

397
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:31,160
All right.

398
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:37,127
Do your homework well.

399
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,608
I hope you all come back to exercise.

400
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,991
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

401
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:44,173
Rok Hui!

402
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:46,075
Take a break from working out today.

403
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,588
Treat your friends to something yummy.

404
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:50,209
Here you go.

405
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:57,147
That's right.

406
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,462
There you are.

407
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:06,910
What are you doing here?

408
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,829
Ta-da. Look at this.

409
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:13,552
We went to Rok Hui's dad's gym to shadow him at work.

410
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:15,994
- Cool, right?
- Awesome.

411
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,836
It was fun,

412
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:21,300
but he made us exercise and throw punches. It was so tiring.

413
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,680
We need to do that assignment as well.

414
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,997
I don't know why we have to do stuff like shadowing our dads at work.

415
00:23:27,997 --> 00:23:31,260
Why not? Just ask your dad.

416
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,983
I'm sure he'll let you do it.

417
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:36,125
No way. Don't even talk about Dad.

418
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,838
- That's so annoying.
- Hey.

419
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:41,592
Why do you hate your dad so much? He adored you so much.

420
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:45,373
I hate him! I said stop talking about him!

421
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:47,137
You little—

422
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:51,510
I collected so many coins.

423
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:56,095
This is probably over 30,000 won (≈ $27).

424
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:58,348
- What are you going to do with this money?
- Quiet.

425
00:23:58,348 --> 00:24:01,621
I'm going to buy Dad something yummy.

426
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:05,015
Dad's so busy that he can't come home sometimes.

427
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:06,185
Poor thing.

428
00:24:06,185 --> 00:24:08,758
Sa Na, you're so kind.

429
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:47,035
I told you not to invest in such a dangerous venture.

430
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:50,650
You're going to steal your own daughter's savings?

431
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,924
Dad, don't go. Don't leave.

432
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:57,446
Dad!

433
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:01,931
Dad! Don't go!

434
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:10,809
Dad, don't leave!

435
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,484
He said he would come back, but he never did even once.

436
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:18,156
- I don't even want to call him my dad.
- Dad!

437
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,301
Hello.

438
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:34,003
- Not yet.
- Ah, all right.

439
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:38,118
Here you are.

440
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:40,739
Oh, wait a minute.

441
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,716
Oh.

442
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,810
Yes.

443
00:25:53,913 --> 00:25:55,304
Please ring me up.

444
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,467
Here we go.

445
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:02,411
With the 20 won shopping bags, that'll be 83,540 won (≈ $75).

446
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:04,795
- You're charging for shopping bags?
- Of course.

447
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:06,836
It's 20 won per bag (≈ $0.18).

448
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:10,350
Why not just give it for free. It used to be free before.

449
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,883
It's been a long time since the law changed.

450
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:16,470
And if I give it out for free, I could get reported.

451
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:19,348
I can't believe you charge for bags.

452
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:21,260
Never mind then.

453
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,182
What? Wait!

454
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,034
Miss—

455
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:28,290
Aish!

456
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,663
I think we took enough pictures.

457
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:35,784
What should we write for our thoughts?

458
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:38,458
I can't do anything.

459
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,180
I can't even lift my arm.

460
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,783
Gosh, that's why you need to exercise regularly.

461
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:48,068
Then, to be fair, how about we write half a page each and put it all together?

462
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:51,500
That's a good idea. Let's start right away.

463
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:57,475
Here's your coffee.

464
00:26:57,475 --> 00:26:59,279
Enjoy.

465
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:03,604
We've been waiting for our order.

466
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:05,785
Yes, I'll be right there.

467
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:15,795
Shall I help out?

468
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:18,999
What? You know how to do stuff like this?

469
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:23,270
Yes, I've done a lot of part-time jobs. I know how to do this kind of work.

470
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:29,258
Two iced Americanos, please.

471
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:31,561
That will be 7,000 won  (≈ $6.30).

472
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:36,786
Thank you.

473
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:39,680
That'd be so helpful. Then help me out for a bit.

474
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,522
I'll pay you for your work later.

475
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:55,534
Look.

476
00:27:57,407 --> 00:28:00,010
Here are your two Americanos.

477
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:03,732
Oh, my. Seo Ro Bin.

478
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:06,215
I can't believe it.

479
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,050
Oh, my. He's so handsome.

480
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,690
Let's come here all the time.

481
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,973
Let's come here again.

482
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:18,920
The customers are loving this. Maybe I'll put him on the staff.

483
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:25,310
May I see all of your IDs?

484
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:29,460
Thank you.

485
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:37,316
All of your IDs are valid.

486
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:38,879
Just a moment.

487
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,709
That will be 8,000 won (≈ $7.20).

488
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:44,020
- We can drink it at the tables, right?
- Sure.

489
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:52,352
I thought you were just good at boxing, but you're good at serving, too.

490
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,733
I know, right? That was great.

491
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,868
There is something that Ro Bin can't do. He sucks at studying.

492
00:28:58,868 --> 00:29:01,071
You talk as if you're good at studying.

493
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,991
Why you—

494
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:07,277
Thanks for helping my aunt.

495
00:29:07,277 --> 00:29:09,758
I did your part of the homework for you.

496
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:11,912
It's perfect. It's a win-win situation!

497
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:14,874
I have to go to my part-time job. I'll get going.

498
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:24,750
What kind of part-time job is he doing?

499
00:29:25,134 --> 00:29:27,066
I need to go to the cram school.

500
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:30,319
You guys go ahead. I'll be helping out my aunt for a bit.

501
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,992
- Bye.
- Thank you for the snacks.

502
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:33,983
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

503
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:35,745
See you later.

504
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,539
Your store has gotten so much busier.

505
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:43,723
- Should I work part-time?
- No way. I don't need you.

506
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:46,766
Bring your friend, Ro Bin. He's perfect for the job.

507
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:48,477
Whatever.

508
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:15,865
Ji Na, go on before it gets too late.

509
00:30:15,865 --> 00:30:17,817
I'll clean up and head out later.

510
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,460
All right. Come home soon, Aunt.

511
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,694
Aigoo. This is so unfair!

512
00:30:24,694 --> 00:30:26,976
You can't be selling alcohol to minors.

513
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:29,618
Sir, please investigate this.

514
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,594
You punk! That ID earlier was a fake, wasn't it?

515
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:35,856
Where is it? Hand it over.

516
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:37,336
What do you think you're doing?

517
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,688
- You're the one who sold the alcohol.
- What did you say?

518
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,490
What did you say, you punk?!

519
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,423
- What are you doing?
- Get over here!

520
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:45,534
- Let go!
- How dare you?

521
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:48,097
- He has it. Just look for his ID.
- Come on!

522
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,479
You're the one who did wrong here.

523
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,923
- Look for his ID!
- Calm down, Sir.

524
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:54,525
- What's wrong with you, you punk?
- What?

525
00:30:54,525 --> 00:30:56,476
- Get over here!
- Calm down!

526
00:30:56,476 --> 00:30:58,667
- What's going on?
- Look through his pockets!

527
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:00,499
- It's got to be in there!
- Stop it!

528
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:02,642
You just have to search his pockets for it!

529
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:04,475
- If you search him, you'll find it!
- Come on!

530
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:06,766
- Does he want to get beaten up?
- It must be a fake ID!

531
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,239
- You can find it in his pockets!
- Calm down!

532
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,751
What do you mean they're minors?

533
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,753
- Dad!
- These rotten kids ...

534
00:31:12,753 --> 00:31:15,524
- What's with that guy?
- It's ...

535
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:40,660
[Epilogue]
Three Months Before

536
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,482
Hey!

537
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:56,665
Why are you over there?

538
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,789
I work over there starting today.

539
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:02,481
A guy I know introduced me to one of his friends.

540
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:05,060
So I'm a store manager now.

541
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:09,199
I went to the Middle East and even rode boats.

542
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:11,680
I worked hard all these years

543
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,753
to pay off all of my debts.

544
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:15,105
Now,

545
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:19,999
I want to live close by you and my kids.

546
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,890
I can't believe you.

547
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,304
You disappeared while they were growing up.

548
00:32:24,304 --> 00:32:26,195
Now, you suddenly want to show up?

549
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,678
I didn't contact you

550
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:31,260
because I wanted to make sure you didn't get hurt.

551
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,974
Now that I'm close by,

552
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:37,037
- you'll be all right.
- Forget it.

553
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:40,910
We're doing just fine without you. So don't act like you know us!

554
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:43,573
I can't believe this.
