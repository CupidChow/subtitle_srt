Get up, Uncle.

Come on.

9
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,498
Get up.

10
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:42,672
Leave me alone.

11
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,845
Kang Seon-a.

12
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,266
I never wanted much in life.

13
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,486
All I wanted was to be free. That was it.

14
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,820
But the things I wanted to be free from

15
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,229
were thrown at me like chores.

16
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,566
THE GLASSES

17
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,540
When did they...

18
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:00,536
That's unexpected.

19
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,544
Hey. Come here.

20
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,029
- Why?
- Just get over here.

21
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,884
Lower your head a bit.

22
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,367
Why?

23
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,128
What's going on?

24
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,771
When did you meet your wife again?

25
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,260
In college.

26
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:32,624
What about before?
Didn't you have any girlfriends?

27
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:34,902
- Of course I did.
- How many?

28
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,672
One.

29
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,841
We are so different.

30
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,112
That's not anything new.

31
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,926
Why the new glasses?

32
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:52,394
Are you trying to see the world
from a suspect's point of view?

33
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,460
They don't suit you at all.

34
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:55,947
Don't I know it.

35
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:03,972
Can I help you?

36
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,892
Bangju High School?

37
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,451
Yes.

38
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,132
Follow me.

39
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,368
- Get over here.
- What the heck?

40
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:23,620
What gives detectives
the right to do this?

41
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,332
Get a warrant.

42
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:28,226
Warrant, my ass.

43
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:29,921
I'm not arresting you.

44
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,545
I just want you to visit a friend.

45
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:33,754
I need to check something.

46
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:36,548
What friend?

47
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:37,962
And check what?

48
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,041
Come and see for yourself.

49
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,672
Stand here for a minute.

50
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,028
Damn it.

51
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:07,683
Am I free to go now?

52
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:09,662
Wait.

53
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,373
Do you know if Seon-a had any boyfriends?

54
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:21,547
Boyfriends?

55
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:24,048
Kang Seon-a?

56
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,419
I don't know about boyfriends,

57
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:28,457
but I know she has someone she hates.

58
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:31,432
Maybe it was you.

59
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,235
Stop fooling around.

60
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:38,692
You know what she always says.

61
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:41,600
"I'm going to kill
that son of a bitch one day."

62
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:45,795
I think she hates that person
even more than Kim Hye-yeong.

63
00:05:50,336 --> 00:05:52,302
Isn't it Hyeon-heup's birthday next week?

64
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:53,696
What day is it?

65
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,858
November 1st.

66
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:57,176
Let's have a party!

67
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,152
I don't want to.

68
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,423
How come?

69
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:06,613
I've never had one before.

70
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:09,742
Sorry, but you don't have a choice.

71
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:25,755
Want to meet up before the party,

72
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,746
just the two of us?

73
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,880
UNKNOWN NUMBER

74
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:44,421
NOVEMBER 1ST.
YOU ARE INVITED TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

75
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:58,340
NOVEMBER 1ST.
YOU ARE INVITED TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

76
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:00,824
How's this color? I just bought it.

77
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:02,283
- It looks awful.
- What?

78
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:03,868
- Wipe it off.
- No way.

79
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,714
- You should.
- Look, Ji-na's here.

80
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,422
Hey.

81
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:13,125
No practice today?

82
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,731
What brought you to school?

83
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:17,003
Nothing.

84
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:20,527
Why are you so quiet today?

85
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:22,221
Don't know.

86
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,284
- What's with her?
- Weird.

87
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:34,773
Ji-uk.

88
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,895
I think there's a sexual assault case
against a minor.

89
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,271
Su-min can handle that.

90
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,741
I think it'd be good
if you gave her a hand.

91
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,281
Who's the victim?

92
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,161
A week ago...

93
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:55,867
I went to this boy's house
and we drank together.

94
00:07:56,473 --> 00:08:00,885
We used to be K-pop idol trainees together
so we were close.

95
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,033
We were drinking...

96
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:10,361
and I blacked out for a while.

97
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:12,012
When I woke up...

98
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,287
I noticed my underwear

99
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,600
was on back to front.

100
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:24,536
What about the boy?

101
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:28,714
He had sent me a text
that he was going out.

102
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:36,162
Had you had sexual intercourse
before the incident?

103
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:40,073
No.

104
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:42,734
Why is she lying?

105
00:08:42,758 --> 00:08:44,486
What do you mean?

106
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,445
Huh?

107
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,619
Nothing.

108
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:50,176
Let's go see the boy in question tomorrow.

109
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,899
- Quick.
- We have to hurry.

110
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:03,462
Kids these days...

111
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,722
Even I wasn't like that in high school.

112
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:08,534
What are you mumbling about?

113
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,173
I said I'm fed up visiting schools.

114
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:14,175
I graduated years ago.

115
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,593
I know.

116
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:18,350
There seem to be a lot of
school-related cases recently.

117
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,771
Detective.

118
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:22,541
Hello.

119
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,989
- Hello.
- Hello.

120
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,456
A virgin?

121
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,164
No sex before marriage?

122
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:37,592
Nice meeting you again.

123
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:40,701
Except...

124
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,936
You being here can't mean good news.

125
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:49,768
How's Seon-a doing?

126
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:53,301
She's still in the hospital.

127
00:09:56,314 --> 00:10:00,390
I wanted to visit her with the students.
Would that be okay?

128
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:03,417
It's a little early for that.

129
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:05,846
I see.

130
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:12,908
You're wearing new glasses.

131
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:16,267
They look good on you.

132
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,920
Yeah, right.

133
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,106
Your ears are red.

134
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:27,092
Do you know Seo Han-yu in class 7, year 2?

135
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,483
Han-yu? Yes.

136
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,031
Seo Han-yu.

137
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,213
How do you know Yoon Ji-na?

138
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:42,916
She's just...

139
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,618
a girl I know.

140
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:48,158
We used to be trainees together.

141
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:50,218
On the evening of September 20,

142
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:53,195
did you drink together at your place?

143
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,627
- Yes.
- Where were your parents?

144
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:56,753
They're abroad.

145
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:58,754
I came to Korea to become a singer

146
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:00,113
and now I'm living by myself.

147
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,361
Do you think it's okay
for you high school kids to drink?

148
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,640
You seem pretty cocky.

149
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,861
Sorry, Detective.

150
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,673
I was stressed out from schoolwork.

151
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:31,244
You're here as a suspect
in a sexual assault case.

152
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,826
Are you aware of that?

153
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:38,531
Is that what Ji-na said?

154
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,700
I never slept with her.

155
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,188
I don't want to.

156
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,416
Kids these days are really something.

157
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,262
With such innocent faces, too.

158
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:51,917
We'll get something once we start digging.

159
00:12:08,956 --> 00:12:10,539
Are you done staring at me?

160
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,020
I was going to tell you first.

161
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:15,386
Give them here.

162
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:20,484
They're evidence from a case.
I can't just give them to you.

163
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:23,485
And it's okay for you
to wear the evidence?

164
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,321
I need to test them out.

165
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,982
Isn't that for the KCSI to do?

166
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,075
Yes. You're correct.

167
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,121
As soon as I put these glasses on,

168
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:41,940
I realized you were telling the truth
and got goosebumps all over.

169
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:43,584
It's a relief, isn't it?

170
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:46,711
I trust you, and you trust me.

171
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:48,212
I don't trust you.

172
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:49,547
Get rid of the glasses now.

173
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,249
Calm down.

174
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:56,661
Detective, haven't you learned anything
from Seon-a's case?

175
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:58,915
And remember my neighbor?

176
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:03,827
You said you found the glasses
at a crime scene.

177
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:05,627
Don't you get it?

178
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,728
Every case is related to them.

179
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:09,979
Wearing them is dangerous.

180
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:12,448
You're pretty convincing.

181
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:15,900
All the more reason
for me to try these on.

182
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:18,735
- And how could they be dangerous...
- I'm not saying the glasses are.

183
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:21,112
You don't know
how they're going to change you.

184
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,767
What's going on here?

185
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:25,606
Is something wrong?

186
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,193
Nothing's wrong.
She lives in my neighborhood.

187
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,708
Hyeon-heup's a special kid.

188
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:51,985
Would you like to have dinner
with me sometime?

189
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:53,935
Sorry?

190
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,145
I'll call you.

191
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:31,271
Hello. You're here nice and early.

192
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,830
Please, take a seat.

193
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,993
Yoon Ji-na.

194
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,356
I discovered her myself.

195
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:42,466
But she didn't try very hard.

196
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,510
So I told her to quit
if she didn't have her heart in it.

197
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:50,569
I'm not the type to force people
into doing something they don't want to.

198
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:55,370
What was Ji-na like?

199
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,275
I'm embarrassed to say this,

200
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:05,650
but she wasn't that talented.

201
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:09,462
She should have tried harder
to make up for that.

202
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,279
But she didn't push herself.

203
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:14,031
On top of that, she liked
hanging out with her friends too much.

204
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:16,658
She'd always talk the other trainees
into drinking with her

205
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,696
or meet boys.

206
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,249
It's no surprise she didn't make it.

207
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:26,513
We shouldn't rule out the possibility
that it's a false accusation.

208
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:29,815
Don't make any assumptions yet.

209
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:33,972
My head hurts.
I hate these kinds of cases.

210
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:35,997
What do you mean?

211
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:37,748
The "he said, she said" type.

212
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:41,385
Plus, they're both minors,

213
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,722
and the case is sensitive in nature,
so we can't really interrogate them.

214
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,746
We need something like

215
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,639
a foolproof lie detector.

216
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,222
Strange.

217
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,920
- What is?
- It doesn't make sense.

218
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:06,549
What are you talking about?

219
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,830
It's nothing.

220
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:14,228
By the way,

221
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,579
do you have a crush on
Seon-a's homeroom teacher?

222
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:17,753
What?

223
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,134
Where the heck is this coming from?

224
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,464
Never mind if not.

225
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,286
She was annoying.

226
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:39,282
Always calling me up, wanting to see me.

227
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:41,828
I'm going to be a senior soon

228
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:44,859
and not even a trainee anymore.

229
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,473
Can I see your text messages?

230
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:49,986
Go ahead.

231
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,068
JI-NA: I'M EXHAUSTED. CAN I COME OVER?

232
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:00,404
RIGHT NOW?
JI-NA: YES. ARE YOU BUSY?

233
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:02,780
JUST A LITTLE...?

234
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,032
JI-NA: I WON'T STAY LONG.
I'M SO DEPRESSED.

235
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,367
ARE YOU COMING RIGHT NOW? FOR A DRINK?
JI-NA: YES!

236
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:09,070
You deleted your texts,

237
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,037
washed the clothes

238
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:14,130
and the bloodstained underwear
you were wearing that day,

239
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:18,064
and filed charges
only after a whole week passed.

240
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,008
Did it cross your mind

241
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:24,077
that these circumstances
wouldn't play out in your favor?

242
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,507
I already told you.

243
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:29,926
I didn't want to believe
what happened was true.

244
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,252
You might be charged
with false accusation.

245
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:34,568
Detective.

246
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:38,097
It was me who washed Ji-na's clothes.

247
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,909
It's not Ji-na's fault.

248
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:54,849
DONG-SIK: NOTHING MUCH TO GO ON HERE.
I'M SENDING HAN-YU HOME NOW.

249
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:57,712
Please excuse me.

250
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:50,778
Yoon Ji-na.

251
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,170
I'm asking you for the last time.

252
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,812
Were you coerced into...

253
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,281
I mean...

254
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:06,168
Did anything actually happen
between you and Seo Han-yu?

255
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,036
Don't transfer this case
to the Prosecutors' Office.

256
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:18,469
What?

257
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:26,662
"Hey, Sunglasses."

258
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:37,057
Not calling me that today?

259
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,678
When did I ever?

260
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:19,139
This is for you.

261
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:24,195
It's not exactly a gift, but still.

262
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,709
I read your case file.

263
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,934
What happened to your parents
is not your fault.

264
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,945
In case that's what you were thinking.

265
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:36,715
So that's what she looked like.

266
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:40,682
She looks different from what I remember.

267
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:46,926
Do you want to find her?

268
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:50,925
Seon-a said

269
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:56,602
if she were alive,
she'd have come to see me.

270
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,956
Like you said, these glasses

271
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:08,319
may be dangerous,

272
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,377
but I'm positive
they can help someone out.

273
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:15,083
Just like you saved
that woman in apartment 204.

274
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:22,112
Who is it that you're saving now?

275
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:28,314
Do you know Yoon Ji-na?
She's in your class.

276
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:31,076
Yes.

277
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:34,115
She reported someone for sexual assault.

278
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,513
The case has been dismissed.

279
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,590
I used these.

280
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,385
There was no S line between the two.

281
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:45,915
Yoon Ji-na said she had
no sexual experience,

282
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:48,207
but she had four S lines.

283
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,966
I knew you wouldn't make it
as a K-pop idol.

284
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,759
- Serves you right.
- Serves you right.

285
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:54,127
Yoon Ji-na

286
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,578
could be telling the truth.

287
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,616
Just a week ago,
she didn't have any S lines.

288
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,485
Hello?

289
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:10,404
Have you transferred the Yoon Ji-na case?

290
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:11,572
No, I'm working on it.

291
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,616
- Wait till I get there.
- Why?

292
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,271
We're going back to square one.

293
00:22:33,204 --> 00:22:36,466
This doesn't feel quite right.

294
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:42,996
Seo Han-yu.

295
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,736
It's the police. Are you home?

296
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,800
Seo Han-yu.

297
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:07,202
- You...
- Hello, Detective.

298
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:12,762
Can we come in?

299
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,704
Sure, go ahead.

300
00:23:38,902 --> 00:23:41,253
You keep a tidy home.

301
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:43,800
Yes.

302
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:47,278
I'm a bit of a clean freak.

303
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,366
Did you drink

304
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:55,339
over here that night?

305
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:59,823
We started there, but she blacked out,

306
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:02,264
so I put her on the bed.

307
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:08,292
Okay.

308
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:10,861
Are the bottles you drank from still here?

309
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,705
No. I don't keep things like that.

310
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:24,769
Detectives.

311
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,492
I have an early morning tomorrow.

312
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:32,917
Can I get some sleep?

313
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:39,810
CLOSED

314
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:55,002
MISEONG MOTEL

315
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:20,951
I went back to the scene just in case

316
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:23,421
and found the glasses in the bathtub.

317
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,686
What if someone intended

318
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:31,657
for you to take the glasses?

319
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:33,882
Impossible.

320
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:35,655
How could they have known I'd be back?

321
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:39,718
You can't expect things to make sense.

322
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,208
Like the fact that I see S lines

323
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,492
or those glasses.

324
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:50,170
I know someone put the glasses
at the crime scene on purpose.

325
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,868
Who could it be?

326
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:43,486
- How did you...
- I just...

327
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:45,629
I saw you while I was passing by.

328
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:49,394
I wondered what was up and followed you,

329
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:51,730
but you disappeared around here.

330
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:53,837
You weren't taking my calls.

331
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,731
What brought you back here?

332
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:08,184
I left something during my shift.

333
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:12,485
Aren't you scared? It's creepy here.

334
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,343
Remember?

335
00:27:22,193 --> 00:27:25,048
I told you I could see weird things.

336
00:27:25,072 --> 00:27:26,223
Yes.

337
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:29,767
There's something

338
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:31,934
above your head...

339
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:35,316
Stop.

340
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,431
If I were to get

341
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:07,208
an S line,

342
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,085
I think it'd be okay if I saw things...

343
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:16,027
What?

344
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:19,743
...as long as I'm with you.

345
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:38,915
Starting the day with grueling work.
What a morning.

346
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:49,495
This looks okay.

347
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,090
Found it.

348
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:19,316
Okay. Thank you.

349
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,028
How long is the forensics going to take?

350
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:26,376
A day at the shortest.

351
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:31,999
How did you get the idea
of looking for the bedsheets?

352
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:34,748
The sheets...

353
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,733
The color bothered me.

354
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:44,972
It didn't match the interior.

355
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:51,295
He threw away perfectly good sheets

356
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,861
not in the trash,
but a clothing donation bin.

357
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,179
He's got something to hide.

358
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:02,314
Except...

359
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,589
There's something I can't figure out.

360
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:23,425
Humans acquire deviation
from interacting with others.

361
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:26,931
Seo Han-yu.

362
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:28,759
Get over here.

363
00:30:29,737 --> 00:30:31,224
Make it quick!

364
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:10,138
Don't I get to eat? I'm starving.

365
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,858
I'm going to ask you again.

366
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:23,505
Why did you throw out the sheets?

367
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:26,740
I'm a clean freak.

368
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,119
I can't sleep on used sheets.

369
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,220
I've already told you like five times.

370
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,101
How did Ji-na's blood get on the sheets?

371
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,537
I have no idea.

372
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,480
Maybe she had a nosebleed.

373
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,687
Or got her period.

374
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,246
Han-yu.

375
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:54,500
You see...

376
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,966
I know you didn't do anything.

377
00:31:58,336 --> 00:32:00,830
I totally believe you. Want to know why?

378
00:32:01,714 --> 00:32:05,744
Good-looking guys like us
can't keep girls away.

379
00:32:07,888 --> 00:32:09,683
Yoon Ji-na came on to you first, right?

380
00:32:10,766 --> 00:32:12,445
Though you weren't that interested.

381
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:20,502
I told you the truth before.

382
00:32:22,154 --> 00:32:23,641
She's not my type.

383
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:26,559
There are people who say she's hot,

384
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,560
but not me.

385
00:32:28,953 --> 00:32:31,544
She insisted on coming, so I let her.

386
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:33,434
I had some whisky left,

387
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,521
so I gave her that
and she drank all of it.

388
00:32:36,962 --> 00:32:38,497
You have whisky at home?

389
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,683
What brand?

390
00:32:43,052 --> 00:32:44,587
I'm a whisky drinker myself.

391
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:48,221
Glenfiddich.

392
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,084
And then what?

393
00:32:50,477 --> 00:32:52,108
She downed the bottle,

394
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:55,308
got herself drunk,
and said she didn't want to go home.

395
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:58,007
She even wanted another drink.

396
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:01,062
So I got her a beer
from a convenience store.

397
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:02,958
She passed out after that.

398
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:04,998
Mixing drinks is a bad choice.

399
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:07,365
How were you able to buy the beer?

400
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:09,672
The convenience store never checks IDs.

401
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:12,815
Go see for yourself.

402
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,353
Glenfiddich, my ass.

403
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:27,626
Ji-uk.

404
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:31,492
The only usable surveillance camera
footage is from the parking lot.

405
00:33:32,316 --> 00:33:35,536
With the number of residents
in the building, there's a lot of traffic.

406
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:38,873
The time Ji-na entered the building,

407
00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:40,885
the time Han-yu went out and came back,

408
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:43,547
and the time he left
in the morning all checks out.

409
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,934
How long was he gone to get the beer?

410
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,925
Five, ten minutes?

411
00:33:51,504 --> 00:33:55,198
If somebody intruded
during that time slot,

412
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,052
the S line can be explained.

413
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:05,271
That would mean she had passed out
before drinking the beer.

414
00:34:06,854 --> 00:34:08,102
What line?

415
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:11,057
It's nothing.

416
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:15,743
Hey, stop it right there.

417
00:34:17,908 --> 00:34:19,395
When did these punks get in?

418
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:22,124
About an hour ago.

419
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:23,953
There.

420
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:28,396
Weren't there cameras
at the back of the building?

421
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,763
No.

422
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:31,759
Rewind.

423
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:45,187
One, two, three...

424
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:49,145
One, two, three, four, five...

425
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:58,456
From six to seven lines.

426
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,009
Four to five lines.

427
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:05,587
One, two, three...

428
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:12,121
Fucking punks.

429
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,009
So that's Ji-na?

430
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:32,884
Bring them with you.

431
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,387
Do you have cigarettes?

432
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:36,389
- No.
- Not again.

433
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:37,660
You can't be serious.

434
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:47,523
DETECTIVE HAN

435
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:57,230
SUNGLASSES

436
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:03,544
Fuck. I don't have the time for this.

437
00:36:03,568 --> 00:36:05,199
I want a lawyer.

438
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,441
- What are you typing?
- Hey.

439
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:28,081
Please, can't you just let me go home?

440
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:45,772
I didn't do anything.

441
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:48,053
Let me go. Please.

442
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:51,149
My mom's going to kill me.

443
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:52,654
Please.

444
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,101
Okay, I'll drive you home. Come on.

445
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:13,680
Detective.

446
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,334
I live in the opposite direction.

447
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:17,509
Yes, I know.

448
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,913
Where are we going?

449
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,386
What do you think of this car?

450
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,849
Pretty smooth, isn't it?

451
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,111
Can you just tell me where we're going?

452
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:35,882
God, this red light is crazy long.

453
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:41,467
Why are we here?

454
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,635
Is this place familiar?

455
00:37:51,898 --> 00:37:53,673
Detective Oh, come with me.

456
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:15,114
Okay.

457
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:18,665
What should we have for dinner?
Maybe get some soju?

458
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,286
Ji-uk.

459
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:22,515
We don't have much time.

460
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,492
We have to let Seo Han-yu go soon.

461
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:28,625
Also, we don't have cause
to keep that kid in custody.

462
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:31,064
Good. Keep talking.

463
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:36,049
But try to keep a frown on.

464
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:37,766
What for?

465
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:40,400
Isn't it obvious?

466
00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:42,514
He's ready to piss himself.

467
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:47,814
All we need to do is wait
with a dead serious face.

468
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:50,805
I say

469
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:52,987
he'll break in ten minutes.

470
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,871
Hey, Beom-ju. Get out of the car.

471
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:06,389
- What? I don't...
- Just get out for a minute.

472
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,584
Where are you taking me?

473
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:11,391
It's not far. It won't take long.

474
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:12,978
Where are we going?

475
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:16,051
Can't you please just take me home?

476
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,179
We'll have a look around the crime scene,

477
00:39:18,203 --> 00:39:19,555
and we'll go back...

478
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:20,922
Damn it.

479
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,974
Now that's a confession.

480
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:35,061
Fucking prick.

481
00:39:37,683 --> 00:39:39,458
He's a super fast runner, isn't he?

482
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:41,712
Yes.

483
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,137
- Detective.
- Yes?

484
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,306
I really want to go home.

485
00:39:48,236 --> 00:39:51,930
I'll take you.
But we're going back to the station first.

486
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:54,756
Why? What about the other guys?

487
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:56,475
I sent them home.

488
00:39:58,414 --> 00:39:59,564
How come?

489
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,750
I didn't have much on them.

490
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:06,041
What about me? Why can't I go home?

491
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:08,616
You...

492
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:12,006
I think I've got enough on you.

493
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,318
No way.

494
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:18,122
You can't do this!

495
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,540
You can't do this!

496
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:25,985
Damn it!

497
00:40:26,362 --> 00:40:28,041
Calm down. You're going to get hurt.

498
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:41,304
Jerks.

499
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:46,213
Detective.

500
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:50,076
I won't get detained
if I'm absolutely honest, will I?

501
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,168
Well,

502
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:58,183
that depends on what you say.

503
00:41:00,484 --> 00:41:02,019
I did do it,

504
00:41:03,237 --> 00:41:04,580
but it wasn't just me.

505
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:07,485
It's not my fucking fault.

506
00:41:09,452 --> 00:41:11,994
That scumbag Han-yu planned everything.

507
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:14,927
I was always on
about how hot Yoon Ji-na was,

508
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:16,936
and one day the guys called me up.

509
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,407
They asked how much I'd pay
to do it with Yoon Ji-na.

510
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,508
I only went there
because I wanted to drink with her.

511
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:25,279
She was out cold
because Han-yu had drugged her.

512
00:41:25,303 --> 00:41:28,658
Detective, it was Han-yu.
He told us what to do.

513
00:41:28,682 --> 00:41:29,881
It wasn't...

514
00:41:30,684 --> 00:41:33,288
It wasn't just me. We were all in on it.

515
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:36,041
Can you let me off just this once?

516
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:38,559
That asshole Han-yu
planned the whole thing.

517
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:42,237
I only did it because my friends said to!

518
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:48,114
Han-yu was sitting there
watching us the whole time, the pervert.

519
00:41:58,632 --> 00:41:59,783
This is yours, isn't it?

520
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:05,699
- What is it?
- I found it in your room.

521
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,840
As if.
It was in the fire extinguisher cabinet.

522
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:15,734
Did you use this to drug Ji-na?

523
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:21,163
Do you have proof I did?

524
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:24,135
I just had this for a laugh.

525
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:28,183
Let's see if the judge
thinks it's funny, shall we?

526
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:29,810
The other kids came clean.

527
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:31,560
You have four witnesses against you.

528
00:42:38,051 --> 00:42:40,258
I'm not the rapist.

529
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:44,248
Those scumbags are.

530
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:50,297
Sure, you're right.

531
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:52,231
But you're the ringleader.

532
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:54,657
You creep.

533
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,197
Detective.

534
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,415
Will they be punished?

535
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:07,645
I did everything I could.

536
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,254
The court will do the rest.

537
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,933
Putting these glasses on the judge
would definitely do the trick.

538
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,618
Wearing the glasses

539
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:25,177
doesn't let you see the truth.

540
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:31,886
I suppose.

541
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:44,548
If I get tons of S lines like you,

542
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:47,550
I might become more indifferent.

543
00:43:48,588 --> 00:43:50,075
Is this an insult?

544
00:43:54,386 --> 00:43:59,423
NURSING HOME

545
00:44:03,563 --> 00:44:05,386
You can walk home from here, can't you?

546
00:44:05,649 --> 00:44:07,616
Something urgent came up.

547
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:10,388
Sure.

548
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:33,305
YOO JUN-SEON

549
00:44:33,388 --> 00:44:35,211
When did he go missing?

550
00:44:35,891 --> 00:44:38,453
This isn't the first time.
Are you sure he isn't here?

551
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,164
I... I think...

552
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:43,250
I found him on the roof the last time.

553
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:46,153
I think you need to come and see this.

554
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:52,003
We haven't seen her before,

555
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:54,750
and we don't know how she got in.

556
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:22,153
Seon-a's homeroom teacher?

557
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:31,067
UNKNOWN NUMBER

558
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,229
Dong-sik.

559
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:40,411
Run a background check on Lee Gyu-jin.

560
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,242
Father...

561
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:49,537
How did you get here?

562
00:48:07,378 --> 00:48:09,153
Seon-a...

563
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:13,046
What the hell is going on?

564
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:41,754
This is fucked up.

565
00:48:44,419 --> 00:48:45,618
Get your hands off her.

566
00:48:46,672 --> 00:48:47,919
Get them off!

567
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:56,929
What did you do to Seon-a?

568
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,496
Say something, for fuck's sake!

569
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,343
Ji-uk...

570
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:23,488
You fucking...

571
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,674
How could you...

572
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:48,945
to Seon-a!

573
00:49:50,368 --> 00:49:52,431
What have you done?

574
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:55,113
How is she supposed to live with this?

575
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:57,885
Detective...

576
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:01,522
I need your help.

577
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:28,757
ask you a favor.

578
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,090
You can say no if you want.

579
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:34,361
Do you like me?

580
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:38,397
If I were ever to be with someone,

581
00:51:39,114 --> 00:51:41,945
I wanted it to be you.

582
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:54,858
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
ARE YOU IGNORING ME?

583
00:51:54,882 --> 00:51:56,360
REPORTING ME WON'T GET RID OF THE VIDEOS

584
00:51:56,384 --> 00:51:58,195
IT'S OVER FOR YOU, YOU SLUT

585
00:51:58,219 --> 00:51:59,562
I think

586
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:03,946
you dropped these earlier.

587
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:06,629
Detective...

588
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,467
I need your help.

589
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:12,086
I ran a background check
on your homeroom teacher,

590
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,212
but nothing came up.

591
00:52:13,236 --> 00:52:15,423
Lee Gyu-jin doesn't exist.

592
00:52:15,447 --> 00:52:16,886
The lines above people's heads.

593
00:52:17,032 --> 00:52:18,807
You know what they mean, don't you?

594
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:20,553
It won't be long

595
00:52:20,577 --> 00:52:24,511
until the whole world is bathed in red.

596
00:52:24,582 --> 00:52:27,844
RED LINES THAT CONNECT SEXUAL PARTNERS
