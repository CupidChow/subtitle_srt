Seon-a, please wake up!

Where's Seon-a?

00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,698
Why were you at school so late at night?

13
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,285
I was looking for Seon-a.

14
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,122
Looking for her?

15
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:25,291
She called me

16
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:29,129
on her way to school.

17
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,341
This late at night?

18
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:38,722
Don't know.

19
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,830
I know one thing for sure.

20
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,127
Seon-a...

21
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:12,507
didn't try to kill herself.

22
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,043
Is the Korean teacher still not here?

23
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,836
Come on. Someone should try calling him.

24
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:49,880
What a day to be tardy.

25
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:54,551
I'm trying to reach him,
but he's not picking up.

26
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:58,848
How can you let something like this
happen at our school?

27
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:01,183
She could have killed herself at home.

28
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,311
Why did she do it here
on our school premises?

29
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,979
Excuse me.

30
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:07,648
I think you just crossed a line.

31
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,443
And for your information,
she hasn't passed yet.

32
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:13,071
You don't get to preach.

33
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:14,656
You have just as much accountability.

34
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,825
Yes, I am well aware of that.

35
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:19,828
We're all responsible for what happened.

36
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,080
What I don't get is
why you're blaming the student.

37
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:23,915
What the heck are you talking about?

38
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,793
- That's what you're doing.
- I'm not taking this!

39
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:28,378
I said what I said.

40
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:30,297
Then let's talk it out at my office!

41
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:31,548
- Calm down.
- Do you hear me?

42
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:32,883
- Unbelievable.
- That's enough.

43
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:34,969
You have no right to be acting out.

44
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:37,304
- Settle down.
- That's not it.

45
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:38,472
Are you okay?

46
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:39,974
I'm already stressed as it is.

47
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:41,517
You're making things a lot worse.

48
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:43,978
- Just let it pass.
- Sorry about this.

49
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:47,857
Anyway, make sure this doesn't get around

50
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:50,527
and keep quiet about it.

51
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,988
- God, you guys stink of smoke.
- Whatever, we smell nice.

52
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,698
Your teeth are going to turn yellow.

53
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:55,949
You should try it sometime.

54
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:58,452
Your teeth are yellow as fuck.
They're like corn.

55
00:04:58,535 --> 00:04:59,703
What?

56
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:01,788
You guys are hilarious.

57
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:04,416
Join us for a smoke.

58
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,584
Hey.

59
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,086
Where's Hye-yeong?

60
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,172
What a fucking coincidence,
right after Seon-a falls off the roof.

61
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:12,883
- Is school too boring without her?
- Maybe.

62
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:16,178
It's all my fault. She's in my class.

63
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:17,847
No, don't say that.

64
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:21,017
The School Violence Prevention Committee
was almost held because of her, right?

65
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,853
Is the Korean teacher still unavailable?

66
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:27,232
It's strange. This usually never happens.

67
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:31,987
This is exhausting.

68
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,697
Does anyone have good news for a change?

69
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,449
It's always bullying, suicides...

70
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,662
- Hey, Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

71
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:42,581
How are the wedding preparations going?

72
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:43,874
Have you fixed a date?

73
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:46,502
We called it off.

74
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:15,657
THE APARTMENT

75
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,659
Come in. You can leave that here.

76
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:22,831
Are you hiding? A-yul.

77
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,167
Come say hi to your uncle.

78
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,337
Come on.

79
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,089
Here.

80
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,263
A-yul.

81
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,933
Are you feeling shy?

82
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,812
You don't have much luggage.

83
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:45,605
I'll only be staying for a week.

84
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,982
I shipped the rest of my stuff.

85
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:50,819
Quitting your job and moving to Canada...
It's so out of the blue.

86
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:51,862
Gosh.

87
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:54,406
Have a seat.

88
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,033
Okay.

89
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:59,662
It's your first time here, right?
How do you like it?

90
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:02,832
It's great.

91
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,710
You moved here last year, right?

92
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,295
What? No.

93
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,464
It's been over two years.

94
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:11,758
Time flies.

95
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,137
It's all thanks to Mr. Kim Byeong-cheol.

96
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,472
Right?

97
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,140
So that would be my brother-in-law?

98
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,102
What was that?

99
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:24,604
Is he okay with me staying here?

100
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,232
Why not? You're my little brother.

101
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:32,529
Plus, he's way too busy.
He won't be around much.

102
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:33,447
Let me have a look.

103
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:36,492
All done.

104
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:39,578
You'll be going to work
up until the departure date, right?

105
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:41,330
Yeah.

106
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:43,749
Just a second.

107
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:54,386
Kang Seon-a.

108
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,141
Wake up and say something.

109
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:39,099
You must be looking for evidence.

110
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:41,602
For Seon-a, right?

111
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,567
I know her. She's one bitter bitch.

112
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,779
Suicide? It's ridiculous.

113
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,449
And Kim Hye-yeong,
who's been bullying Seon-a every day,

114
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:57,618
skipped school the very next day.

115
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:00,288
Now that's suspicious.

116
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,124
Who are you?

117
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,126
I'm Lee Gyeong-jin from Class 5.

118
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,130
Assuming that this is
not a suicide but a murder,

119
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,509
the number one suspect is the person
who was closest to the victim.

120
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,053
But Seon-a was a loner.

121
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,723
No, wait.

122
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:21,352
Recently, she had some people
she hung around with.

123
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,228
She's not dead.

124
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,023
- What?
- Seon-a's still alive.

125
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,403
True. Sorry.

126
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,490
That reminds me,
you were friends with her.

127
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:05,856
Where did you get these?

128
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,485
An optical store.

129
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:10,778
When?

130
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,657
- Last year.
- How come you didn't wear them till now?

131
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,453
I wore contacts but they hurt my eyes.

132
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:55,075
Excuse me.

133
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:56,743
Yes?

134
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,329
Do you happen to know who these belong to?

135
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,677
I'm not sure.

136
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:16,305
Why do you ask?

137
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,808
They were on my desk.

138
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,061
They must be yours, then.

139
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:24,647
Try them on. I bet they suit you.

140
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:26,899
Sure.

141
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,562
It's all my fault.

142
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:46,441
I should have taken better care of her.

143
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:52,614
I was her homeroom teacher
and I had no idea what was bothering her.

144
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:55,409
So you think it was a suicide attempt?

145
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:00,622
- Sorry?
- It hasn't...

146
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,959
been ruled as a suicide yet.

147
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:09,799
Either way,

148
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:13,928
I'm ready to help you if you need me.

149
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:16,598
Call me whenever.

150
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,103
Is the student that bullied Seon-a
here today?

151
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,942
That student

152
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:29,069
is missing as of now.

153
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:30,654
Missing?

154
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:33,448
Yes.

155
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:46,212
What about this student?

156
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:51,676
I found this in Seon-a's bag.

157
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,469
Seems it was taken
on the day of the accident.

158
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:15,784
Are you Lee Ji-won?

159
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:16,869
Yes.

160
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:19,413
I'll get to the point.

161
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:22,583
Were you in a relationship with Seon-a?

162
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,963
No.

163
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:32,218
If you weren't,

164
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:34,220
why were you two on a date?

165
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:35,722
She wanted to meet up.

166
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:37,224
- And you always say yes?
- Why not?

167
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:40,477
You know.

168
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,605
It was kind of interesting.

169
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:47,901
It was as if the loner
suddenly became a different person.

170
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,614
I knew she was always into me.

171
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,255
Did you notice anything strange
while with her?

172
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,050
Well...

173
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,260
Not really.

174
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:15,722
What about at the cafe?

175
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:18,725
Can I be honest with you?

176
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,356
We talked and then made out.

177
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:27,693
I wanted a little more

178
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:29,028
but she didn't.

179
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,907
And then what?

180
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:37,870
Oh, I remember.

181
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,123
We took a picture

182
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,417
but then she started
running off somewhere.

183
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:45,128
She said she lost something.

184
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:16,869
HAN JI-UK

185
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:20,081
OH DONG-SIK

186
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:37,433
SINU GREEN PARK (1)

187
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:02,417
SINU GREEN PARK (2)

188
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,815
- Cheers.
- Right.

189
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:25,858
Cheers.

190
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:42,959
I'm sorry I came to stay out of the blue.

191
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:45,587
- Hey.
- It's fine. Don't be.

192
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:48,006
Jeong-u.

193
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:50,676
That's your name, right?

194
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,220
Yes. There's no need to be so formal.

195
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,014
By the way,

196
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:56,974
you two

197
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:00,019
- don't look alike at all.
- What?

198
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:01,270
He's so handsome.

199
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:07,151
Cheers.

200
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,200
Can I ask you something?

201
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:16,077
Go ahead.

202
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,332
I heard you almost got married.
What happened?

203
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,628
Honey, don't...

204
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:26,964
It's okay. Let him talk.

205
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,801
We'd been living together for a while

206
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,305
but not long before the wedding,

207
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:38,309
I came home early from work
and saw her in bed with my friend.

208
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,274
Goodness, Jeong-u.

209
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,235
You made the right call.

210
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,946
Having it happen before the wedding

211
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,116
is the best luck you can get.

212
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,452
I really like this guy.

213
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,870
Come on, let me pour you one.

214
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:57,955
Thanks.

215
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:03,335
Top me off, too.

216
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,087
- You okay?
- Yeah.

217
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:07,923
There we go.

218
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:20,853
What the heck?

219
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:22,814
- Sorry about this.
- No worries.

220
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,859
They're all from work.

221
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:28,028
So many texts...

222
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,741
What subject did you say you teach?

223
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:34,618
I teach English.

224
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:47,173
I sometimes meet people
from other countries because of work.

225
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:48,716
Jeong-u.

226
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:52,512
Do you know what people
visiting Korea love the best?

227
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:55,598
Guess.

228
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,685
Go on.

229
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:06,943
It's been a while
since you talked to your sister, right?

230
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:09,905
Yes. I didn't take her calls too often.

231
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:12,533
Well.

232
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,868
Stay in touch from now on.

233
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:18,247
You're the only family to each other
since your parents passed.

234
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,415
That's right.

235
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,584
I'll stay in touch.

236
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,260
Hello.

237
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,020
Oops.

238
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,478
Jeong-u, where are you going?

239
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,272
We live on the tenth floor.

240
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,315
Oh, right.

241
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,568
You can't hold your liquor very well,
can you?

242
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,864
I'm telling you.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

243
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:32,825
You can't close this case.

244
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:35,286
What do you mean, Detective Han?

245
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:37,621
We heard what the doctor said.

246
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:39,624
No signs of foul play.

247
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:51,344
Be honest with me.

248
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:55,182
Were you aware
that your niece was getting bullied?

249
00:21:58,101 --> 00:21:59,895
There's a possibility
of it being a suicide attempt.

250
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:04,942
All the more reason for us to investigate.
It might not be one!

251
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,151
Ji-uk.

252
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:07,611
The top brass want this closed.

253
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,323
The school foundation's fed up with it.

254
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:13,117
Suicide's bad enough.

255
00:22:13,142 --> 00:22:15,953
But a homicide? They'll throw a fit.

256
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,957
I know how you feel.

257
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,626
But just let it go.

258
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:23,962
Will you?

259
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:31,928
What if it were your kid?

260
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,812
What the...

261
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:44,149
You just crossed a line.

262
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,986
You crossed it first.

263
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:50,573
What?

264
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:52,992
Hey. Ji-uk!

265
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:07,549
ENTER PASSCODE

266
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:09,676
For fuck's sake.

267
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:12,888
It's impossible to bypass.
They can't do it even in the States.

268
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:20,729
PHYSICS, LEE GYU-JIN

269
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:31,991
You have the glasses on.
They really suit you.

270
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:33,701
Thanks.

271
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,623
The Korean teacher
must be still unavailable.

272
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,085
Looks like it.

273
00:23:58,561 --> 00:23:59,770
If you found out

274
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,982
someone you knew was having an affair,

275
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,276
what would you do?

276
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,488
Well...

277
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,620
Is it something that happened for sure?

278
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,381
I'd let everybody know

279
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,842
and let all hell break loose.

280
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,596
Like a scene from a soap opera.

281
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,850
I see.

282
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,275
You were so shy at first.

283
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,693
Now Uncle's your favorite?

284
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:46,903
A-yul.

285
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,905
Hold Mommy's hand, too.

286
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,703
You're a funny little kid.

287
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,538
- Who's Oh Tae-seok?
- What?

288
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,541
That's been misdelivered.

289
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,335
It's the right address, though.

290
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,337
No, it belongs to Unit 401.

291
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,714
They sometimes add the wrong address.
I'll take it to them.

292
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:07,633
No, you take A-yul inside. I'll go.

293
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,345
Just drop it off at the security office.

294
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,721
Sure thing.

295
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:14,724
Want to try opening the door?

296
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,475
OH TAE-SEOK, UNIT 1002

297
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,435
Unit 401?

298
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,051
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

299
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:32,805
The shopping bags are so heavy.

300
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,641
You said I could buy whatever I wanted.

301
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:40,897
There's another parcel.

302
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:50,532
No, it's not mine. It's yours.

303
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,242
Well...

304
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,952
I'm not sure.

305
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:10,470
RECIPIENT: OH TAE-SEOK

306
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:15,266
RECIPIENT: KWAK CHAE-RIN

307
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:17,268
Kwak Chae-rin.

308
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,919
A-yul, let's say hello to Grandma.

309
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:44,630
Okay.

310
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:46,340
Let's say hello.

311
00:28:07,863 --> 00:28:09,406
- Where's Byeong-cheol?
- What?

312
00:28:10,324 --> 00:28:11,408
He's in Gumi.

313
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:15,704
Is he not coming home today too?

314
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:18,457
When he visits the factories in Gumi,

315
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:20,835
he spends two or three nights there.

316
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:29,636
How is married life?

317
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:35,267
It's good.
Raising a kid like everyone else.

318
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:40,147
You should get a facial or something.

319
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,940
Byeong-cheol makes enough money.

320
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:49,406
You've changed a lot,
nagging me like that.

321
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:55,788
Mom should've seen this.

322
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:04,047
Jeong-u.

323
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:07,759
About your breakup...

324
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,389
It wasn't because your ex
and her family didn't like the fact

325
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:14,307
that you had no parents, was it?

326
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:17,269
It wasn't.

327
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:20,564
I told you. She was cheating on me.

328
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:30,908
It's nice to have you with me
on the day Mom passed away.

329
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,453
For Dad's...

330
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:43,880
You're not in touch with
Dad's side of the family, are you?

331
00:29:44,547 --> 00:29:45,590
Well...

332
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:49,761
Sometimes Uncle calls and...

333
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:51,722
Are you out of your mind?

334
00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:55,976
Have you forgotten what it did to Mom
after Dad cheated on her?

335
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:59,605
How could you speak to them?

336
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:00,814
I just...

337
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:04,652
You were too young
to understand at the time, but...

338
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:13,786
I was just going to marry Su-yeon.

339
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,001
We'd been living together for six years.
I was going to let it go.

340
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,379
She swore it was a mistake.

341
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:26,216
She was on her knees saying she was sorry.

342
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:31,680
But one day...

343
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,685
I could see Dad's face.

344
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,899
Dad probably said he was sorry at first.

345
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:45,903
Is this how Mom would have felt?

346
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,701
The face of the girl I loved so much

347
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:56,414
kept reminding me of
the person I despised most.

348
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,293
I still love Su-yeon.

349
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:03,046
I miss her.

350
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:07,593
But I can't see her because of Dad.

351
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:14,642
The man's ruining my life from his grave.

352
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:24,152
- This is crazy.
- What on earth?

353
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:25,528
Is this actually true?

354
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,488
Not a day goes by
without some kind of commotion.

355
00:31:27,572 --> 00:31:28,948
Unbelievable.

356
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:30,950
- I never thought...
- Is that him?

357
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:33,578
- The Korean teacher...
- How is this possible?

358
00:31:34,454 --> 00:31:36,748
Hey, come on over here, quick.

359
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,750
It's Kim Hye-yeong and the Korean teacher.

360
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,335
- This is unreal.
- Wow.

361
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:42,129
- Are you kidding me?
- You're lying.

362
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:44,464
- This is insane!
- Come on.

363
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:46,216
This is nuts.

364
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,093
Is this for real?

365
00:31:48,177 --> 00:31:52,181
DO NOT CROSS, UNDER INVESTIGATION

366
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,975
I am Bang Seong-jin.

367
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:58,187
I teach Korean at Bangju High School.

368
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,149
For a while, I have been

369
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,485
in an inappropriate relationship
with a student.

370
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,697
I apologize to my family.

371
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:10,575
The humiliation and guilt
that will overwhelm me

372
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:13,036
when this comes to light

373
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:16,373
has led me to end my own life.

374
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:22,963
I am sincerely sorry
for causing such trouble.

375
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:25,132
Hey, don't touch that.

376
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:27,384
I've got my gloves on.

377
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:33,057
SUICIDE NOTE

378
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,852
I AM BANG SEONG-JIN,
I TEACH KOREAN AT BANGJU HIGH SCHOOL...

379
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:40,315
What's the estimated time of death?

380
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:42,984
Well...

381
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:47,364
We'll need an autopsy to confirm that

382
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:49,574
but I heard it's been at least three days
since he died.

383
00:32:59,084 --> 00:33:00,794
Doesn't seem like it happened here.

384
00:33:01,795 --> 00:33:02,630
What?

385
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,342
This car's sitting
in the middle of this parking lot

386
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,552
and nobody sees him for three days?

387
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:11,180
The pictures were posted today.

388
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:16,227
He knew it was going to come out.

389
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,273
Someone's behind all of this.

390
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:25,779
Hey, Prez!

391
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,199
We're going for some tteokbokki.
Want to join us?

392
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:33,120
- Sure.
- Really?

393
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:35,914
You never want to join me.

394
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:39,919
Are you into me or something?

395
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:45,424
Or maybe it's Hyeon-heup
you're interested in.

396
00:33:53,474 --> 00:34:00,440
BANGJU HIGH SCHOOL

397
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,907
- Hey. Get in the car.
- Who are you?

398
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:11,660
Do you know this guy?

399
00:34:12,953 --> 00:34:14,413
He's my neighbor.

400
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,498
It's illegal to park here. Get in, quick.

401
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,794
Hey, mister.

402
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:21,712
Who are you to tell us what to do?

403
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:22,755
Mister?

404
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:25,925
Yeah, that's right.
Are you trying to kidnap us?

405
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:28,261
It's a pretty bold-faced attempt.

406
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:30,013
You're one crazy dude.

407
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:34,184
Hey, call the police. Come on.

408
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:36,728
You want the police? Just a second.

409
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:40,941
Hey, look. The police just got here.

410
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:43,235
Hop in. Quick.

411
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:47,990
You never dropped by.
I thought we were friends.

412
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,415
I'm not suspecting you or anything.

413
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,085
You said it yourself.

414
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:01,254
She had no reason to kill herself.

415
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:05,883
Why do you think Seon-a
went back to school so late at night?

416
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:15,268
Have you seen

417
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:17,729
Seon-a's glasses?

418
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,524
Glasses?

419
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,116
Tell me the truth.

420
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:31,869
What do the glasses mean?

421
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:34,413
Does Seon-a also have
something to do with them?

422
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,376
The glasses.

423
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:40,920
You have to find them.

424
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:43,756
Then I'll tell you.

425
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:49,679
Tell me what?

426
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,213
Taxi!

427
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,844
HOTEL

428
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:36,061
The key's inside.

429
00:36:43,153 --> 00:36:45,196
Let's just start eating.

430
00:36:46,947 --> 00:36:48,115
Are you done now?

431
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,424
Wait. What's this doing here?

432
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,052
Oh, my gosh!

433
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:09,721
What is it?

434
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:15,644
It's beautiful.

435
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:26,572
- This is embarrassing.
- Come on.

436
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:28,491
Let's see.

437
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:30,284
There.

438
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,584
Let's eat.

439
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:44,091
Hello?

440
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:46,426
Hi, Byeong-cheol. This is Jeong-u.

441
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,511
Hey.

442
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:55,978
Jeong-u, what's up?

443
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:58,606
Is this a bad time?

444
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:01,776
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

445
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,110
I can't really talk.

446
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,987
Where are you?

447
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,781
Now?

448
00:38:08,074 --> 00:38:09,200
I'm not in Seoul.

449
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:12,579
I'll give you a call when I can.

450
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:13,648
Byeong-cheol.

451
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,088
I can't get a hold of my sister.

452
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:21,004
Really?

453
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:25,217
In that case,

454
00:38:25,926 --> 00:38:28,095
I'll try calling her.

455
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:31,015
Okay? Got to go now.

456
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:44,362
ROOM NO. 2407

457
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,685
Just a minute, okay, babe?

458
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,634
- Who is it?
- Room service.

459
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:52,683
Hey!

460
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,479
Jeong-u.

461
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:58,856
Let go of me.

462
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:01,276
Let go.

463
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,486
What the hell do you think you're doing?

464
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,916
I'd like to ask you the same question.

465
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,295
Well, I...

466
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,632
Jeong-u, I understand

467
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,470
how all of this may look to you.

468
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:31,140
But you have to respect my privacy.

469
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:33,977
I mean...

470
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:38,398
This does no good for your sister.

471
00:40:39,107 --> 00:40:40,400
You're so brazen.

472
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,906
Shouldn't you be apologizing first?

473
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:49,910
You're right. Okay, I'm sorry.

474
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,664
I have no words for how sorry I am.

475
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:55,541
Wait!

476
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:00,546
Okay.

477
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:04,467
I'll break it off today, right here.

478
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:07,386
I swear.

479
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,348
Just give me a little more time.

480
00:41:11,432 --> 00:41:13,143
I mean it. I'm serious.

481
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:15,186
Will you?

482
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:21,109
End it today.

483
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,655
Otherwise, who knows what I'll do.

484
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,575
Jeong-u.

485
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:31,078
Don't tell your sister.

486
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:38,336
When will we meet again once you leave?

487
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,757
We only just got back in touch.

488
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:50,974
Canada's not that far away.

489
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:54,519
I'll call you often.

490
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,147
You do that.

491
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,566
Call me, if something's up.

492
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,656
A-yul's going to miss you
when she wakes up.

493
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:10,035
Here, this isn't much.

494
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:11,745
It's for you to spend.

495
00:42:12,288 --> 00:42:14,165
- You shouldn't have.
- Go.

496
00:42:21,297 --> 00:42:23,925
Has Byeong-cheol still not called?

497
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,051
What?

498
00:42:26,386 --> 00:42:27,971
He'll call when he can.

499
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:30,265
He must be busy.

500
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:32,517
Call me.

501
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:34,686
I will. You don't need to see me off.

502
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,589
The soap opera thing.

503
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:04,426
Did you take care of it?

504
00:43:06,678 --> 00:43:07,679
Not really.

505
00:43:08,513 --> 00:43:09,639
I don't think so.

506
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:11,892
Perhaps I did.

507
00:43:15,187 --> 00:43:17,231
It's bad enough
that things are chaotic here.

508
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:22,027
I'm sad to hear
that you are leaving as well.

509
00:43:24,446 --> 00:43:25,823
Thanks for everything.

510
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:27,199
It's nothing.

511
00:43:28,993 --> 00:43:31,621
Have they found Kim Hye-yeong?

512
00:43:33,498 --> 00:43:34,999
No, not yet.

513
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,337
Who do you think posted the pictures?

514
00:43:40,672 --> 00:43:41,715
Well...

515
00:43:42,465 --> 00:43:44,134
There are plenty of people who would.

516
00:43:44,217 --> 00:43:47,971
There are rumors that the pictures were
all over social media even before that.

517
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:07,074
"Chae-rin."

518
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:17,085
KWAK CHAE-RIN

519

I'M SO TOUCHED

521
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,397

Your call could not be connected
and has been forwarded...

528
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:06,094
Hello. Can I help you?

529
00:45:06,178 --> 00:45:07,679
We're trying to get inside the complex.

530
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:09,306
Sorry, I'll only be a minute.

531
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,142
Sir. Excuse me, sir!

532
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:30,495
Oh, my goodness.

533
00:45:30,578 --> 00:45:31,871
You have to stop!

534
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:34,666
Stop! I said, stop!

535
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:36,668
Oh, no!

536
00:45:36,752 --> 00:45:37,919
Oh, my goodness!

537
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,632
What's up with that person?

538
00:45:41,715 --> 00:45:43,509
Somebody, please call the police.

539
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:44,593
Oh, no!

540
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,053
What's going on?

541
00:45:46,136 --> 00:45:47,805
Are you okay?

542
00:45:47,888 --> 00:45:49,932
- What's going on?
- The person did it on purpose.

543
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:52,893
- You have to stop.
- Come on.

544
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:54,395
Are you okay?

545
00:45:54,478 --> 00:45:56,898
- Oh, my gosh.
- What's going on?

546
00:45:59,692 --> 00:46:00,735
Gyeong-mi.

547
00:46:02,946 --> 00:46:03,988
Are you okay?

548
00:46:06,074 --> 00:46:07,784
Open the door.

549
00:46:08,868 --> 00:46:10,287
That scared me.

550
00:46:17,169 --> 00:46:18,420
Are you okay?

551
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:24,176
I'll take care of this.

552
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,761
Take A-yul and--

553
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:26,846
Jeong-u.

554
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,682
Why did you do it?

555
00:46:31,684 --> 00:46:33,394
What do you mean?

556
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:35,730
Why did you do it?

557
00:46:36,689 --> 00:46:37,982
What are you talking about?

558
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:41,653
Why did you have to do that?

559
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:50,203
What the hell...

560
00:46:56,835 --> 00:46:58,796
- You...
- Babe!

561
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:01,882
Hey.

562
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:05,886
- Are you okay?
- Babe...

563
00:47:06,554 --> 00:47:10,516
That woman just crashed her car
into mine out of nowhere, and...

564
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,060
Everything's okay.

565
00:47:13,186 --> 00:47:14,228
I'm sorry this happened.

566
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:20,902
Let go of me, you punk.

567
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:22,821
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

568
00:47:23,613 --> 00:47:26,032
You're no better than an animal.
You bastard!

569
00:47:26,116 --> 00:47:27,576
Let go, for fuck's sake!

570
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:28,702
Stop!

571
00:47:29,536 --> 00:47:31,121
Stop.

572
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:32,956
Stop it, Jeong-u.

573
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:35,209
Damn it.

574
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:39,171
Babe, what's going on?

575
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:41,507
They're just some crazy people.

576
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:42,675
Come on.

577
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,435
That's not my husband.

578
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:56,022
That person is not Kim Byeong-cheol.

579
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,113
That man's name is Oh Tae-seok.

580
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,367
He's that woman's husband.

581
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:13,582
He came here
in case I tried to kill his pregnant wife.

582
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:15,960
Jeong-u.

583
00:48:16,669 --> 00:48:17,712
I...

584
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,132
I'm...

585
00:48:22,884 --> 00:48:24,802
I'm the other woman.

586
00:48:27,388 --> 00:48:28,473
What are you saying?

587
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,268
I was told what you said.

588
00:48:35,772 --> 00:48:38,275
You wanted him to end the affair.

589
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,075
Jeong-u saw me and Chae-rin together.

590
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,787
He wanted me to end the affair.

591
00:48:51,497 --> 00:48:52,790
Chae-rin's pregnant.

592
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:55,918
I think it's time.

593
00:49:22,654 --> 00:49:24,782
What the hell is wrong with you?

594
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:26,742
You've destroyed my car.

595
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:29,578
I can't believe this.

596
00:49:41,424 --> 00:49:42,842
Mommy.

597
00:49:51,768 --> 00:49:53,770
Why are you crying, Uncle?

598
00:49:54,271 --> 00:49:55,939
Is Mommy hurt?

599
00:49:58,275 --> 00:49:59,276
No.

600
00:50:01,236 --> 00:50:02,696
Everything's okay, A-yul.

601
00:50:05,074 --> 00:50:06,367
I AM SINCERELY SORRY...

602
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,203
What a sloppy suicide note.

603
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:14,876
Suicide note.

604
00:50:18,796 --> 00:50:19,798
Suicide note?

605
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:26,018
- Where are you going?
- Home.

606
00:50:30,851 --> 00:50:32,811
And I thought you lived here.

607
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:33,082
MISEONG MOTEL

608
00:51:48,223 --> 00:51:53,479
URGENT: RECEPTIONIST WANTED
MISEONG MOTEL

609
00:52:00,611 --> 00:52:01,696
Hey, you! Sunglasses!

610
00:52:05,908 --> 00:52:08,119
Why aren't you taking my calls?

611
00:52:08,203 --> 00:52:09,287
What's your phone for?

612
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,296
Did the pair of glasses look like this?

613
00:52:38,734 --> 00:52:41,487
The glasses Seon-a was wearing.
Are these the ones?

614
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:45,158
What do these glasses make you see?

615
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,662
S line.

616
00:52:50,372 --> 00:52:51,581
S line?

617
00:53:30,163 --> 00:53:31,081
So you're saying

618
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:34,042
that someone took Seon-a's glasses,

619
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:37,463
called her to the school rooftop,
and then pushed her.

620
00:53:37,671 --> 00:53:40,466
she was threatening people
about their S lines.

621
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,843
Stupid virgin.

622
00:53:43,427 --> 00:53:44,553
Teacher

623
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,931
Do you have a girlfriend?

624
00:53:47,014 --> 00:53:48,266
I have had

625
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,936
many men as lovers in my life.

626
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,314
What exactly are those glasses?

627
00:53:54,939 --> 00:53:58,902
They show who people have had sex with.

628
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,862
Yet another gruesome murder took place

629
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,114
yesterday evening in Gangam-dong.

630
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,617
Could there be
more than one pair of the glasses?

631
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:07,786
The glasses might not be...

632
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:11,107
the only pair.

633
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,086
