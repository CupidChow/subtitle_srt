00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:46,321
SOCIAL

2
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:47,363
SEX

3
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,240
SECRET

4
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:52,077
SEX LINE

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,454
S LINE

6
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:58,625
RED LINES THAT CONNECT SEXUAL PARTNERS

7
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:03,880
So if

8
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:05,641
people have sex...

9
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:07,926
I mean...

10
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:12,904
If people have intercourse,
they are connected with a line.

11
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,193
And putting on these glasses
lets you see the lines?

12
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,622
You said you were
able to see them from birth?

13
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,045
Come on!

14
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:33,089
Stop joking around.

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,268
I know you high school kids are untamable

16
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:38,373
but I'm a detective.

17
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:39,875
Don't underestimate me.

18
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,286
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

19
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:45,651
Hey, wait.

20
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:49,880
I never said I didn't believe you.

21
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:53,448
So you're saying

22
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:57,001
that someone took Seon-a's glasses,

23
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:01,060
called her to the school rooftop,
and then pushed her.

24
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,302
Possibly.

25
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:05,977
Who? And why?

26
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,417
I don't know.

27
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,439
Seon-a isn't someone who'd kill herself...

28
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:16,800
but she was threatening people
about their S lines.

29
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:19,350
She had plenty of enemies.

30
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,303
Do you think it's possible

31
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,021
there's more than one pair of the glasses?

32
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:30,499
Recently, there's been a series of cases
similar to the one that happened

33
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:32,762
in the apartment above yours.

34
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:41,700
What am I even saying
to a high school kid?

35
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,982
Wait.

36
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:48,608
Do you see a blur of red everywhere then?

37
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,005
Yes.

38
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:51,948
More or less.

39
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,668
That explains the sunglasses.

40
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:01,216
It can't have been easy for you.

41
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:30,495
Seon-a.

42
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,460
Kang Seon-a.

43
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:47,304
What are you doing?

44
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:49,681
Stop sleeping in my class.

45
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:52,017
Let's concentrate, everyone.

46
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,145
So we have autosomes and sex chromosomes.

47
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:56,605
There's one pair of sex chromosomes

48
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:59,483
and the remaining 22 are autosomes.

49
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,485
Autosomes determine our...

50
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:02,903
Come on, run!

51
00:04:02,986 --> 00:04:03,821
Shoot!

52
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:06,824
Are you okay?

53
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,660
- Why?
- Well...

54
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:13,414
She cried out loud in class
when she woke up from her sleep earlier.

55
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,041
Listen.

56
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,252
It's all because you haven't
gotten enough sunshine.

57
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:20,838
Let's go somewhere nice this weekend.

58
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,215
- I can't.
- Why not?

59
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,342
You don't want to? Or you can't?

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,386
I have plans.

61
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,304
What plans?

62
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:32,850
I got a part-time job.

63
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,727
You did? What kind of job?

64
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:38,940
Stop pestering her.

65
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,192
She might not want to tell us.

66
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,031
It's at the Miseong Motel.

67
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:48,157
- Miseong Motel?
- Miseong Motel?

68
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,009
Ms. Kim Mi-seong.

69
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:53,329
Yes?

70
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,003
This was your second attempt.

71
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:02,797
How can you make the same mistakes?

72
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:08,136
You're driving me up the wall.

73
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:13,099
Do it over.

74
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:15,518
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,283
Stupid virgin.

76
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:02,232
They have the best nuggets there.

77
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,401
You should try their rolls too.

78
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:07,747
Where did you grow up, Mi-seong?

79
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:09,239
In Busan.

80
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,783
But you don't have an accent.

81
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:13,535
I tried hard to get rid of it.

82
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:15,996
Why?

83
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,374
Because I'm trying to get into acting.

84
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:25,172
To be an actress?

85
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:26,840
Yes.

86
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,970
I was approached
by a casting director once.

87
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,976
Is the music teacher seeing anyone?

88
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:45,359
Why? Are you interested?

89
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,569
He's cute.

90
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:48,988
- Should I ask him for you?
- Yes.

91
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:51,198
Do you think he's single?

92
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:52,992
Just finish your lunch.

93
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,806
MISEONG MOTEL

94
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,227
MISEONG MOTEL

95
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,701
RECEPTION

96
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:19,621
NO MINORS ALLOWED

97
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,919
Hi. Day room, please.

98
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:28,140
That will be 30,000 won.

99
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,391
Can't we go to a hotel instead?

100
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:33,302
We're only staying a couple of hours.

101
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,780
Thanks.

102
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,608
You always say
you'll take me to a nice place.

103
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:49,318
I'll take you to a hotel next time.

104
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,004
Seon-a's bully, Kim Hye-yeong...

105
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,422
pushed Seon-a from the roof and fled.

106
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,626
Except she's totally vanished.

107
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:09,004
No credit card or phone records.

108
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:11,082
Or...

109
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:13,217
the Korean teacher

110
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,720
pushed Seon-a from the roof

111
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:18,431
and killed himself
due to a guilty conscience.

112
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:21,350
That's the most probable scenario.

113
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:24,562
His cell phone signal was picked up
on the school premises.

114
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,858
Except the Korean teacher
was basically missing

115
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:30,902
until his dead body turned up.

116
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:33,863
And his family says
he had severe acrophobia,

117
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:36,491
making it impossible for him
to push someone off a roof.

118
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,494
If what they say is true.

119
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:44,582
Then who could it be?

120
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,794
Ji-uk.

121
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:53,925
Could Seon-a have...

122
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:57,929
KANG SEON-A

123
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:03,893
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

124
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:08,022
I'm not just being stubborn.
Something's bothering me.

125
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:08,940
GLASSES?

126
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,277
Seon-a changed
once she started wearing the glasses.

127
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:15,874
What exactly are those glasses?

128
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:22,412
Get this.

129
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:27,709
They show who people have had sex with.

130
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:30,754
Are you serious?

131
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:34,053
You think?

132
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:44,760
What are you guys doing here?

133
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,396
- Do you need a room for the night?
- Yes.

134
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,235
That'll be 60,000 won.

135
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,621
Ta-da!

136
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,253
How did you...

137
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,588
Friends come over
to see their friends at work.

138
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,341
You guys can't be here. You're underage.

139
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,027
Hey.

140
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,220
You are too.

141
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,349
Exactly. It's illegal.

142
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:25,064
I know.

143
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,853
Do you have any customers?

144
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,271
Can I go upstairs and look around?

145
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,731
- Hey!
- Wait!

146
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,691
Keep it down!

147
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,485
Guys, stop it.

148
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:41,322
It's so cramped here.

149
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,078
There's so little room.

150
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:46,317
Stop.

151
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,918
Why did you want to come inside, anyway?

152
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,003
It's fun.

153
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,256
It's thrilling.

154
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,027
A day room, please.

155
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,184
I'd like Room 206.

156
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,645
Did she come alone?

157
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm sure I know her from somewhere.

158
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,237
It's true.

159
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,990
I've had many men

160
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,242
as lovers in my life.

161
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:08,955
But...

162
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,251
ever since I saw you,

163
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,382
having sex with strangers

164
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:23,512
couldn't fulfill my empty heart.

165
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,142
I was afraid

166
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,270
that I could never...

167
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,983
have you.

168
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,500
I want to have sex!

169
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:53,918
You're crazy.

170
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:56,690
You don't even have a boyfriend.

171
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,884
Not now I don't,
but I had plenty in the past.

172
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,387
You mean the guys you stalked?

173
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,430
You're one to talk, mister virgin.

174
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:20,278
- What?
- I knew it.

175
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,280
- What?
- The woman who came in by herself.

176
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,253
She works in the school admin office.

177
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:27,465
You know, the one with the glasses.

178
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,704
Are you sure that's her?

179
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,123
She looks so different.

180
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:35,960
But she can't get past my sharp eye.

181
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:57,674
Keep it down, will you?

182
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,621
HWAGYEONG-DONG MARITICIDE CASE

183
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:58,283
She's Shin Hyeon-heup.

184
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,023
Her mom killed her dad
and ran away when she was a kid.

185
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:09,972
KILLED HER HUSBAND WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE

186
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,682
VICTIM WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL

187
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:17,313
THE SUSPECT LEARNED OF THE AFFAIR
WITH HER SISTER

188
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,399
SUSPECT'S CHILD HAD DRAWN IMAGINARY LINES
TO DEPICT THE SCENE OF AFFAIR

189
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,738
Am I being strung along by an insane girl?

190
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:47,314
SUSPECT'S CHILD HAD DRAWN IMAGINARY LINES
TO DEPICT THE SCENE OF AFFAIR

191
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,478
I have a few questions.

192
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,088
Does Seon-a...

193
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:06,915
also have S lines?

194
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,039
Isn't that Seon-a's privacy?

195
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,580
That would mean yes.

196
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:24,297
Is Seon-a's S line connected

197
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:28,802
to that boy in your class, Ji-won?

198
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,150
No.

199
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:37,123
I don't know who it's connected to.

200
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:40,230
But...

201
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:43,733
It's not someone in our class.

202
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:49,448
Jesus Christ.

203
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:56,163
Do you think the guy connected to her...

204
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:01,376
is the one who pushed her off the roof?

205
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:03,503
Well...

206
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:08,509
I'd say it's a possibility.

207
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,267
Yet another gruesome murder took place

208
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:20,020
yesterday evening in Gangam-dong.

209
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:23,565
The suspect was apprehended
not far from the crime scene,

210
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:27,027
but only after the victim passed.

211
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:30,781
The apprehended suspect
did not hide his smile

212
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:33,033
and said he was cleansed,

213
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:35,995
leading to assumptions of psychosis...

214
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:37,955
Could there be
more than one pair of the glasses?

215
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:40,040
The glasses might not be...

216
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,085
the only pair.

217
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:49,884
MUSIC ROOM

218
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:52,197
Sorry.

219
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:54,950
The music is so beautiful.

220
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:56,952
I couldn't help myself.

221
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,412
It must be nice,

222
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,791
knowing so much about music.

223
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,876
It doesn't do me any good.

224
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,130
I spend every day with high school kids.

225
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:11,758
You're Mi-seong, right?

226
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:18,348
- You remembered.
- I did.

227
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:26,398
Do you have any dreams?

228
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,115
Take a guess.

229
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,956
I have a feeling
you don't want to stay here.

230
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,250
An actress, maybe?

231
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:50,568
Did I get it right?

232
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,842
Yes. How did you know?

233
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,983
I figured you'd be good
at anything using your body.

234
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:58,280
You're right.

235
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,811
That's so uncanny.

236
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,053
I know I can be good.

237
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:06,420
It's something you're born with.

238
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:07,994
I guess.

239
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:34,313
Are you on your way home?

240
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:36,043
Yes.

241
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:38,057
Where's Gyeong-jin?

242
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:42,381
Something came up, so she left early.

243
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,179
By the way...

244
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:00,717
are you free today?

245
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,766
You seemed to like empty places.

246
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:25,781
How did you find this place?

247
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,484
I was on the swimming team in junior high.

248
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:30,976
I'm not anymore

249
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,305
but I'd come here sometimes to swim.

250
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,328
Do you know how to swim?

251
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:56,350
No.

252
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:51,450
Hey, are you okay?

253
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:01,435
Look at us.

254
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:23,633
HOT BOWL NOODLES

255
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,310
It's all ready. Let's dig in.

256
00:24:43,422 --> 00:24:44,119
It's good.

257
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:46,696
Are you sure we can eat here?

258
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,016
Yes, so long as we don't get caught.

259
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:51,430
If Gyeong-jin were here,

260
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:53,105
she'd have brought a portable stove.

261
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,794
By the way,

262
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,177
why'd you jump earlier?

263
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:24,729
It's okay if you
don't want to talk about it.

264
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,030
Sorry.

265
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:34,946
Ever since

266
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:37,759
I was little...

267
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:40,980
I can see these weird things.

268
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,290
I can see red lines

269
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,360
above people's heads.

270
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:55,706
Like this?

271
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,158
Yes.

272
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:02,806
Do I have one?

273
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:06,032
You don't.

274
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:10,299
It's the same for me

275
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:12,969
and Gyeong-jin.

276
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,366
Do you believe what I'm saying?

277
00:26:24,012 --> 00:26:25,452
- Yes.
- How come?

278
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,116
Why would you lie?

279
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:35,858
I'm weird, aren't I?

280
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:37,986
Yes.

281
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:40,249
You're not run-of-the-mill.

282
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:42,512
I knew it.

283
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:44,901
I think you're cool.

284
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,585
I'm far too ordinary.

285
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:54,116
No one would know
if I disappeared tomorrow.

286
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,874
If you were to,

287
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,944
at least Gyeong-jin and I would know.

288
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:06,868
I guess you're right.

289
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:43,335
I keep telling you. It's not me.

290
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,065
Do I look like a scammer,

291
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,268
Ms. Kang Su-min?

292
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:49,573
Hey.

293
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:51,718
It's been a while, Ji-uk.

294
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,530
It has been.

295
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,413
Why didn't you take my calls?
I missed you.

296
00:27:57,665 --> 00:27:58,333
Well...

297
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:02,452
I can't be seen talking to a criminal.

298
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:05,045
When was I not one?

299
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:08,264
You were just a suspect then.

300
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:12,545
Are you always this picky?

301
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:16,693
I'm done here, right? I'm free to go?

302
00:28:17,202 --> 00:28:17,870
Okay.

303
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,462
Take my calls.

304
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:27,913
Ji-uk, when did you...

305
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,666
Mind your own business.

306
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,330
LEE JI-WON

307
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:42,126
KANG SEON-A

308
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:44,218
BOYFRIEND?

309
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:50,301
Ji-uk.

310
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:53,039
Aren't you dating anyone these days?

311
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,371
When have I ever dated anyone?

312
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:00,624
Well, not technically,
but you always kept yourself busy.

313
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:03,765
I guess.

314
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:05,673
A hiatus, maybe?

315
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:15,773
There's someone I'm curious about.

316
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:18,000
But not in a sexual way.

317
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:20,070
No way. How come?

318
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:21,738
What do you mean?

319
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:24,459
Can I not be just curious about someone?

320
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:39,203
I'd like a day room.

321
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:41,781
Room 206, please.

322
00:30:09,344 --> 00:30:10,041
It's true.

323
00:30:10,882 --> 00:30:13,128
I've had many men as lovers in my life.

324
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:29,300
It's true.

325
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,672
I've had many men as lovers in my life.

326
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:36,958
It's true.

327
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:40,514
I've had many men as lovers in my life.

328
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,812
It's true.

329
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,611
I've had many men

330
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:51,523
as lovers in my life.

331
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:58,469
At first...

332
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,050
I was glad just to have enough space
to lay myself down.

333
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:08,128
I was confident I would become
a famous actress very soon.

334
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:11,927
But soon...

335
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:15,748
my ears started hurting.

336
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,224
It wasn't because I could hear
people from the other rooms.

337
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:23,781
The problem was me.

338
00:31:26,388 --> 00:31:27,375
I was afraid the noise

339
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:29,598
when I spoke and moved

340
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:32,517
would reach other people's ears.

341
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:36,345
It was the same at school.

342
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,032
I was scared someone would hear me

343
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:44,470
giggling every time I saw you.

344
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,815
That's when I found this place.

345
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:53,035
An old motel that was sure to have
no customers during the day.

346
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,828
I was free in this room.

347
00:31:58,576 --> 00:32:00,166
And one day, I found the glasses.

348
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:05,265
I was perfect
when I looked at myself through them.

349
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:16,576
And all of a sudden,

350
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:18,757
I became an observer.

351
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:25,120
This room is perfect.

352
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:28,982
A perfect world

353
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:31,625
for the perfect me.

354
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,072
Hey.

355
00:34:06,222 --> 00:34:07,636
Why a motel, out of nowhere?

356
00:34:08,194 --> 00:34:09,355
Just for old times' sake.

357
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:11,351
It is refreshing, I guess.

358
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,250
Didn't you miss me?

359
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,637
I can see you whenever on TV.

360
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,099
You're so funny.

361
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:15,257
Are you leaving?

362
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,141
How about the same time tomorrow?

363
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:38,263
JOON-SEON: AT MISEONG MOTEL TONIGHT?
YES, I'M WORKING NOW.

364
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:56,061
CAN I COME SEE YOU?

365
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:03,946
I'd like to stay longer.

366
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:06,502
Which room?

367
00:37:07,345 --> 00:37:08,135
Room 206.

368
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,067
What do you think? Does it suit me?

369
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:02,254
- Hey.
- Hello.

370
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:04,328
You're here early.

371
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:09,335
Mi-seong?

372
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:13,638
Wait.

373
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:15,791
This music...

374
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:20,244
We listened to it together, didn't we?

375
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:26,430
How did you know I was here?

376
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:34,874
You see...

377
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:39,292
I have a confession to make.

378
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,791
What?

379
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,306
I have had

380
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:47,310
many men

381
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:49,818
as lovers in my life.

382
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:51,444
What are you talking about?

383
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:53,060
It's true.

384
00:39:55,014 --> 00:39:56,274
I've had many men

385
00:39:57,523 --> 00:39:58,568
as lovers in my life.

386
00:39:59,001 --> 00:39:59,698
But...

387
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,886
ever since I saw you,

388
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:07,733
having sex with strangers

389
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:10,450
couldn't fulfill my empty heart.

390
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:16,270
I was afraid

391
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:19,930
that I could never...

392
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:23,285
have you.

393
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:26,547
You're deranged.

394
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:35,730
You're out of your mind.

395
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,465
It's true.

396
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:39,111
I've had many men as lovers in my life.

397
00:40:44,947 --> 00:40:46,291
Did you just throw this at me?

398
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:47,705
Yes.

399
00:40:51,913 --> 00:40:52,959
Oh, God.

400
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:56,384
What's happening?

401
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:59,501
I don't feel so good.

402
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:17,165
I spiked your water earlier.

403
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:20,134
You'll be better in a while.

404
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:44,788
It's true.

405
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,161
I've had many men

406
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:50,817
as lovers in my life.

407
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,697
But ever since I saw you,

408
00:42:57,606 --> 00:43:00,121
having sex with strangers

409
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:04,653
couldn't fulfill my empty heart.

410
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:34,380
No, no!

411
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,797
Oh, no.

412
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:37,918
Please...

413
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:22,496
It's true.

414
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:26,459
I've had many men...

415
00:44:29,388 --> 00:44:30,997
as lovers in my life.

416
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:13,604
- Are you okay?
- Fucking hell!

417
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,928
Some crazy bitch beat me up

418
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:19,132
and stole my clothes.

419
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,792
Where is she? That fucking bitch!

420
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:27,001
It hurts. Please, call the police.

421
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:09,365
Did you find any glasses at the scene?

422
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:10,849
No.

423
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:24,329
Did you see those people's S lines?

424
00:46:27,832 --> 00:46:29,997
The admin officer always had just one.

425
00:46:31,582 --> 00:46:34,166
But it wasn't connected
to the music teacher.

426
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,169
Why the hell would anyone
do something like this?

427
00:46:41,121 --> 00:46:42,218
I don't know.

428
00:46:43,674 --> 00:46:45,116
And I probably never will.

429
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:03,595
Do you think this case has
something to do with the glasses too?

430
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:06,536
I think...

431
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:10,756
the glasses she was
always wearing at school

432
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,767
are the ones we've been looking for.

433
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:17,779
Every time she came here,

434
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,264
she looked
completely different from school.

435
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:25,058
She probably thought she was special

436
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:29,916
after she started wearing the glasses.

437
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,692
Detective.

438
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:40,676
No one's an exception.

439
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:44,092
That's why the glasses are dangerous.

440
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:11,320
KANG SEON-A

441
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:18,374
Detective.

442
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,078
No one's an exception.

443
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:24,551
That's why the glasses are dangerous.

444
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,561
I was going to tell you first.

445
00:51:06,423 --> 00:51:07,062
Give them here.

446
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:08,982
As soon as I put these glasses on,

447
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:12,700
I realized you were telling the truth
and got goosebumps all over.

448
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,769
I don't trust you.

449
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:17,123
Get rid of the glasses now.

450
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:19,412
I think there's a sexual assault case
against a minor.

451
00:51:20,462 --> 00:51:22,234
Had you had sexual intercourse

452
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:23,605
No.

453
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:25,615
Why is she lying?

454
00:51:26,656 --> 00:51:29,081
There seem to be a lot of
school-related cases recently.

455
00:51:30,938 --> 00:51:31,634
Detective.

456
00:51:32,245 --> 00:51:33,271
A virgin?

457
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,374
You're wearing new glasses.

458
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:37,765
Would you like to have dinner
with me sometime?

459
00:51:37,852 --> 00:51:38,490
Sorry?

460
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,525
lines bnla bla
