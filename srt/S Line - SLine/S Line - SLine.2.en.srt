- You got this.
- Hurry, Teach. We're going to be late.

17
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:05,658
Let's go!

18
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:07,146
Teach, we're going to go on ahead!

19
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,347
See you in a bit!

20
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:12,362
Kids, be careful. Don't get hurt.

21
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm late.

22
00:01:26,777 --> 00:01:27,948
Miss.

23
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:29,241
Here.

24
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,576
Silly me. How could I forget?

25
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,591
Thanks, Jun-seon.

26
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:38,376
Wait.

27
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,794
Hey, Prez.

28
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:41,504
What's for lunch today?

29
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,089
How would I know?

30
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,423
And also,

31
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:47,093
we're not even in the same class,
why do you keep calling me "Prez"?

32
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,010
Who cares?

33
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,346
You've been the class president
every year since middle school.

34
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,181
So, what's for lunch today?

35
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,016
Ugh, so annoying.

36
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:56,769
What? Tell me.

37
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:57,770
I don't know.

38
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,701
Tell me.

39
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:02,817
Dude, this guy's seriously messed
in the head, you know?

40
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:03,776
Get lost, you idiot.

41
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:05,152
You too, get lost, jerk.

42
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:06,737
Why the hell are you
starting this shit again?

43
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:08,752
Dude, what's your problem?

44
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:10,950
So pretty.

45
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,284
Hey.

46
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:14,078
Where should we go this weekend?

47
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:15,801
Wherever you want to go.

48
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:17,928
Okay.

49
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:35,975
Last year, 5.9% of adolescents experienced

50
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,906
sexual relations.

51
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:42,273
According to Statistics Korea,
3,096,947 people fall

52
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:46,832
under the adolescent demographic.

53
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,697
That would mean
at least 170,000 of them have experienced

54
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:52,003
sexual relations.

55
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,509
Only 170 thousand?

Hey, you drew her too pretty.

62
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:28,683
Make her look more like a loser.

63
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,983
THE CRAZIEST BITCH OF THE CENTURY

64
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:48,536
Seon-a is pissed. Oh, no.

65
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,421
"Dear Ji-won."

66
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:00,953
"Hey..."

67
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,289
"I'm sure you don't know who I am,"

68
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,762
"but I've liked you for a long time"

69
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:29,440
Hey, kids.

70
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,454
Kids.

71
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,040
Seon-a.

72
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:19,627
Even so, violence isn't the answer.

73
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,034
When you start the attack,

74
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,799
it makes it difficult for me
to take your side.

75
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:29,346
I'm going to kill her.

76
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,222
What?

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,505
Miss.

78
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:36,895
I'd like to go home now.

00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,897
Ji-uk, that was really screwed up.

82
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:25,110
What do you mean? What now?

83
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:29,518
You sent me off into that bastard's place
and took forever to get back.

84
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:31,311
I almost died in there.

85
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:34,398
I swear it was an emergency. I'm sorry.

86
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,330
It looks like I have to write
an official apology for shooting my gun.

87
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:42,001
If you shoot to save someone,
you have to write an apology.

88
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,783
If you don't and protect
the rights of the criminal,

89
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,535
the press eats you alive.

90
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,092
Either way, it feels like crap.

91
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:52,750
Then, why are you looking at that again?

92
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,472
We already caught the culprit.

93
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:58,380
Something's sketchy.

94
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,465
What?

95
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,300
I just don't understand
why he killed them at all.

96
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,512
He had relations with all those women.

97
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:10,058
He was probably another crazy bastard
who suffered from an inferiority complex.

98
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:12,311
He has a history
of dating violence on his record.

99
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,146
That's why he worked at a private academy
after leaving that high school.

100
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,606
That happened last year.

101
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,287
Why did he have to do this now?

102
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,958
Because it's hot?

103
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,657
This punk kept going on
about salvation or whatever.

104
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,242
Are you sure he's not religious?

105
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:29,411
Yes, according to the people who knew him,

106
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,914
he actually kept
his distance from religion.

107
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:34,625
A religious math teacher.

108
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:37,169
It just doesn't sound right.

What in the world is this?

113
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,674
Seon-a, did you eat?

114
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,607
Hey, where are you going this late?

115
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,363
What the...

116
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,784
What is all this?

117
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:05,377
Seon-a.

118
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:07,725
Hurry up and get in. I'll drop you off.

119
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,361
Unbelievable.

120
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,128
Hurry up.

121
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,202
I'm so tired of getting kimchi stew
all the time.

122
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:40,370
It's kimchi stew every day.

123
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,926
Hurry up.

124
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:52,437
What the? She's a virgin?

125
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:07,535
The one that finishes lunch last...

126
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:09,787
That whore.

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,041
Quiet down.

130
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,824
We have a new student
joining our class today.

131
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,422
Her name is Shin Hyeon-heup.

132
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,634
Hyeon-heup, do you want
to introduce yourself?

133
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:25,767
Then, I hope you get along
with your classmates.

134
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:29,116
If you have any questions, you can
ask Jun-seon, the class president.

135
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,065
You can take that empty desk there.

136
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:34,038
Go on.

137
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:39,072
Everyone should
get ready for fifth period.

138
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:41,158
Yes, Miss.

139
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:42,701
Why can't she talk?

140
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,465
Is she dumb?

Sorry

146
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,895
Why are you in such a rush?

147
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:53,409
It's nothing.

148
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:55,607
Wanna catch up after work?

149
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,580
Sure, hit me up.

Can I help you with something?

152
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:37,816
I'm Detective Han Ji-uk
from Bangju Police Station.

153
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,039
I just had a few questions.

154
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:43,292
You're Seon-a's father, aren't you?

155
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:47,463
Not dad, but uncle.

156
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:52,176
No wonder. You do look young.

157
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:58,169
Seon-a has been having
a difficult time recently.

158
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:00,226
I'm sure you're aware of it?

159
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:04,730
I was busy lately, so...

160
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,931
I'm sorry,
I didn't take good care of her.

161
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:12,154
It's okay.

162
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:15,437
But I'm not here because of Seon-a today.

163
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:18,231
I'm here investigating a murder case.

164
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:19,399
A murder case?

165
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:22,902
Yes. I'm sure you're aware
that a serial killer was caught recently

166
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:24,779
at Wanseong Apartments.

167
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,867
I unfortunately don't live in this town.

168
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,995
Then, are you familiar with the name,
Mr. Oh Jeong-min?

169
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:34,539
He was a math teacher here
up until last year.

170
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,929
Yes, I do know Mr. Oh.

171
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,433
No way.

172
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,840
Are you saying Mr. Oh is dead?

173
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,801
Yes. Not as a victim, as the assailant.

174
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:49,275
My goodness.

175
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,195
Are you saying Mr. Oh killed people?

176
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:58,521
So, the thing is...
it might sound a bit strange,

177
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:02,705
but did Mr. Oh always wear glasses?

178
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,195
Glasses?

179
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,917
Yes.

180
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:08,961
I'm not sure.

181
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:13,215
I've never seen him wear them.

182
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:40,939
Have you lost your mind?

183
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,358
I don't have any money to give you.

184
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:45,164
Stop bothering me.

185
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:46,778
What's this?

186
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,709
Are you being reckless now?

187
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,492
Shit. Did you run out of things
to be embarrassed about?

188
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:55,203
It's time for you to be embarrassed now.

189
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:56,884
What?

190
00:18:57,494 --> 00:18:59,386
Why would I be embarrassed?

191
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,002
Tell me.

192
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,017
Why would I be embarrassed?

193
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,148
Stop it.

194
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:17,446
What's this now?

195
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,577
Are you two part of a duo?

196
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:42,876
What the fuck is this?
Do you want to jump or something?

197
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:46,058
No. We should both jump.

198
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:54,859
Let go of me!

199
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,986
Someone, help me. Fuck!

200
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,434
Promise me.

201
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,102
Promise you won't bother either one of us.

202
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:02,437
Fine.

203
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,326
Let go of me!

204
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,217
Crazy bitch.

205
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,470
Hye-yeong, are you okay?

206
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,297
Why are you meddling?

207
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,270
Did I ask you for help?

208
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:37,055
Are you still mad at me?

209
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,153
Why would I be mad at you?

210
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:42,406
Just mind your own business.

211
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:52,541
Come on. Let's go.

212
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:04,040
Do you want to go see Seon-a
before you go?

213
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,180
She should be done with class soon.

214
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:12,061
No. She'd freak out
if she knew I was here.

215
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:17,887
Then, I guess I'll reach out
if I remember anything.

216
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,568
Okay.

217
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:22,613
But...

218
00:21:23,222 --> 00:21:25,616
- Your...
- Yes?

219
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,412
Oh.

220
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:32,790
Why is this...

221
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:15,416
What the? Why was he here?

222
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,887
Excuse me.

223
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,728
I heard this man was a regular here.
Do you remember seeing him?

224
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:40,316
Yes. What is this regarding?

225
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:45,683
I'm Detective Han Ji-uk
from Bangju Police Station.

226
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,740
I'm in the middle of an investigation.

227
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:52,690
He was a regular here.

228
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,955
Although he hasn't been around recently.

229
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:57,624
Was there anything strange about him?

230
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:03,743
I'm not sure. He always came alone
and quietly drank by himself.

231
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:08,635
But I did notice he started talking
to himself a lot at some point.

232
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:11,125
I thought he was just drunk,

233
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:13,891
but he was perfectly fine when he left.

234
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,672
He talked to himself?

235
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:18,395
He just kept saying numbers.

236
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:20,468
I mean... he was

237
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:27,279
just counting numbers like,
"One, two, three."

238
00:23:28,014 --> 00:23:30,645
Then, eventually, he ended up fighting
with another customer...

239
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:38,957
Twenty-five. Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven. Shoot. Again.

240
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:49,093
One, two...

241
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:52,054
That guy seems a bit strange.

242
00:23:57,251 --> 00:23:59,019
Excuse me.

243
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:01,355
Do you have something to say to me?

244
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:12,145
Wow. So damn many.

245
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:14,201
What are you saying?

246
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:16,787
Have you lost your damn mind?

247
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:26,255
Oh, and I think he wore glasses.

248
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:35,097
Thank you.

249
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:45,023
I can't believe there are still people
who carry around notebooks.

250
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:49,820
It's cute.

251
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,823
Wait.

252
00:24:57,436 --> 00:24:59,496
What's so cute about notebooks?

253
00:25:34,348 --> 00:25:36,729
But why did you pretend like
you didn't know me at school?

254
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,578
How could I with all those kids around?

255

KANG SEON-A: ATTACHMENT 1 IMAGE

257
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,518
This crazy bitch.

258
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:47,020
What's wrong?

259
00:26:49,548 --> 00:26:51,095
It's nothing.

260
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,514
I've been so tired lately,

261
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:55,474
my skin is a mess, isn't it?

262
00:26:55,554 --> 00:26:58,115
Is it? No, it's not.

263
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:00,242
Teach.

264
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:03,704
What would you do
if someone found out about us?

265
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:05,998
I'm not sure. What do you think?

266
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:10,948
Maybe, I'll run away with you!

267
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:12,754
What should I do?

MISEONG MOTEL

269
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:25,058
It seems like you forgot we're minors.

270
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:28,687
He'll be punished
but not me, you dumb bitch.

271
00:27:55,031 --> 00:27:57,328
Did you see the news yesterday?

272
00:27:57,408 --> 00:28:01,470
A female teacher from Jeongil High
was caught sleeping with a student.

273
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:05,544
The world is really going to hell.
The teacher is definitely an issue,

274
00:28:05,624 --> 00:28:08,769
but I honestly don't know
what kids are thinking nowadays.

275
00:28:10,963 --> 00:28:14,762
Since you're pretty, aren't there guys
hitting on you all the time, teacher?

276
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:17,694
Don't say that. How vulgar.

277
00:28:18,804 --> 00:28:22,144
Sir, that's sexual harassment.

278
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:24,493
Oh, is it?

279
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,565
I apologize.

280
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:28,455
It's okay.

281
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:31,237
It's fine if it's about a man, right?

282
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:34,169
Our Korean teacher is
quite a looker as well.

283
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:39,424
Be careful. Don't get yourself
mixed up with a weirdo and dragged down.

284
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:44,554
As if they'd ever be interested
in an old man like me.

285
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:50,894

Aren't you going to class, teacher?

288
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:19,423
Yeah, I should go.

289
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:32,131
PREPARE 20 MILLION WON

290
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:35,897
Will 20 million won be
enough for a deposit?

291
00:29:36,423 --> 00:29:38,316
I'm not sure.

292
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:43,780
I just want to escape
from this godforsaken place.

293
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,980
Are you trying to move out? Why?

294
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,483
I don't know.
I'm just sick of all of it.

295
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:55,488
This apartment,
this town, the people in it...

296
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:59,533
It's not like I have a family.
I'll have to live on my own eventually.

297
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:01,410
Isn't that detective your family?

298
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,538
Hey, how can an uncle be a family?

299
00:30:04,618 --> 00:30:07,888
That man doesn't care about me anyway.

300
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:12,129
But at least, you have someone.

301
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:15,937
What about you? Do you think
your mom is still alive?

302
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:20,805
I don't know.

303
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:25,572
Then again, she would've reached out
if she were still alive.

304
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:05,307
Mom, Dad called me a pig again.

305
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:08,657
Jeez, why are you fighting
over every meal?

306
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,708
Hey, Hye-yeong.

307
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,793
Are you going
to continue sleeping in class

308
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:35,684
and leaving to go to the bathroom? Well?

309
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:39,145
Your behavior is rotten to the core.

310
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:44,067
What are you trying to do here?

311
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:07,507
What was that earlier?

312
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,051
Were you just out to get me?

313
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:18,339
Do you know anything?
Is someone threatening you?

314
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:23,385
Oh, you got the pic.
That was from Kang Seon-a.

315
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:25,108
Kang Seon-a?

316
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:28,028
The Kang Seon-a in your class?

317
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,267
How does she know about us?
Did you tell her?

318
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:32,645
How would I know?

319
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:35,564
I'm a victim, too.
Don't take it out on me. This is bullshit.

320
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:37,662
Kim Hye-yeong!

321
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:42,667
Your way of talking to the teacher,
what's up with that?

322
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,535
Teacher. I sincerely apologize.

323
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:51,927
I should get to class now.

324
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:54,638
Asshole.

325
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:57,474
How could Kang Seon-a...

326
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:10,236
But seriously, how did she find out?

327
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:46,940
What picture? Where was it taken?

328
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:53,154
I told you to be careful!

329
00:34:08,695 --> 00:34:10,242
What do you think you're doing?

330
00:34:10,322 --> 00:34:10,868
What?

331
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,163
"What?" How can you say that right now?

332
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:17,178
You're going to break up with me
to hang out with that bitch?

333
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:18,751
Oh, were we dating?

334
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:20,515
Hey!

335
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,015
Are you saying I told someone?

336
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:34,975
You did.
That's why I received these photos.

337
00:34:35,055 --> 00:34:37,853
Why would I? You must have.

338
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:39,646
You must have thought it to mention it.

339
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:40,689
Are you sure you didn't say anything?

340
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,483
Lower your voice. We're at school.

341
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:44,526
Did you get drunk
and go around telling people?

342
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:45,957
Have you lost your mind?

343
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:58,303
Those glasses...

344
00:34:58,704 --> 00:35:00,221
What?

345
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:02,795
Did you always wear them?

346
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:06,561
My eyes have gone bad.

347
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:14,736
What are you doing? Give them back.

348
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:19,144
You can see something
with these on, can't you?

349
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:22,494
What are you talking about?

350
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,872
Red lines.

351
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:33,338
Can you see them, too?

352
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:39,969
Then, how many lines do I have on my head?

353
00:35:42,164 --> 00:35:43,765
One.

354
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,714
Choi Da-hye has five.

355
00:35:47,794 --> 00:35:50,759
Kim Hye-yeong has two,
one with the Korean teacher.

356
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,344
Choi I-seul has over ten.

357
00:35:52,424 --> 00:35:55,527
The gym teacher is having an affair.
Shall I continue?

358
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,863
How?

359
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,575
Where did you get these glasses from?

360
00:36:03,852 --> 00:36:05,703
I just found them.

361
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:13,253
That's the truth.
They were in my locker.

362
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,040
Give them back.

363
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,625
These are dangerous.

364
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:25,794
How can glasses be dangerous?

365
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:28,797
You know what happened
to your neighbor recently, right?

366
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:31,133
That man was wearing these glasses.

367
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:32,981
He saw the S lines.

368
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:39,237
S lines?
Oh, so that's what they're called.

369
00:36:40,138 --> 00:36:41,739
So what?

370
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:47,370
I couldn't care less about who made them

371
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,747
or who it originally belonged to

372
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:53,501
These are mine.

373
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:03,136
Hey, Teach.

374
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:04,971
Yes?

375
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:08,128
You have a Seon-a in your class,
don't you? A Kang Seon-a?

376
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,101
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

377
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,925
What's she like?

378
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,511
She hasn't been behaving
in my class recently...

379
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:17,483
Oh, really?

380
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:20,933
She hasn't had any issues recently.

381
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:22,726
Do you want me to talk to her?

382
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:24,520
Oh, really?

383
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,189
No, it's fine. I'll try talking to her.

384
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:28,870
Okay.

385
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:40,953
You're looking at my S line, aren't you?

386
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,634
I'm not.

387
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:48,973
But do you know how to get rid of them?

388
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,693
Not sure.

389
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:06,115
Maybe the partner just needs to die?

390
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,818
Are you going to hold onto those glasses?

391
00:38:12,898 --> 00:38:16,029
Of course.

392
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:18,753
I'm going to show them
how pitiful they really are.

393
00:38:41,426 --> 00:38:44,862
PREPARE 20 MILLION WON

394
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,975
Is it your first time?

395
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,895
No.

396
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:23,192
Are you okay?

397
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:39,363
I HAVE THE 20 MILLION WON.
MEET ME ON THE SCHOOL ROOFTOP AT MIDNIGHT.

398
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,085
Who is it?

399
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:44,743
My financier.

400
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:46,674
Where do you want to go?

401
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:49,844
What?

402
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,721
What about coin karaoke?

403
00:39:57,127 --> 00:40:05,485
PHOTO BOOTH

404
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:09,476
What are you doing?

405
00:40:09,556 --> 00:40:10,811
That's not going to work.

406
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:12,950
Let's check out over there.

407
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:27,536
What's that?

408
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:29,371
They're mine.

409
00:40:29,451 --> 00:40:33,721
So you should just keep
your mouth shut, too.

410
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:15,805
What's with that face?

411
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:18,099
The ones on top came out really nice.

412
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:27,066
Damn it!

413
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:30,265
What's wrong?

414
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:31,946
What the?

415
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:40,955
Excuse me, did you find
a pair of glasses over there, by chance?

416
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:18,271
Hello?

417
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:20,774
It's you, isn't it? You took them!

418
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:21,775
What are you talking about?

419
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:24,820
My glasses! They're gone!

420
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,823
Glasses? What are you talking about?

421
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:29,115
Damn it. I'm late.

422
00:42:29,195 --> 00:42:30,784
Where are you right now?

423
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:34,467
I have to get to school right now.
I'll talk to you later.

424
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:38,166
School? Why are you going
to school at this hour?

425
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:41,182
Hello? Hey!

426
00:42:50,592 --> 00:42:52,485
BANGJU HIGH SCHOOL

427
00:43:16,618 --> 00:43:19,595
I haven't been on the roof in a while.

428
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:24,725
But how did you know it was me?

429
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:30,398
Oh. Hye-yeong must have told you.

430
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:34,264
Nobody saw you come up here, right?

431
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:37,225
What's the point of asking that?

432
00:43:37,305 --> 00:43:38,948
Where's the money?

433
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:41,784
You shouldn't live your life like that.

434
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:46,902
All of a sudden?

435
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:50,459
Then, should I be more like you?

436
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:53,617
You were an outcast anyway, right?

437
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,298
Not anymore.

438
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:05,170
Please, Seon-a. I have a child.
My second will be born soon.

439
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,298
What will my family do
if I get fired from here?

440
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:11,718
And where would I suddenly get
20 million from on a teacher's salary?

441
00:44:11,798 --> 00:44:14,012
You people all knew
that I was getting bullied,

442
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:19,309
by Kim Hye-yeong and Choi I-seul.

443
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:21,782
But, you guys just ignored it.

444
00:44:22,976 --> 00:44:24,272
All because of Choi I-seul's parents.

445
00:44:24,352 --> 00:44:29,110
Seon-a, let me apologize to you
on behalf of everyone. I mean it.

446
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,916
Don't be ridiculous.

447
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:36,672
Seon-a, then how about this?

448
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:39,120
Let's just delete
that photo on your phone first.

449
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,137
Then, I'll get you that money
some way, somehow tomorrow.

450
00:44:57,177 --> 00:44:58,306
WIFE

451
00:44:58,386 --> 00:44:59,975
EXPLAIN THIS.

452
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:04,283
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

453
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,418
You sent it?

454
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:20,203
You sent it already?

455
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:22,051
What are you talking about?

456
00:45:23,078 --> 00:45:24,833
Why?

457
00:45:24,913 --> 00:45:26,681
Why?

458
00:46:34,566 --> 00:46:36,375
Seon-a.

459
00:47:09,758 --> 00:47:11,247
You must be looking for evidence.

460
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:12,902
Who are you?

461
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:15,559
I'm Lee Gyeong-jin from Class 5.

462
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:17,657
So you think it was a suicide attempt?

463
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:22,245
Do you happen to know who these belong to?

464
00:47:22,604 --> 00:47:25,206
Try them on. I bet they suit you.

465
00:47:29,695 --> 00:47:33,410
I heard you almost got married.
What happened?

466
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,245
not long before the wedding,

467
00:47:35,325 --> 00:47:37,873
saw her in bed with my friend.

468
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:39,666
Having it happen before the wedding

469
00:47:39,746 --> 00:47:43,016
is the best luck you can get.

470
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:45,130
If you found out

471
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,438
someone you knew was having an affair,

472
00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:50,398
what would you do?

473
00:47:50,841 --> 00:47:53,972
I'd let everybody know

474
00:47:54,052 --> 00:47:56,404
and let all hell break loose.

475
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:04,037
RED LINES THAT CONNECT SEXUAL PARTNERS
