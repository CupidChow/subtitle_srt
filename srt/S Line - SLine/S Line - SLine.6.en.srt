1
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,251
Here's the Americano you ordered.

2
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,427
Enjoy.

3
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:54,228
Sorry.

4
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:55,644
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:37,239
HAN EUN-JI SENT YOU A VIDEO

6
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,617
HAN EUN-JI:
JUN-HUI, IS THIS YOU? OH MY GOD...

7
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:01,815
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
ARE YOU IGNORING ME?

8
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,976
REPORTING ME WON'T GET RID OF THE VIDEOS

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,455
IT'S OVER FOR YOU, YOU SLUT

10
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,214
Sorry.

11
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:43,023
We've closed for the day.
I'll give you your order to go.

12
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,381
Sorry.

13
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:49,384
I think

14
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,092
you dropped these earlier.

15
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,686
They aren't mine.

16
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:01,273
I'll leave them here

17
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,289
since I found them here.

18
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,210
SOCIAL

19
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:45,250
SEX

20
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:47,223
SECRET

21
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,833
SEX LINE

22
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,353
S LINE

23
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:57,075
RED LINES THAT CONNECT SEXUAL PARTNERS

24
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,907
I'm late, aren't I?

25
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:21,960
Is something wrong?

26
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,137
Oh, I almost forgot.

27
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:29,113
Happy birthday.
It's before midnight, but still.

28
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,894
I was going to throw you an awesome party.

29
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:39,209
I want to...

30
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,764
ask you a favor.

31
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:45,782
What is it?

32
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,434
You can say no if you want.

33
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,803
I'm not sure

34
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,307
if this is okay.

35
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,915
I don't want to push you into anything.

36
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:43,525
I just...

37
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:47,543
If I were ever to be with someone,

38
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:52,134
I wanted it to be you.

39
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,444
I have a question.

40
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,342
What is it?

41
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,116
Do you like me?

42
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:14,765
Yes.

43
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,750
Oh, no.

44
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:27,203
I don't have... that.

45
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:42,168
You mean this?

46
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:50,882
It's amazing.

47
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,178
It is.

48
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:25,000
What's wrong?

49
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,491
Nothing.

50
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:32,218
Are you hungry?
Should we get something to eat?

51
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:33,913
Sure.

52
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:38,320
Except the last bus home
is going to be here soon.

53
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,954
Well...

54
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:43,666
Wait here for a minute.

55
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,793
Okay.

56
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:21,456
I've always thought of myself
as a cursed child.

57
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:25,122
A kid who let her parents die.

58
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,818
I wanted to change.

59
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,311
But...

60
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:36,075
I couldn't.

61
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:40,834
I'm cursed.

62
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,885
Anyone close to me

63
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,244
will die.

64
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:40,450
UNKNOWN NUMBER

65
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:44,078
HAPPY SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY!

66
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:49,906
YOU ARE INVITED TO THE ROOM OF BOUNDARIES.

67
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,407
Detective...

68
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:04,006
I need your help.

69
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,299
Did you really not know

70
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:20,517
about Seon-a's S line?

71
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:26,594
If I had known,

72
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:29,962
I would have told you.

73
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:44,057
I always get

74
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,379
a birthday card

75
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:51,365
on my birthday.

76
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:55,359
There's no one to send me one.

77
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:59,609
I thought it was my mom at first,

78
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,306
but then I realized

79
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,911
someone was counting down the days
until my birthday.

80
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:16,349
Someday, I would be required
to do something.

81
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:21,721
And...

82
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:27,606
I think today is that day.

83
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,281
HAPPY SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY!

84
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:43,182
YOU ARE INVITED TO THE ROOM OF BOUNDARIES.

85
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:49,620
They lured you to the school,

86
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,043
gave me these glasses,

87
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,953
and Seon-a...

88
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:07,720
You're saying it's the same person?

89
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,948
A HAPPY AND WISE SCHOOL LIFE FOR EVERYONE

90
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,316
Will there be anyone at school
so late at night?

91
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,490
I ran a background check
on your homeroom teacher,

92
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:39,675
but nothing came up.

93
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,097
Lee Gyu-jin doesn't exist.

94
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,805
Going to the school premises
and looking for--

95
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:47,131
Detective, over there!

96
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,165
Hey, Sunglasses!

97
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,459
I almost died.

98
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,354
What happened? Who did this?

99
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,052
You told me to come to school.

100
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,686
But I can't remember after that...

101
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:56,608
Did something happen to you?

102
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:00,827
No time for that.

103
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:02,676
What?

104
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,187
We need to get out of here.

105
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:06,381
I came with Detective Han.

106
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,177
Detective.

107
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:27,327
Detective!

108
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:30,802
Come on.

109
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:35,813
What the hell?

110
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:50,159
Wait, didn't we just come downstairs?

111
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,249
Christ. Let's go.

112
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,725
What's happening?
Why are we still on the same floor?

113
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:12,830
Help us!

114
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,133
I think

115
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:19,264
we're trapped in here.

116
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:21,902
Trapped?

117
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:24,344
What do you mean?

118
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,882
NO ENTRY

119
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,041
The roof.

120
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:52,529
What?

121
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:57,576
There's nobody here.

122
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:09,023
Hello?

123
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:14,447
Anyone here?

124
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,122
The fact I met her

125
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,520
was a stroke of sheer luck.

126
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:56,742
I think

127
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,950
you dropped these earlier.

128
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,745
Did you give me these on purpose?

129
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:16,606
How do you feel right now?

130
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:18,711
What?

131
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:22,116
Do you still want to die?

132
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,390
Or...

133
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:30,129
Do you want to kill?

134
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,200
I don't understand.

135
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:37,774
The lines above people's heads.

136
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,154
You know what they mean, don't you?

137
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:44,879
Don't you want to get rid of them?

138
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,950
The red lines.

139
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,204
Others will be able to see
the world you see with these glasses.

140
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:56,835
It won't be long.

141
00:21:56,904 --> 00:21:58,582
And no one will need glasses.

142
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,876
Aren't you excited to find out
what people will do

143
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:08,238
when that day comes?

144
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,417
For some,
it'll be a conspicuous weak point,

145
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,139
and others will try to use that.

146
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,701
Which is why

147
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:21,907
I came

148
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,289
to help you, Jun-hui.

149
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,345
After that,

150
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,871
I found a new purpose in life.

151
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,634
I am now ready

152
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,806
to sever my last sin from myself.

153
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,078
On the day the world turns red,

154
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,066
we will all

155
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:27,747
be born again!

156
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,252
Please...

157
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:37,175
I'm sorry.

158
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,329
Don't do this.

159
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,659
You know how much I love...

160
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:18,577
Gyeong-jin.

161
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:26,206
There's something I haven't told you.

162
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:31,855
I could see strange things

163
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,251
ever since I was little.

164
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:38,449
Are you calling this...

165
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:43,052
strange?

166
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,163
I think it's awesome.

167
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,854
Where did you get those?

168
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:02,872
- Take them off--
- No.

169
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:07,223
By the way...

170
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:11,891
I heard S lines will be visible
even without glasses if you die.

171
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,382
Is it true?

172
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:17,178
What?

173
00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:20,229
That's what our homeroom teacher said.

174
00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:22,687
Our homeroom teacher?

175
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,295
Lee Gyu-jin.

176
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,033
Father.

177
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:21,313
Don't you want to save Seon-a?

178
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,544
No!

179
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:39,739
Put the knife down.

180
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:43,263
I said, put it down!

181
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:54,743
Detective.

182
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,072
How was the world with the glasses on?

183
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:00,840
Wasn't it beautiful?

184
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,343
It won't be long

185
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:09,736
until the whole world is bathed in red.

186
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,439
Regular human beings cannot kill me.

187
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,857
Was it you
that pushed Seon-a off the roof?

188
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,839
If Seon-a weren't at the hospital,

189
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:35,671
would you have even cared
to give her a glance?

190
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,815
I gave you an opportunity.

191
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:55,887
Die!

192
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:03,926
No!

193
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,502
Where am I?

194
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:35,022
Your face...

195
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:40,513
Why have your eyes changed color?

196
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:36,244
Stop it!

197
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:58,258
Why are you doing this?

198
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:10,260
Haven't you always wondered

199
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:15,755
why you were able to see
the red lines from birth?

200
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:19,882
It was all for today, Hyeon-heup.

201
00:32:21,634 --> 00:32:23,216
You're not cursed,

202
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:26,088
but a present and blessing.

203
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,693
That's a lie.

204
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,460
People killing each other,

205
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,793
having my friends and family die...

206
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:41,343
Knowing what I've been through,

207
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:46,308
how can you say
seeing S lines is a blessing?

208
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:49,028
People want to know.

209
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,843
Don't you get it, Hyeon-heup?

210
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:08,206
S lines.

211
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,286
Can't you feel the desire
of the people who are craving to see them?

212
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,055
I'm a mere mouthpiece for their longing.

213
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:29,508
Mom...

214
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:32,422
I'm sorry.

215
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:38,398
I'm sorry...

216
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:42,390
I'm so late.

217
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,648
I had...

218
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:55,641
the glasses too.

219
00:34:56,998 --> 00:34:58,601
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey.

220
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,112
Have you eaten?

221
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,421
What's wrong, honey?

222
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:13,726
Hyeon-heup...

223
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:15,794
it's not your fault.

224
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:41,417
You!

225
00:37:24,564 --> 00:37:25,811
Your death

226
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:31,448
will bring to mankind
the blessed eyes of God.

227
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:36,638
You're too late.

228
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:40,274
I've already

229
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:44,250
proven the reason for your existence.

230
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,038
The two of us

231
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,923
have finished what we're here to do.

232
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,880
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

233
00:40:52,454 --> 00:40:53,606
My glasses.

234
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:37,951
Hyeon-heup.

235
00:41:40,345 --> 00:41:41,545
Are you all right?

236
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:47,860
Let's get out of here.

237
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:57,259
Detective.

238
00:42:09,088 --> 00:42:10,191
Detective.

239
00:42:20,393 --> 00:42:22,120
Let's go and see Seon-a.

240
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:34,470
It's awesome.

241
00:42:34,494 --> 00:42:36,055
Cool.

242
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,662
The sky's turned red.

243
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,161
Look above his head!

244
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,608
Get it off me!

245
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:05,821
- What the hell?
- Look!

246
00:43:08,534 --> 00:43:10,693
Look, your head!

247
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,558
- Do I have them too?
- A lot.

248
00:43:13,582 --> 00:43:15,227
- What?
- Look.

249
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:16,562
What is that?

250
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:17,833
What are they?

251
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:30,974
Someday,

252
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:35,010
everyone will see the world as you do.

253
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,815
A world where everyone can see S lines.

254
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:06,798
I finally got to be what I wanted.
A regular human being.

255
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:12,958
The world was in a state
of massive chaos for almost a year.

256
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:17,179
People tried to figure out
why S lines suddenly appeared,

257
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:19,262
but no one could find the answer.

258
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:24,435
GOOD LUCK ON THE NEXT CHAPTER OF YOUR LIFE

259
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:26,666
Seon-a eventually awoke from her coma.

260
00:44:28,422 --> 00:44:30,821
In a world full of S lines,

261
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:34,692
she was reborn without one.

262
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,048
See you.

263
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:42,524
Seon-a and Detective Han
didn't ask each other any questions.

264
00:44:44,274 --> 00:44:45,474
They were just relieved

265
00:44:46,193 --> 00:44:48,736
at the fact that each other was alive.

266
00:44:49,114 --> 00:44:51,080
I told you not to come.

267
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:52,847
What do you want for lunch?

268
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,559
Nothing.
It's embarrassing to eat with you.

269
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:57,964
What are you talking about?

270
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:00,538
Just look above your own head.

271
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:02,189
Didn't you see everyone?

272
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:04,132
They're all staring at you.

273
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:06,947
And as for me...

274
00:45:09,263 --> 00:45:10,990
I was on my own again.

275
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:38,425
YOO JUN-SEON

276
00:45:45,223 --> 00:45:48,996
YOO JUN-SEON

277
00:46:14,091 --> 00:46:15,242
Hyeon-heup.

278
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:45,117
Hyeon-heup.

279
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:08,180
Hyeon-heup.
