I said, get in.

00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,047
Kang Seon-a, get in.

13
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:52,813
I told you I'm not getting in!

00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:55,928
Seon-a

15
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,151
Ugh, that temper of hers.

MATCHMAKING FOR THE FOREVER ALONE

17
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:38,817
There are some things
you don't need to see in life.

18
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,321
No. Some things
should not be seen at all.

19
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:45,769
I've seen these lines
ever since I was born.

20
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,605
- POLITICIAN'S SEXUAL ASSAULT EXPOSED
- I've seen these lines ever since I was born.

21
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,773
Could we just get a statement? Is it true?

22
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,067
- TOP STAR INTERVIEW
- Not at all.

23
00:02:52,147 --> 00:02:54,958
She's special to me,
but we're just manager and actor.

24
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:59,742
As I grew up, I naturally found out

25
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:02,077
what those lines meant.

26
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:04,259
What did you write?

27
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:09,806
I also discovered I was the only one
who could see these lines.

28
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:23,806
I was a cursed child who saw
what others couldn't...

29
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:25,572
DAD, ME, MOM, AUNT

30
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:31,870
And also a child who made her mom
go insane and who killed her dad.

31
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,244
The red lines that were always there,

32
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,717
slowly began to take meaning.

33
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,298
The moment I realized

34
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:59,439
that seeing red lines
could kill people...

35
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:06,321
I shut my mouth and closed my eyes.

36
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,382
I wanted to give up on everything...

37
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:54,675
but I didn't die.

38
00:04:56,727 --> 00:05:00,038
I survived every time
as if the god was playing with me...

39
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:04,609
and one day, I became completely alone.

40
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:11,016
I made a decision then.

41
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,254
If I have no choice but to live,

42
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,357
I needed to find out
why these red lines existed,

43
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,844
who made them,

44
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:26,940
who else is watching them besides me,

45
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:33,143
and how I can get rid of them.

46
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,403
Hello? Anyone home?

47
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:11,968
I moved into the building
across the way a few days ago.

48
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:14,750
I was going to give out rice cakes
to the neighbours,

49
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,378
but people don't really
eat them nowadays, right?

50
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,755
So I bought some fruit, instead.

51
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:21,519
Do you like fruit?

52
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:27,805
I never used to eat fruit
when I was younger,

53
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:31,363
but now I can never have
enough as an adult.

54
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:36,647
I'll leave it out here.

55
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,828
Make sure to eat them
before they go bad.

BANGJU POLICE STATION

57
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:22,015
Damn it.

58
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,014
Hey. I'm sorry.

59
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:35,265
What?

60
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:37,322
Never mind. Later.

61
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,370
Don't tell me you left
another scratch on my car.

62
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,667
What's the occasion today?

63
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,088
Why are you here at this hour?

64
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:55,536
I know, right? It's meaningless...

65
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:58,247
I was trying to be a good uncle for once.

66
00:08:58,327 --> 00:08:59,957
This is why people shouldn't
try new things.

67
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:02,263
Oh, that niece in high school?

68
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:04,420
High schoolers act like royalty nowadays.

69
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,255
So damn royal.

70
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:08,507
But what can we do?
I'm all that she has.

71
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:11,314
Then, what happens when you get married?

72
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:13,733
- "Married?"
- "Married?"

73
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:28,748
You will come to my wedding, right?

74
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,550
Why would I go to your wedding?

75
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,803
Because we're work colleagues?

76
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:45,765
What?

77
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,476
Nothing. Just something
came up in my mind.

78
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,856
I thought you were a sex addict.

79
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,275
Isn't it too late for you to be picky?

80
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:00,905
My bad.

81
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:20,592
Seon-a, didn't I tell you
to stop acting out?

82
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:25,346
Why the all they far off

83
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:28,057
Hey, hand it to me.

84
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,838
Come here.

85
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:32,174
So I told you not to act up,
didn't I?

86
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:33,884
Jackass.

87
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:35,135
Seon-a, are you okay?

88
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:36,428
Does it hurt?

89
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,818
Stand her up.

90
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,520
Seon-a.

91
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,730
You don't even bring me
the money I ask for.

92
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,912
Then why would you ever report me?

93
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:51,539
It was you, wasn't it?

94
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:57,378
Grab her.

95
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:00,577
My goodness. Seon-a.

96
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:02,788
Seon-a, you need to get
beaten up some more.

97
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:03,789
Get up.

98
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,137
Get up! Damn it.

99
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:09,503
Hey.

100
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,588
I heard that your uncle is a cop.

101
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:13,215
It's obivous, right?

102
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:16,272
And why are you ignoring
my calls and texts?

103
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:28,743
She's so damn heavy.

104
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,130
Did you laugh at me?

105
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,288
If you ever report me again,

106
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:47,136
I'll actually push you off here.

107
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:06,030
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

108
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:10,814
Victim?

109
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:14,151
She's a 29-year-old woman living alone.

110
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:16,737
She worked as a manager
at a nearby cafe.

111
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,530
Family?

112
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,214
No siblings. Parents are still alive,
but they're in the countryside.

113
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:24,870
Lover?

114
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,219
Nothing confirmed yet.
I'll look into it.

115
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:42,317
The place is a complete mess,
but all her stuff is here.

116
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,744
The body is clean.

117
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:57,540
It almost looks like a set for a play.

118
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:10,428
Oh?

119
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,585
This place is good.

120
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,128
Is it famous?

121
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,893
No.

122
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:19,645
It's a local spot.

123
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,888
Check it.

124
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:26,736
Yes, sir.

125
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:32,688
Detective Han.

126
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,899
We received a statement
from the first floor neighbor earlier.

127
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,068
They saw a man with a helmet on

128
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,696
headed toward this woman's place
late last night.

129
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,155
Helmet?

130
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:45,046
They said he looked like a deliveryman.

131
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:47,994
But I just can't figure out

132
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:51,331
what this punk's goal was.

133
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:53,333
The money was untouched.

134
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,973
There were no signs of sexual assault.

135
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,685
She doesn't seem like the type
people would have grudges against.

136
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:02,300
Maybe he's just a psychopath?

137
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,607
Does such a psychopath exist?

138
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,012
How'd it go with the restaurant?

139
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:08,557
We confirmed she does order
from there frequently,

140
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:09,891
but she didn't place an order that day.

141
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:11,393
And what about her love life?

142
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:12,644
Did you look into it?

143
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:14,396
They say she did have one,

144
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:17,662
but apparently,
it ended about a year ago.

145
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,622
Should we look for him?

146
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:04,542
I JUST ORDERED A BIT TOO MUCH

147
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:23,006
The corpse of a woman in her 20s was
discovered in her apartment complex

148
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:25,730
in Sinu-dong with signs
of a strangling this afternoon.

149
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:29,429
The police have reported
signs of forced entry

150
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:33,821
and have started investigating this case
as an opportunistic robbery and murder.

151
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,394
With the recent string
of murders in Sinu-dong

152
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:40,190
involving women in their 30s
who lived alone...

153
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,581
People with hundreds of S lines
are rare and stand out,

154
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:48,669
but that doesn't mean I miss
the people with just one, either.

155
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:53,674
Especially if that person is

156
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:57,011
trying to eavesdrop anything
at a murder scene.

157
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:23,538
No, I didn't hear anything strange.

158
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:28,238
Nowadays, deliveries are made
on motorcycles day and night.

159
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:32,463
Even if you see one roaming,
you just assume someone has ordered food.

160
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:25,866
112. What's your emergency?

161
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:31,664
The place across from mine...
The man with the helmet...

162
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,751
Hello?

163
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:58,059
Today's topic is
equilibriums in ecosystems.

164
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:02,397
Let's say a grey wolf starts
eating up the livestock in a town.

165
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:03,940
The residents become mad at the wolf

166
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,775
and ask for permission to hunt the wolf.

167
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,277
Then, what do you think happens?

168
00:19:07,357 --> 00:19:10,209
The wolf will begin to hide its tracks.

169
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:13,003
So you're just not going to show up?

170
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:25,975
- What the?
- What is that?

171
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:29,061
- What could this be?
- Open it.

172
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,899
Clothes?

173
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:17,151
Jeez, you scared me.

174
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:19,403
Why didn't you go to school?

175
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:21,906
Uncle.

176
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:24,283
Can I have some money?

177
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,123
You can take this for now.

178
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,096
I'll get you some more tomorrow.

179
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,643
How much more can you get me?

180
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:02,404
Hey, why is your face like this?

181
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,735
Are you getting beaten up out there?

182
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:14,625
Why do you care?

183
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:15,905
How much more can you...

184
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:18,003
Why do you need money?

185
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,326
- Ji-uk.
- Yeah. What?

186
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:03,578
Listen. Someone made a report yesterday

187
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:05,830
mentioning a man wearing a helmet.

188
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,958
But the possibility of the suspect being
a deliveryman was never disclosed.

189
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,168
Do you have the caller's location?

190
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:11,586
Hold on.

191
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,129
Sinu-dong.

192
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,311
Wanseong Apartments, Building B?

193
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,009
Wait, isn't that where you live?

194
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,648
Building B?

195
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,830
BUILDING B

196
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:45,078
I'm Detective Han Ji-uk
from Bangju Police Station.

197
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:46,800
Is anyone home?

198
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,123
Wow...

199
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,292
I've never seen someone

200
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:53,974
with so many S lines
this up close before.

201
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,365
Hello.

202
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,480
You're wasting your time.
She won't come out.

203
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,732
She's famous for being a recluse.

204
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:17,331
She even has someone throw
her garbage out for her.

205
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,246
I just need a moment of your time.

206
00:23:28,326 --> 00:23:30,039
You made
a police report yesterday, didn't you?

207
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:33,222
Can you just tell me what you witnessed?

208
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,171
It could serve as crucial evidence

209
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,771
in a murder case
that happened in the vicinity.

210
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,146
A teenager?

211
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:55,035
Are your parents home?

212
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:57,329
It was done accidentally.

213
00:23:58,815 --> 00:23:59,777
I'm sorry?

214
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,418
I called 112 by accident.

215
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:09,508
Can you give me more details
about that situation?

216
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:14,917
I saw a man with a helmet on walk
into the building across from me

217
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,766
and I thought the woman was in danger.

218
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,922
Woman?

219
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,508
Your next-door neighbor.

220
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:25,232
The woman who moved into Unit 204.

221
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:29,027
There's just been
a lot of incidents recently...

222
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,904
But,

223
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,407
it was her boyfriend.

224
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,106
But,

225
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,357
aren't you a teenager?

226
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:39,997
Shouldn't you be in school?

227
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:46,003
What the hell's wrong
with the kids nowadays?

228
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:55,179
But how did she know I lived there?

229
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:24,166
BUILDING B

230
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,388
KIM-HYE BITCH

231
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:33,681
I SUGGEST YOU
COME TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

232
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:35,404
DON'T FORGET THE MONEY.

233
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:38,740
ing bitch...

234
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,656
Hurry up.

235
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:34,296
What's wrong with you?

236
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:38,467
We just keep going, yeah?

237
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,917
- That's really amazing.
- I know, right?

238
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:44,835
- Isn't it so freaking nice?
- How much was it?

239
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:45,920
I didn't buy it this time.

240
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,171
Did your mom buy it?
Or was it your dad?

241
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,715
Don't be an ass.

242
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,396
They passed away.

243
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,446
Ji-uk.

244
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:03,700
You know that ex-boyfriend of the victim
in the Sinu-dong murder...

245
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:05,189
His name is Oh Jeong-min.

246
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,774
He's a teacher at Bangju High School.

247
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,567
And his guy's home address is listed

248
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:12,459
as Unit 303,
Wanseong Apartments Building B.

249
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:16,450
Don't you think it's strange
he lived so nearby?

250
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,995
And the murder case from last month,

251
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:21,414
that woman had been going

252
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:24,333
to the same gym as him up
until a few weeks ago.

253
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,306
What a similarity.

254
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,797
Unit 303, Building B?

255
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,561
Do you have a picture of him?

256
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,179
You're wasting your time.
She won't come out.

257
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,599
She's famous for being a recluse.

258
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,198
She even has someone throw
her garbage out for her.

259
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,064
Unit 303, that bastard.

260
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:50,163
So he was acquainted
with both murder victims.

261
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,071
Too much to be a coincidence, right?

262
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,836
Right?

263
00:28:57,446 --> 00:29:00,507
And we can't just ignore
such a coincidence.

264
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:12,936
Hello?

265
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:17,899
Okay.

266
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:20,931
Go on ahead without me.

267
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,779
I need to stop by somewhere first.

268
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:25,519
What?

269
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,077
FATHER

270
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:47,708
Are you Mr. Han Ho-san's guardian?

271
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,043
One of our new caregivers
just stepped out

272
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,420
for a moment when he disappeared.

273
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,340
We're currently searching
every inch of our facilities.

274
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,605
You must be in shock,
but if you could just wait...

275
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:17,292
Yeah

276
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,961
Maybe that's…

277
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,250
- Sir!
- Why is he up there?

278
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,210
It's dangerous up there! Come down!

279
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,683
Hurry! Get him!

280
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,520
Come down from there now!

281
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:08,385
BUILDING B

282
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:25,086
What the hell is all this?

283
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,780
DONG-SIK

284
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,823
Yeah, I'm on my way.

285
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,521
Ji-uk, this place is weird.

286
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:56,730
What's weird?

287
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,286
Are you there?

288
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,289
What's weird?

289
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:03,904
DONG-SIK

290
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,030
Hello?

291
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,378
Dong-sik?

292
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,213
Dong-sik!

293
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:36,449
DONG-SIK

294
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:02,475
There's only one left now.

295
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:35,003
Mom...

296
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,823
Hey.

297
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,305
Jeong-min...

298
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:29,849
Have you been well?

299
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,851
What are you doing here?

300
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,782
Why...

301
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:50,495
This is the way to salvation for us all.

302
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,417
Stop.

303
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,177
You're that recluse from downstairs.

304
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,313
So you going to stab me with that?

305
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,566
Go ahead.

306
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,113
Why are you shaking so much?

307
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:29,117
Go ahead and stab me.

308
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:32,912
You can't do it?

309
00:39:08,656 --> 00:39:10,674
It's time for salvation.

310
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:13,093
What a crock of shit.

311
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:16,513
Where are my glasses?

312
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:18,085
Where are my damn glasses?

313
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:20,379
Please stand up! We need to go!

314
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,922
Oh, no. It'll be okay.

315
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:25,689
- Where are my damn glasses!
- Try to stand up. Come on.

316
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,693
- Where are they?
- Get up. Come on.

317
00:39:43,566 --> 00:39:44,779
Stop it!

318
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:46,626
Let go of me!

319
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:56,094
What is all this?

320
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,402
Let go of me!

321
00:40:15,764 --> 00:40:17,199
Hey.

322
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:34,257
I'll be set once you're gone.

323
00:40:34,992 --> 00:40:36,551
Die.

324
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:54,778
Die...

325
00:41:30,547 --> 00:41:33,567
The line is disappearing.

326
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:35,086
The line is disappearing.

327
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:36,784
Did he see

328
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:39,549
the S lines like me?

329
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:42,218
How?

330
00:42:46,457 --> 00:42:48,016
The glasses?

331
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:19,547
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the hospital?

332
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:25,679
The man that died...

333
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,223
Who was he?

334
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,672
I'll tell you more later.

335
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:33,770
You need to stop by the station
at some point anyway.

336
00:43:34,254 --> 00:43:35,772
Uncle.

337
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,095
What's going on?

338
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:41,027
Why haven't you been
picking up your phone?

339
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:49,202
What's with the sunglasses
in the middle of the night?

340
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,542
Do you two know each other?

341
00:44:04,034 --> 00:44:05,205
What?

342
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:06,970
Don't come in if you're not
going to give me money.

343
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:10,265
Do I look like your ATM or something?

344
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:24,446
Is something going on at school?

345
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:28,324
Say something.

346
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:30,606
Will talking about it change anything?

347
00:44:30,686 --> 00:44:32,691
If there's an issue,
we need to solve it.

348
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:33,609
Solve it?

349
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:34,902
How are you going to solve it?

350
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:36,236
What are you going to solve?

351
00:44:36,316 --> 00:44:39,419
Are you going to pretend to be
my guardian and come with me to school?

352
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:43,548
You're just going to do this
for a bit before you disappear again.

353
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:46,121
As if you ever cared for me.
This is bullshit.

354
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:48,136
Bullshit?

355
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:50,013
Why you little brat...

356
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:56,644
Forget it.

357
00:44:57,463 --> 00:44:59,189
But...

358
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:03,013
why was Hyeon-heup

359
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:04,932
standing outside of her building?

360
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:06,946
How do you know her?

361
00:45:08,098 --> 00:45:09,949
The same middle school.

362
00:45:10,684 --> 00:45:13,899
Her mom killed her dad
and ran away when she was a kid.

363
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:15,580
You didn't know?

364
00:45:29,703 --> 00:45:31,638
Thank you.

365
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:37,131
For the first time,
I realized there's a chance

366
00:45:37,211 --> 00:45:40,647
my ability to see S lines could
help save people.

367
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:43,178
If that's true,

368
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:45,443
what should I do now?

369
00:46:22,798 --> 00:46:27,931
I CAN SEE THE SAME WORLD YOU SEE.

370
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:33,283
COME TO BANGJU HIGH SCHOOL.

371
00:46:41,817 --> 00:46:48,631
THE GIRL WITH THE SUNGLASSES

372
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,551
Kids, be careful. Don't get hurt.

373
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,416
We have a new student
joining our class today.

374
00:47:17,496 --> 00:47:20,015
Her name is Shin Hyeon-heup.

375
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:25,771
You can see something
with these on, can't you?

376
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:27,259
Red lines.

377
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:30,984
Can you see them, too?

378
00:47:32,428 --> 00:47:33,724
Then, why are you looking at that again?

379
00:47:33,804 --> 00:47:35,447
We already caught the culprit.

380
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,019
Something's sketchy.

381
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:38,062
What?

382
00:47:38,142 --> 00:47:40,189
I just don't understand
why he killed them at all.

383
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:42,817
Are you going to hold onto those glasses?

384
00:47:42,897 --> 00:47:44,026
Of course.

385
00:47:44,106 --> 00:47:45,569
Have you lost your mind?

386
00:47:45,649 --> 00:47:48,114
It's time for you to be embarrassed now.

387
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:49,824
Why would I be embarrassed?

388
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:50,991
Seon-a.

389
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:54,370
Even so, violence isn't the answer.

390
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,384
I'm going to kill her.

391
00:47:56,994 --> 00:48:00,430
