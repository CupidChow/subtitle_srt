1
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,831
-What a disgrace!
-Gosh.

3
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,210
-She's here.
-What psychopath did this?

4
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,129
I know!

5
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,090
Why would anyone write this
on someone else's house?

6
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,925
But what does it say?

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,011
You're so dumb.

8
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,680
It says S-E-X.

9
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,057
What does S-E-X mean?

10
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,267
Geez.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,436
I don't know.

12
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,189
Jeong-suk, what does it mean?

13
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,359
It means…

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,737
I know what it means.

15
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,572
S…

16
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,574
-What?
-Shirt?

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,160
-S…
-Say it properly.

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,995
Sex!

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,998
-Sex!
-That's so indecent. Stop.

20
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,627
Which asshole wrote this?

21
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,630
Sure, the vandal is a problem,

22
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:32,133
but the real problem is Jeong-suk.

23
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,761
Pardon?

24
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,555
I only just heard yesterday
what you've been up to.

25
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,352
This happened
because you're selling disgraceful things.

26
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,104
You're not going to continue, right?

27
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,943
I'm going to continue.

28
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,069
What?

29
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,696
That way, I can pay rent.

30
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,199
You're thick-skinned, aren't you?

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,951
Paying rent is not some big feat.

32
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,663
Of all the work you could do, why this?

33
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,997
That's true.

34
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,875
Does Seong-su know? Is he tolerating this?

35
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,672
I haven't seen him around lately.

36
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,882
Is he away?

37
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,470
I'll clean up the writing.

38
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,638
What's the point?

39
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,976
If you keep selling those lewd things,
it's just going to happen again.

40
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,519
That's true.

41
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,772
Since the culprit hasn't been caught yet.

42
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,649
-I'll…
-That's true.

43
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,861
Mom.

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,991
Ma'am.

45
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,617
Hello.

46
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,376
-Mom.
-What?

47
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,045
You're afraid I'll ruin these dirty items?

48
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,091
Does Seong-su know you've been
roaming around at night to sell these?

49
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,554
Is this why he's not coming home?

50
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,848
That's not it.

51
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,974
Of course it is!

52
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,268
I knew something was off.

53
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,769
He may be irresponsible,

54
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,439
but he isn't the type
to run away from home.

55
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,901
This is a total shock even to me.

56
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,528
-So I can only imagine how he felt.
-It's not like that!

57
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,821
What is it then?

58
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,910
Seong-su…

59
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,413
cheated on me.

60
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,250
I found out. That's why he left.

61
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,921
What?

62
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,131
Don't worry, Mom.

63
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,383
I can raise Min-ho on my own.

64
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,135
What are you saying?

65
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,264
Are you saying you'll divorce Seong-su?

66
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,309
How will you raise a child on your own?

67
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,771
By selling these vulgar
and disgusting products?

68
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,149
What do you mean, disgusting?

69
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,444
These products aren't disgusting.

70
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,571
They can be helpful in a marriage.

71
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,739
As if.

72
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,243
Looking at you and Seong-su,
I can't see any evidence

73
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,372
that these things
really helped your marriage.

74
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,879
How could you, of all people, say that?

75
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,217
I just told you

76
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,596
that Seong-su cheated on me
with another woman!

77
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,057
I'm a mess because of him,

78
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,476
and you think this job is
the bigger problem?

79
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,811
Yes, because it is!

80
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,481
I'm not looking after Min-ho
if you keep doing this.

81
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,234
You said you can raise him on your own.

82
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,071
Let's see just how well you can do.

83
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,420
GEUMJE POLICE STATION

84
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,130
Where did he go?

85
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,590
Yes, hello?

86
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,926
Vandalism?

87
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,595
Someone scribbled on a wall?

88
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,098
What did they write?

89
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,353
What did you say?

90
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,441
I got it. Thanks.

91
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,194
Gosh.

92
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,529
What happened?

93
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,906
Another problem involving Han Jeong-suk.

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,658
Someone scribbled

95
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,579
"sex" on their house wall.

96
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,497
-"Sex"?
-Yes.

97
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,417
The landlord's hell-bent on
catching the culprit.

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,918
My goodness.

99
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,088
I thought the in-home sales
of adult products was bad.

100
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,843
Maybe selling lewd items got her involved
in some kind of complicated love affair?

101
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,094
That's a leap.

102
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,013
No way.

103
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,892
Catching the vandal sounds fun,

104
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,812
but I have so much paperwork to do.

105
00:05:54,896 --> 00:06:00,193
All this work is going to kill me.
Right, Detective Kim?

106
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,070
I'll go and check it out.

107
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,533
These are the case files
from the precinct, right?

108
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,243
I'll go to the scene.

109
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,457
Well, that's new.

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,584
He's normally not that willing.

111
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,045
I think I know why.

112
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,762
Is one can enough?

113
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,472
Yes. How much is it?

114
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,431
It's 13,000 won.

115
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,100
What?

116
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,064
Do you sell half-cans?

117
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,402
In my 30 years of working here,
I've never had anyone ask for a half-can.

118
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,114
-I'll throw in a brush for free.
-Throw it in.

119
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,160
Here you go.

120
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,913
-Thank you.
-No problem. Take care.

121
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,248
Take care.

122
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,586
I feel bad for her.

123
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,006
I hope they find the vandal soon.

124
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,883
I agree.

125
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,031
Hello.

126
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,581
When did you last see the wall
without the writing?

127
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:42,170
I came home around 10 p.m.

128
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:47,383
My son discovered the writing
around 8:20 a.m. the next morning.

129
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,926
It must have happened overnight.

130
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,970
Did you notice anyone entering?

131
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,847
No, not at all.

132
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,059
Does anyone hold a grudge against you?

133
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,438
-A grudge?
-Yes.

134
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,565
Looking at the writing,

135
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,445
it's likely done by someone
who has a grudge against you.

136
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,656
Anyone involved in your in-home sales?

137
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,993
Or could it be a neighbor
or a friend of yours?

138
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,538
No.

139
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,959
No one welcomed
my business with open arms,

140
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,004
but I doubt anyone would take it this far.

141
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,633
I have no idea who did it.

142
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm sorry,

143
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,990
but can I erase that now?

144
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,745
It's better to preserve the crime scene.

145
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,622
I see.

146
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,542
Are you worried people might judge you?

147
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,002
Actually, it's because

148
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,923
it's almost time for my son
to come home from school.

149
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,885
I told him it was no big deal,
but if it's still here,

150
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,971
I think he might worry.

151
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,356
I took enough photos.

152
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,900
So you can erase it now.

153
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,488
Thank you, detective.

154
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,948
Of course.

155
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,440
You don't have to help.

156
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,734
Your child will be back soon.

157
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,819
I'll just paint the top part.

158
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,303
Mom.

159
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,388
Min-ho.

160
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,311
I'm relieved that we finished
before he got here.

161
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,687
Thank you so much.

162
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,857
Sure thing.

163
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,404
Hi, Min-ho.

164
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,994
Who are you, mister?

165
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,080
He's a police officer.

166
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,540
He'll catch the one
who scribbled on our wall.

167
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,376
I see.

168
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,961
I'll contact you when I find out more.

169
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,129
All right.

170
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,425
The writing's gone.

171
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,886
Yes. I told you it was no big deal.

172
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,888
It's even cleaner now.

173
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:30,189
Excuse me,
did anyone buy this red paint recently?

174
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,565
Let me think.

175
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,486
Mr. Kim is a plasterer, so he buys a lot.

176
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,697
Mr. Park is crazy
about the election campaign

177
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,159
and bought various colors
to paint pickets with.

178
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,369
Have some of this.

179
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,371
It's coffee, which I know you like.

180
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,834
Thank you.

181
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,794
It's hot.

182
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,926
The rice seller
also bought some the other night.

183
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,720
Do you remember exactly when?

184
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,222
I'm not sure.

185
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,684
It was when that show was on.

186
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,018
What was his name again?

187
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,312
With Son Beom-su.

188
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,397
Here you go again.

189
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,774
Animal Quiz Show.

190
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,570
Be careful, will you? It spilled.

191
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,072
Those are so old you can't even tell.

192
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,950
Just throw them out.
I'm so tired of those army boots.

193
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,163
They're fine. Why would I throw them out?

194
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,207
-You can't find boots like these anymore.
-All right already.

195
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,169
Detective, where did you serve?

196
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,839
I was with the 38th Infantry Division
Assault Force.

197
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,883
I went to the police academy.

198
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,302
Is that so?

199
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,429
You're an elite, then.

200
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,391
Anyway, my division

201
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,770
was more passionate than any others
and was known as "the warrior's division."

202
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,149
Even in the freezing cold
of Gangwon Province, I marched in these.

203
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,443
I'm tired of those boots and stories.

204
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,112
Just answer the questions he asked.

205
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,740
All right.

206
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,119
Where was I?

207
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,330
When did the rice seller buy the paint?

208
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:14,168
It was when Animal Quiz Show was on.

209
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,505
So between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m.

210
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,465
I wonder why

211
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,510
the rice seller would need paint.

212
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,095
It's very suspicious.

213
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,139
It's not suspicious, damn it!

214
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,432
IF YOU LITTER, YOU'RE TRASH!

215
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,520
You see how they're throwing trash
right in front of my store?

216
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,855
I was so furious, so I made that sign!

217
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,315
How could you suspect me?

218
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,693
Tell me. Who blabbered that I did it?

219
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,654
In a town this small too.

220
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,157
Talking behind my back makes me mad.

221
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,575
Who is it?

222
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,869
Who keeps littering here?

223
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,331
Damn it.

224
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,168
-Mom.
-Yes?

225
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,215
That looks delicious.

226
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,383
Right.

227
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,343
When is Grandma coming over?

228
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,721
She can't come today.

229
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,182
I'm staying with you tonight.

230
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,269
You're not going out to work today?

231
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,231
How many pieces do you want, Min-ho?

232
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,483
Three?

233
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,236
Finish your homework first.

234
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,696
Okay.

235
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,291
Hello?

236
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,002
Jeong-suk, it's me!

237
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:42,089
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

238
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,924
I got a job for us.

239
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,634
A job?

240
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,305
Yes. I know someone
who runs a knitting shop.

241
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,472
I told her about us.

242
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,350
She said we could use the store
around closing time.

243
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,144
She gets quite a few customers.

244
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,522
Why don't you come by with Ms. Oh?

245
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,649
The thing is…

246
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,445
I don't think I can make it.

247
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,322
What? Why?

248
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,449
Actually…

249
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,829
there's no one to watch Min-ho.

250
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,498
My mother can't do it anymore.

251
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,294
Oh, no! What will you do?

252
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:24,173
I wish I could let my husband watch him.

253
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,927
But we have a newborn
in our tiny home right now.

254
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,762
I have an idea!

255
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,556
Why don't you ask Ju-ri to watch him?

256
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,643
I don't feel comfortable asking someone
who runs a business.

257
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,022
I'll look for a different solution.

258
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,232
Bye.

259
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,919
How can you be smiling now?

260
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,215
The other kids got seated
in boy-and-girl pairs,

261
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,550
but we're a boy-boy pair.

262
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,303
We have terrible luck.

263
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,931
So how can you be smiling?

264
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,475
How are we unlucky?

265
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,853
I'm happy I'm paired with you, Dong-u.

266
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,022
Really?

267
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,402
I guess people of all genders and ages
are fond of me.

268
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,363
Min-ho.

269
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,739
Mom!

270
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,909
Did you come to pick me up?

271
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,454
-Is he your friend?
-Yes.

272
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:42,543
Hello. I'm Jang Dong-u,
number 11 in Class 3 of first grade.

273
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,253
I'm Min-ho's classmate.

274
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,175
Nice to meet you.

275
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,636
But haven't I seen you before?

276
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,556
Do you think you've seen me on TV?

277
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,434
I often hear
that I look like a child actor.

278
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,229
Well, I see.

279
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,690
But that's not it.

280
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,941
Dong-u.

281
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,277
Jeong-suk!

282
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,447
So he is your son, Ju-ri.

283
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,450
This is my son.

284
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,786
-They're classmates.
-Really?

285
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,041
Coffee for Jeong-suk,
hot chocolate for the boys.

286
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,208
Thank you.

287
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,754
This is amazing.

288
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,839
I didn't know they're classmates.

289
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,007
Me neither.

290
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,509
You look like pretty close friends.

291
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,054
Yes, we're close.

292
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,181
I wouldn't say that.

293
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,807
We're getting to know each other.

294
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,980
Yeong-bok stopped by earlier.

295
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,400
She said she found a sales spot
but that you need childcare.

296
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,445
Well…

297
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,697
If you haven't found anyone,
leave him here.

298
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,200
I can't do that. You're working.

299
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,578
I watch my kid and work every day anyway.

300
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,748
They're classmates, at that.

301
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,416
I bet they'd get along great.

302
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,667
Don't worry. Go.

303
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,880
Still.

304
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,673
Leave him with us.

305
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,926
Childcare is a give-and-take,

306
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,346
so if you get help one day,
you may give help another.

307
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,725
-Where did you learn that?
-The March issue of Lady Kyunghyang.

308
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,895
You should go. You'll be late.

309
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,647
Gosh.

310
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,859
Min-ho, be good, okay?

311
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,986
I'll come get you as soon as I'm done.

312
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,946
-Okay.
-All right.

313
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,155
Thank you so much.

314
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,658
-Quick, go!
-Thank you.

315
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,746
Treasure Island.

316
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,914
Can I get a perm now?

317
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,582
Of course. Come have a seat.

318
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,794
-Hey.
-Yes?

319
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,922
I'm telling you now
since you'll find out anyway.

320
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,341
My mother's a single mom.

321
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,176
I see.

322
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,013
But she's raised me with love.

323
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,433
If you look down on her
for being a single mom,

324
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,686
I'll teach you a lesson.

325
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,189
-But…
-What?

326
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,899
What's a single mom?

327
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,696
-Just read your comic book.
-Okay.

328
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,540
You only sold one, right?

329
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,209
I was lucky to sell one.

330
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,087
I sold one too thanks to you two.

331
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,801
We're here. I sold as many as two,

332
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,094
so I'll treat you to fish cake.

333
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,388
-Fish cake?
-Yes.

334
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,807
At the street food stall over there?

335
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,142
Yes.

336
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,940
Have you not had it before?

337
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,737
I grew up in a prim family.

338
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,364
So I've never had food
while standing on the street.

339
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,993
That's kind of your vibe.

340
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,621
Like a nobleman's daughter.

341
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,750
Can you at least give it a try though?

342
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,085
This commoner is starving.

343
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,129
Stop it already.

344
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,423
Let's go! Don't mind me.

345
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,633
Okay.

346
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,486
Milady seems to like the fish cake.

347
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,489
This makes me angry.

348
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,117
I went 50 years
without knowing this taste.

349
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,751
Min-ho's with Ju-ri now, right?

350
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,920
Yes.

351
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,340
I'm worried about the future.

352
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,094
Even if the working hours
are flexible compared to other jobs,

353
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:06,473
you'll need childcare
in the afternoons and evenings.

354
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,269
Is something up with your mother?
She's been helping you out.

355
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,272
She found out about this work.

356
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,983
She really hates it.

357
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,818
Oh, no.

358
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,072
You must be so upset.

359
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,575
Jeong-suk!

360
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,121
That man is…

361
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,747
That bitch's husband, right?

362
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,000
-Excuse me a moment.
-Sure.

363
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,627
In-tae.

364
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,173
This is great.

365
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,301
I've been meaning to see you.

366
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,887
Why?

367
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,973
The in-home sales thing you do.

368
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,392
I thought I'd host it at mine.

369
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,602
Your house?

370
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,147
A special event for Mi-hwa's birthday.

371
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,857
I think it'd be good for you too.

372
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,819
And we'd like to spice things up.

373
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,865
You know we've been
struggling to get pregnant.

374
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,368
We do try, but we always fail.

375
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,247
Mi-hwa seems uninterested
in that department.

376
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,048
Is that what she said?

377
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,718
That she's uninterested in sex?

378
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,931
-I can't do it.
-Why?

379
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,849
Excuse me.

380
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,187
Could I do the sales event at yours
instead of Jeong-suk?

381
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,689
Are you very busy?

382
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:42,027
Of course she is. Her schedule is packed.

383
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,655
I'm in the same line of work.
I'm a great salesperson too.

384
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,283
It would be great if you could!

385
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,578
Here's my card.

386
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,163
Please get in touch.

387
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,331
Thank you.

388
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,085
Jeong-suk, see you later.

389
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,630
-See you.
-Bye.

390
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,714
Goodbye.

391
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,097
You didn't have to do that.

392
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,476
Why wouldn't I?
It's a chance to earn some money.

393
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,019
You know I'm a smooth talker.

394
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,648
I'm going to take them
for everything they have.

395
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:24,361
Yes, leave it to Yeong-bok.
And you don't worry about it.

396
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,654
That's right.

397
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,744
You had that much fun?

398
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,206
Yes, I read Treasure Island
and Youth JoongAng.

399
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,125
I even ate curry!

400
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,587
Dong-u's mom told me to visit again.

401
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,381
-Really?
-Yes.

402
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,258
What is this?

403
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,053
It's from Dad!

404
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,264
It must be a gift for me!

405
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,693
SENDER: KWON SEONG-SU
RECIPIENT: KWON MIN-HO

406
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,114
It's Voltron.

407
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,992
There's a letter too.

408
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,702
Let's read it together, Mom.

409
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,247
Sure.

410
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,333
I'll read it out loud.

411
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,626
Okay.

412
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,461
"Dear Min-ho, it's Dad."

413
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:29,217
"I bought this because I remembered
you wanted a Voltron.

414
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,096
I'm so jealous of this robot.

415
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,726
This robot can play

416
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,979
and fall asleep with Min-ho.

417
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:45,483
I believe there will come a day
when I can be by your side again.

418
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,736
I know it will.

419
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,030
I love you, Min-ho.

420
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,992
Tell Mom I love her."

421
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,515
Excuse me?

422
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,188
Excuse me?

423
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,439
Yes?

424
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,942
Hello.

425
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,904
Your dog seems to be quite riled up.

426
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,240
What about putting him on a leash?

427
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,202
Don't worry about it.
Ppoppi doesn't bite people.

428
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,079
He's the sweetest dog.

429
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,705
I see.

430
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,971
What the hell! Sweetest dog, my ass!

431
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,936
Oh, my gosh! Are you badly hurt?

432
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:07,524
I landed on my butt hard.

433
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,485
I can't move at all.

434
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,656
What should I do
about the sales event at your friend's?

435
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,867
It's tonight, so I can't cancel.

436
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,288
I was going to ask Ms. Oh,

437
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:26,251
but it turns out today of all days
she has a Royal Club gathering.

438
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,587
I'll go.

439
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,133
You will? Will you be okay?

440
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,551
Yes.

441
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,845
Don't worry about it. Rest up.

442
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,180
Bye.

443
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,068
Come support me.

444
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,737
-Hold me up.
-I got you.

445
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,906
Why did we put the phone here?

446
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,410
-Oh, no.
-Easy.

447
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,745
That hurts!

448
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,666
Does it hurt a lot?

449
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,545
Why?

450
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,466
Are those tears in your eyes?

451
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,384
I'm sorry, honey.

452
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,764
If I'd had a well-paying job,
this wouldn't have happened.

453
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,392
It's fine. What are you saying?

454
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,644
It was just bad luck.

455
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,147
No, it's because I'm a bad husband. Sorry.

456
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,066
-Be gentle.
-Gently.

457
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,781
I'll go get some medicine
and pain relief patches for you.

458
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,449
I need pain relief patches.

459
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,370
Is there anything you want to eat?

460
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:47,123
I should eat, but I have no appetite.

461
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,417
Should I buy some bananas? You love them.

462
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,128
But they're expensive.

463
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,338
Don't worry about cost.

464
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,676
You're right. I'm hurt.
Go buy them and give some to the kids.

465
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,262
All right. I'll dash and get some.

466
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,432
My husband's the best.

467
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,852
But…

468
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,064
do you have any money?

469
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,362
Money?

470
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,575
Look in my jacket pocket.

471
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,419
-Just take 3,000 won.
-That will be good.

472
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,878
I'll bring back the change.

473
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,799
Hang in there, okay?
I'll be fast as lightning.

474
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm really sorry, honey.

475
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,011
I love you.

476
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,270
Am I supposed to thank him

477
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,646
or curse him?

478
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,775
I'm never sure when it comes to him.

479
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,532
-Thank you.
-Come back anytime!

480
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,868
Can I get a haircut?

481
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,412
I'm sorry.
Too many people are waiting for perms.

482
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,789
I'll give you a great cut next time.
Sorry!

483
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,196
Jeong-suk.

484
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,491
My colleague had an emergency.

485
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,659
I brought Min-ho
since I couldn't find a sitter.

486
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,953
Good call.

487
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,206
Min-ho, long time no see.

488
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,540
Hello.

489
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,210
Honey, who is it?

490
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,252
It's…

491
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,757
Jeong-suk. Why are you…

492
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,052
I invited her for your birthday surprise.

493
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,472
You said your friends
would like Jeong-suk's in-home sales.

494
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,974
You should've talked to me first.

495
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,768
I'm sure Jeong-suk didn't want to.

496
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,145
If you're uncomfortable, you can go.

497
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,313
I'm okay with it.

498
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,981
I'm fine with this too.

499
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,441
It'll make me some money.

500
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,568
See? It's fine.

501
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,861
Min-ho.

502
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,198
While your mom's working,
let's go see a movie.

503
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,284
Young-gu and Daeng Chil 4 is out now.

504
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,410
Wow.

505
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,996
Mom, can I go?

506
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,541
Go ahead.

507
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,917
Let's go!

508
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,418
-See you later.
-Okay.

509
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,801
I can come in, right?

510
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,386
Of course.

511
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,705
What's wrong, Min-ho?

512
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,582
Do you want popcorn?

513
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,544
When is my dad coming back?

514
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,549
I'm not sure myself.

515
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,094
Grandma told me

516
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,056
there's nowhere left
in Geumje for Dad to work.

517
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,809
That must be why he can't come home.

518
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,608
If you eat a lot and stay healthy,

519
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,861
I'm sure Dad will come back
to see you soon.

520
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,115
With that in mind, who wants popcorn?

521
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,704
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

522
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,707
Excuse me.

523
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,505
He's out. Guess where.

524
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,841
-Where?
-Paris.

525
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:07,926
-Paris?
-Paris?

526
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,677
-Wow.
-He's bringing me a gift.

527
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,430
-I'm jealous.
-Do you even know where Paris is?

528
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,557
-I know. I've just never been.
-Where?

529
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,685
-You don't know!
-Stop teasing me.

530
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,647
-She doesn't know.
-She doesn't know any countries.

531
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,565
-How long's the trip?
-It's six days.

532
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,275
-Gosh.
-Wow.

533
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,529
-It is.
-Really?

534
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,782
You went to high school
with Mi-hwa, right?

535
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,785
We went to elementary
and middle school with her.

536
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,204
We heard a lot about you from Mi-hwa.

537
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,122
You're friends with her husband as well.

538
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,626
Yes, we've been friends
since we were little kids.

539
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,378
-I see.
-So that's how it is.

540
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,674
Mi-hwa announced her marriage
so suddenly, I was so shocked.

541
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,008
You must know

542
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,970
that she is not interested in men.

543
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,555
She can be a bit of a prude, right?

544
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,309
Yes, I know.

545
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:03,398
Starting now,
let's talk about some adult business.

546
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,400
-Let's do it!
-Be honest with me.

547
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,151
After you got married,

548
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:11,698
have you ever been attracted
to another man?

549
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:13,908
What?

550
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,953
Have you ever wanted
to sleep with another man?

551
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,623
Why are you hesitating? You have?

552
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,339
Stop it already.

553
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,674
Did she just get mad?

554
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,967
She's so cute.

555
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,012
She hasn't changed at all.
She's the same as always.

556
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,388
Jeong-suk.

557
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,891
Show us some of your products.

558
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,645
Sure. Shall we?

559
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,064
That part, right there.

560
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,775
-Look!
-That one!

561
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,279
Excuse me.

562
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,034
Min-ho.

563
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,870
Kwon Min-ho?

564
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,581
-Min-ho.
-Sit down already.

565
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,749
I'm sorry.

566
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,419
Did you see a boy
holding a toy around here?

567
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,754
No, I haven't.

568
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,756
Min-ho! Kwon Min-ho!

569
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,883
-We can't see!
-I'm sorry.

570
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,009
Move!

571
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,178
Please sit. He must've gone for a smoke.

572
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,471
He's eight years old.

573
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,515
Get out of the way first.

574
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,602
He's clearly not here. Get out of the way.

575
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,980
-Geez.
-My goodness.

576
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,149
I bought so many pretty things.

577
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,734
Thank you so much.

578
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,778
Mi-hwa, I had so much fun today.

579
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,446
-So did I.
-Me too.

580
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,199
I want to invite Jeong-suk
to my birthday party too.

581
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,742
Sure, give me a call.

582
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,826
-See you.
-Bye.

583
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,661
-See you.
-See you. Take care.

584
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,164
-Thank you.
-Bye!

585
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,041
-Take care.
-You too!

586
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,350
Jeong-suk, great job tonight.

587
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,606
I think you have a knack for this.

588
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,150
I didn't know you were so well-spoken.

589
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,237
We've known each other so long.

590
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,781
But there was still
a side of me you didn't know.

591
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,534
But after all,

592
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,370
it was the same with you.

593
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,503
Min-ho!

594
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,214
Min-ho? Min-ho.

595
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,174
-In-tae?
-Min-ho isn't here?

596
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,010
Why would he be here?

597
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,850
Where's Min-ho?

598
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,230
Where is Min-ho?

599
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,024
I wrote a few items down.

600
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,110
Please ask the forensics team for advice.

601
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,362
-You can leave right after that.
-Yes, sir.

602
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,281
I'll take care of this and go.

603
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,240
All right.

604
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,209
Yes, this is Detective Kim.

605
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,921
A missing child report?

606
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,007
Please go ahead.

607
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,508
Min-ho.

608
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,137
Did Min-ho come here?

609
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,138
He didn't.

610
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,307
He isn't anywhere.

611
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,893
I went everywhere I thought he could be.

612
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,815
I filed a report with the police,
so I'm sure they'll find him soon.

613
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,656
-Jeong-suk.
-Why did you leave him alone?

614
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,117
I stepped out for a minute
to get him popcorn.

615
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,662
I didn't think he'd disappear
in that short amount of time.

616
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,794
You never know anything.

617
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,965
You never know what's going on

618
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,550
right in front of your eyes.

619
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,635
Jeong-suk, calm down.

620
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,719
Don't touch me!

621
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,638
My Min-ho.

622
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,807
Min-ho. What should I do?

623
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,602
Tell me again.

624
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,562
How did it happen?

625
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,107
Min-ho said he wanted popcorn.
I told him to wait there.

626
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,275
-You told him to wait?
-Yes!

627
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,569
-Did you say it clearly?
-I did.

628
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,071
-And?
-He was gone when I returned.

629
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,948
You're here for the missing child?

630
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,033
-Yes.
-Where would he go?

631
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,284
The mother's over there.

632
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,953
-Did you search the area?
-I did.

633
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,080
Try and think where he could be once more.

634
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,122
Where can he be?

635
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,501
Did you search the whole area?
You double-checked?

636
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,214
You already checked
all the places he might be?

637
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,674
Yes.

638
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,134
I went to all his usual hangouts.

639
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,430
Then, let's do another search
in the theater area

640
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,266
where he disappeared.

641
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,143
He could be waiting there.

642
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,023
He's never been anywhere alone
besides school and home.

643
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,862
It's so dark out. He must be terrified.

644
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,699
He must be so cold.

645
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,121
I used to live in the US.

646
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,332
There's a big amusement park
called Disneyland there.

647
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,878
This town is smaller than the park.

648
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,632
I'm saying we'll find him soon.

649
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,981
Wait! That's my mother.

650
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,199
Mom!

651
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,667
I got a call from In-tae.

652
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,628
How could this happen?

653
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,298
I'm looking for him
with a detective right now.

654
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,884
Min-ho should be sleeping by now.

655
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:09,055
How could you drag your child along
to that lewd work of yours?

656
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,558
What was I supposed to do?

657
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,312
You wouldn't watch him.

658
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,938
And I still had to make money.

659
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,482
I told you not to do this.

660
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,442
I said I hated it. It's dirty!

661
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,154
It's too much to think about
the fact that my own daughter

662
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,032
is going around
selling such vulgar things!

663
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,992
It makes me tremble.

664
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,079
Mom.

665
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,332
You may be mad for money,
but you've crossed the line.

666
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:40,961
What do you even get
by doing that to make money?

667
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,006
A mother should act like one.

668
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,259
Don't you have any shame?

669
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,264
What about you?

670
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,144
Do you think you're acting like a mother?

671
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,981
-What?
-I'm going crazy as is.

672
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,402
And you're hurting me
even more with your harsh words.

673
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,195
Is that acting like a mother?

674
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,781
You should be ashamed of yourself!

675
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,416
Min-ho!

676
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,795
Kwon Min-ho!

677
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,258
Min-ho!

678
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,442
Are you all right?

679
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,236
Yes. Let's go before it's too late.

680
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,374
Min-ho.

681
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,211
Min-ho!

682
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,964
Ms. Han, you go that way
and I'll go this way.

683
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,048
Okay.

684
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,845
Min-ho.

685
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,765
Min-ho.

686
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,621
Min-ho.

687
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,583
Min-ho.

688
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,085
Min-ho.

689
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,255
Min-ho.

690
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,472
Min-ho!

691
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,063
Min-ho.

692
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,400
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

693
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,320
Have you seen a boy this tall,
around eight years old?

694
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,706
Min-ho!

695
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,333
Min-ho!

696
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,795
Min-ho!

697
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,381
Min-ho.

698
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,134
Who the heck are you?

699
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,137
I'm sorry.

700
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,641
You think saying sorry is enough?
How dare you pull my kid's arm?

701
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,978
I'm sorry.
We mistook him for someone else.

702
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,314
Let's go.

703
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,117
Where could Min-ho be?

704
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,705
Has he been struggling
with anything recently?

705
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,082
Or any concerns?

706
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,334
Not really.

707
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,841
Being apart from his dad

708
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,509
has made him miss him.

709
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,557
Maybe he went to find his dad?

710
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,286
GEUMJE GOCHUJANG

711
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,370
Min-ho!

712
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,497
Min-ho!

713
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,707
Mom.

714
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,794
What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you.

715
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,592
My goodness, you're cold as ice!

716
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,968
I'm sorry.

717
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,057
Why did you do this?

718
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,101
Dad doesn't work here anymore.
Don't you know that?

719
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,104
I know. That's why I came.

720
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,273
I wanted to meet the CEO.

721
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,192
What?

722
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,571
I was going to ask him to hire Dad again.

723
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,576
Then we can live with him again.

724
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,419
So that was why?

725
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,547
Okay. You must be cold.

726
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,383
Let's go.

727
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,761
Let's go.

728
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,640
Get up.

729
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,017
Let's go.

730
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,699
Thank you so much.

731
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,785
We found him before it was too late.

732
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,079
What a relief.

733
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,914
We found him thanks to you.

734
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,626
When I thought he might be gone forever,

735
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,670
I couldn't think straight anymore.

736
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,716
Any parent would feel that way.

737
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,220
Being devastated
when their child's gone, I mean.

738
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,307
Of course.

739
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,895
Any mother would've been the same.

740
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,860
You must've been shaken up. Please rest.

741
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,656
You should treat your cheek too.

742
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,743
Please take care.

743
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,037
Really…

744
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,790
thank you so much.

745
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,225
NANA BAND

746
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,918
Now, put the backpack on.

747
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,713
Here.

748
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,049
There.

749
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,176
Let's brush your hair.

750
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,139
-Mom.
-Yes?

751
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,058
What's wrong with your face?
Did you get hurt?

752
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,560
This?

753
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,229
It's nothing.

754
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,814
Min-ho.

755
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,943
Should I come pick you up from school?

756
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,322
No. I'm going to walk with Dong-u.

757
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,991
Look at me.

758
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,870
Then come straight home, okay?

759
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,623
Don't go somewhere else
without telling me ever again.

760
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,250
I really won't.

761
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,586
I'm going now.

762
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,504
Here, take this.

763
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,840
Have a good day and come straight home!

764
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,013
Greet people politely.

765
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,056
-Okay.
-Go.

766
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,902
I almost forgot! Today is…

767
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,706
Oh, my.

768
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,001
It's been a long time
since I got paid a salary.

769
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,088
It's more than I expected.

770
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,172
I know.

771
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,591
That's it?

772
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,261
When money comes in,

773
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,348
you have to welcome it passionately
to make even more money.

774
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,974
Here, hold this.

775
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,060
Okay.

776
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,229
On the count of three,

777
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,231
holler loudly and run to your right.

778
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,232
Holler? All right.

779
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,900
One, two, three!

780
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,852
Gosh.

781
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,147
Didn't you hurt your back?

782
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,191
You were clutching it
when we went up the stairs earlier.

783
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,277
You're right.

784
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,989
My goodness. I'm being totally honest.

785
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,200
I think I was miraculously cured
the minute I saw this money.

786
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,787
Anyway, what happened to your face?

787
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:45,083
It's just a small scratch. It's nothing.

788
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,293
Anyway,

789
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,712
looking at this

790
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,174
makes me forget all my troubles.

791
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,762
Jeong-suk, what did you want to do
when you got paid?

792
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,643
Go shopping.

793
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,896
Shopping?

794
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,481
Welcome.

795
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,316
I'll take this one.

796
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,817
This bag?

797
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,695
-That's 28,000 won.
-Okay.

798
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,416
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

799
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:31,421
-I'll take this one.
-Okay.

800
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,799
It's for my daughter to study on.

801
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,050
I see.

802
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,021
Let's get shoes.

803
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:48,980
Do you have a size…

804
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,649
I'll take one pack of chwinamul.

805
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,445
-How do I look?
-You look so pretty!

806
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:57,697
Should I get them?

807
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,616
I'll take three of those.

808
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,374
Thank you.

809
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,043
Thank you.

810
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,670
Thank you.

811
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,264
I'll pay.

812
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,869
I gave you extra, so come back again!
Promise me!

813
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,288
-Take a look.
-Next time.

814
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,789
-Come next time.
-I will.

815
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,880
Darling, I'm so thankful.

816
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,590
Dad?

817
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,580
What are you doing?

818
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,249
Your home isn't around here.

819
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,420
-Why did you come back?
-I worried you'd be like this.

820
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,842
Dad should be the one hiding, not you.

821
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,769
About before.

822
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,604
I thought about it…

823
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,609
and realized
I was your age when it happened.

824
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,540
I was 32 years old.

825
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,793
I still wanted to be loved.

826
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,212
I wanted to be seen as attractive.

827
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,759
Jeong-ho, what do you hope Dad will bring?

828
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,803
Rubber shoes with the train logo. You?

829
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,889
A bag of hard candy.

830
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:54,100
Your dad's coming home after months.

831
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,769
Are his gifts more important?

832
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,229
Mom, don't you want anything?

833
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:02,150
All I want is for your father
to return safe and sound.

834
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,070
Making money in a place
where he doesn't know anyone

835
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,946
must have been hard for him.

836
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,785
Dad's home!

837
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,620
-Dad!
-Dad!

838
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,582
How have you been?

839
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:18,750
Good.

840
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,629
Come on in.

841
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,597
After all that big talk
about making money in Seoul

842
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,392
and not coming home empty-handed…

843
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,564
I didn't think he meant
he'd be holding another woman's hand.

844
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:48,238
It happened to quite a lot of women
back in the day.

845
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,243
I tried to pull myself together.

846
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,792
Mom, I have to pee.

847
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,880
You have to pee?

848
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,473
It's Dad.

849
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,520
What's going on? Why are you so late?

850
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,897
I told you already.

851
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:29,028
Let's go inside. Did you miss me?

852
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,113
Of course I did.

853
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,213
I couldn't stop my heart

854
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,216
from breaking into a million pieces.

855
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,972
Could you wash this too?

856
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,223
Ms. Lee?

857
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,894
How dare she, in my house?

858
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,062
And on top of my children's clothes?

859
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,857
I lost it for a moment.

860
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,030
Are you insane?

861
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:14,908
Hey!

862
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,410
-Let go!
-Come on!

863
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,913
You let go first, you crazy bitch!

864
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,456
What the hell are you doing?

865
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,169
Are you all right?

866
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,505
Let me see.

867
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,131
Yong-deok.

868
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,681
Don't cry. Let's go in first.

869
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,266
Don't cry, okay?

870
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,484
It's up here!

871
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:51,653
Hey!

872
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,865
Mom!

873
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:00,870
Mom.

874
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,664
Let's go.

875
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,217
Mom, why are you going this way?

876
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,385
Aren't we going home?

877
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:19,013
That's not our home anymore.

878
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,392
The three of us will live by ourselves.

879
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:31,609
You know how I've lived after that
better than anyone.

880
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,362
It's a path I chose.

881
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,783
But whenever things got tough,
I felt angrier and more wronged

882
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,702
than I normally did.

883
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,121
Their blind lust

884
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,958
ruined my life and my family.

885
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:49,961
Mom.

886
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:51,838
That's why

887
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,549
I couldn't stand it

888
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,845
when I found out my own daughter
was selling products

889
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,471
a woman like her would wear.

890
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,642
I know you.

891
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:09,647
I know you're doing it to make ends meet.

892
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,489
My pitiful baby.

893
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,160
Whenever I'd say hurtful things to you,

894
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,038
my heart broke into pieces.

895
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,791
But…

896
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,879
it was not easy to accept it.

897
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:45,642
It's stopped raining.

898
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:49,729
Min-ho must be waiting for you. Go home!

899
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,608
Here.

900
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,402
What's this?

901
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,654
Today is payday.

902
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,989
I thought about getting thermals
but got those instead.

903
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,996
I'm too old for this.

904
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,333
-I have no one to show it off to.
-It's not for anyone else to see!

905
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,959
Wear it for yourself.

906
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,397
Mom.

907
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,816
Where did you go so suddenly?

908
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,276
Nowhere really.

909
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,404
Why do you have your bag on?

910
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,863
Because I like it!

911
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,825
I want tomorrow to come faster!

912
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,368
I want to show Dong-u.

913
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,829
Would you like some?

914
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,249
You have them.

915
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,918
I'll be back after washing the dishes.

916
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:17,442
Deep down, I knew about Mom's pain.

917
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,993
Your father's very drunk.

918
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,162
Let's go inside.

919
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,333
Ever since that woman came,

920
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,754
Mom always looked exhausted.

921
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,484
The sadness she bore

922
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:04,405
looked so heavy,
even in the eyes of a child.

923
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,662
DAESUNG STEAMED BUNS

924
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,747
Jeong-suk.

925
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,457
Here, have one.

926
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,836
Mom, you're not having one?

927
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,215
It's for you.

928
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,050
Isn't that heavy?

929
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,927
It's not heavy at all.

930
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,681
We can buy rice
and the pastries you like with this.

931
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,183
It's not heavy at all.

932
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,228
It's tasty.

933
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,898
Is it that good?

934
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,526
-Yes.
-My goodness. Take your time.

935
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,486
DON'T BE ANXIOUS
CONFESS AND FIND HOPE

936
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,780
I believed her
when she said it wasn't heavy.

937
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,077
No, now that I think about it,

938
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,122
I think I wanted to believe so.

939
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:21,399
Why did she spend money on this
when she's struggling herself?

940
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:43,170
While I've believed
that she's fine since she's Mom,

941
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,756
so much time has passed.

942
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:50,845
She must have been
unimaginably lonely that whole time.

943
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,650
Now that I'm a mother…

944
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,112
it pains me terribly.

945
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,022
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

946
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,483
I think I found the culprit.

947
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,735
Who is it?

948
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,904
I'm planning to join you.

949
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,656
-Yes, that's great!
-Yes.

950
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,825
I think the four of us
can achieve great things.

951
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:55,910
It's cool.

952
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,704
-But what work do you do, Mom?
-What?

953
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,457
"Fantasy Lingerie Survey."

954
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,336
We're doing a survey
regarding our in-home sales.

955
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:08,381
I thought she'd have
changed her mind by now.

956
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,841
Shouldn't the town ladies
call a town meeting

957
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,427
to force her to stop that business?

958
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,595
What is she doing?

959
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:15,888
"Close my business"?

960
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,516
I won't. I can't!

961
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:27,900
