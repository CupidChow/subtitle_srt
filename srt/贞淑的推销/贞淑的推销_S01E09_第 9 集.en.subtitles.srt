1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,710
It's true that I was trying
to keep my distance.

3
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,381
But it wasn't because of the reasons
you had in mind.

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,093
It's just that when I'm with you,

5
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,263
I become a bit confused.

6
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,057
That was why I avoided you.

7
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,435
Because of me?

8
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,606
What are you confused about?

9
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,899
I don't know.

10
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,235
So,

11
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,404
I want to check.

12
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,115
What?

13
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,188
What do you want to check all of a sudden?

14
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,273
My feelings for you.

15
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,735
I'm sorry if I startled you.

16
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,614
But I think I know for sure now.

17
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,201
Ms. Han, I think of you as…

18
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,578
Oh, a forever friend

19
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,038
…a forever friend…

20
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,166
Oh, a heart full of happiness

21
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,254
That came out wrong.

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,133
It's already late.

23
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,717
My goodness.

24
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,236
He wanted to check his feelings?
I don't understand.

25
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,451
No, thinking about this
is a luxury I don't have right now.

26
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,795
Damn it.
That man will call the police, right?

27
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,007
That was why I asked you to help.

28
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,967
How could you only act as a lookout?

29
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,554
It would've been quicker if you helped.
You dragged your feet and--

30
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,055
Shut your mouth!

31
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,641
You said you'd only get back
what you lost.

32
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,060
You broke the door
and stole all the jewelry.

33
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,105
Had I known, I wouldn't have said yes.

34
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,483
I did all the work, so don't make a fuss.

35
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,154
Don't get scared. Nothing will happen.

36
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,409
What?

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,954
-What?
-Damn it.

38
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,124
Mister.

39
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,004
-Mister. Oh, no.
-Get back in the car.

40
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,881
He needs to go to the hospital.

41
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,424
It's too late!

42
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,969
If you don't want to end up behind bars,
get back in the car.

43
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,597
You need to wake up, sir.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,641
-Hurry up.
-Mister!

45
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,851
Mister.

46
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,434
Oh, no.

47
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,570
A person…

48
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,241
There's a dead person.

49
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,912
No, he's dying.

50
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,290
I think he got hit by a car.

51
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,375
The location?

52
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,086
It's across the Geumje Mill
at the three-way junction.

53
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,005
Please come--

54
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,507
You crazy bastard.

55
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,426
Why don't you just call the police?

56
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,137
Take this and get lost.

57
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,980
What should I do?

58
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,945
-Is the operating room ready?
-Yes.

59
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,365
Honey. Honey!

60
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,575
It's an emergency. Move!

61
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,327
Honey!

62
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,620
Honey!

63
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,705
Honey!

64
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,377
Honey.

65
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,464
CAUTION
OFF-LIMITS

66
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,257
You can't enter.

67
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,551
Thank you. Please help with that.

68
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,598
Hey.

69
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,268
The victim's name is Choi Won-bong.
He's 58 years old.

70
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:55,730
He's the pharmacist at Wonbong Pharmacy.

71
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,106
How is he now?

72
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,734
He's getting surgery at Geumje Hospital.

73
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,780
Seeing as how his wallet was untouched,

74
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,199
I don't think it was robbery.

75
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,952
The car came from there,
so I think it was DUI.

76
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,253
-Did you take a photo of this?
-Did anyone witness the accident?

77
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,506
No?

78
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,468
Let's wake people at the restaurant
and electronics store and…

79
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,178
The same culprit?

80
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,639
The hit-and-run culprit
and the jewelry store robbers

81
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,766
are the same people?

82
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,603
I checked the route from the jewelry store
to where the hit-and-run happened

83
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,146
and found skid marks.

84
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:42,318
It looks like they sped off in the car
after running into a witness,

85
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,530
spotted the victim and hit the brakes,
leaving the skid marks.

86
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,784
The marks match the tire marks
we found in front of the jewelry store.

87
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,078
I was going to say that.

88
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,579
Detective Kim, you're fast.

89
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,332
Then you should run the investigation.

90
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,293
I don't want to make
my junior detective look bad.

91
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,503
Keep going.

92
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,299
Let's look for the hit-and-run witnesses
and the theft suspects simultaneously.

93
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,761
All right. The two of you,
good luck with the investigation.

94
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,888
I'm sure it'll be
quite frustrating though.

95
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,723
That's how he'll learn.

96
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,478
Who were you looking at just now?

97
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,064
Captain. Me?

98
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,068
They're my eyes.
Why do you care who I look at?

99
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,613
I'll visit the victim at Geumje Hospital.

100
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,781
Okay.

101
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,866
See you later.

102
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,786
-The same culprit?
-Yes.

103
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,456
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

104
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,209
When were you supposed to meet
your husband?

105
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,132
We were supposed to meet
at Mokhwa Restaurant at 7 p.m.

106
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,845
I waited an hour, but he didn't turn up.

107
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,265
So I called the pharmacy,
but he didn't pick up.

108
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,313
Why did the accident happen there?

109
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,487
At the scene,

110
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,948
we found a scarf and a package
that read, "Jung Yeon-ja Fashion."

111
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,534
Do you know what it is?

112
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,663
It's…

113
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,418
a clothing store I frequent.

114
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,463
JUNG YEON-JA FASHION

115
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
I think

116
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,225
it's a wedding anniversary gift.

117
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,607
I had no idea

118
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,776
and resented him for being late.

119
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,169
I'm sorry. You must be busy.

120
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,129
It's okay.

121
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,841
Once he regains consciousness,
I'll come visit once more.

122
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,102
When did you come back?

123
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,396
Why aren't you coming inside?

124
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,482
The thing is…

125
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,197
You know,

126
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,702
there's something I want to say to you.

127
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,079
I was waiting for you, but I dozed off.

128
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,748
What is it?

129
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,170
You know…

130
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,843
I'm going to have this baby.

131
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,095
What?

132
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,392
Someone told me

133
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,272
that they see hope in my life.

134
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,941
So I gave it some thought.

135
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,278
If I live a bit more diligently,

136
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,449
there might be a way.

137
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,370
So I changed my mind.

138
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,002
If you're happy, say so.

139
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,254
I won't criticize you for being silly.

140
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,551
Although I may be
hard on you all the time,

141
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,513
I respect you.

142
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,975
For many years,

143
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,397
you never went back to your old ways
and caused trouble.

144
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,732
It's easier said than done.

145
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,197
What's up with you?

146
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,368
Do you feel pressured
now that I want to have this baby?

147
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,286
No.

148
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,914
You made the right call.

149
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,002
I'm glad you changed your mind.

150
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,050
I wanted you to be the first to know,

151
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,721
so I haven't told my colleagues yet.

152
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,393
Now I'll tell them I'm pregnant.

153
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,857
I'll work harder from now on.

154
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,875
GEUMJE HOSPITAL

155
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,058
Ms. Oh.

156
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,770
Jeong-suk.

157
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,024
How…

158
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,693
Did the surgery go well?

159
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,404
Yes.

160
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,740
He lost a lot of blood,

161
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,451
so it would've been dangerous
had he come a bit later.

162
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,246
But he hasn't regained consciousness.

163
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,000
They need to keep an eye on him
for possible brain swelling.

164
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,255
Jeong-suk.

165
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,133
You know…

166
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,640
I always complained about
how he never expressed affection.

167
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,144
But come to think of it,

168
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,189
I was the one who didn't.

169
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,276
I didn't tell him how grateful I am

170
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,529
and how much I love him.

171
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,032
What if

172
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,327
I don't get to tell him these things?

173
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,454
Don't say that.

174
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,040
He'll wake up soon.

175
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,254
Mr. Choi!

176
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,424
How did this happen?

177
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,051
Wake up.

178
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,345
Calm down, Dae-geun.

179
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,556
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

180
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,600
You nagged me so much yesterday,

181
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,312
so I prayed for a day off.

182
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,025
I kept the pharmacy door open
because I was in a hurry.

183
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,236
Scold me!

184
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,988
Stop, Dae-geun.

185
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,906
He needs rest.

186
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,702
What?

187
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,371
Ms. Oh, Mr. Choi's hand…

188
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,501
Honey.

189
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,170
Honey, can you hear me?

190
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,131
Honey, wake up.

191
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,055
Honey!

192
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,141
Excuse me!

193
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,769
Please come to Mr. Choi's room.

194
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,231
Thankfully, you're recovering quickly.

195
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,650
Your blood pressure shouldn't rise,
so please relax.

196
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,068
Take care.

197
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,987
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Okay.

198
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,204
Thank goodness.

199
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,916
When I collapsed…

200
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,004
I got worried I'd never see you again.

201
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,131
Honey.

202
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,183
Mr. Choi.

203
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,101
Mr. Choi.

204
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,772
Mr. Choi.

205
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,858
It hurts.

206
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,026
You're hurting him.

207
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,823
Dae-geun.

209
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,533
Yes?

210
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,577
Can you do me a favor?

211
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,787
Of course.

212
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,790
There aren't many pharmacies in the town.

213
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,001
The pharmacy can't stay closed.

214
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,965
Would you please man the pharmacy
in my stead?

215
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,008
Okay. Of course.

216
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,346
I'll take care of the pharmacy
until you return!

217
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,932
Okay, thank you.

218
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,016
Yes, sir!

219
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,227
-Get going.
-Okay!

220
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,271
Bye.

221
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,658
It's finally quiet in here.

222
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,081
Are you okay?

223
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,625
I told him to man the pharmacy. Why…

224
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,509
Hello, Detective.

225
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,930
The nurse told me
that he regained consciousness.

226
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,475
I'm Detective Kim Do-hyeon
of Geumje Police Station.

227
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,393
Hello.

228
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,771
Ms. Oh, I'll go back to the office.

229
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,982
-Okay. You should get going.
-Bye.

230
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,034
I'd like to ask a few questions
about yesterday.

231
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,452
Okay.

232
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,787
CHOI WON-BONG / MALE / 58

233
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,123
So, you heard two people fighting?

234
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,709
Yes.

235
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,087
I can't remember clearly, but

236
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:32,051
one man was yelling,
asking the other to just go.

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,681
The other man was trying to see
if I was okay.

238
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,352
I think I felt his hand touching my face.

239
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,190
Will you be able to recognize
their voices?

240
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,986
I lost consciousness right away, so…

241
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,071
I'm sorry.

242
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,324
It's okay. You must be pretty out of it.
Thank you for your cooperation.

243
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,450
Okay.

244
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,454
By the way,

245
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,749
could we find the person
who called the ambulance for my husband?

246
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,543
He didn't identify himself,
so it'll be hard.

247
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,170
I see.

248
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,633
I just wanted to thank him
since he saved my husband's life.

249
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,552
In any case, we're in your care.

250
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,929
Okay.

251
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,347
I wish you a speedy recovery.

252
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,183
Okay. I'm sorry
that I wasn't much of a help.

253
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,523
Yes, Ju-ri.

254
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,234
I can't postpone
the branch manager training.

255
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,527
So please help me.

256
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,988
Please call Yeong-bok too.

257
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,701
Okay. Thank you.

258
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,488
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

259
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,494
But I couldn't keep avoiding you
without an explanation.

260
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,835
I like you

261
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,795
a lot.

262
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,257
I realized my feelings recently,

263
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,593
but I didn't develop
these feelings overnight.

264
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,514
Perhaps it started
when seeing you struggle

265
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,475
made my heart ache.

266
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,896
Or perhaps it started

267
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,732
when you made me
forget my situation and laugh.

268
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,652
Perhaps it was when I realized
you had a beautiful smile.

269
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,279
I don't know for sure.

270
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,660
I know it may feel sudden,
but please think about it

271
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,913
and give me your answer.

272
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,921
No.

273
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,548
I won't think about it.

274
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,427
I haven't given a serious thought

275
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,639
to my feelings for you.

276
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,476
But even if I did,
it wouldn't change anything.

277
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,604
No matter the conclusion,

278
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,148
I have no intention to date you.

279
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,862
Now I want to be a good mom to Min-ho

280
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,657
and work hard to do so.

281
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,827
I only want to focus on those two things.

282
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,167
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,964
I should give one to Mr. Choi.

284
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,343
I'm glad the injury wasn't more serious.

285
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,512
That's right. He was fortunate
in many ways.

286
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,680
Yes.

287
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,726
My goodness.

288
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,979
It's time for him to get X-ray scans.

289
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,489
Ms. Oh, that's not how you do it.

290
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,368
Look, this is how you do it.

291
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,412
My goodness.

292
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,914
Shouldn't there be a caretaker?

293
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,249
Seriously.

294
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,919
You can't even lift the bed.
How will you put him in a wheelchair?

295
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,006
I'll help you out.

296
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,507
It's okay.

297
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,968
I was just unfamiliar with the bed.

298
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,014
He isn't a giant.
I can take care of him by myself.

299
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,265
All right.

300
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,933
Hold on.

301
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,477
Honey.

302
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,813
Ms. Oh, I'll help you.

303
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,441
Mr. Choi.

304
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,527
One, two, three. There you go.

305
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:08,970
Hello?

306
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,601
It's you. Honey, where are you?

307
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:18,396
I'm at the hospital.

308
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,776
I dropped by Ju-ri's salon
and heard about the accident.

309
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,236
So I dashed here.

310
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,821
An accident?

311
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,490
You know the pharmacist
at Wonbong Pharmacy, right?

312
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,576
He's my colleague's husband.

313
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,372
He got into a hit-and-run yesterday.

314
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,749
What…

315
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,753
What happened to him?

316
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,257
He regained consciousness earlier.

317
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,092
Thankfully, he's turned the corner.

318
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,263
That's good to hear.

319
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,975
That's really good to hear.

320
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,312
Gosh, my husband is so caring.

321
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,732
Why are you choking up
when you barely know the man?

322
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:08,238
In any case, bring some towels from home

323
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,740
and get some toiletries
from the supermarket.

324
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,661
Ms. Oh couldn't bring anything
because she was in a hurry.

325
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,288
Me?

326
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,290
How about Eun-ji?

327
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,959
Yeong-sik's mom can watch her for a while.

328
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,462
It's Room 405 at Geumje Hospital.

329
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,547
I'm hanging up.

330
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,685
-I'm giving a lecture?
-Yes.

331
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,856
Educating new recruits is one
of the branch manager's responsibilities.

332
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,941
There are no recruits from Geumje,

333
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,736
so those from nearby regions will come.

334
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,905
I see.

335
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,033
Please continue with
your promotion training until tomorrow

336
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,327
and begin working
on your upcoming lecture.

337
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,164
You know about the products
better than I do now,

338
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,082
so I'm sure you'll do well.

339
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,794
I see. Okay.

340
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,874
Who is it?

341
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,795
Well, I…

342
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,090
I'm Ms. Seo Yeong-bok's husband.

343
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,092
She told me to bring these.

344
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,010
I see.

345
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,472
I think she's stepped out for a moment.

346
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,808
You should take a seat on the couch.

347
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,311
It's okay. Bye.

348
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,313
Wait.

349
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,529
By any chance,

350
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,531
could you…

351
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,292
take me to the restroom?

352
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,971
Overnight,

353
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,559
I became someone
who can't even wash his hands properly.

354
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,316
Thank you.

355
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,651
Receiving help from a man is much better.

356
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,281
-What?
-Is he your husband?

357
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,198
Yes.

358
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,283
You're here.

359
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,702
Hello.

360
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,330
I'm sorry.

361
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,499
We were talking in the lounge
since you had fallen asleep.

362
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,751
It's okay.

363
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,421
He took me to the restroom

364
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,506
and washed my hands, too.

365
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,885
Why does a man have
housewife's eczema on his hands?

366
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,679
Gosh, it must've been hard.

367
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,265
It wasn't hard at all.
I'll take my leave now.

368
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,142
Why would you leave so soon?

369
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,228
Mr. Choi must be bored.
You should talk to him for a while.

370
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,271
What?

371
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,858
Mr. Choi can't move his limbs right now.

372
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,777
He can't even read a book.

373
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,112
Seriously.

374
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,657
I don't know who it is, but the culprit
deserves divine punishment!

375
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,118
-Gosh.
-Don't be so angry anymore.

376
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,244
I'll get you some juice.

377
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,164
It's okay. I'll get going now.

378
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,000
-But…
-We couldn't even thank you.

379
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,631
I guess he's in a hurry
because he has to pick up Eun-ji.

380
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,606
Honey.

381
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,650
Are you crying?

382
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,194
Yeong-bok.

383
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,278
What's wrong?

384
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,698
You looked so troubled earlier.

385
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,909
Did something happen?

386
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,289
This is so frustrating!
Talk to me. What's wrong?

387
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,668
You're killing me now.

388
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,548
Let's talk at home, okay? I need to go.

389
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,675
It was me.

390
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,718
What?

391
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:46,224
The culprit who deserves divine punishment

392
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,893
is me.

393
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,523
What are you…

394
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,900
What?

395
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,491
My goodness. It isn't true, right?

396
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,202
It isn't what I think it is, right?

397
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,247
Right? I must be insane
for having such a terrible thought!

398
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,627
Say it isn't true.

399
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,882
Hurry up and say it isn't true. Oh, no.

400
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,762
Oh, no.

401
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,055
How could this be?

402
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,557
What are we going to do?

403
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,816
I should turn myself in, right?

404
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,197
You think so?

405
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,491
What about our children then?

406
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,495
Back in the day, they were clueless
because they were young.

407
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,083
But it's different now.

408
00:29:55,543 --> 00:30:00,006
The entire town will talk about you.

409
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,549
Okay?

410
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,595
Then what should I do? Abort the baby?

411
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,763
Should I?

412
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,474
This baby doesn't deserve that.

413
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,143
You have a point, but…

414
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,439
You swore in prison that day.

415
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,608
Do you remember? You remember, right?

416
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,761
Your body must be heavy.
You didn't have to come.

417
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,263
Well,

418
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,559
Mother said she could watch Eom-ji.

419
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,896
Is Eom-ji doing well?

420
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,773
Doesn't she miss me?

421
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,650
Of course she does.

422
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,863
Her father she was inseparable from
disappeared overnight.

423
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:10,368
I told Eom-ji
that you went to Saudi Arabia

424
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,786
to earn money.

425
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,709
Right.

426
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:23,339
Eom-ji knows how to write now too.

427
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,593
-Already?
-Yes.

428
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,722
She wrote a letter to you.
Make sure to read it.

429
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,683
Good.

430
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,918
Dad, earn a lot of money
and come home soon.

431
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,004
I miss you a lot.

432
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,567
Compared to that day,

433
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,278
things will be unimaginably harder.

434
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,657
I know that, but--

435
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,783
What?

436
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,994
So, you know.

437
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,915
But you feel so guilty?

438
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,669
Don't act so conscientious now.
It's not even funny.

439
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,175
I will do

440
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,885
anything

441
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,348
for my children, whatever it is.

442
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,683
Understood?

443
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,729
The best you can do now…

444
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,818
is not getting caught until the end.

445
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,695
Understood?

446
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,407
Don't cry.

447
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,494
I'll never visit you in prison again

448
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,163
with a baby in my belly.

449
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,957
I'll never do that again.

450
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,917
-Honey.
-Don't touch me.

451
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,424
My goodness.

452
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,920
CAUTION
OFF-LIMITS

453
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,215
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

454
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,009
Let us ask you something.

455
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,929
Did you pass by this place around
8 to 8:30 p.m. in the last two days?

456
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,098
No, I didn't.

457
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,894
Did anyone come in after July 10th
to get their car fixed

458
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,146
for a broken windshield and bumper?

459
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,398
I can't remember all the cars.

460
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,010
CHESTNUTS

461
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,389
-Eleven. I added two more chestnuts.
-Thank you.

462
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,308
All right. Thank you.

463
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,143
Let's go.

464
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,478
Why did you buy chestnuts?

465
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,108
Someone I know is unwell. He likes yakbap.

466
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,692
So I want to make it for him.

467
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,944
I see.

468
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,323
What? Mom, I want a corn dog.

469
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,450
You like it too, right?

470
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,245
Yes.

471
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,205
Shall we eat it since it has been a while?

472
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,335
Hello.

473
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,088
What? Mister.

474
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,632
Min-ho, hello. Have you been well?

475
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,842
Yes, mister.

476
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,886
I became much better at gonggi.

477
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,930
Can you come visit sometime?

478
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,724
Well…

479
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,061
Min-ho, he's busy.

480
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,898
Two corn dogs to go, please.

481
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,608
I'm sorry.

482
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,861
These are the last ones for today,

483
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,280
and he ordered them already.

484
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,115
I see.

485
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,534
Min-ho, shall we eat donuts instead?

486
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,703
Ma'am, please give the corn dogs to them.

487
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,039
It's okay. You wanted them.

488
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,417
It's okay. I'm not that crazy about them.

489
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,545
I just needed to fill my stomach,
so I can eat other things.

490
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,267
Hello.

491
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,395
Aren't our corn dogs ready yet?

492
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,023
I canceled the order
to eat something else.

493
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:32,982
What?

494
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:37,612
You said this place's corn dogs
were what you like the most in this town.

495
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,949
You were so happy they weren't sold out.
Why did you change your mind?

496
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,326
I can eat donuts.

497
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,662
You said you hated
how donuts stick to your teeth--

498
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,748
Min-ho, bye.

499
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,000
Take care.

500
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,335
Okay.

501
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,754
Let's go.

502
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,505
Bye, mister.

503
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,965
Bye.

504
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,509
Bye.

505
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,065
-Mom.
-Yes?

506
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,526
Mister must've given up
the corn dogs on purpose, right?

507
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,654
Yes.

508
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,366
It's really hard to give up the food
you want to eat.

509
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,117
It must be affection.

510
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,871
What? It isn't like that.

511
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,082
What? No?

512
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,420
I thought he liked me a lot.

513
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,756
Right.

514
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,301
Yes, it's true.

515
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,513
He likes you a lot.

516
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,100
Is it tasty? I should try it too.

517
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,107
It's really tasty, right?

518
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,193
It's crispy and sweet.

519
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,115
You're right.

520
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,122
Welcome.

521
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,420
Do you need anything?

522
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:22,174
I have a canker sore in my mouth,
so I need an ointment.

523
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,343
An ointment for the mouth?

524
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,067
Okay. Here it is.

525
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,402
How much is it?

526
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,738
It's 2,550 won.

527
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,293
Excuse me.

528
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,462
Yes?

529
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,256
I'm sorry about that night.

530
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,179
I should've confessed my love
and asked for permission first.

531
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,307
I regretted it
since you could've been offended.

532
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:12,892
What?

533
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,103
-Why would you apologize?
-What?

534
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,856
Had I been offended,
I would've kicked you off right away.

535
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,274
I also thought…

536
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,819
it was nice.

537
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,781
It was nice? Really?

538
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,324
Was it nice?

539
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,161
Then why didn't you show it?

540
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,581
There was no time to do that.

541
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,792
You ran off as soon as you saw me.

542
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,007
In any case, I'm glad to know
that I didn't offend you.

543
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:51,263
Look, I'll be more serious with you

544
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,057
from now on.

545
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,978
No. I hate seriousness.

546
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,982
If you want to go out with me,
keep things casual.

547
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,777
How?

548
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:18,707
Will you be able to handle
a casual relationship?

549
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,876
I can handle it really well.

550
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,504
I think I'm talented.

551
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,591
Right. I need to go to the hospital.

552
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,552
-What?
-See you later then.

553
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,471
Ju-ri!

554
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,435
GEUMJE HOSPITAL

555
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,686
Hey.

556
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,896
Yakbap.

557
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,484
It's so tasty.

558
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,945
He ate it with gusto.

559
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,155
Thank you, Jeong-suk.

560
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,491
I couldn't visit often due to work.

561
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,703
You and Yeong-bok are doing so much.

562
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,787
That's right.

563
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,040
This incident made me see
Yeong-bok in a new light.

564
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,002
You're such a loyal friend.

565
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,671
Gosh, that's an overstatement.

566
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,259
Jeong-suk, how is work
as a branch manager?

567
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,845
That's right. I heard
you'll train new recruits soon.

568
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,929
Yes.

569
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,265
While I prepared,

570
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,768
I thought that it'd be nice
to make a brochure.

571
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,897
We can put product details in it
to use it for training

572
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,607
and for in-home sales.

573
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,111
Right. Other in-home sales companies
have those brochures as well.

574
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,614
Let's get to it
after my husband's discharge.

575
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,283
We can have a meeting during the party.

576
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,160
What? Will you throw a party?

577
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,207
I want to invite people I'm thankful for.

578
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,293
It was such a sudden hardship in life,

579
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,504
and it made me feel so lost
even at my age.

580
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,424
But you guys ran over and worried about us

581
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,762
and looked after us like a family.

582
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,725
Meeting you guys has been
the biggest blessing in my life.

583
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:06,273
I also think that all the time.

584
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,360
Same here.

585
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,863
The four in-home sales sisters

586
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,699
should stay together forever.

587
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,494
We can do it if we don't fight

588
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,288
and you guys live long
without getting sick.

589
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,415
What is she talking about?

590
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,500
Health is the best.

591
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,876
Wait, there's a chestnut.

592
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,963
Yes. I bought them at the market.

593
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,297
Open wide.

594
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,759
-Wow, it's tasty.
-Really?

595
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,094
Jeong-suk, you too.

596
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,683
Jeong-suk.

597
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,018
I couldn't tell you this earlier.

598
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,104
I have a boyfriend now.

599
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,855
So suddenly?

600
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,400
I've known him for a while.

601
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:53,028
We suddenly ended up being physical.

602
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,948
I see.

603
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:59,827
But when I actually thought
about dating him, I got hesitant.

604
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,079
Right.

605
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,081
You have a child too.

606
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,959
Come on. Having a child doesn't matter.

607
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,919
I've had no trouble dating.

608
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,005
I see.

609
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:17,261
Were you flustered
since you guys got physical first?

610
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:21,557
Come on. That doesn't matter either.

611
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,268
I had butterflies in my stomach too.

612
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,895
Then why…

613
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,148
He isn't my ideal type.

614
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,276
I get tired of men quickly
if they aren't smart.

615
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,778
I see.

616
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,406
But I guess I'll know once I date him.

617
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,535
If I have fun spending time with him,

618
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,245
that means I like him too.

619
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,665
Then that's it.
I should just go out with him.

620
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,419
I see.

621
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,678
Why don't we meet
in front of the telephone booth?

622
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,890
Okay. Thank you.

623
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,351
What is it?

624
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,354
About the report from the telephone booth
near the hit-and-run location,

625
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,397
someone saw a man using
the telephone booth

626
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,108
around the time
the police received the report.

627
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,736
Why are you chasing the man
who called 119?

628
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,781
It's strange that there was blood
in the telephone booth.

629
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,494
The victim said the culprit touched
his face while checking on him.

630
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,371
Perhaps the blood got on the culprit then.

631
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,498
Are you saying

632
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,793
that the jewelry store robber
and the hit-and-run driver

633
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,544
made a report on the run?

634
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,630
That could've gotten him caught.

635
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,300
I'm not certain, but I'll hear
about his appearance

636
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,762
and compare it to what the jewelry store
robbery witness told us about the suspect.

637
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,014
I see.

638
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:49,353
If they match,
the cases might get resolved easily.

639
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,021
I'll meet up with the witness

640
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,899
and see if I can get
the recording of the 119 call.

641
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,234
Okay.

642
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,046
I like you

643
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:17,965
a lot.

644
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,095
But I guess I'll know once I date him.

645
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,848
If I have fun spending time with him,

646
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,891
that means I like him too.

647
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,520
Then that's it.
I should just go out with him.

648
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,736
A person…

649
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,156
There's a dead person.

650
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,786
A person…

651
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,164
There's a dead person.

652
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,835
A person…

653
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,962
There's a dead person.

654
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,179
Hello?

655
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,140
It's me, Han Jeong-suk.

656
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,938
By any chance, are you free tomorrow?

657
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,692
What?

658
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,738
Here. Open wide.

659
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,825
All right.

660
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,254
I told you to leave it there.

661
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,424
You should go home now.

662
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,425
It's okay.

663
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,970
You saw me put him in a wheelchair
without a problem earlier.

664
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,140
If you stay longer,
that'll be you thinking I'm incompetent.

665
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,226
Thank you.

666
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,605
I'll treat you properly
after I get discharged.

667
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,900
-Okay.
-I'll get going then.

668
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,402
-All right.
-Bye.

669
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,863
Take care.

670
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,762
You're home.

671
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,113
I don't need to go anymore now.

672
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,075
I'm sorry.

673
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,661
You're such a kind woman,

674
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,248
so every moment must be an agony.

675
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,084
Don't say such a meaningless thing.

676
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,797
Don't get weak either.

677
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,258
Okay.

678
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,764
I'll go and get some air.

679
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,960
I've never raised a child.

680
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,922
I didn't know what your girls would like,
so I had to think for a while.

681
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,216
What do you think?

682
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,594
Do you think your girls will like them?

683
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,493
PARK JONG-SEON

684
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,144
Done.

685
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,689
Mom, how do I look? Do I look pretty?

686
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,190
Of course, you look pretty.

687
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,610
Have a nice day.

688
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,862
-See you later.
-Okay.

689
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,782
-See you later.
-See you later.

690
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,139
She'll be uncomfortable
if I dress up too much.

691
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,015
Let's dress as modestly as possible.

692
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,851
Just like always.

693
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,907
This is just like
how I normally dress, right?

694
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:50,464
Good morning.

695
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,678
What? What morning?

696
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,306
Did something good happen?

697
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,183
No.

698
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:08,899
When a man changes suddenly,
it's one of two things.

699
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,067
He either won the lottery

700
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,486
or began dating a woman.

701
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,279
It's neither.

702
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:18,116
I heard that you found a lead
at the telephone booth.

703
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,160
Is that why you're excited?

704
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,039
Are you on cloud nine for beating a senior
and receiving attention?

705
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,290
Stop being jealous!

706
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:29,836
Detective Na, play the recording
of the 119 report call

707
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,049
to the head of the town and townspeople
and see if they recognize the voice.

708
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:34,966
And Detective Kim--

709
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,886
I'll put together the clues we have so far
and give you an interim report.

710
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,555
Okay. You know what you're doing.

711
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:45,101
It's Saturday, so let's wrap up quickly
and go home.

712
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:55,362
FANTASY LINGERIE
FOR WOMEN'S BEAUTY

713
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,659
Hello.

714
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:05,205
I'm Branch Manager Han Jeong-suk,
and I'll explain the products.

715
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,628
Firstly, I'll introduce the clothes.

716
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,965
These are called costumes.

717
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:18,802
A costume represents a person
or a character of a certain time period

718
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,762
or a job.

719
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,307
It's an outfit for role-playing.

720
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,914
YONGIN FARMLAND
COFFEE SHOP, RESTAURANT NEARBY…

721
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,082
Perfect.

722
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,918
Let's do this.

723
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,799
What?

724
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,635
GEUMJE POLICE STATION

725
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,620
Jeong-suk.

726
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,789
I'm sorry for being late.

727
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,541
My car suddenly broke down.

728
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,001
Oh, no.

729
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,462
You must've waited for a long time.

730
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,880
No, it's okay.

731
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,552
Where should we go?

732
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:48,183
I had a place in mind,
but we can't go there on foot.

733
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,644
Please give me a second to think.

734
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,689
Which place did you have in mind?

735
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,235
A theme park called the Farmland.

736
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,906
There's a Ferris wheel and…

737
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:10,080
You can also take a bus
and see animals like lions and tigers.

738
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,874
I thought it'd be nice to eat
at a Western restaurant

739
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:16,920
and look around the place, but…

740
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,129
We can do that.

741
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,465
What?

742
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,719
Let's go to a theme park
and eat something tasty.

743
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,402
I wanted to buy you a full-course meal.

744
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,948
I'm going to eat cotton candy too,
so it's a full-course meal.

745
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,747
I'm sure this doesn't compare
to the Farmland.

746
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:56,042
But Oksan Land has
many things to see and enjoy.

747
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,919
I've been here a few times with Min-ho.

748
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,505
Which ride do you like?

749
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,801
I've never been on any.

750
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,638
Since Min-ho was young,
I was busy babysitting.

751
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,765
I see.

752
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:15,061
Wow, every ride looks fun.

753
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,400
Why don't we go on every ride today?

754
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,500
My goodness.

755
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,753
You should've said so if you were scared.

756
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,923
No. I'm having fun.

757
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,010
Shall we go on the rides once more?

758
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,929
No, it's okay.

759
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,813
I put the eyes on the Dooly plushies
as a side job in the past.

760
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:43,108
I think I put the eyes on that plushie.

761
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,237
You must have
many of those plushies at home.

762
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,989
No, I just put eyes on them for work.

763
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,575
I don't have a single one.

764
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,704
Shall I win you one then?

765
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:58,873
What?

766
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,001
NUMBER 1 PRIZE
DOOLY PLUSHIE (10 POPS)

767
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:06,840
You have to pop ten balloons for Dooly.
It's too hard.

768
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,884
The price is 1,000 won.
It's too expensive.

769
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,928
In the police academy,

770
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,430
I always got a perfect score
in shooting.

771
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,683
Follow me.

772
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:22,480
Sir, I'll give it a go.

773
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,565
Okay.

774
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,693
I don't think it's the same as shooting.

775
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,778
It's the same.

776
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,867
Can you see how steady my form is?

777
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,785
Yes, I can see it well.

778
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,038
As it also requires
momentary focus on the target,

779
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,957
they're pretty much the same.

780
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,508
-My hand slipped.
-Okay.

781
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,061
Once I adjust, it won't take long.

782
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,146
I see. Okay.

783
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,121
All right.

784
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,751
I wasn't going to take off my jacket,
but I guess I should.

785
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,935
May I lean forward? Okay.

786
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,812
Please, Kim Do-hyeon.

787
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,524
You can't mess this up.

788
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,653
Yes!

789
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,737
-My goodness.
-I did it.

790
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,198
I did it.

791
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,407
Yes!

792
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,495
-Yes, I did it!
-Congratulations.

793
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,247
-I did it.
-Yes.

794
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,083
GEUMJE HOSPITAL

795
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,908
Yeong-bok.

796
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,578
What brings you here at this hour?

797
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,956
I told you we didn't need help.

798
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,463
Well, I…

799
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,510
I have something to tell you.

800
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,079
If I have fun spending time with him,

801
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,040
that means I like him too.

802
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,876
Then that's it.
I should just go out with him.

803
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:38,718
I'm sorry.

804
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,012
What?

805
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:45,058
I know that it was hard for you
to decide to go on a date with me.

806
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,436
So I really wanted to do well.

807
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,316
From the car to the ride and the plushie,

808
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,527
nothing went the way I planned.

809
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,451
Nothing went the way I planned, either.

810
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,662
I see.

811
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,998
I came to the date…

812
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,336
hoping that it wouldn't be fun.

813
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,129
What?

814
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:20,051
If I have fun spending time with you,

815
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,887
I'll want to do it again.

816
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,349
I was a bit scared of that.

817
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,269
But…

818
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,162
I had fun today.

819
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,709
I haven't laughed this much recently.

820
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,630
And…

821
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,551
I really like this too.

822
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,640
So lay down your burden.

823
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,894
Who cares if things don't go
as you planned?

824
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,356
Okay.

825
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:22,447
It was supposed to rain,
but I'm glad the day was clear.

826
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,534
It would've been awful
if it rained when we don't have a car.

827
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,427
-Please wait.
-Okay.

828
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,519
What?

829
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,191
Here. Let's run to the bus stop.

830
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,151
Okay.

831
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,847
So, this is a pager.

832
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,100
You can reach me with that now.

833
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,727
I'll give you my number.

834
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,689
Okay.

835
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,944
I don't have any paper right now.

836
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,657
May I…

837
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,200
What?

838
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,951
It's the police station.

839
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,495
-Let me make a call very quickly.
-Okay.

840
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,311
Captain, it's me, Kim Do-hyeon.

841
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:43,689
What?

842
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,318
Okay. I'll be right there.

843
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,290
The thing is…

844
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,292
Did something happen?

845
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,420
It's about Mr. Choi Won-bong's
hit-and-run case.

846
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,339
The culprit turned himself in.

847
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,634
Who's the culprit?

848
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:14,971
It's…

849
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:20,810
GEUMJE POLICE STATION

850
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,782
Please excuse me. I'll go inside first.

851
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:35,866
Okay.

852
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:09,775
Ms. Oh.

853
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,070
Ms. Oh.

854
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,830
I should've listened to my husband.

855
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,501
He said you were different from me.

856
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,173
He told me to live as I always have.

857
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,552
Can we talk for a second?

858
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,803
I regret it.

859
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,896
I regret thinking
that you were good people.

860
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,273
No.

861
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,736
The very fact
that I got to know you people…

862
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,282
I regret it all.

863
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,631
Let's not see each other again.

864
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,593
Ever.

865
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:11,021
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

866
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,274
I'll never request leniency.

867
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,693
Please make sure
they get the punishment they deserve.

868
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:16,861
Let's go together.

869
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:19,572
Don't just sit back and be defeatist.

870
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,449
You should do anything to mend things.

871
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,785
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

872
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,079
So why are you here, rambling on and on?

873
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,165
Ms. Oh…

874
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,167
-Yeong-bok!
-My belly…

875
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,253
Move out of the way!

876
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,297
There are no files
regarding their admissions.

877
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,632
Only their adoption applications
were found.

878
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,635
Is there any information
on who brought in these children?

879
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,012
Can you stop?

880
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,806
Stop it. It's meaningless.

881
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,017
I resented my parents all my life.

882
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,687
I didn't know that it was your doing.

883
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:59,111
