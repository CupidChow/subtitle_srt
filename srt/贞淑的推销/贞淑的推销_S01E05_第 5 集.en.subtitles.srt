1
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,415
I'll do it.

3
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,583
Thank you.

4
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,086
All right. Thank you.

5
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,007
Thanks to you,
I traveled back comfortably.

6
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,634
It was on my way.

7
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,386
Thank you.

8
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,813
I'll put it here, sir.

9
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,231
Okay.

10
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,693
Make sure to come here
for a get-together as you promised.

11
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,236
Of course.

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,905
Thank you. Bye.

13
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,365
-Okay. Take care.
-Okay.

14
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,327
JINHYANG HOF

15
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,311
Gosh, you startled me.

16
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,731
Seriously, I almost fell down.

17
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,650
-Let's go.
-Where were you hiding?

18
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,151
I was in the alley.

19
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,319
You startled me.

20
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,613
-You startled me.
-Come on.

21
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,368
Despite everything,
there's no place like home.

22
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,702
That goes without saying.

23
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,290
I forgot the key.

24
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,626
-What?
-What should I do?

25
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,628
I knew you'd forget it.

26
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,213
-So I brought it.
-What?

27
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,049
You're silly. Hurry up and open the door.

28
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,055
Jeong-suk.

29
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,689
Jeong-suk, this is--

30
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,898
What's going on?

31
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,859
Go inside.

32
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:32,986
Okay.

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,079
I came back because In-tae told me
that there will be a job opening.

34
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,497
I'll live here until I get hired.

35
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,708
You don't know when that'll happen.

36
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,751
You and Mi-hwa under the same roof…

37
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,336
How does it make sense?

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,463
It wasn't an easy choice for me either.

39
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,257
But what choice did I have?

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,217
I had no money for a motel,

41
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,553
and In-tae kept telling me to move in.

42
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,764
In-tae told you that
because he doesn't know anything.

43
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,807
Exactly.

44
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,561
He doesn't know anything,
so it would be strange to say no.

45
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,313
Besides,

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,774
it didn't look like
you'd take me back anytime soon.

47
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,944
That's your excuse?

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,115
I think I'll be able to get
a proper job this time, Jeong-suk.

49
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,703
Soon, I'll come back
to you and Min-ho with my chin up.

50
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,371
"Come back"?

51
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,833
"With your chin up"?

52
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,004
Then what?
Do you really want to end things?

53
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,343
I know we're going through a rough patch…

54
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,808
but let's get through this.

55
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,229
I'll be in touch.

56
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,924
It looks tasty.

57
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,025
Mom.

58
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,861
What is it?

59
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,951
My goodness.

60
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,246
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,833
Go ahead and eat.

62
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,260
Mom, is your work not going well?

63
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:08,391
I was wondering if your
adult product business wasn't going well.

64
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,269
It's going well.

65
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,813
That's why we're eating
this delicious yellow corvina.

66
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,110
-Did you pack everything?
-I almost forgot.

67
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,321
-I need to buy something.
-Okay.

68
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,656
I need to buy some clay.
Please give me 500 won.

69
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,574
500 won?

70
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,869
It's 400 won for two,

71
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,372
but I need 100 won for Apollo snacks.

72
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,793
All right.

73
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,588
Let's see.

74
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,800
What? Where's my wallet?

75
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,578
What's that? It looks quite old.

76
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,538
It's nothing.

77
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,834
Captain told us to gather around.
Didn't you hear him?

78
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,919
Me too?

79
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,003
"Me too?"

80
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,590
Aren't you a member of the team?

81
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:26,511
I need to talk to everyone
about a serious problem,

82
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,930
so come on out.

83
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,728
Why is he so angry?

84
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,690
Man, Captain is no joke when he's angry.

85
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,737
I think we'll get a hot taste of it today.

86
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,700
"A hot taste"?

87
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,084
Gosh, it's hot.

88
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,256
I thought there was something
you wanted to say.

89
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,674
Hurry up and eat.

90
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,885
You said there's a serious problem.

91
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,973
Oh, right.

92
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,850
That?

93
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,899
There is a problem indeed.

94
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,238
We need better teamwork
so that we can be more productive.

95
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,407
You joined the team a while ago,

96
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,911
but you're still not close to the others.

97
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:39,041
We should eat together from time to time
and foster teamwork.

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,960
I agree with you.

99
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,505
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but may I order more meat?

100
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,966
Why would you ask me that?

101
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,302
Ask the person who's paying.

102
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,595
That's right.

103
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,265
May we order more meat,

104
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,558
Detective Kim?

105
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,062
Suit yourselves.

106
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,024
-Ma'am!
-Please give us four servings of meat.

107
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,067
I'm so stuffed.

108
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,738
It must have been expensive.

109
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,535
Still, we earned something valuable
thanks to the captain.

110
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,371
Friendship and rapport.

111
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,999
You can't buy them with money.

112
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:25,922
That's right. It finally feels like
we've become a family.

113
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,800
Since you paid for the meal,
I'll pay for dessert.

114
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,970
The vending machine
at the convenience store over there

115
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,515
has incredible coffee.

116
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,059
I'm good, thanks.
I need to leave for questioning.

117
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,936
Is that so? Still…

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,189
What? Isn't that Seong-su?

119
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,107
That's him.

120
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,569
I thought he had left town.
Did he come back?

121
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,377
Hey…

122
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,342
I know we're going through a rough patch…

123
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,347
but let's get through this.

124
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,766
I'll be in touch.

125
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,400
Have you had lunch?

126
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,401
-Yes.
-Yes.

127
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,487
Seong-su, I thought you left to find work.
Did you come back?

128
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,115
Yes, I was offered an opportunity here.

129
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,284
This time, keep your temper in check

130
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,995
and hold out.

131
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,205
You should stop coming to the station.

132
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,915
Don't worry.

133
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,296
I don't think I've seen him before.

134
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,298
He joined recently.

135
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,842
He's the ace of the division,
Detective Kim.

136
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,719
I see. Hello.

137
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,263
Trash.

138
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,810
Excuse me? Trash?

139
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,978
Yes.

140
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,397
Trash.

141
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,692
I just saw you litter the street.

142
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,617
How could you say that
about a tiny gum wrapper?

143
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,579
Pick it up and put it in the trash can.

144
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,624
I mean…

145
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,632
Why would you glare at me
for such a trivial matter?

146
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,426
It's as if you have
ill feelings toward me.

147
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,470
Pick it up.

148
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,513
What's wrong with you two?

149
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,308
I picked it up too.

150
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,185
It's nothing.

151
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,020
Don't be like that.

152
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,438
Pick it up.

153
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,315
All right.

154
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,483
Here.

155
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,652
Look ahead, Seong-su.

156
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,446
Come and have
a cup of vending machine coffee.

157
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,159
FANTASY LINGERIE SURVEY

158
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,912
PRODUCTS CUSTOMERS WANT TO BUY

159
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,665
The number one product
customers wanted to buy was

160
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,208
a sexy slip dress.

161
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,460
Number two was a vibrator.

162
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,005
Now, the reason why
they have no interest in buying.

163
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,383
Number one, "I'm worried
people might judge."

164
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,177
Number two, "The price is too high."

165
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,804
That's right.

166
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,724
Most of them are regular housewives,
so they probably can't afford it.

167
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,310
Among those who have bought the products,

168
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,854
many had no interest in purchasing again.

169
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,064
That's right.

170
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,566
It's not like vibrators break.

171
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,860
You don't need a new one for each season.

172
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,570
It's understandable.

173
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,697
In conclusion,

174
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,159
we need to target people
who haven't purchased any items.

175
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,538
In that case, where can we find women
with a fat wallet

176
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,541
and no purchase history?

177
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,212
I know such women.

178
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,550
-Who?
-The Royal Club members' wives.

179
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,968
I see.

180
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,511
You're right.

181
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,306
Those women are big spenders.

182
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,144
Ms. Oh, you know
the Royal Club members, right?

183
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,356
I know them,

184
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,860
but I need to solve a problem
in order to approach those women.

185
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,027
What's that?

186
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,655
The Royal Club chairman's wife.

187
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,366
-I see.
-The owner of the real estate agency?

188
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,868
Yes.

189
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,828
That club is like the military.

190
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,205
The head is the wife of Chairman Eom.

191
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,374
Gosh, that woman…

192
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,587
She threw a fit
during Jeong-suk's first in-home sale,

193
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,380
so it'd be hard to win her over.

194
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,799
I ran into her
while handing out the survey.

195
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,636
Upon learning about the business,
she asked me to cut ties with her.

196
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,598
-Isn't that a bit extreme?
-My goodness.

197
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,519
-Hello.
-Hello.

198
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,229
Hello.

199
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,857
You didn't tell me you'd be home.

200
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,818
Why do I need to tell you
about coming to my own house?

201
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,030
I came to eat lunch.

202
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,992
I brought steamed buns.
Would you like one?

203
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,537
No, thank you. You can have them.

204
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,835
How frigid. He's so cold.

205
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,587
We'll get going now.

206
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,299
-Okay.
-Let's think of ways to persuade Ms. Heo.

207
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,010
-Okay. Let's do that.
-Okay.

208
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,637
-I'll take these two.
-Okay.

209
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,226
-I'll help.
-Okay.

210
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,610
What are you scheming this time?

211
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,695
We didn't scheme. We had a meeting.

212
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,698
Using the survey results,

213
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,242
we made some business plans.

214
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,079
Plans to make an enemy of
Chairman Eom's wife?

215
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,999
Plans to destroy my long-cherished wish
of moving the pharmacy?

216
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,502
Why are you so pessimistic?

217
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,461
You never know.

218
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,589
She might become my customer someday.

219
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,757
Customer?

220
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,759
Give me a break.

221
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:07,263
She despises your products.
What makes you think that she'll buy them?

222
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:12,309
You're being delusional
without a realistic solution.

223
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,229
Are you serious?

224
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,275
What will you do if she buys my products?

225
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,569
If that happens, I'll do anything.

226
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,029
I'll buy all of these products.

227
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,115
No, that won't be enough.

228
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,950
What products are there?

229
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,326
-What's this?
-Gosh.

230
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,205
I'll wear this and dance

231
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,709
in the middle of the town.

232
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,713
Goodness.
Stop having such ridiculous thoughts

233
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,756
and come to your senses.

234
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,138
And hurry up and make lunch! I'm hungry.

235
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,557
Geez.

236
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,726
I can't believe that man!

237
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,980
How can I teach him a lesson?

238
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,523
DHALSIM VS CHUN LI

239
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,442
Round one. Fight!

240
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,200
Jeong-suk!

241
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,661
-Hello.
-My goodness.

242
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,332
Come and have a seat for a second.

243
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,168
I have something to say.

244
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,046
Have a seat.

245
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,172
Okay.

246
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,258
All right. Here.

247
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,551
GEUNIL PHOTO STUDIO

248
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,512
My younger sibling opened a photo studio,

249
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,348
so you should visit.

250
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,309
If you drop my name,
you'll get a big discount.

251
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,853
I plan to get a family portrait.

252
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,480
How about your family?

253
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,856
Excuse me?

254
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,401
Gosh, don't ask her that.

255
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,780
Her husband left the house
a long time ago.

256
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,823
What? Why?

257
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,745
I believed her when she said
that her husband was away to make money,

258
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,456
but I saw him looking for work in Geumje.

259
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,833
But he didn't visit his family.

260
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,419
I thought they'd get a divorce soon.

261
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,089
Don't run your mouth
when you don't know the full story.

262
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,175
That's right. Min-ho's family
always gets the worst rumors.

263
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,426
Don't add to them.

264
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,429
I think I heard them arguing
some time ago,

265
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,556
and Seong-su was nowhere to be seen.

266
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,642
Am I really mistaken?

267
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,604
Well,

268
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,023
the thing is…

269
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,534
-Yes, it's a misunderstanding.
-A misunderstanding?

270
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,328
Yes. Well,

271
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,834
my husband is helping out a friend
who's a truck driver.

272
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,922
He's staying at the place
until he gets hired officially.

273
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,216
-I see.
-I see.

274
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,010
Do you guys meet up then?

275
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,012
Of course. We met up yesterday too.

276
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,597
They don't have a problem, okay?

277
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,766
You should worry about your own marriage.

278
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,488
Why did I give such an excuse?

279
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,579
What? Detective!

280
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,420
-Are you coming back from somewhere?
-Yes, I had a meeting.

281
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,755
What brings you here?

282
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,881
I'm here to see you.

283
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,758
Me?

284
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,678
-What?
-You left this in the car.

285
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,598
I see. That's where it was.

286
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,183
I was upset, thinking I lost it.

287
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,228
I couldn't figure out
when it had disappeared.

288
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,731
Things were so hectic yesterday.

289
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,444
Did the meeting go well?

290
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:52,988
Yes.

291
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,657
The surveys helped a lot.

292
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,826
There's a clear goal now,

293
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,787
so I need to get into action.

294
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,330
That's good to hear.

295
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,040
When you have a lot on your mind,

296
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,044
it's a good idea to focus on work
and keep yourself busy.

297
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,213
Right.

298
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,051
Why…

299
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,515
It just seemed like
you had gone through a lot.

300
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,183
I see.

301
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,477
Okay.

302
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,563
You're right.

303
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,818
Keeping myself busy might be the answer.

304
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,740
Thank you so much for this.

305
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,492
Okay.

306
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,702
Take care.

307
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,496
Okay. Thank you.

308
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,767
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

309
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,608
All right.

310
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,779
Let's focus.

311
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,670
I understand the situation,
but I think it'll be hard.

312
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,591
As you know,

313
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,469
my mom absolutely hates your work.

314
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,514
Still, I'd like to face it head-on.

315
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,517
I think it'll be a good idea
to get to know her.

316
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,271
Do you think a gift will help?

317
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,151
The only thing my mom couldn't have
was a handsome husband.

318
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,529
-What?
-There's nothing she doesn't have.

319
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,697
I see.

320
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,285
Then what are her interests?

321
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,370
-Interests?
-Yes.

322
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,832
I want to know
what she's most interested in.

323
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,250
Well,

324
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,086
I guess there's one thing.

325
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,881
-Okay.
-I'm not sure if it's the right term.

326
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,092
Someone else's misfortune.

327
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,429
Someone else's misfortune.
"Someone else's"…

328
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,307
What?

329
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,352
I'm the epitome of misfortune.
The moment I say I'm a single mom,

330
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,146
nine out of ten people look at me
with pitying eyes.

331
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,149
Why don't I tell her the story
of how I became a single mom?

332
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,444
Come on. Still,

333
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,988
you're a young woman with a profession.

334
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,325
I live in a tiny studio with a husband
who can't earn 50,000 won a month,

335
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,952
I birthed a gaggle of children.

336
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:49,248
Only someone like me
is entitled to talk about misfortune.

337
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,875
Don't you think
I'm the most unfortunate one?

338
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,920
My husband cheated on me
with my best friend

339
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,089
without a hint of remorse.

340
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,927
Buy cucumbers, pumpkins,
and perilla leaves.

341
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,973
Pumpkins, rice, and more!

342
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,477
Here's the thing.

343
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,108
While it's true that we need to work hard
for the success of the business,

344
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,319
I don't think you should reveal
such a painful memory.

345
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,113
That's right, Jeong-suk.

346
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,199
A memory that's too painful
should stay buried.

347
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,159
I agree.

348
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,162
I think the misfortune of a single mom
would be adequate.

349
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,039
No, my misfortune is perfect.

350
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,666
Ms. Oh, go ahead and tell us.

351
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,751
Whose misfortune would be adequate?

352
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,839
I don't know
whose story she'll be more drawn to.

353
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,926
Geum-hui.

354
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,263
You're making a big mistake.

355
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,347
I think I know.

356
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,726
The misfortune she'd be interested in.

357
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,395
-Come closer.
-What?

358
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,361
You look so elegant.

359
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,489
Your skills are improving.

360
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,908
Ms. Lee.

361
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
My goodness.

362
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,374
I didn't know you were here.

363
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,128
Are you here to get your hair done?

364
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,796
Please sit down for a moment.

365
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,673
No.

366
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,677
I wanted to talk to you
since something upsetting happened.

367
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,304
I'll visit next time.

368
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,223
My goodness, could it be

369
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,559
that you fought with your husband again?

370
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,024
I'll come back another time.
I don't want to make her uncomfortable.

371
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,068
Me?

372
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,112
-I'm fine.
-Pardon?

373
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,699
It's not like
only I can use this hair salon.

374
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,745
It's not like we're strangers.

375
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,456
I wouldn't be uncomfortable.

376
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,253
Gosh, my neck hurts.

377
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,340
Come and take a seat.

378
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,971
What is it? Why did you fight?

379
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:15,310
He's very unsatisfied with my work.

380
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,564
He said many hurtful things to me.

381
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,774
Hurtful things?

382
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,150
Like what?

383
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,737
Exactly what hurtful things did he say?

384
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,532
I don't know.

385
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,867
They were quite vulgar.

386
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,370
What? My goodness.

387
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,497
Hold on.

388
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,500
"You're a graceless woman!"

389
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,085
Something like that?

390
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,505
"I've never seen a Jezebel like you!"

391
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,881
Was that what he said?

392
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,301
Did he use swear words?

393
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,305
Well, what he said was worse.

394
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,598
Worse?

395
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,392
Unbelievable!

396
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,601
My goodness.

397
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,645
This is so much fun…

398
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,731
You must have been upset.

399
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:06,027
To be honest,
he shouldn't judge me for my work.

400
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,364
He had his fun thanks to it.

401
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,783
"His fun"? What do you mean?

402
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,080
Do you remember
the first in-home sale you came to?

403
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,166
I bought a few pieces of lingerie.

404
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,625
Yes.

405
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,544
One day, I wore them out of curiosity,

406
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,130
and he ended up seeing them.

407
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,132
And?

408
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,471
From that moment,

409
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,099
he didn't seem like a person.

410
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,604
He was like a beast.

411
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,651
A beast?

412
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,031
What did he do?

413
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,452
-That night…
-Go on.

414
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,787
-Ju-ri.
-We're here.

415
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,624
Hey. Did you have a good trip
to the office?

416
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,083
Yes.

417
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,836
We just got some pieces
of lingerie to sell.

418
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,797
There are only a few pieces
since it's limited edition.

419
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:12,552
I think it'll be a good idea to sell them
to the existing customers only.

420
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,470
All right.

421
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,055
Isn't it pretty?

422
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,730
Okay. Thank you.

423
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,025
Ms. Heo.

424
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,652
I'll get going now.

425
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,948
But you haven't finished your story!

426
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,532
You didn't get to the important bit.

427
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,411
Let's finish the conversation
at my real estate agency.

428
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,205
-Right now?
-Yes, I have time.

429
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,623
My goodness.

430
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,001
Good luck.

431
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,466
Three times?

432
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,178
Three times? My goodness.

433
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,640
How is that possible in a single night?

434
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,183
That's what I'm saying.

435
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,937
But now he's throwing a fit,
saying he doesn't want me to do it.

436
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,024
They say your mind isn't the same
when you go in and out.

437
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,569
My goodness, in and out?

438
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,863
What a risqué proverb.

439
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,908
In any case, we fought
since I was disappointed in his attitude.

440
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,995
I'm sorry, but I have to get going.

441
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,414
I need to prepare for the in-home sales.

442
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,790
Gosh, it suits you so well.

443
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,751
Wait a second.

444
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,628
Listen.

445
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,341
Why don't I buy all of these?

446
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,552
What?

447
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,180
You don't have to do--

448
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,432
It's okay.

449
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,476
As you know, I'm someone

450
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,272
who has no interest whatsoever
in these things.

451
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,232
But you're going through so much.

452
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:53,820
I can't sit and watch
as you struggle once more.

453
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,364
I'm quite softhearted.
You know that, right?

454
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,992
So tell me.

455
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,662
How much is the total?

456
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,706
How much should I give you?

457
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,045
You really don't have to do that.

458
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,005
No. Go ahead and tell me.

459
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,634
One, two…

460
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,928
What?

461
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,767
What's wrong with this?

462
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,853
Detective Kim, come here for a second.

463
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,024
I need to save
the material for the meeting,

464
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,984
but I can't insert the floppy disk.

465
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,696
Once you insert it here…

466
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,822
I did that.

467
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,034
…you need to pull down the lever.
Now, you can save it.

468
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,452
Gosh, I do that…

469
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,122
What? Detective Kim,
you have a scar on your arm.

470
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,208
It looks like a burn scar.

471
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,001
It's nothing.

472
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,421
It's quite big.

473
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,007
Did you get injured while investigating?

474
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,884
Something like that.

475
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,178
It's nothing.

476
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,346
As for me,

477
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,141
I took on a group of delinquents
all alone a few years ago

478
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,602
and bled profusely from my side.

479
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,062
I haven't shown it in a while.

480
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,149
Do you see it?

481
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,445
Do you? I got over eight stitches.

482
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,782
You took on a group of delinquents alone?

483
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,202
They were sixth graders.

484
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,330
He got scared and was backing away,

485
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,041
and that's when he crashed
into a wall all on his own.

486
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,338
It was the end of the school year,
so they were basically middle schoolers.

487
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,298
Of course.

488
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,426
That's something to brag about.

489
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,346
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

490
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,391
PROTECTING GEUMJE LIVES
AND SAFETY

491
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,453
A fire?

492
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,706
Did she really say that?

493
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,958
Yes.

494
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,795
I asked because I was curious
about a burn scar on a baby's body.

495
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,175
She told me that there was a big fire
in the nearby neighborhood.

496
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,428
She picked up the baby that was all alone.

497
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,014
Didn't she look for the parents?

498
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,558
They could've been looking for him.

499
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,519
She said there was no one.

500
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,731
She asked us

501
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,692
to find him a nice family
despite the scar.

502
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,697
You said the woman was in her 20s or 30s.

503
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,451
Could it be that she was
my biological mother?

504
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,789
She left quickly before we had a chance
to make a record.

505
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,792
And it happened so many years ago.

506
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,752
I'm sorry.

507
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,964
I just know that she was Catholic.

508
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,301
She was wearing a rosary ring.

509
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,469
A wooden one.

510
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,015
Is there anything else you remember?

511
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,393
I don't know.

512
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,271
That woman had

513
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,774
a ticket to Geumje.

514
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,651
She used the regional dialect,

515
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,278
so I assumed that she was from Geumje.

516
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,322
Geumje?

517
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,492
BIOLOGICAL MOTHER: UNKNOWN

518
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,703
BABY'S LAST NAME
IS DECIDED TO BE KIM

519
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,499
A BURN SCAR ON THE RIGHT ARM

520
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:54,227
PROTECTING GEUMJE LIVES
AND SAFETY

521
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,854
Did you sell everything?

522
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,564
I can't believe it.

523
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,024
-Ms. Oh.
-Ms. Oh, thank you for your hard work.

524
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,484
-Seriously.
-Cheers.

525
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,029
Everyone, thank you for working hard.

526
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,739
You did too, Jeong-suk.

527
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:11,202
I thought Ms. Oh's life was
quite far from unfortunate,

528
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,580
so such a strategy never occurred to me.

529
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,665
I thought the focus would be
on the subject,

530
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,876
not the severity of the misfortune.

531
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,586
A conversation with Seo-yeon let me know

532
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,047
-that she had a lot of interest in you.
-My goodness.

533
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,216
Listen to me.

534
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,012
If you think about it, the story you told

535
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,307
was about fortune, not misfortune.

536
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,018
You may have sounded a bit dejected,

537
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,686
but you were actually bragging.

538
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,147
I didn't think that she'd fall for it.

539
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,690
Seriously.

540
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,735
-There's something I want to know.
-What is it?

541
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,738
Your story was quite realistic.

542
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:50,742
Did you make it up
or is it based on your experience?

543
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,414
I don't know.

544
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,043
I can't say that I made up everything.

545
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,173
-I knew it. Which part?
-Which part?

546
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,633
JINHYANG HOF

547
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,343
I'm so full.

548
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,013
Thank you for the food.

549
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:14,891
Thank you.

550
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,396
What? They're so sensual.

551
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,361
I hope Ms. Heo from the real estate agency
is having a sensual night as well.

552
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,072
I don't want to imagine it, but I hope so.

553
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,115
The slip dress really was hot.

554
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:36,162
Gosh, his hands are moving so busily.

555
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,831
Come on. That's how it is.

556
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,125
-No one will care.
-They should get a room.

557
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,461
My goodness. They're getting a room.

558
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,088
-They're entering a motel.
-Really?

559
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,381
Let's go.

560
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,301
That man!

561
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,261
What?

562
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,889
He's Chairman Eom, right?

563
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,183
-He's Ms. Heo's husband.
-Gosh.

564
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,601
-Really?
-Really?

565
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,190
Why is he touching
another woman on the street?

566
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,485
Didn't Ms. Heo wear that slip dress?

567
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,988
She wore it.

568
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,659
Mom definitely wore it.

569
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,376
What's that nonsense?

570
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,380
Are you losing shame as you grow older?

571
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:31,801
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

572
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,971
You're crazy… For goodness' sake.

573
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,558
-For goodness' sake.
-Why are you complaining? I bought it.

574
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,519
Would you at least have a look?

575
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,063
How is he so heartless?

576
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,275
So you're saying

577
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,862
that your father left the house
even after seeing her in the slip dress.

578
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,530
Yes.

579
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,493
I guess he went to that woman afterward--

580
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,462
Mom knows
that he's seeing someone these days.

581
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,964
It's happened before.

582
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,056
In any case, I thought
that you should be aware of the situation.

583
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,391
Thank you, Seo-yeon.

584
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,727
Thank you.

585
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,520
I'll get going now.

586
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,564
-I'll keep in touch.
-Okay.

587
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,319
She'll return it since it didn't have
the desired effect, right?

588
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,612
I think so.

589
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,530
Her husband made her angry,

590
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,991
so I hope she doesn't take it out on us.

591
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,201
Seriously.

592
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,621
That's the real estate agency.

593
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,372
-Let's take a detour.
-Okay.

594
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,874
Geum-hui!

595
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,044
What should we do? Should we run?

596
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,296
I think it's too late for that.

597
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,006
Goodness.

598
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:58,262
Come on. Why did you just walk past?

599
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,807
How could you make me run alone?

600
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,016
I'm sorry, Ms. Heo.

601
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,310
I'll cut to the chase.

602
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,854
It's about the product from yesterday.

603
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,897
Ms. Heo--

604
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,857
The effectiveness of that product was…

605
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,653
unbelievable.

606
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,865
Seriously.

607
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,660
You know, my husband

608
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,663
pestered me so much last night.

609
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,249
I couldn't sleep a wink.

610
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,044
I was scared
that my children would wake up.

611
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,462
How embarrassing!

612
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,802
In any case, I experienced
the effect of the product firsthand.

613
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,429
I see.

614
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,931
Right.

615
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,937
I'm so glad that it was effective.

616
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,606
Yes. Right now,

617
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,236
I was chatting with the female members
of the Royal Club.

618
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,446
When I explained it briefly
over the phone,

619
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,199
they insisted on hearing it in person

620
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,160
and came to the real estate agency.

621
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,202
I see.

622
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,453
The Royal Club?

623
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,621
Yes.

624
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,833
If I want to talk about
the long and passionate night,

625
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,461
I won't be able to eat dinner
this evening.

626
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,756
Anyway, I'll get going now.

627
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,799
See you later.

628
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,593
Bye.

629
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,308
What was that?

630
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,020
We know for certain
that Chairman Eom rejected Ms. Heo

631
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,105
and spent time with another woman.

632
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,648
Afterward, did he--

633
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,775
That's impossible.

634
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,403
She obviously came up with a lie.

635
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,238
She didn't need to do that.

636
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,032
Seriously.

637
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,118
How pitiful.

638
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,412
We won't need to take a detour. Let's go.

639
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,581
I feel bad for her.

640
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,166
JACKPOT REAL ESTATE

641
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,835
-Chairman Eom is a jerk.
-He'll get in trouble if he gets caught.

642
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,463
But she has an inkling.

643
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,216
I'm feeling bad for her
for the first time.

644
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,301
There are two pieces of clothing.

645
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,971
You know how
a slip dress with straps looks, right?

646
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,183
It came with a soft gown.

647
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,143
The set was quite nice and classy.

648
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,480
-My goodness.
-That was why I couldn't sleep last night.

649
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,320
Look at the nighttime makeup
that wench is wearing!

650
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,488
Hey.

651
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,282
Don't attack me.

652
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,576
-That vixen!
-How's this nighttime makeup?

653
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,163
How could she run her mouth
after wrecking a family?

654
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,999
Look at that cake face of yours!

655
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,876
Mom.

656
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,628
Yes?

657
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,214
Why didn't you get a divorce?

658
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,133
What?

659
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,303
You didn't finalize the divorce on paper

660
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,181
even though Dad did
so many terrible things.

661
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,768
He did.

662
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:56,399
When I left the house,
I wanted to cut off all dirty ties

663
00:37:56,482 --> 00:38:00,486
and live as if those scumbags
didn't exist in the world.

664
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,657
However,

665
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,452
I became scared of getting labeled
as a divorced woman.

666
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,997
Because we lived separately,

667
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,918
all sorts of terrible rumors
followed me, not your father.

668
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,839
I wondered what would happen
if I actually ended the marriage.

669
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,050
I figured

670
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,387
that it wouldn't help you guys at all.

671
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,103
By the way, why do you ask?

672
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,276
Well, just because.

673
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,320
You get mad at the drama,

674
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,697
so I wondered
how you endured it in real life.

675
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,407
Min-ho's in the room, right?

676
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,300
What? I'm done with this sketchbook.

677
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,013
I need to draw something
for homework this week.

678
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,057
A drawing?

679
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,809
Yes, I need to draw my family.

680
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,316
I'll buy you a new one.

681
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,236
Dong-u said he doesn't
want to draw his family.

682
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,239
When he draws himself and his mom,

683
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:31,577
other kids ask him where his dad is.
He finds it bothersome.

684
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,872
I think I'd feel the same.
Don't you agree?

685
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,253
Here. Put the pencil case
in your backpack.

686
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,106
-Mom.
-Yes?

687
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,358
I need 10,000 won
for The Art of Mathematics and a notebook.

688
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,275
10,000 won?

689
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,237
See you later.

690
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,655
Have a good day!

691
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,199
Mom, I need 2,000 won
for a compass and a protractor.

692
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,325
2,000 won?

693
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,244
-See you later!
-Bye!

694
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,038
Mom, I need 500 won for clay.

695
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,498
You too? Here.

696
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,125
Thank you.

697
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,085
Okay. Hold your sister's hand on your way.

698
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,169
Okay.

699
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,340
Goodness!

700
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,884
You startled me.

701
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,513
Honey, please give me
200 won for an ice pop.

702
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,146
Say, "Ma'am, please give me 200 won."

703
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,356
What? I can't do that.

704
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,691
Why not?

705
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,652
To me,

706
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,612
you'll never be a "ma'am."

707
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,115
You're a woman.

708
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,372
What's the point of a romantic line?

709
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,749
Your face belongs in a comical movie.

710
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,918
What?

711
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,589
If you keep provoking me,
it'll turn into an erotic movie.

712
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,548
Give me a break.

713
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,469
Honey, aren't you going to work today?

714
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,470
Stop it.

715
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,431
An in-home sale with the Royal Club
has been scheduled,

716
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,266
so I need to go and get the products.

717
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,227
But Jeong-suk agreed
to get my share in the afternoon

718
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,645
so I can look after the kids.

719
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,524
What a nice friend.

720
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,237
Seriously.

721
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:34,033
You should also find a friend
who helps you in life.

722
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,995
Honestly speaking,

723
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,164
your only flaw is
that you aren't successful.

724
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,208
You have a nice character.

725
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,377
But how is it that you don't have
any decent friends--

726
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,507
Why did you do that so suddenly?

727
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,635
Your lips looked so plump.

728
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,844
Seriously!

729
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,971
Plump, my foot!

730
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,183
I know you did that to avoid a scolding!

731
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,770
That was my intention at first.

732
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,732
But I don't want to stop anymore.

733
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,152
It's too early for this.

734
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,570
This is nothing new.

735
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,406
The older girls left,
and Eun-ji is asleep.

736
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,035
Our mornings in this studio
are hotter than other people's nights.

737
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,038
-Come here.
-You must be insane.

738
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,374
-You're out of your mind.
-Come here.

739
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,918
-I can't believe you.
-Come on.

740
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,337
-Hurry up. Come here.
-Are you an animal?

741
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,799
-That's it.
-Come on.

742
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,425
-Come on.
-My goodness.

743
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,471
You must be insane. Seriously.

744
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:53,404
I think you look like a celebrity.

745
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,322
-A celebrity?
-Yes.

746
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,284
Don't leave with regrets…

747
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,244
Don't go

748
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:04,665
There's so much time left

749
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:09,253
-Even if everything disappears
-Everything disappears

750
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,214
-This feeling and we will be forever
-This feeling and we will be forever

751
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,678
It isn't the only song.

752
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,972
Why do you listen to it on repeat?

753
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:23,642
It was annoying all the same,
but you used to sing different songs.

754
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,936
Well,

755
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,732
someone told me a few days ago

756
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,235
that I looked like Shim Shin.

757
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,281
I think the song suits me as well.

758
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,409
What? You look like whom?

759
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,953
-Shim Shin?
-Yes.

760
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,916
Perhaps you misheard that person.

761
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,219
You don't think I look like him?

762
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,431
If someone told you
that you looked like Shim Shin,

763
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,058
it must be one of the two.

764
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,060
Number one.

765
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:12,441
This person may have bad eyesight
to the point of blindness.

766
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,571
What's the other one?

767
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,490
This person likes you.

768
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,951
They say that love is blind.

769
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,913
Me?

770
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,419
No way.

771
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,550
This is Wonbong Pharmacy.

772
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,636
Hey, Geum-hui.

773
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,846
Come home for lunch?

774
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,433
Okay. Shall I take Dae-geun with me?

775
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,935
No.

776
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,604
I want you to come alone.

777
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,607
There's something
I need to tell you in private.

778
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,317
In private? What could it be?

779
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,113
Make sure you come alone, honey.

780
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,541
Honey!

781
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,085
Honey, I'm home!

782
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,130
Where are you? I'm home! Where…

783
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,049
-You're home.
-Yes.

784
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,428
What?

785
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,849
Did you call me over in broad daylight
to show me that?

786
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,767
I couldn't wait.

787
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,270
Hurry up and put it on.
I'll go and wash up.

788
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,938
No.

789
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,275
It's for you.

790
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,862
What do you mean?

791
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,406
You promised.

792
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,615
Did you forget?

793
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,743
What did I promise…

794
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,373
No way! Ms. Heo?

795
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,375
Yes. That's right.

796
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,127
Ms. Heo bought my products.

797
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,546
She also introduced my business
to the Royal Club.

798
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,006
No way!

799
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,926
Did she get struck by lightning?
How did she change so suddenly?

800
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,803
If you don't believe me, I can call her.

801
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,931
You don't need to do that. Hold on.

802
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,186
Do you really want me to…

803
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,394
I can't.

804
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,938
Hurry up and put it on.

805
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,648
You'll dance in this alone.

806
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,608
It'll be cold once the sun sets.

807
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:01,985
Honey, please.

808
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,696
I don't have much time.

809
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,095
How are you feeling right now?

810
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,181
Ashamed.

811
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,599
And?

812
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,186
Regretful.

813
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,314
Don't forget that feeling.

814
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:45,112
If you take back your word again,
I'll make you wear it for real!

815
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,700
Does that mean I don't need to wear it?

816
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,746
I don't need to dance, do I?

817
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,082
Button up your shirt
before I change my mind.

818
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,542
We'll eat out for lunch.

819
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,420
I made good money.

820
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,130
Lunch is on me today.

821
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,425
Honey, wait.
I'm still buttoning up… Honey, wait.

822
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,801
Next up.

823
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:11,096
A fire that's believed to be arson
broke out at a house

824
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:14,099
in Oksan, North Jeolla-do,
to the locals' shock.

825
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,852
Because of this fire, Mr. Oh's family,
who were in the house,

826
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:20,272
sustained serious injuries
and are in a critical condition…

827
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,024
It's an arson case.

828
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,109
Detectives in charge
will get quite a headache.

829
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,777
They won't be able to sleep.

830
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,571
Have you ever taken an arson case?

831
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,407
Yes.

832
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,491
No.

833
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,910
There hasn't been an arson case.

834
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,622
Geumje is famous
for not having any incidents.

835
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,082
That's right.

836
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,835
Captain, wasn't there one
when you were a rookie?

837
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,129
A serial arson case. Right?

838
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,424
If you were a rookie,
then it must be at least 30 years ago.

839
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,428
That's right. There was such a case.

840
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,222
The fire wasn't what was important.

841
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,268
Quit yapping!

842
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,562
Clean this up.

843
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,816
He didn't finish the food.

844
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,943
He seems very sensitive.

845
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,864
He must've struggled a lot
because of that case.

846
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,116
It's still unsolved.

847
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,701
The arsonist never got caught?

848
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,498
I don't know if I should call it
an arsonist or a kidnapper.

849
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,833
-Kidnapper?
-Yes.

850
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,211
Someone set fire in the town

851
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,631
and kidnapped children amidst the chaos.

852
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,591
Only the newborns.

853
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,761
INVESTIGATION REPORT

854
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,398
A 70-DAY-OLD NEWBORN
WENT MISSING AMIDST THE FIRE

855
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,108
ARSON IS STRONGLY SUSPECTED

856
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,371
COLD CASE

857
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:45,625
LUCKY STATIONERY

858
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,134
A drawing of the family?

859
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,729
-Be careful on the step, my lady.
-Silly you.

860
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,439
Jeong-suk.

861
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,277
Hey, Jeong-suk.

862
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,362
I'll finally become a dad.

863
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,493
-What?
-She received a checkup today.

864
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,911
It's been six weeks.

865
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,497
We bought a few baby supplies.

866
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,126
After eight years of struggle
since the wedding,

867
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,711
a baby finally came to us.

868
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,299
My checkup results weren't very good,

869
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,426
so I had no expectations.

870
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,386
The doctor said that it was a miracle.

871
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,930
Honey.

872
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,974
Why are you sharing all the details?

873
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,100
What?

874
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,353
It isn't anyone else but Jeong-suk.

875
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,272
I'll go and bring the car.

876
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,565
What? Okay.

877
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:58,865
Congratulations.

878
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,536
After eight years of trying and failing,

879
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,372
you got pregnant miraculously.

880
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,542
I know what you're thinking,

881
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,293
but it's In-tae's baby. I'm certain.

882
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,296
So don't say anything.

883
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,633
Stirring up trouble won't be good
for either one of us.

884
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,887
"Either one of us"?

885
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,099
Honey!

886
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,184
Hold on.

887
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:30,981
That's right.

888
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,025
In-tae and I waited eagerly for this baby.

889
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,528
You need to protect your family,

890
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,655
and I need to protect my family.

891
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,490
Isn't that right?

892
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,696
-Yes.
-Good. This time,

893
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,948
they'll combine to protect the Earth!

894
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,035
Defender of the Universe, Voltron!
Combine!

895
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,040
The legs are complete.

896
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,460
Oh, hey.

897
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,922
Mom, Dad came to school to pick me up.

898
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,759
Let's go.

899
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,928
Mom.

900
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,682
I was waiting for Min-ho with some snacks,

901
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,684
and Seong-su got back,
holding Min-ho's hand.

902
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,436
He picked up Min-ho from school.

903
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:55,690
I wanted to slap him across the face,

904
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,442
but Min-ho was there.

905
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:03,156
Don't let it show in front of Min-ho.

906
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:04,991
I'll take care of it.

907
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,958
Seong-su.

908
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,502
Let's talk.

909
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:17,837
Now?

910
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,631
Yes. Now.

911
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,301
I'll be right back.

912
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,150
Why did you come without a word?

913
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,111
Mom seemed quite flustered.

914
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,364
On my way back after an interview,

915
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,366
I picked Min-ho up since I missed him.

916
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,244
Why? Can't I come here?

917
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,746
I came to see my child in my house.

918
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:56,126
Why on earth are you so unashamed?

919
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,503
Unashamed, my foot.

920
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,505
Had I been unashamed,

921
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,550
I wouldn't have struggled
outside the house.

922
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,720
You have no idea

923
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,097
how sad and miserable I felt

924
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,307
to leave the house.

925
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,020
-What?
-People get shocked when I tell them.

926
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,355
They say there's not a single man

927
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,691
who doesn't cheat in his life.

928
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,738
Do you actually mean that?

929
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,281
What I'm saying is this.

930
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,786
It wasn't a passionate relationship.

931
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,538
It happened only once.

932
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,417
It ended as a mistake.
When will you stop talking about it?

933
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,502
What if it didn't end?

934
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,087
What are you saying?

935
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,213
Mi-hwa…

936
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,884
is pregnant.

937
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,474
How does that make you feel?

938
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,689
Why do my feelings matter?
The baby must be In-tae's.

939
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,650
Even if it isn't, I don't care.

940
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,986
-You don't care?
-No.

941
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,030
Min-ho is my only child.

942
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,157
You're my only woman.

943
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,204
Am I supposed to be moved?

944
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,789
Jeong-suk.

945
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,957
Let's stop.

946
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,668
You should know how to cover up
a mistake and move on.

947
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,379
Aggravating me in a fit of temper
isn't a wise move.

948
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,675
If our marriage really ends,
what about Min-ho's life?

949
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,553
What?

950
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,431
Remember how my mom said
that you were strangely depressive

951
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,600
because you were raised
under a single mom?

952
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,229
What will you do if you pass down
the same fate to Min-ho?

953
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,276
What are you…

954
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,071
Hey, Han Jeong-suk!

955
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,159
I'll leave for today.

956
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,452
Think this through.

957
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:58,456
Do you think it's okay to hurt Min-ho
when he's the happiest by his dad's side?

958
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,316
Mom, where's Dad?

959
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,653
Min-ho.

960
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,658
Dad had to leave in a hurry
because something came up.

961
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,619
Without saying goodbye to me?

962
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:42,625
He'll come back soon to see you.

963
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,837
He said he'd leave
after putting me to bed.

964
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,881
He promised.

965
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,676
Min-ho, don't cry.

966
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,971
Did you finish preparing
for school tomorrow?

967
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,139
No.

968
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,018
I need to finish coloring the drawing.

969
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,729
Get to it.

970
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,401
By the way, Mom,

971
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:12,614
we can live with Dad from now on, right?

972
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,824
What?

973
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,035
Dad told me

974
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,996
that he can find work in Geumje.

975
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,041
We can live with Dad

976
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,710
once he finds work in Geumje, right?

977
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,511
You should go inside
and do your homework, young man.

978
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,387
The night will end at this rate.

979
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,639
Okay.

980
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,894
Mom.

981
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,231
Can I go outside and get some air?

982
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:48,858
Okay.

983
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,111
Take a stroll around the town.

984
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,323
You must feel terrible.

985
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,951
I'll be right back.

986
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:21,849
My goodness.

987
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,727
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

988
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,439
Sorry.

989
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,649
Are you okay?

990
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,818
I told you to look where you were going.

991
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,162
Are you okay?

992
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,415
You seem very drunk.

993
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,349
I've been looking for something
for many years.

994
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,978
That was why I came to this town.

995
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:57,403
For over ten years, I've chased after it
thinking that it was the answer.

996
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,824
But I learned an entirely different truth.

997
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,745
Now, my investigation
will need to take a new direction.

998
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,082
I don't know if it's right.

999
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,168
I'm lost.

1000
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,219
I feel the same.

1001
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:28,976
I've lived my entire life,
only caring about my family.

1002
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,106
But something I'd never imagined happened.

1003
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:41,406
Now, it's time to make up my mind.

1004
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,034
But I don't know…

1005
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,329
which path

1006
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,250
will make my child happy.

1007
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,295
Did you ask him?

1008
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,048
The path that'll make him happy.

1009
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,009
Instead of taking a guess…

1010
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,264
you should ask your child.

1011
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,729
Even if it's painful,
you'll have fewer regrets.

1012
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,998
At least you can ask.

1013
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,293
Min-ho.

1014
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,094
It's when we went on a picnic
to Lake Soyang.

1015
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,179
Yes.

1016
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,934
MY FAMILY

1017
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,561
Min-ho.

1018
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,943
When are you the happiest?

1019
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,989
Is it when our family
is together like this?

1020
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,574
Yes.

1021
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,077
We're happy when we're together.

1022
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,248
When Dad smiled, you smiled.

1023
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,792
When you smiled, I smiled.

1024
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,128
I read it in a children's book.

1025
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,464
"A happy person
makes another happy person."

1026
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,732
Try it.

1027
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,616
Watch.

1028
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,035
Hold it like you're holding a hook.

1029
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,370
Make it parallel to the water

1030
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,623
and throw it like this. Understood?

1031
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:26,797
Mom, did you see it?

1032
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,676
If you practice a bit more,
you'll make it skip three times.

1033
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,595
I'll make it happen today.

1034
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,931
-Here. Keep practicing.
-Okay.

1035
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,237
Thank you.

1036
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,492
I know that it wasn't easy.

1037
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,954
It wasn't easy,

1038
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,123
but I think this is the right choice.

1039
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:07,463
We had so much fun
when we came here last time.

1040
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,381
Remember?

1041
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,179
Min-ho told me

1042
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,724
that your smile made me smile,

1043
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,561
and my smile made him smile.

1044
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:31,821
He read in a children's book

1045
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,824
that a happy person
makes another happy person.

1046
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,078
However,

1047
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:43,290
I think unhappiness seeps in faster.

1048
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,504
Since the day
I saw you and Mi-hwa together…

1049
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,384
I haven't smiled from my heart.

1050
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,269
We can smile from now on.

1051
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,064
Now…

1052
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,819
I find your smile disgusting.

1053
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,571
What?

1054
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:16,490
If I'm unhappy, Min-ho will feel it.

1055
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,537
I can't let that happen.

1056
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,543
What are you doing?

1057
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,838
I thought you'd changed your mind.

1058
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,174
Did you plan this to say this shit?

1059
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,010
Are you insane?

1060
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,180
I want you to feel pain.

1061
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,057
What?

1062
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,726
I want you to remember

1063
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,314
the things you've lost
and feel pain for years to come.

1064
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,233
Hey, Han Jeong-suk.

1065
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,069
Now…

1066
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,448
get lost from my life.

1067
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,922
Let's get a divorce.

1068
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:24,767
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

1069
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,789
Is there anything we can do for her?

1070
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,165
Shall we introduce her to a man?

1071
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:52,169
They say you heal
the wounds of past love with new love.

1072
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,589
Would you come to my place tomorrow?

1073
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:56,799
What?

1074
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,093
Isn't that police officer a bit scary?

1075
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,222
He's a bit scary since he doesn't say much

1076
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,849
and is expressionless.

1077
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,310
I have an in-home sale scheduled
for tomorrow, but something came up.

1078
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,521
I wondered if you could go instead.

1079
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:13,274
Let's work and get some fresh air
as if we're on a trip.

1080
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,192
We'll be able to refresh ourselves.

1081
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,653
We're from Fantasy Lingerie.

1082
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,363
-Hey!
-Let go of me!

1083
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,447
No!

1084
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,615
Oh, no!

1085
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,576
Would it be okay to ask

1086
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,661
who you're looking for in this town?

1087
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,999
She might be able to help.

1088
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:38,090
