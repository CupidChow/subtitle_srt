1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,752
I did it because Jong-seon told me to.

3
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,714
All I did was follow him.

4
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,882
Hey, Du-seok.

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,135
-So he's the accomplice?
-Yes.

6
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,847
Mr. Kim Du-seok led the crime
and drove the car afterward.

7
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,600
Mr. Park Jong-seon was the lookout

8
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,644
and was in the passenger seat
when the accident happened.

9
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,870
I could forgive you for the accident.

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,538
But…

11
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,792
how could you just leave behind
a bleeding man?

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,252
I can't forgive you for that.

13
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,463
I…

14
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,761
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,915
I'll never request leniency.

16
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,419
Please make sure
they get the punishment they deserve.

17
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,465
Yes, ma'am.

18
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,719
And I asked you this before.

19
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,974
If you find the person
who reported the accident,

20
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,684
please let me know.

21
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,522
The thing is…

22
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,024
Did you find the person?

23
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,029
The caller

24
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,784
was Mr. Park Jong-seon,
Ms. Seo Yeong-bok's husband.

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,662
What?

26
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,583
There's a witness who saw him
get out of the car and make a call.

27
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,212
The caller's voice in the recording
of the emergency call

28
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,047
matched Mr. Park Jong-seon's.

29
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,760
It seemed like he didn't tell you
because he felt guilty.

30
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,195
Yeong-bok, it's me.

31
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,679
Why did you come?

32
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,267
You should've gone to check in on Ms. Oh.

33
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,188
Let's go together.

34
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,732
She said…

35
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,820
she didn't want to see me ever again.

36
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,660
She'll feel uncomfortable if I visit her.

37
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,329
Of course, she might feel uncomfortable.

38
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,997
She might hate it.

39
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,587
But if you don't do anything,

40
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,840
you guys might actually become strangers.

41
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,426
Will you be okay with that?

42
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,974
Of course not.

43
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:32,730
She means so much to me.

44
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,566
If I could,

45
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,280
I'd get on my knees
and beg for forgiveness.

46
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,618
I'd apologize sincerely.

47
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,537
But…

48
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,165
But…

49
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,965
I want to tell her
I had complicated circumstances…

50
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:07,557
and beg her to hear me out just once.

51
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,559
Then go and tell her.

52
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:15,606
It'd be shameless of me to do that
after what happened.

53
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,651
I can't talk to her.

54
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,654
It's out of the question.

55
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,367
I'd look so desperate and pathetic.

56
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,704
What's wrong with that?

57
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,789
Regardless of the reasons,

58
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,000
you hurt her feelings.

59
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,253
Don't just sit back and be defeatist.

60
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,923
You should do anything to mend things

61
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,093
even if it may make you seem
desperate or pathetic.

62
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,304
Don't avoid it.

63
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,393
GEUMJE HOSPITAL

64
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,354
You didn't get a new patient gown today.

65
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,939
A new patient gown?

66
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,107
Yes.

67
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:03,237
His sister got a new gown every night
because he sweats a lot.

68
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,074
She said he needed to go to bed
in a clean gown.

69
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,745
She isn't his sister.
We're not even family.

70
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,749
I thought she was
because they seemed very close.

71
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,667
Your blood pressure is normal.

72
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,253
Please let us know if you have a headache.

73
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,546
-Okay.
-Thank you.

74
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,634
I'm glad that it's normal.

75
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,474
Are you okay?

76
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,935
What do you mean?

77
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,230
You cut ties with them.

78
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,112
I heard that it was another man
who drove the car.

79
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,952
In any case, he called the ambulance.

80
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,165
How could you say that in this state?

81
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,085
You nearly died!

82
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,712
Cutting ties with those nobodies
is not a big deal.

83
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,755
I know.

84
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,341
I'm not a saint,

85
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,676
so I did get upset.

86
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,470
But

87
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,558
they don't seem like nobodies

88
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,309
to you.

89
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,318
You aren't

90
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,531
the type to open up to people easily.

91
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,035
But you opened up to them

92
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,080
and got close to them
as if they were your family.

93
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,586
You must've gotten close
to them for a reason.

94
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,466
A reason, my foot.

95
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,636
Stop talking about them.

96
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,430
I'll get a new gown.

97
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,188
Here you go.

98
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,398
Thank you.

99
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,088
Mom, can I go and buy an ice pop?

100
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,425
Sure.

101
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,681
Oh, yes!

102
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,560
Where did Dad go to make money?

103
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,272
I told you that he went abroad.

104
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,815
That's right.

105
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,861
I hope he brings back presents
like clothes or a bag.

106
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,240
He'll make a lot of money abroad,
so I'm sure he'll bring presents.

107
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,993
Mom.

108
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,703
Yes?

109
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,456
Dad isn't away for work, is he?

110
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,463
Did you hear something?

111
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,507
When Dad was absent for a few years,

112
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,051
I had a hunch

113
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,887
that he wasn't away for work.

114
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,140
I feel like it's the same this time.

115
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,435
-Eom-ji.
-I'm okay.

116
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,938
I know how nice Dad is to us.

117
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,692
It's just…

118
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,071
I wanted to tell you this.

119
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,284
I was clueless when I was young.

120
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,330
But it must've been hard for you,
not being able to tell anyone.

121
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,712
Thank you for staying strong
and protecting us despite everything.

122
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,090
I admire you.

123
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,596
Admire, my foot.

124
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,515
Mom.

125
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,684
Yes?

126
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,770
Until Dad receives
proper punishment and returns,

127
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,939
let's hold out well together.

128
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,070
You have another person on your side,
so don't be weak.

129
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,799
You're a big girl now.

130
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,803
You're such a big girl.

131
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,097
You really are a big girl now, my dear.

132
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,161
What?

133
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,666
Hello?

134
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,087
Yes, Yeong-bok.

135
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,177
Where's the dishcloth?

136
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,429
Yeong-bok would wash it every day,

137
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,849
fold it nicely, and put it
in the drawer next to the couch.

138
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,906
Ms. Oh.

139
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,625
Ms. Oh, there's something I want to say.

140
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,462
Did you even hear what I said?

141
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,297
Leave.

142
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,052
Ms. Oh.

143
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,931
Would you please spare me a minute?

144
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,726
I need to take care of my husband.

145
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,853
I'm okay.

146
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,190
I was going to take a nap anyway.
Go ahead.

147
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,454
Ms. Oh.

148
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,417
I was so worried about my children

149
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,712
that I wasn't thinking straight.

150
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,799
But I didn't know from the very start--

151
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,884
Forget it.

152
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,220
Tell me why you're really here.

153
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,723
Do you want a settlement?

154
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,560
No. That isn't why I'm here.

155
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,478
Then what?

156
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,731
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

157
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,567
So why are you here, rambling on and on?

158
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,777
Do I look like a joke?

159
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,697
No, it isn't like that.

160
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,326
I just…

161
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,454
I just…

162
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,707
I just wish…

163
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,084
I just hope…

164
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,840
you aren't hurting so much.

165
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:27,431
I'm not brazen enough
to ask for your forgiveness.

166
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:34,563
But if you could understand me just a bit,

167
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:40,903
then the pain you feel might lessen a bit.

168
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,072
That's why I'm here.

169
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,698
I don't know.

170
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,287
Since the friendship is already over,
I don't feel much pain.

171
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,918
Stop with your presumptuous worries
and mind your business.

172
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,963
Ms. Oh.

173
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,719
Why are you
still not telling me everything?

174
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,307
That night,

175
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,812
the person who called
the ambulance for my husband

176
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,898
was your husband.

177
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,736
In any case, he's responsible
for the accident.

178
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,657
I thought that wasn't important.

179
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,244
And had I brought it up,

180
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:34,999
you would've probably thought
that I was after a settlement.

181
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,375
So…

182
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,838
Thank goodness you have a conscience.

183
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,965
Ms. Oh…

184
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,677
Yeong-bok.

185
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,179
Yeong-bok!

186
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,681
Yeong-bok! What's wrong?

187
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,975
My belly…

188
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,895
Please take me to an ob-gyn.

189
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,396
An ob-gyn?

190
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,816
Yeong-bok, are you pregnant?

191
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,152
Yes.

192
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,281
This won't do. I'll call for help.

193
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,283
-Oh, no.
-Jeong-suk.

194
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,036
Oh, no.

195
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,497
Yeong-bok, take a deep breath.

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,460
Breathe. That's right.

197
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,670
What should we do? Let's sit here.

198
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,881
Hold on.

199
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,134
Get up!

200
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,638
-What?
-You aren't actually unwell!

201
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,932
You played tag
with your girlfriend yesterday!

202
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,308
Hurry up!

203
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,268
Okay.

204
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,773
Yeong-bok.

205
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,193
Yeong-bok, come here. You can do it.

206
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,242
Hold tight, Yeong-bok.

207
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,330
Move out of the way!

208
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,165
Move out of the way! It's urgent!

209
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,086
Make way for us!

210
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,964
Make way!

211
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,467
Move out of the way! All right.

212
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,387
It's pelvic pain.

213
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,431
It happens when the bones and tendons
move around or stretch

214
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,393
because of the fetus.

215
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,480
The pain could intensify
depending on the mother's condition.

216
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,818
Well… Is the baby okay?

217
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,195
Yes. Ultrasound revealed no problems.

218
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,365
You can go home after a bit of rest.

219
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,783
Okay.

220
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,034
Thank you.

221
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,204
Thank goodness, Yeong-bok.

222
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,497
Listen.

223
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,543
You should've told me from the start
that you were pregnant…

224
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,840
I see why you couldn't.

225
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,762
Had I known, I wouldn't have said
such harsh words.

226
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,769
Why are you crying again?

227
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,312
I didn't say much.

228
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,861
I…

229
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,904
I know better than anyone

230
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,410
how kind you are.

231
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,126
Don't be mistaken.

232
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,254
I don't feel bad for you at all.

233
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,927
I just feel bad for the baby.

234
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,433
The baby is innocent.

235
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:46,482
Ms. Oh, I'm so sorry.

236
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:51,987
I'll atone for it for the rest of my life.

237
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,035
Stop crying.

238
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,122
I haven't forgiven you yet.

239
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,665
Okay.

240
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,925
It's a relief, right?

241
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,973
GEUMJE HOSPITAL

242
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,689
Seriously.

243
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,821
I'll atone for what I did to you
for the rest of my life.

244
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:39,118
I'm truly sorry.

245
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,622
I'm sorry.

246
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,875
Words won't do.

247
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:52,089
I'll give you a chance
to pay me back properly in the future,

248
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,508
so brace yourselves.

249
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,968
Yes, sir.

250
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,764
I'll do anything you ask me to do.

251
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,519
I'll do whatever, whenever.

252
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,728
Yes, I will.

253
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,582
I'll forward the settlement agreement
along with the case materials.

254
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,961
It couldn't have been easy,
but you made a decision in a few days.

255
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,880
Thank you.

256
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,177
Please make sure
people don't find out about the case.

257
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,346
If word gets out,

258
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,473
Yeong-bok's children will suffer.

259
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,476
I told the others to be careful,
but I'll do it again.

260
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,061
Thank you.

261
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,147
Right.

262
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,775
You lent me this handkerchief
the other day.

263
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,778
-I'm sorry I'm only returning it now.
-That's okay.

264
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:05,454
And I prepared this as a gift.

265
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,789
It's okay.

266
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,668
I made it. It's nothing big.

267
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,504
Thank you.

268
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,384
Is it a mouse? It's very cute.

269
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,678
It's a rabbit.

270
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,644
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,148
It's okay.

272
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,317
It's a signature of mine.

273
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,653
Many people mistake it for a mouse.

274
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,747
Thank you.

275
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,500
It's a rabbit.

276
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,087
BURAMARBLE

277
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,175
One, two… Oh, no.

278
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,763
What? Mom, you're
on Dong-u's property again.

279
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,932
-It's a hotel.
-It's Madrid.

280
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:11,061
It's a property with a hotel,
so the toll is 1.2 million won.

281
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,273
Did you say 1.2 million won?
Oh, no. I'm 30,000 won short.

282
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,441
Unfortunately, you went bankrupt.

283
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,653
All right. The two of you should play.

284
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,906
I need to pack up since Min-ho is going to
his uncle's place tomorrow.

285
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,616
-Okay.
-All right.

286
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,412
Make sure you practice
while I'm at my uncle's place.

287
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,706
Do I need to practice?

288
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,419
It's a game that requires strategies.

289
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:39,798
We'll be able to have a better match
if you practice a bit.

290
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,800
Okay, I'll try.

291
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,886
-What? Keep playing.
-Okay.

292
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,972
It's my turn.

293
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,522
Hello?

294
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,235
Hello, Detective.

295
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,698
I see.

296
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,658
I was actually curious about that too.

297
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,497
Will the settlement agreement
change the sentence?

298
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,498
Yes.

299
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,169
When it comes to sentencing, the
settlement agreement is the most crucial.

300
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
He'll be
in the detention center for a while.

301
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,467
But after the trial,
he might be released on parole.

302
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,554
I'm really glad to hear that.

303
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,556
Yes.

304
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,229
I think the case will get wrapped up soon.

305
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:41,151
Would you be free
to have dinner with me tomorrow?

306
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,989
I've been very busy since our date.

307
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,325
Okay.

308
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,496
I can do it since Min-ho is going
to my brother's place with my mom.

309
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,041
Where shall we meet?

310
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,586
Why don't you come to my place?
I want to cook dinner for you.

311
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,298
Okay. That sounds good.

312
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,759
Okay.

313
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,642
DATE IDEAS: ROLLER SKATING RINK,
MOVIE THEATER, GAME ARCADE

314
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,942
Hey, Ju-ri.

315
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,401
-You're here.
-Yes.

316
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,364
You said you'd think of a date idea.
Have you decided?

317
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,116
No.

318
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,784
You know,

319
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,203
it's so hard.

320
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,372
Where can we enjoy a fun date

321
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,541
while avoiding other people's eyes?

322
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,588
If you can't think of any,

323
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,340
why don't we go to a motel?

324
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,802
What? That's a bit…

325
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,055
Dismissive much?

326
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,267
This is a bit awkward.

327
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,102
I said I wanted a casual relationship.

328
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,104
It isn't like that.

329
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,524
All the motels in the neighborhood
belong to my mom.

330
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,984
I used to collect rent.

331
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,945
You didn't want the word to spread.

332
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,614
If we go to a motel,
word will spread right away.

333
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,578
So whether it's casual or not,
we won't be able to go on a date.

334
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,122
It's not like an at-home date
is an option.

335
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,541
I'll figure something out.

336
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,170
For now, why don't we have

337
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,756
a quick date in the dispensary

338
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,633
like the last time?

339
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,389
No. I need to go to the office.

340
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,266
Contact me when you finish thinking.

341
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,603
Hold on, Ju-ri.

342
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,772
But I've prepared everything.

343
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,401
Product description?

344
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,029
Yes. I think we should begin
preparing the brochure

345
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,947
I mentioned last time.

346
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,158
There's a lot of work to be done,

347
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,368
so we should write
the descriptions in advance.

348
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,953
-I see.
-Okay.

349
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:01,291
So we should pick the products
and write a description for each at home.

350
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:05,837
Yes. It'll be easier
if you take similar products.

351
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,381
Pick first,
then I'll take the remaining ones.

352
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,467
The branch manager is the best!

353
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,097
I'll take the products for men.

354
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,601
-Will you take the products for men?
-Yes.

355
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,063
I'll take the gel and massage oil.

356
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,607
My sales were the best
when I promoted these.

357
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,861
Then I'll take the slip dresses.

358
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,322
Jeong-suk and I
studied the garments, after all.

359
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,825
I'll introduce it that way.

360
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:40,247
-All right. I see.
-It'll be professional.

361
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,499
What? Is this for men as well?

362
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,885
GEUMJE OKSAN
MISSING CHILDREN CASE

363
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,597
Detective Kim left early
for his dinner plans.

364
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,349
Shall we go out for a drink?

365
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,059
What? No.

366
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,479
I have something to do.
You should get going.

367
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,523
Okay.

368
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,820
By the way,

369
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,907
you spend a lot of time alone
in the office these days.

370
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,537
It's just that I have work left.

371
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,874
I think you have something in the drawer.

372
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,626
That's the reason, right?

373
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,797
-What?
-You don't want Detective Kim to know.

374
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,923
Right?

375
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,137
How did you know that?

376
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,390
I also stay behind and read it sometimes.

377
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,516
What?

378
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,189
If yours is a foreign one, let's share.

379
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,649
NEOGUNE
10 SEXY MOVES, COLLEGE GIRL

380
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,526
Get out.

381
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,986
It's really good.

382
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,988
-Hurry up and go home.
-It's good.

383
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,740
-Go home already!
-Seriously.

384
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,618
For goodness' sake.

GEUMJE OKSAN
MISSING CHILDREN CASE

386
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,094
Yeong-bok, shall I take more items?

387
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,222
She's busy with her branch manager duties,
so give them to me.

388
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,601
It's okay. It's better to have
something to do.

389
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,646
You must be busy
since you have a boyfriend.

390
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,648
Gosh. Ju-ri, did you get a boyfriend?

391
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,108
How did you know?

392
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,862
I got a hunch when you picked
the products for men.

393
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,491
Enjoy testing the products.

394
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,453
Well, I need to look for a place.

395
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:47,290
An at-home date is nice,
but neither of our places is free.

396
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,167
Why is an at-home date nice?

397
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,171
Well, it's simple,

398
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,881
yet perfect for getting physical.

399
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,761
They act like
they're just inviting you for a meal.

400
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,223
But when you guys are alone

401
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,891
in the house…

402
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,936
You guys will end up
doing something R-rated.

403
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,562
Something will surely happen.

404
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,485
It might really be just a meal
and nothing more.

405
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,573
What's with the naivete?

406
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,325
Don't act so innocent.

407
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,494
Seriously. You know how it goes.

408
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,664
You're old-fashioned.

409
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,541
There's so much you can do at home.

410
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,628
Why don't you come to my place?
I want to cook dinner for you.

411
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,757
Is she the Virgin Mary or what?

412
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,009
Did a child suddenly pop out?

413
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,651
R-rated, my foot.

414
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,278
We'll just have dinner…

415
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,446
BURAMARBLE

416
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,697
…and play a board game.

417
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,949
It'll be G-rated.

418
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,635
Detective.

419
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,934
Detective.

420
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,733
What?

421
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,237
Why is he taking a shower
when he invited me here?

422
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,698
What for?

423
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,267
Why did you take a shower now?

424
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,980
I had to wash up, didn't I?

425
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,608
Hurry up and take a shower, Jeong-suk.

426
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,377
Hey, you're here.

427
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,215
Yes. The door was open.

428
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,217
I kept it open on purpose.

429
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,803
Sauce splattered while I was cooking,
so I washed my hair.

430
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,264
I thought you might arrive
during that time.

431
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,932
I see.

432
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,268
You must be hungry.

433
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,605
I'm going to make pasta.
Would that be okay?

434
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,315
Pasta?

435
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,901
It's like spaghetti.

436
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,822
I see. Yes, I've seen it on TV.

437
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,167
I'll do it. Just leave it.

438
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,961
There are only a few plates.

439
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,838
We should clean up
to hang out comfortably.

440
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,966
I brought something for entertainment.

441
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,843
Entertainment?

442
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,178
Yes. It's in my bag.

443
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,222
Please take it out and set it up.

444
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,225
Okay.

445
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,038
Did you find it?

446
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,082
Yes.

447
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,127
So you're saying

448
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,256
you brought these for me, right?

449
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,425
You don't know how to play, do you?

450
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,762
I know well, so I'll teach you
step by step.

451
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,806
Oh, my!

452
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,017
Why did you…

453
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,145
My goodness.

454
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,939
These were the only things in the bag.

455
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,274
My goodness, not this bag.

456
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,610
I meant this one.

457
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,616
-I see. Buramarble.
-Yes.

458
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,702
-I'll set it up.
-Okay.

459
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,705
-My goodness.
-Okay.

460
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,677
I should've taken it out myself.
Things got so awkward.

461
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,262
Too expensive.

462
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,107
Ms. Han.

463
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,901
Let's stop having strange thoughts.

464
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,862
Detective invited me with pure intentions.

465
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,783
Ms. Han.

466
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,246
You need to go to Hong Kong.

467
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,414
What?

468
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,003
Go to Hong Kong? What do you…

469
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,507
You rolled the dice and got seven.

470
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,803
Three, four, five, six, seven.
It's Hong Kong.

471
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,681
I see. Yes, Hong Kong.

472
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,267
One, two, three, four, five… Yes.

473
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,685
This Hong Kong.

474
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,770
What other meaning…

475
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,317
I'm sorry.

476
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:53,906
I had a chat with the in-home sales reps
before coming here.

477
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,035
They said something is bound to happen

478
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,830
if you're on an at-home date.

479
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,130
It's not like I thought
that was your intention.

480
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:13,760
It's a ridiculous thought, but…

481
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,973
I don't think it's a ridiculous thought.

482
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,728
What?

483
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,647
That thing that's bound to happen
on an at-home date…

484
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,487
I want that too.

485
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,996
OKSAN RESTAURANT

486
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,790
Thank you for the food.

487
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,086
This candy is
the tastiest thing they have.

488
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,963
But you emptied all the plates.

489
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,214
My goodness.

490
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,423
Mom.

491
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,927
Would it be okay if I moved out?

492
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,263
Why so suddenly?

493
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,183
My workplace is far away,
so it gets exhausting.

494
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,935
Isn't it a ten-minute walk?

495
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,023
Even a ten-minute walk
can be exhausting at times.

496
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,861
Gosh, it can't be more exhausting
than having a son like you.

497
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,946
Geez, stop spouting nonsense.

498
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,656
Here. Eat a candy.

499
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,536
That's right. Mom, aren't you going
on a trip abroad with Dad soon?

500
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,124
Yes. We'll go to China
with the Royal Club members next week.

501
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,085
I'm going to Seoul next week for business.

502
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,421
Then Dae-geun will be home alone.

503
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,339
What? Really?

504
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,592
Why are you so surprised?

505
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,094
What? Do you think I'll make you starve?

506
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,891
I'll make a big pot of bone broth soup
before I go, so don't worry.

507
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,729
Thank you, Mom. Thank you so much.

508
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,856
What's up with you?
You don't even like beef bone soup.

509
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,815
Seriously.

510
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,110
That isn't true. I like it.
I'm obsessed with it.

511
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,321
Really? Are you obsessed with it?

512
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,326
HOW TO USE A WHIP

513
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,465
These were the only things in the bag.

514
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,424
My goodness.

515
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,850
That startled me.

516
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,233
"As lightly as possible."

517
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,550
HONG KONG - 80,000 WON

518
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,439
Hello?

519
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,942
Yes, Captain.

520
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:00,987
Now?

521
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,453
Recently, I talked on the phone
with Yeong-ho's mom,

522
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,664
who runs a hanbok shop in Yeongeup.

523
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:15,459
She said a detective asked her
about the missing children case

524
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,670
because he was looking for his parents.

525
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,883
Only I know about it,
so you don't need to worry.

526
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,762
I couldn't get it off my mind,

527
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:32,059
so I contacted a junior police officer
who investigated the case with me.

528
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,061
He said something strange.

529
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,316
There's an orphanage in Yeongeup.

530
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:43,029
It closed down recently
because the director passed away.

531
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,115
Following the director's death,
hidden materials were revealed.

532
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:50,369
He said they seemed to be connected
to the missing children case.

533
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:52,955
These are

534
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,708
the materials.

535
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,336
Why does he think that?

536
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:03,341
Yeongeup Orphanage sent about 20 children
for international adoption.

537
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,595
But eleven of them
weren't from the orphanage.

538
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,431
There are no files
regarding their admissions.

539
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,476
Only their adoption applications
were found.

540
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,189
Do the adoption applications have
the children's photos?

541
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,483
Just a few.

542
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,320
They all look similar
since they were all newborns.

543
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,948
It's hard to tell them apart
since the photos are in black and white.

544
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:33,454
But thankfully, this three-year-old
girl's photos are clear.

545
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,872
Take a look.

546
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,298
It's the same girl, right?

547
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,303
There's a high chance
the other children were kidnapped too.

548
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,475
Is there any information
on who brought in these children?

549
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,687
No, but… My goodness.

550
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,401
A price was written
on the children's files.

551
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,279
It was 10,000 won per child.

552
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,116
TEN THOUSAND WON

553
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,536
In the 1960s, it was a hefty sum.

554
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,706
These children lived
in the unpopulated mountains,

555
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,960
so there were no witnesses whatsoever.

556
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,296
Was there no other link
between the victims?

557
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,299
Perhaps they were born
in the same hospital.

558
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,678
It was rare to give birth
in a hospital back then.

559
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,139
They did have the same midwife.

560
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,475
But she had a solid alibi.

561
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,311
Do you know where she lives?

562
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,541
Excuse me.

563
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,463
Hello, ma'am.

564
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm Detective Kim Do-hyeon
of Geumje Police Station.

565
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,051
I have a few questions.
Do you have a minute?

566
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,846
By any chance,

567
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,725
are you here because of that incident?

568
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,689
I did think someone would come.

569
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,530
Thirty years ago, children went missing
in Geumje and Oksan.

570
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,910
I heard you were their midwife.

571
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,953
Do you know anything about it?

572
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,924
Who are you?

573
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,218
Mother.

574
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,476
By any chance,

575
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,812
are you here because of that incident?

576
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,567
I did think someone would come.

577
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,362
Gosh, you're at it again.

578
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,907
Why do you say that
when I visit every day?

579
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,826
She has Alzheimer's disease.

580
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,704
By the way, who are you?

581
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,879
You worked as a midwife's assistant?

582
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,757
Yes. It's been about 20 years.

583
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,926
Twenty years?

584
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,347
Did someone else do it before you?

585
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,892
Yes, I heard that there was
another assistant.

586
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,270
What was the name?

587
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,479
Ok-yeop's mom.

588
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,649
Gosh, do you remember?

589
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,195
Her mind becomes clear from time to time.

590
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,493
Did you say Ok-yeop's mom?

591
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,371
Ok-yeop's mom.

592
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,625
She told me she started
a business in the town center.

593
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,877
She told me to visit.

594
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,424
Do you remember
what kind of business it was?

595
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,471
Who are you?

596
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:26,145
A woman in her 50s or 60s
with a son named Ok-yeop.

597
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,315
And she runs a business
in Geumje town center.

598
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,068
Those are the clues we have.

599
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,153
Yes.

600
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,365
Since she has Alzheimer's disease,
it's not certain. But we should check.

601
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,660
Ok-yeop isn't a common name,

602
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:46,582
so I'll go through the IDs
of the residents I've investigated.

603
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,835
I'll come and help after I ask around.

604
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,670
-Okay.
-Okay.

605
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,716
-My goodness.
-Go ahead and eat.

606
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,427
-All right. Take one.
-It looks delicious.

607
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,553
Hello.

608
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,806
-Hello.
-Welcome. Take a seat.

609
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,142
Are you here for sales?

610
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,143
Thank you.

611
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,563
I'm here to ask a question, not to sell.

612
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,481
I see.

613
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,360
Have you heard of the name, Ok-yeop?

614
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,529
He's a man in his 30s.

615
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,532
Oh-gyeop? Like "Oh" of "Oh, no?"

616
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,784
My goodness.

617
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:25,287
No. It's "Ok," as in, "Okay."

618
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,665
-I see. Ok-yeop.
-Ok-yeop.

619
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,167
-I've never heard the name before.
-Same here.

620
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,253
It's a very unusual name,
so no one would forget it.

621
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,797
But I have no idea.

622
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,465
-Me neither.
-Right.

623
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,677
Why are you looking for this man?

624
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,970
Well…

625
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,516
You see,

626
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,436
someone I met during in-home sales
talked about Ok-yeop's mom.

627
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,063
But I had never heard the name before.

628
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,731
Ok-yeop's mom?

629
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,819
Sun-ae, who has lived here the longest,
doesn't know anyone with that name,

630
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,904
so he can't be someone around here.

631
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:02,950
Hey, can you stop saying
that I've lived here the longest?

632
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,827
People will think we're the same age.

633
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,413
The same age? Sure.

634
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,581
Stop joking around.

635
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,167
I'm not joking around.

636
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,420
Tell me. Who looks younger?

637
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,589
-I don't know.
-Let's count the wrinkles.

638
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,133
Who has more wrinkles?

639
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,259
Who looks younger?

640
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,178
-One, two, three, four, five…
-I don't have many wrinkles.

641
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,722
-I'll get going now.
-Okay.

642
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,766
-Thank you.
-All right.

643
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,767
-Bye.
-Bye.

644
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,603
-But you have lived here long.
-Hello.

645
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,771
I should leave too.

646
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,233
Let me ask you something.

647
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,402
Do you know anyone named Ok-yeop?

648
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,738
-Ok-yeop?
-A man in his 30s…

649
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,366
His mother…

650
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,703
It makes no sense
that it isn't in the moving records.

651
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,456
Could it be that you got the name wrong?

652
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,458
No, I don't think that's it.

653
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,209
Tomorrow, I'll check…

654
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,630
What? What's going on?

655
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,301
What are you hiding
that you suddenly stop talking?

656
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,636
We aren't hiding anything.

657
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,431
We were talking about a case.

658
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,183
What case?

659
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,352
-Mill…
-Car repair…

660
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,690
You guys are hiding something.

661
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,903
We're a team. Let's work together.

662
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,362
Forget it.

663
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,491
It's a secret project.

664
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,242
How could you have

665
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,662
a secret project with him
when I'm his senior? Why?

666
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,747
It's…

667
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,834
You can't keep a secret.

668
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,296
-Let's talk later.
-Okay.

669
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:45,928
Detective Na.

670
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,095
What?

671
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:51,683
It's about the inheritance dispute
in the family that runs a wallpaper store.

672
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,851
What about it?

673
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,561
The second wife's child showed up.

674
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,646
What a mess!

675
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,607
But we can't confirm it
on the resident registration.

676
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,609
Check the family registration.

677
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,529
It'll show both the second wife's child
and the deceased people.

678
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,624
GEUMJE TOWN HALL

679
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,195
KANG OK-YEOP
BORN 11/24/1960, DIED 2/28/1961

680
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,490
That means he passed away 30 years ago.

681
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,537
FATHER: KANG DEOK-PAL
MOTHER: CHO SUN-AE

682
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,663
Cho Sun-ae?

683
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,089
Writing together
makes it feel like a writing contest.

684
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,093
It was hard to write by myself.
I couldn't pick up speed either.

685
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,055
My goodness.
Yeong-bok, you wrote quite a lot.

686
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,099
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

687
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,143
I may not look it,

688
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,271
but I enjoyed writing in my school days.

689
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,357
Let me read yours.

690
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,692
-Do you want to?
-Yes.

691
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,610
Sure, here you go.

692
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:31,783
"This slip dress
that's as red as a poppy flower

693
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:36,163
is 'perpect' for showing your sexiness."

694
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,375
-Why are you laughing?
-What?

695
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,546
Yeong-bok, what's "perpect"?
That doesn't make sense!

696
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,715
-What? It's not "perpect"?
-So funny.

697
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,966
Oh, here.

698
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,261
PERFECT

699
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,805
I see.

700
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,267
I told you I'm not very well-educated.

701
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,231
Ju-ri, you made a mistake too.

702
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,232
What? Where?

703
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,859
Where?

704
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,403
"It's a ring-shaped product
that'll bring back

705
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,906
a man's confidence and power.

706
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,575
Hold yourself 'erection'
and wear it close to the body."

707
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,118
This part.

708
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,244
It isn't "erection."

709
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,122
It's "erect."

710
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,500
"Erect."

711
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,461
How embarrassing!

712
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,631
You made a mistake too.
You're not better than me.

713
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,802
But why is it "erect"?

714
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,847
Honestly, men wear this product
and get an--

715
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,934
Ju-ri, it's "erect."

716
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,394
You hold yourself erect.

717
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,773
-Okay.
-"Erect."

718
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,026
Come to think of it,

719
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,529
the problem isn't our writing skills.

720
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,365
We should start with basic grammar.

721
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,494
Ms. Oh will proofread what we wrote.

722
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,789
That's right. Write freely
without worrying about grammar.

723
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,874
-How nice.
-I'll fix everything.

724
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,126
Okay.

725
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,295
I'm nearly done,
so I'll go and buy some drinks.

726
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,841
-Really? Then I want Skoll.
-Skoll.

727
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,551
-I want Tabom.
-Tabom?

728
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,593
I want BB Col.

729
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,637
-BB Col. Skoll, Tabom, and BB Col.
-Yes.

730
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,555
Thank you.

731
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,348
-How about money?
-I have it.

732
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,733
That's right.

733
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,361
PAY PHONE

734
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,621
President of the Women's Club,
it's me, Han Jeong-suk.

735
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,082
You told me to call you.

736
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,752
Yes.

737
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,963
In the neighborhood,

738
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:53,091
is there a man in his 30s named Ok-yeop?

739
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,011
His mother would be in her 50s or 60s.

740
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,144
Yes. Okay.

741
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,026
Can you stop?

742
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,282
Ma'am.

743
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,370
You're looking for Ok-yeop's mom.

744
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,165
Stop it. It's meaningless.

745
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,460
What do you mean?

746
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,590
He's dead.

747
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,760
-What?
-I'm talking about Ok-yeop.

748
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,970
He died 30 years ago due to an illness.

749
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,516
I don't know what this is about, but stop.

750
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:46,228
Must you trouble the woman
who's trying to get by

751
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,646
after losing a child?

752
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,150
Do you know Ok-yeop's mom?

753
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:55,821
I don't know.

754
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,447
Please tell me.

755
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,950
There's something I must check.

756
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,251
Well…

757
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,549
STAR VIDEO RENTAL

758
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,633
It's me.

759
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:24,015
Yes, I'm Ok-yeop's mom.

760
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,143
Have a drink.

761
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,854
Okay.

762
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:38,196
So, from 1961 to 1965,

763
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,033
you worked as a midwife's assistant?

764
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,661
Yes.

765
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,456
After losing Ok-yeop,

766
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,417
my heart felt so empty.

767
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:54,296
As volunteer work,
I helped women give birth.

768
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,842
I had to do something
to pull myself together.

769
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,679
Do you know

770
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,141
how my child died?

771
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,566
A cold.

772
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,361
It was just a cold with a fever.

773
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,908
He just needed
to receive treatment at the hospital…

774
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,162
but we couldn't afford it.

775
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,167
All night long, I tried to break his fever

776
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,880
by wiping his body with a wet towel.

777
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,469
"Baby, don't go. I'm sorry."

778
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,012
"Don't go."

779
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,265
But

780
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,311
his body went limp.

781
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,525
He was a tiny baby
who was barely 100 days old.

782
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,696
I buried him and returned home.

783
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:15,543
I'm sorry. When I think about that time…

784
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,879
It's okay.

785
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,715
The thing is,

786
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,261
you began running a business
two years after your child passed away.

787
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,517
If I may ask,
how did your financial situation improve

788
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,394
when you couldn't even
afford the hospital?

789
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,812
It only took two years too.

790
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,441
My husband worked hard--

791
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,026
He was a tenant farmer.

792
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,488
Even with your salary
as a midwife's assistant,

793
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:45,907
you couldn't have afforded such expenses.

794
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,872
There's a story behind it.

795
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,459
I'll tell you everything from now on.

796
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,880
My goodness, I don't know where to begin.

797
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,009
That's right.

798
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,722
Detective, I…

799
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:22,068
I did take those children.

800
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:40,271
Dear Heaven, please let
each and every one of the children

801
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,899
be healthy and happy.

802
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:47,195
Please watch over them
so that they can become important people.

803
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,871
This is my daily routine.

804
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:03,545
I pray for the children's health
and happiness.

805
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,881
Do you think it makes sense?

806
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,844
You kidnapped children

807
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,556
and sold them for money.

808
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,184
I didn't do it for money.

809
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,020
Every single one…

810
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,108
of these children

811
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,319
came from a penniless family…

812
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,405
INTERNATIONAL ADOPTIONS SURGE

813
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,991
…just like my Ok-yeop.

814
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:39,873
Those families couldn't afford hospitals
even if their children got sick.

815
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,461
How could anyone be happy
growing up in such a family?

816
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,796
I think

817
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:52,510
I saved these children.

818
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,516
"Save"?

819
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,772
I resented my parents all my life.

820
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,526
"Why did they abandon me?"

821
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,989
"Why did they have me in the first place?"

822
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:17,327
I didn't know that it was your doing.

823
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,954
What? You saved me?

824
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,340
You're wrong.

825
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,760
When I sent the angels away,

826
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,471
I put a tiny cross tattoo

827
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,848
on their foreheads,

828
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,810
just in case I might
recognize them later in life.

829
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,272
But you have nothing on your forehead.

830
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,109
I have a burn scar on my arm.

831
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,571
I've had it since I was left
at the orphanage.

832
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,533
Then you're definitely not one of them.

833
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,787
I cherished my babies.

834
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,000
It looks like

835
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,087
you're an adoptee as well.

836
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,257
You grew up to be a great man.

837
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,010
Why are you so full of resentment?

838
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,263
-No, I--
-Here.

839
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,349
I'm going to pray now.

840
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,105
Even if I were to leave everything behind,

841
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,858
I should take my babies' photos.

842
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,200
Ms. Cho!

843
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,495
Ms. Cho, please come on out for a second!

844
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,335
Ms. Cho, you're inside, right?

845
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,421
Ms. Cho!

846
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:10,898
Ms. Cho!

847
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,693
What?

848
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,322
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

849
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,495
What brings you here?

850
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,707
Didn't you see the sign that reads,
"Closed for the day"?

851
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,960
I have to ask you something urgently.

852
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,173
Well, I was just heading out.

853
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,133
Shall we talk as we go?

854
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,635
Hold on.

855
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,725
This is Detective Kim's.

856
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,438
Did Detective Kim come here?

857
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,526
Where is he?

858
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,863
Tell me!

859
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,326
Detective!

860
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,662
Detective!

861
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,789
Detective!

862
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,877
Detective!

863
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,381
Detective!

864
01:01:58,965 --> 01:01:59,966
Oh, no.

865
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,428
Detective.

866
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:06,639
Jeong-suk.

867
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,559
It's okay now.

868
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,436
Let's get out of here.

869
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,577
Be careful.

870
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,375
-Let go!
-My goodness!

871
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,252
What are you doing? Hey!

872
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,087
Let go!

873
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,381
You can't go anywhere!

874
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,551
-Let go!
-My goodness.

875
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,720
It's over, Ms. Cho Sun-ae.

876
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,355
You're under arrest
for kidnapping children

877
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,566
in Geumje and Oksan

878
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,819
and illegal international adoptions.

879
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,032
-You kidnapped children?
-No, I didn't do it!

880
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,117
-Is it true?
-Let go!

881
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,578
-Hold tightly!
-Let go!

882
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,250
GEUMJE HOSPITAL

883
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,252
Geumje Police arrested

884
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:22,465
the culprit behind the horrific crime
of kidnapping children in Geumje and Oksan

885
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:25,343
and putting them up
for international adoption.

886
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,887
The suspect, Ms. Cho Sun-ae

887
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,431
kidnapped children
from poor families in remote areas

888
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,266
and teamed up with the director

889
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,310
of Yeongeup Orphanage
to forge the documents

890
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,729
-and receive money for adoption.
-Move!

891
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:40,358
Although the statute of limitations
has expired…

892
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:41,442
CAPTAIN SEO HYEON-SIK
GEUMJE POLICE STATION

893
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:45,071
…she poisoned the detective
who was after her,

894
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,908
locked him up, and committed arson.

895
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,913
So we plan to punish her for confinement
and an injury due to negligence.

896
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,790
Are you okay?

897
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,212
I'm glad that she's getting punished,
but I feel troubled.

898
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,508
I thought I was almost there.

899
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,264
Did you bring my belongings?

900
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,809
Yes, I brought mail.

901
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:17,311
You received a package from overseas.

902
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,484
It's from my adoptive parents.

903
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,819
I see.

904
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,253
They cleared out the garage

905
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:46,215
and found the clothing
I was wearing when they adopted me.

906
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,592
I see.

907
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,514
What? There's an embroidery.

908
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,771
It could be your real name.

909
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,782
In any case, I know for sure
that it's a new lead for my case.

910
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,711
Ms. Oh. Yeong-bok. Ju-ri.

911
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,379
-Hello.
-Hello.

912
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,300
How are you feeling?

913
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:32,345
I'm fine. I'll be discharged in two days.

914
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:35,014
I wanted to thank you guys.

915
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,225
The three of you helped a lot
in apprehending the culprit.

916
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,269
Gosh, don't mention it.

917
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,480
We just did what Jeong-suk told us to do.

918
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,773
My goodness.

919
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,692
Did Mr. Choi get discharged
from the hospital?

920
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,527
Of course.

921
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:52,156
While we're on that, why don't you come
to my house this weekend?

922
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:56,369
I'd like to invite you to a party
in celebration of my husband's discharge.

923
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,705
That's right.

924
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,501
You guys should come together
as an official couple.

925
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,962
Ju-ri, it isn't like that.

926
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,922
Okay. We'll come together.

927
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,467
"An official couple."

928
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,179
How sweet.

929
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:23,729
My goodness, why did you make
so much food?

930
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,743
It's tomorrow, right?

931
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:39,954
Yes.

932
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:43,457
My mom, dad, and sister are all away.

933
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,585
The house will be totally empty.

934
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,507
I'll bring the products,

935
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,675
so brace yourself.

936
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,888
Don't run around. You're stirring up dust.

937
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,391
You'll get hurt!

938
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,728
-Calm down, will you?
-Hello.

939
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,062
-My goodness.
-Hello.

940
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:07,064
-Congratulations on your discharge.
-Thanks.

941
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,150
You didn't have to.

942
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:11,819
Let me help. What should I do first?

943
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,529
-You're here.
-Yeong-bok.

944
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:17,199
Ms. Oh, we need another stove.

945
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,701
One won't be enough.

946
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,244
A stove.

947
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:21,495
I know where it is.

948
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,123
I put it away during work.
Let me go get it quickly.

949
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,500
-Please take a seat.
-Okay.

950
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,836
My goodness.

951
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,109
Gosh.

952
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:27,895
What?

953
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,523
What is this doing here?

954
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,609
…and found the clothing
I was wearing when they adopted me.

955
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,559
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

956
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:51,395
Your search for your biological parents

957
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,272
went back to square one.

958
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,691
I'll start over.

959
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,486
It's cool that you're a good photographer.

960
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,822
It's wonderful.

961
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,408
No one has said that to me before.

962
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:05,826
What are you guys doing?

963
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,952
Why are you here?

964
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:11,790
By the way, you told me
that you excluded Ms. Oh early on.

965
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,376
May I ask you why?

966
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,879
You're a wonderful babysitter.

967
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:19,256
-Really? Am I?
-Yes.

968
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,801
I'd imagined meeting my mother

969
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,471
hundreds of times.

970
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:28,974
Perhaps because of that,
I feel better than I expected.

971
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:36,148
