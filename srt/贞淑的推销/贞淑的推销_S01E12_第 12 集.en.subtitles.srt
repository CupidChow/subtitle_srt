1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,848
Where should I begin?

3
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,184
I…

4
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,188
loved the son of the servant
who grew up with me since childhood.

5
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,199
Becoming pregnant with you
turned the family upside down,

6
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,951
and he took off in the end.

7
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,082
I left the house in order to protect you.

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,005
It was my first time experiencing poverty,

9
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,468
but it was also my first time
experiencing happiness.

10
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,728
What?

11
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,235
Did the briquette go out?

12
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,161
Mommy will go and get briquettes.

13
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,517
Baby!

14
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,916
He needs a surgery.

15
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,172
Please help me with the medical bills.

16
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,674
Father…

17
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,363
Send him off well.

18
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,117
Make sure no one sees you.

19
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,201
Yes, sir.

20
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,456
They promised to pay
for your medical treatments

21
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,001
and send you to a family friend
if I gave you up.

22
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,676
In the end,

23
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,804
it was my decision.

24
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,061
The reality I'd face upon opening the door

25
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,480
scared me.

26
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,435
I'll go and take care of Min-ho.

27
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:32,939
Okay.

28
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,063
Are you okay?

29
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,149
Is this…

30
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,492
What are you doing here?

31
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,956
There's something I want to say.

32
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,836
I feel like…

33
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,133
I didn't get to say
what I really wanted to tell you.

34
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,310
I'm sorry.

35
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,245
I'm sorry.

36
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,337
It's all Mommy's fault.

37
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,135
I'm so sorry.

38
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,223
I'm sorry.

39
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,103
Ms. Han Jeong-suk.

40
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,986
I went to yours, but you weren't home.

41
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,242
Did you have a good talk?

42
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,011
-Did the newspaper arrive?
-Yes, it's here.

43
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,891
-Here. Taste it.
-Okay.

44
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:09,191
Gosh, it tastes amazing.

45
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,276
Really?

46
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,241
You know, about Do-hyeon…

47
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,996
Tell him to come by often.

48
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,792
He should start eating
his mom's tasty dishes.

49
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,507
Okay.

50
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,676
I'll tell him so.

51
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,473
Good morning.

52
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,225
-Hello.
-Good morning, Ju-ri.

53
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,938
Geum-hui, you look so cheerful today.

54
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,732
Did something good happen?

55
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,025
Yes.

56
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,861
I found my son.

57
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,207
It's Detective Kim Do-hyeon.

58
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,295
Detective Kim Do-hyeon is your son?

59
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,133
Goodness gracious.

60
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,929
So…

61
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,848
it is not part of Drama Game

62
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,518
but your story, right?

63
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,645
Stop asking.

64
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,356
I asked her five or six times
back home too.

65
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,489
My goodness, Ms. Oh.

66
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,659
All these years, you couldn't tell anyone.

67
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,744
It must've been so hard on you.

68
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,791
I'm so glad that you found your son.

69
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,294
Thank you.

70
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,008
I was worried that you'd judge me.

71
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,137
Why would we judge you?

72
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,305
As you know, I'm a single mom.

73
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,017
And my husband is an ex-con.

74
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,728
I got divorced
because my husband had an affair.

75
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,814
My life is full of drama,
to say the least.

76
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,446
That's right. We… How should I put it?

77
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,783
That's right.
We've shared our wounds with each other.

78
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,286
So, we'll be closer friends from now on.

79
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,169
How do you feel?

80
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,338
It doesn't feel real yet.

81
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,466
I bet it doesn't.

82
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,220
But you'll slowly realize
that you actually found your son.

83
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,765
-Right?
-Yes.

84
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,979
My goodness, how great.

85
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,612
-Detective.
-Hello.

86
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,071
It's your son.

87
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,199
He must've come to walk you home.

88
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,243
Hi.

89
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,661
Hello.

90
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,209
Come on, nobody bows
so politely to his mom.

91
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,921
You guys should welcome each other
more affectionately.

92
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,089
That's right. You should go,

93
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,926
"Hey, you're here!"

94
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,595
Then he'd go, "Yes, Mother."

95
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,013
Hurry up and do it.

96
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,562
Hey, you're here!

97
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,237
Yes, M…

98
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,281
M…

99
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,582
Shall we go?

100
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,172
Gosh, it's late. Let's hurry up and go.

101
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,800
-We'll get going.
-Bye.

102
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,973
Is there anything you want to eat?

103
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,058
Why don't the three of us get dinner?

104
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,560
Dinner?

105
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,442
I'll eat at home today.

106
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,905
But it'd be nice to eat together.

107
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,283
No, my husband will be home soon.

108
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,911
The two of you should enjoy your date.

109
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,332
See you tomorrow.

110
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,610
What? You're home early.

111
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,781
Why didn't you have dinner with Do-hyeon?

112
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,618
It'd have brought you guys closer.

113
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,454
I'm taking it slow.

114
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,414
I'll have plenty of chances
to eat with him.

115
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,001
You're right. Let's go inside.

116
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,632
That's so cute.

117
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,095
Why?

118
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,097
-All the photos look amazing.
-Really?

119
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,183
I want to frame all of them.

120
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,936
It's because the model is beautiful.

121
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,396
It's because the photographer is talented.

122
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,776
CHARMING HAIR SALON

123
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,904
FOR LEASE

124
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,618
I didn't know she'd lease it right away.

125
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,372
You must be very upset.

126
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,540
No.

127
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,251
I checked out a unit in Oksan. It's okay.

128
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,131
I'll use this opportunity
to take over Oksan.

129
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,053
You walk me home every day,

130
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,721
but get going first today.

131
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,349
It's okay. I'll walk you home.

132
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,184
Come on. It's late.

133
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,061
You have a hard time
waking up in the morning.

134
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,646
What if you're late to work?

135
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,023
If you keep insisting, I'll walk you home.

136
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,775
What? Okay.

137
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,527
Get home safely.

138
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,529
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

139
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,489
Bye.

140
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,700
-Go first.
-You go first.

141
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,035
You go first.

142
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,204
-Go on.
-Get home.

143
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,458
-Get home safely.
-You too.

144
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,850
That's right. One hotteok is Dae-geun's.

145
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:31,133
WONBONG PHARMACY

146
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,849
What?

147
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,521
It weighs on your mind, right?

148
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,023
What?

149
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,859
It looks like you're thinking about it.

150
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,279
Right.

151
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,200
To be honest,
I wanted to have dinner with her.

152
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,579
But I worried that it might pressure her.

153
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,458
Did we look awkward in your eyes as well?

154
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,503
Yes.

155
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,006
But…

156
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,010
it's natural to be awkward.

157
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,889
You two have been apart for 30 years.

158
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,517
I think it will come with time.

159
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,729
Right?

160
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,647
Yes.

161
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,567
Thankfully, the two of you have
enough time to become close.

162
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,950
You don't have much time.

163
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,536
It's next week.

164
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,580
You'll be transferred
to the Cold Cases Team.

165
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,624
It's so sudden.

166
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,544
There's a case
that involves a missing child,

167
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,672
so they asked for you specifically.

168
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,217
It must be because you solved
the serial kidnapping case.

169
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,304
I thought that it was unfortunate

170
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,641
that you'd have to move to Seoul
right after finding your mother,

171
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,018
but I also remembered

172
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,856
that solving the previous case got you
interested in missing children cases.

173
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,484
Yes. You're right, but…

174
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,695
Think about it.

175
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,906
Since the case also involves
international adoption,

176
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,034
they really need someone
who can speak English.

177
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,382
I'm sorry.
I had a stomachache this morning.

178
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,217
It took me a while, right?

179
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,469
It must stink in there.

180
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,309
It's okay.

181
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,105
There's something I want to ask.

182
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,442
What?

183
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,200
It has been a few days.

184
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,536
Although Dae-geun doesn't look it,

185
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,249
he has lived his entire life as the son
of a rich family, so it must be hard.

186
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,045
Ms. Heo asked me to kick him out
of the pharmacy as well,

187
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,547
but I'm stalling time.

188
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,643
My goodness.

189
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,660
My goodness.

190
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,246
It looks tasty.

191
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,964
I'm not exactly happy to see your face.

192
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,800
You'll be happy to hear
what I have to say.

193
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,386
What is it?

194
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,932
Did you decide to break up with him?

195
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,226
Yes.

196
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,313
I'll end the relationship.

197
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,195
Really? Do you mean it?

198
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,239
Now we're talking.

199
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,950
You made the right decision.

200
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,995
But there's a condition.

201
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:32,499
A condition? Do you mean another one
on top of giving you back the hair salon?

202
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,626
Yes.

203
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,007
Ju-ri.

204
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,432
I was going to give it to you tomorrow.

205
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,726
But I can give it to you today.

206
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,395
It's a present.

207
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,957
It would've been better
if I had used a tripod.

208
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,959
-Next time, I--
-No.

209
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,507
There'll be no next time.

210
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,385
I came here to break up with you.

211
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,971
What?

212
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,641
Let's break up.

213
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,773
What are you talking about?

214
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,777
You're joking, right?

215
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,613
Why would we break up?

216
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,159
Wait, is this because of your hair salon?

217
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,870
I know that it's hard,
but if we hold out--

218
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,163
Then what?

219
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,873
What if Ms. Heo doesn't budge?

220
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,042
What can you do then?

221
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,007
I'm sure you understand.

222
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,802
Ju-ri.

223
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,138
I know that I'm incompetent and lacking.

224
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,560
I know that it's selfish of me
to ask you to stay.

225
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,981
But I can't live without you.

226
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,069
Please don't do this, Ju-ri.

227
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,825
Ju-ri.

228
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,156
So 21 vibrators. How about thongs?

229
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,451
We have 15 pink ones, 16 black ones,

230
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,912
and seven pearl-encrusted ones.

231
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,874
We have seven boxes of condoms.

232
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,585
By the way, is something up with Ju-ri?

233
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:25,547
She said there was an important matter
and promised to tell us later.

234
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,840
I see.

235
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,176
Please hold on.

236
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,389
Hello, this is Fantasy Lingerie.

237
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,683
Do-hyeon.

238
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,189
I see.

239
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,568
Okay.

240
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,363
You have a date, right?

241
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,782
We'll wrap up here, so you can go ahead.

242
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,994
Do-hyeon has something
to say to you and me.

243
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,621
He wants to dine with us at home.

244
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,916
-Me too?
-Yes.

245
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,002
My goodness, you're the one
who should get off work early.

246
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,213
Gosh, had I known…

247
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,298
Don't I look too shabby?

248
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,800
You look beautiful.

249
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,346
-Ms. Oh, you're always beautiful.
-Oh, no.

250
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,974
My heart is fluttering.

251
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,726
She must be so happy.

252
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,438
So once you decide,

253
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,358
you'd need to leave next month?

254
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,818
Yes.

255
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,156
So I wanted to discuss it
with the two of you.

256
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,992
It'll take at least two years,

257
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,495
or it could be longer.

258
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,335
What do you think?

259
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,587
What?

260
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,342
You don't have to ask for my permission.

261
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,179
You should do what you want.

262
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,766
Jeong-suk, what do you think?

263
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,227
What do I think?

264
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,814
I think this is wrong.

265
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,984
Pardon?

266
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,945
Of course, you should go.
It's meaningful work.

267
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,991
But the two of you shouldn't part
when you're still so awkward.

268
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,203
Let's do a project in this week.

269
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,329
A project?

270
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,873
Yes. "Get Close Quickly Project."

271
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,468
PROTECTING GEUMJE LIVES
AND SAFETY

272
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,390
Wait.

273
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,851
Hello.

274
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,107
It's packed lunch.

275
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,194
I see. Thank you.

276
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,282
Make sure you eat slowly, okay?

277
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,999
Chapter One.
The highlight of the school days.

278
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,335
Eating Mom's packed lunch.

279
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,597
Here.

280
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,017
It's an umbrella.

281
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,605
Why is it raining so suddenly?

282
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,273
It's raining.

283
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,527
Chapter Two.

284
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,862
Mom coming to pick you up on a rainy day.

285
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,712
Chapter Three.

286
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,966
Having a drink with Mom.

287
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,679
Let me pour you a drink.

288
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,853
-Cheers.
-Okay.

289
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,611
Jeong-suk,
aren't you going to have a glass?

290
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,030
I'm the server today.

291
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,700
I'll bring more liquor.

292
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,410
I'll do it.

293
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,461
I won't eat it. No.

294
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,671
-Why not?
-What's wrong?

295
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,589
I don't want to.

296
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:22,343
He's refusing to eat
the carrots in the whelk dish.

297
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,764
I told him to eat it for his health,
but he said no.

298
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,891
What is he, a child?

299
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,853
You picked out the crown daisy
when we had the fish cake soup.

300
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:36,149
The crown daisy is only a decoration
in the fish cake soup.

301
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:41,279
I think carrots are a decoration
in all dishes.

302
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,614
Nonsense!

303
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,408
I eat this dish because of the carrots.

304
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,786
I eat this dish
because of the crown daisy.

305
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,289
Goodness, he has to have
the last word, doesn't he?

306
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,178
I got permission to sleep outside,
but it feels very strange.

307
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,055
Same here.

308
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,851
When I first started working
at your place,

309
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,897
I never imagined
that we'd become so close.

310
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,565
That's right.

311
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,527
Life is full of surprises.

312
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,700
I was a bit difficult
when you first met me, right?

313
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,788
No. It wasn't just a bit.
You were very difficult.

314
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,540
What? Geez.

315
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,627
You also changed a lot.

316
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,215
At first, you were like, "Gosh, no."

317
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,842
You were so coy.

318
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,510
Now, you know how to be jokey.

319
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,473
I guess I've become
very comfortable around you.

320
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,812
Right.

321
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,858
What's the next item for our project?

322
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,319
It's over.

323
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,991
-What?
-I saw you argue with Do-hyeon

324
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,410
and realized the two of you
became close enough.

325
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,665
Now, you can spend time together
without forcing things.

326
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,255
You think so?

327
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,257
Yes.

328
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,261
So, I'll focus on work starting tomorrow.

329
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,014
Okay.

330
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:36,269
By the way, Yeong-bok said
she'd be a bit late tomorrow.

331
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,063
That's right.

332
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,775
Tomorrow is the day, right?

333
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:52,785
Eun-ji, you aren't whining at all today.

334
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,875
Are you aware
that your dad is coming home today?

335
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,048
Are you?

336
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,493
Yeong-bok.

337
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,930
Does it hurt?

338
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,225
Kick this side too.

339
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,894
Hold on a second.

340
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,023
Forget it. You need to walk home.

341
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,442
Eat this.

342
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,116
Don't have any funny thoughts from now on.

343
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,953
Your first goal is to repay
Ms. Oh's family for their kindness.

344
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,663
Of course.

345
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,914
Your second goal

346
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,709
is to assist me with all your heart.

347
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:27,714
Like the fortune teller said,
I'll restore the family fortunes.

348
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,257
Okay.

349
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,926
I'll do my best
so you don't have to worry about

350
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,303
the household chores or the kids.

351
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,099
Hand Eun-ji over to me and get going.

352
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,810
-Here.
-Forget it.

353
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,813
You got discharged today.
Aren't you tired?

354
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,482
I don't have the right to be tired.

355
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,068
Eun-ji, come to Dad.

356
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,278
Come to Dad. Come here.

357
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,779
-All right then.
-Come here.

358
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,407
Slowly. Is she sleeping? All right.

359
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,160
-Gosh, my baby.
-All right.

360
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,037
Do it slowly.

361
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,164
You need to take this off first.

362
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,623
-She can't breathe.
-There you go.

363
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,462
We're almost sold out.

364
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,673
We should restock the condoms
and slip dresses.

365
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,884
Okay. I'll talk to the director.

366
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,678
We'll be rich at this rate.

367
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,891
Ju-ri, are you really okay?

368
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,935
You seem too fine for someone
who's going through a breakup.

369
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,354
We didn't date for very long.

370
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,191
I'm too busy to dwell on it.

371
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:50,171
It's the best camera
for photography students.

372
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:54,383
Practice taking photos with it
and go back to school next semester.

373
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,929
Okay?

374
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,182
Dae-geun.

375
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,685
Are you listening to me?

376
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,688
What? Okay.

377
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,525
I'm letting you study what you want.

378
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,445
Why are you so down
like wet clothes in the rain?

379
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,366
What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

380
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,540
I'm happy.

381
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,835
Thank you, Mom.

382
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:36,342
I thought he'd be okay after a few days.

383
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,344
How long will he be like that?

384
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,096
Was it the love of the century?

385
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,318
But there's a condition.

386
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,070
What is it?

387
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,489
Let Dae-geun

388
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,617
go back to studying photography.

389
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,870
What?

390
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,124
So letting Dae-geun study photography
is your condition

391
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,333
for breaking up?

392
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,796
Have you ever seen him take photos?

393
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:18,593
His eyes sparkle when he does it.

394
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,680
He'll definitely become successful.

395
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,310
Gosh, I'm dead.

396
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,270
Are you dead?

397
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,356
Hello, Ms. Landlord.

398
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,818
Your mom will scold you
if you play the game like that.

399
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:40,156
My mom lets me do
whatever I want to do most of the times.

400
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,576
My goodness, how kind of your mom.

401
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,205
I don't let my children do something
if I don't think it's right.

402
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,123
I'm iron-willed like that.

403
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,126
Still, there's no parent
who can win against the child.

404
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,380
The one who loves the other one more
is bound to be weaker.

405
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,178
My goodness.

406
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,232
WONBONG PHARMACY

407
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,337
Ju-ri!

408
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,381
Ju-ri!

409
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,133
Ju-ri!

410
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,890
It's yulmu tea.

411
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,436
I don't know if I can drink it
because I ate too much.

412
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,023
I'm glad you liked the food.

413
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,111
You're leaving tomorrow,
so I wanted to make you a delicious meal.

414
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,660
I'm beginning to feel disappointed.

415
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,787
What?

416
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,580
I'm leaving,

417
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,458
but you seem unbothered.

418
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,087
I'm sad about each passing day.

419
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,883
I've never felt so happy
and stable in my life.

420
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,844
Same here.

421
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,306
But I want to be positive.

422
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:33,769
I decided to use this opportunity
to focus more on work,

423
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,855
so it isn't so upsetting.

424
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,524
It's a lie.

425
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,193
What?

426
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,992
Mom cried yesterday too.

427
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,958
Mom, is Mister really leaving?

428
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,002
Yes.

429
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,463
So we're going to say goodbye tomorrow.

430
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,506
Make sure you don't cry.

431
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,466
Why?

432
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,594
He's leaving for important business.

433
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,388
If we cry,

434
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,682
his heart will ache.

435
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:18,147
Even if you're disappointed and sad,

436
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,444
hold back your tears, okay?

437
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,947
Mom, are you crying?

438
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,159
No, I'm not crying.

439
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,374
Oh, I didn't cry.

440
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,501
I had something in my eyes.

441
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,923
Mister, here.

442
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,050
What's this?

443
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,760
It's my farewell gift.

444
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,847
A gift?

445
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,856
Gonggi and ddakji.

446
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,608
Those are your most favorite items.

447
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,780
Once you move to Seoul,
you won't have me or Mom.

448
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,281
You'll be bored.

449
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,785
Right.

450
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,791
Thank you.

451
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,753
Can I give you a hug?

452
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,096
You can call me if you're bored.

453
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,683
Okay.

454
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,187
Come on. Give me a hug as well.

455
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,858
We have a lot of time.

456
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,819
Today is your day.

457
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,784
Thank you, Min-ho.

458
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,133
Once the investigation begins,
I'll be busy

459
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,010
and might be unreachable.

460
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,928
It's okay.

461
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,014
Our brochures led to more orders.

462
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,433
I'll become very busy too.

463
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,937
Let's both live diligently…

464
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,817
and reunite as our cooler selves.

465
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:30,738
Okay.

466
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,246
I'll get going now.

467
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,376
Okay.

468
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,087
Drive safely.

469
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,842
Don't skip meals even if you're busy.

470
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,012
Okay.

471
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,004
Thank you.

472
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,779
See you later…

473
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,700
Mother.

474
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,887
Okay.

475
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,809
I'll be waiting.

476
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,772
Okay.

477
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,699
The payroll!

478
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,475
How did this thief know

479
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,520
that today was payday?

480
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:55,067
Lately, there's been a burglar
on the loose in a neighboring town.

481
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,152
Could it be the same person?

482
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,491
-I don't think a thief did this.
-Then who?

483
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,619
The door was left intact.

484
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:10,165
This lock too.
Most thieves cut the locks off.

485
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,794
Does anyone else know the combination?

486
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,841
Only we and Director Shin know it.

487
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:22,761
-Director Shin.
-The director is coming today, right?

488
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,599
She said that she'd set off
from the countryside in the afternoon.

489
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,230
Shouldn't we call
the CEO's store in Seoul?

490
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,524
She should know about this.

491
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,734
-I'll make the call.
-Okay.

492
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,538
What is it?

493
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,166
The number is out of service.

494
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,504
-No way.
-What does that mean?

495
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,469
What does that mean? What should we do?

496
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,887
Detective, what should we do?

497
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,431
Out of service?
All of us will starve to death!

498
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,682
Please calm down.

499
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,645
So there was a store in Seoul,

500
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,189
but it went out of business?

501
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,523
Yes.

502
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,567
It happened a year ago.

503
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,652
It went out of business
within a few months.

504
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,822
They must be professional swindlers.

505
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,202
That means the CEO was in on this scam.

506
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,121
But I don't understand.

507
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:35,000
If money was the purpose,
why did they come to the countryside?

508
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,793
A big city would've made more sense.

509
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:37,878
I know, right?

510
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,796
They paid us regularly all this time.

511
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,882
Why did they only steal
the last paychecks?

512
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:47,930
Still, the total must be a lot
if we combine our paychecks.

513
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,810
The biggest problem is

514
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,688
that there are no products to sell.

515
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,445
Jeong-suk.

516
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,286
I'm really sorry, but…

517
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,706
may I head home first?

518
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,960
Okay. Go ahead.

519
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,212
Sure, get going.

520
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:24,007
The past few days must've been rough.

521
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,070
Jeong-suk's completely dazed.

522
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,155
It's understandable.

523
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,284
She was the most passionate
about this business.

524
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,452
I've never seen Jeong-suk like that.

525
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,745
Same here.

526
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,748
I can't believe it.

527
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,961
BRANCH MANAGER, HAN JEONG-SUK

528
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:11,865
Hello.

529
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,079
A dildo, right?

530
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,415
We're currently out of stock.

531
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,085
Then when can I buy it?

532
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,754
Well…

533
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,591
Well…

534
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,762
I don't know

535
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,182
when we will be able to sell it again!

536
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,525
I'm sorry.

537
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,925
What the heck?

538
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,677
Why are you doing this to me?

539
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,263
What did I do so wrong?

540
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,267
Why did you backstab me? Why?

541
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,559
Hello.

542
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,979
It's me, Jeong-suk.
Aren't you coming to work?

543
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,649
-What?
-All of us are waiting.

544
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,776
Hurry up and come.

545
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,998
Oh, hey.

546
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,459
Jeong-suk.

547
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,211
-My goodness.
-Hello.

548
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,088
I thought the office
needed to be organized

549
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,467
for us to come up with a plan.

550
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,638
I took care of the monthly rent
for the office.

551
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,681
Ms. Oh.

552
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,810
I met up with Detective Na
yesterday and whined.

553
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,394
He'll work harder that way.

554
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:50,982
I made the facial composites
of the CEO and Director yesterday.

555
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,193
I'll make copies and distribute them.

556
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,738
That's right.
Yeong-bok is good at drawing.

557
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,615
I can draw well.

558
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,116
Let's see them.

559
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,117
Here.

560
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,161
This one is the director.

561
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,664
And this is the CEO.

562
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,082
What do you think?

563
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,501
We'll catch them in no time, right?

564
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,380
I'm not so sure about that.

565
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,006
What? Why are you laughing?

566
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,092
Why? They look spot-on.

567
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,010
I'm sorry.

568
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,264
You're all making an effort,

569
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,975
but I behaved like a child.

570
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,893
Don't say that.

571
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,438
You picked us up
and kept us going whenever we fell.

572
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,608
You fell after charging forward
as if your life depended on it.

573
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,778
This time, we'll pick you up.

574
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,447
That's right. Don't cry.

575
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,450
-What? Please hold on.
-Okay.

576
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,497
Hello?

577
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,166
This is Detective Na
of Geumje Police Station.

578
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,918
Yes, Detective Na.

579
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:59,217
I think CEO Kim Mi-ran
might get caught soon.

580
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:00,886
Really?

581
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,680
I called my colleague
at Incheon Police Station.

582
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,267
They received a tip about seeing
Kim Mi-ran in a motel alley.

583
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,186
They'll contact me when they catch her,

584
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,938
so please wait a bit longer.

585
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,441
I'm putting a lot of care into this case.

586
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,943
Okay. Thank you.

587
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,865
Will they get caught soon?

588
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:22,949
I think so.

589
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,494
I need to go.

590
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,539
There are many motels in Incheon.

591
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,249
What will you do there?

592
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:35,378
Still, I can't sit and wait.

593
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,757
I must know exactly what happened.

594
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,884
I'll be the one…

595
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,804
to wrap things up.

596
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:49,309
ONE WEEK LATER

597
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,376
Thank you.

598
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,670
It's been a while, CEO Kim.

599
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:25,136
GOLD MOTEL

600
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,269
Say something.

601
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,147
How much of it was true?

602
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,149
Was any of what you said the truth?

603
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,991
I bet you feel like
it was a scam from the start.

604
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,159
But that isn't true.

605
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,621
I was certain about this business.

606
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,584
That was why I invested the money
I saved up all my life as a saleswoman

607
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:57,669
and opened a store.

608
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:05,260
At first, people came out of curiosity,
and the sales were good, but…

609
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,019
I don't know when it began,

610
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,980
but people began to write complaints
about it being indecent.

611
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,734
They kept protesting and called it
a menace to society.

612
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:28,241
In the end, people stopped coming.

613
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,995
I held out as much as I could,

614
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,374
but I had to close the business
after six months.

615
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,587
I wanted to die.

616
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,801
But I just couldn't end things like that.

617
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:53,683
That was why I went to a place
where no one knew me.

618
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,148
It's too hard to pull.

619
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,446
-Wait!
-What?

620
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,870
There won't be a crackdown here, right?

621
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:17,957
Of course not. The locals won't know
what happened in Seoul.

622
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,168
No one knows us, so this place is perfect.

623
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,962
Let's hurry up and go.

624
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,423
Push. Come on.

625
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,301
Come on.

626
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,347
And that place was Geumje?

627
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,850
Yes.

628
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,772
Director Shin took over the internal tasks
such as educating the employees.

629
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,441
During that time, I sold my car

630
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,778
and used the money to get the products.

631
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:51,241
You and the others did better
than I expected.

632
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,910
I thought…

633
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,497
I thought that we'd
get back up on our feet.

634
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,749
Then what?

635
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,672
The person who brought
the products from abroad got arrested.

636
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,215
Someone must've made a report.

637
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:11,136
I'm on the run because the police
want me for questioning.

638
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,513
Then what should we do now?

639
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,807
I don't know either!

640
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,559
Damn it!

641
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,317
By the way, shouldn't the world
give an answer to that question?

642
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,404
What?

643
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,032
A desire isn't something
to be embarrassed about.

644
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:37,203
What's embarrassing is expressing
that desire in a dark and twisted way.

645
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:41,499
That's why I want to let it
be expressed more openly.

646
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,501
Why do people keep stopping me?

647
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,628
There's no law for regulations,

648
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,631
so they're using the pharmaceutical
and duty affairs to accuse us.

649
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,011
Ms. Kim Mi-ran, this is the police.

650
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,512
Geez!

651
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,264
What? But…

652
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,351
Ms. Kim Mi-ran, this is the police.

653
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,439
If you believe
that this is the right path,

654
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,566
don't give up and find another way.

655
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,318
I'll do the same.

656
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,490
If you don't open up in ten seconds,
we'll break down the door.

657
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,329
Persevere. Let's meet again.

658
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,499
Are you really going to…

659
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,430
Where did she go this time?

660
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:43,436
She's running toward the intersection.

661
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,939
-Go and catch her.
-Yes, sir.

662
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:53,029
By the way, who are you?

663
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,823
Well…

664
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,776
If you believe
that this is the right path,

665
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,153
don't give up and find another way.

666
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,907
How was it?

667
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,118
Did it bring you to a fantastic world?

668
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,538
Yes.

669
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:47,208
We keep telling people to be honest,

670
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,377
but we should be honest first.

671
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,380
What's the desire in your heart?

672
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,133
I'm confident about this business now.

673
00:59:58,886 --> 00:59:59,929
GEUMJE ELECTRONICS

674
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,848
Another candidate for first place,

675
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,933
"I Know" by Seo Taiji and Boys.

676
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,839
I think it'll still be a hit.

677
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,635
People who persevere
even after going through the pain

678
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,512
that could destroy them
tend to be successful in the end.

679
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,974
That's who he seems to be.

680
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,062
Seo Taiji and Boys wins
two weeks in a row with "I Know."

681
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:49,979
Congratulations!

682
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,404
Mr. Seo, take the trophy.

683
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,864
It's a happy ending.

684
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,908
Congratulations.

685
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,868
Please tell us how you feel.

686
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,829
I'm over the moon.

687
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,180
There are a lot of people
who keep breaking the mold.

688
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,265
Yes. And what matters to them are

689
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,810
strength, bravery, and hope.

690
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,646
Have a meaningful week
chasing your dreams and goals.

691
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,107
We will wrap up today's Inkigayo

692
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,567
with Seo Taiji and Boys' "I Know."

693
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,944
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

694
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,311
4 YEARS LATER

695
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,605
Look at those balloons!

696
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,649
-Balloons?
-Yes, buy me balloons.

697
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,067
Don't be absurd.

698
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,624
JEONG-SUK HAN SALES

699
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,640
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

700
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,144
Congratulations.

701
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,148
-It's all thanks to President Han.
-You're too kind.

702
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,359
What are those balloons?

703
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,612
I thought about bringing flowers

704
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,781
but decided on something more meaningful.

705
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:08,075
Like a balloon,
I hope the business will grow

706
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,745
and take off.

707
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,792
Gosh, that's so thoughtful and romantic.

708
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,836
It isn't a romantic gesture for you.

709
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,380
Read the room. We'll be outside.

710
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:25,009
I'll leave you to it.
We'll prepare for the event outside.

711
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:25,968
Okay.

712
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,473
GRAND OPENING!
JEONG-SUK HAN SALES

713
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,267
Thank you.

714
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,228
You did it in the end.

715
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,108
I said we should reunite
as our cooler selves.

716
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,777
I finally kept that promise.

717
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,823
Do you need my help with anything?

718
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,951
Right.

719
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,288
It'd be nice if you could be
our first customer.

720
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,416
We're offering discounts
for the grand opening.

721
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,671
All right.

722
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:11,681
I was joking.

723
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:17,353
The opening ceremony will begin soon.

724
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:20,857
I'd be grateful if you could attend it.

725
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,234
The opening ceremony?

726
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,493
Jeong-suk, are you ready?

727
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,998
This feels like the real beginning,
so I'm nervous.

728
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:38,708
Everything will go well.

729
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,210
Of course. Four years have passed.

730
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,588
People's perception must've changed too.

731
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,839
Right?

732
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,676
All right. Get ready.

733
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:49,886
Pick up the scissors.

734
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,263
One, two,

735
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,015
three.

736
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,311
-All right.
-Congratulations.

737
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,938
Congratulations.

738
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,858
Only good things will come your way.

739
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:07,278
The birth rate will skyrocket in Geumje.

740
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,155
Come on.

741
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,491
-Go away!
-Go away!

742
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:17,747
An immoral business
and a menace to society, go away!

743
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,957
-Go away!
-Go away!

744
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,335
-Gosh, nothing has changed.
-Go away!

745
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,963
Let's drive away
the family-wrecking menaces!

746
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,256
-Drive away!
-Drive away!

747
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,758
We still have a long way to go.

748
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,135
Let's go inside for a bit.

749
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,012
-No.
-Go away!

750
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,764
-Go away!
-Go away!

751
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,516
I didn't come this far to back down.

752
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,270
Let's drive away
the family-wrecking menaces!

753
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,022
-Drive away!
-Drive away!

754
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,857
-Indecent business!
-Indecent business!

755
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,813
If they block our path,

756
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,107
we can fly into the sky…

757
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,029
even if it takes time.

758
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,201
Yes.

759
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:38,285
That's right.

760
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,375
That's right.

761
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,327
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

762
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:24,165
SPECIAL THANKS TO RA MI-RAN

763
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:28,020
