1
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,092
What's wrong?

3
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,013
Jeong-suk.

4
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,642
Jeong-suk, let me explain.

5
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,440
Honey, listen to me.

6
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,649
Don't touch me.

7
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,613
Jeong-suk.

8
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
Jeong-suk!

9
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,160
Damn it!

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,204
PARK IN-TAE

11
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,497
This is the last bus. You getting on?

12
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,477
My goodness.

13
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,988
You little punk!

14
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,157
I'm going to kill you!

15
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,245
-No!
-Come out, you bastard!

16
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,622
I'm guessing Seong-su wants a drink?

17
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,750
Why didn't he come himself?

18
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,215
One bottle won't do anything,
so you should take two at least.

19
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,883
Take this too.

20
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,679
How much is it?

21
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,515
One bottle of soju is 400 won,
and the shrimp crackers are 300 won.

22
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,683
The total is 1,100 won.

23
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,982
-Take care.
-Okay. Good night.

24
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,175
Geez, are you all right?

25
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,140
It's you, the detective.

26
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,684
-Thank you.
-Sure.

27
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,936
You seem very drunk.

28
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,564
Where do you live?

29
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,654
My house is over there,
but I'm on my way to the store.

30
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,948
I don't have enough alcohol.

31
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,618
You're plenty drunk already.

32
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,125
No, I don't think so.

33
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,339
I heard that getting drunk
will make me forget my problems

34
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,884
and help me feel better.

35
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,598
But the pain still feels too fresh.

36
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,103
It still hurts.

37
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,355
See you.

38
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,825
Geez.

39
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,370
Hold on.

40
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,295
Gong-ji.

41
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,215
Gong-ji.

42
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:11,681
Gong-ji, my sweet baby

43
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,534
What's wrong?

44
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,953
Didn't you say you have a lot of homework?

45
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,414
I can finish it during breaks.

46
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,291
I'm sorry.

47
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,752
Once I make some money,
I'll buy you a desk first thing.

48
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,088
Where will we sleep
if we put a desk in there?

49
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,136
Right! There would be nowhere to sleep!

50
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,689
Goodness me!

51
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,734
What are you doing?

52
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,652
What if people see?

53
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,156
You looked so sexy,
so I couldn't help myself.

54
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,908
Sexy, my ass.

55
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,744
My butt's so saggy after having four kids.

56
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,912
That's not true!

57
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,540
You're aging like fine wine, you see.

58
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,542
Who's that American singer?

59
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,794
Madonna! You're sexier than her.

60
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,839
Madonna?

61
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,592
My don't-know-nothing man.

62
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,345
The kids will hear your nonsense.

63
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,305
So, what's going on?

64
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,307
You said you were looking for work.

65
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,186
The planting's done for the year,
so there isn't much work left.

66
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,772
The election has kept
the print shop really busy,

67
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,941
so I'll look into that later.

68
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,484
-Okay.
-Yes.

69
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,779
What about you? Did you sell some?

70
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,658
Nothing yet.

71
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,784
Is that so?

72
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:59,413
Rome wasn't built in a day.
You'll be successful with time.

73
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,125
Keep your spirits up, okay?

74
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,213
You don't hate

75
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:11,008
that I'm going around
selling things like that?

76
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,761
I heard the other husbands
were flipping furious.

77
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,391
You're working hard to support our family.

78
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,475
Why would I hate that?

79
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,396
When we got married,
my mother had our fortune read.

80
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,481
-Our fortune?
-Yes.

81
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,776
The fortune-teller said
I have no luck with money

82
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,779
but that you are the pillar
supporting our family.

83
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,698
My mother said, "She's older,

84
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,867
has a strong personality
and she'll be the breadwinner?"

85
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,371
She thought it would be an issue,
but I was happy about it.

86
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:45,126
I think this business
is your first step down that path.

87
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,753
So I'm supporting you.

88
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,341
I've never heard

89
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,886
such unencouraging words
of support in my life.

90
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,221
Right?

91
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,892
There's so much weight on my shoulders,
I may collapse.

92
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,936
Really? We can't have that.

93
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,187
Come here.

94
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,023
-Stop.
-Come here. Put that down.

95
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,275
-What are you doing? I'm cooking.
-No, wait.

96
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,619
-My goodness!
-Heavens!

97
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,914
Why did you give it to me?

98
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,094
How can you laugh?

99
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,555
I'd be wailing at the top of my lungs.

100
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,724
-Excuse me?
-I don't know what Ms. Heo said,

101
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,311
but my status at the club is in shambles.

102
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,022
I used to sit next to the chairman,

103
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,024
but now I'm at the very end.

104
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,152
If I want to talk to the chairman,

105
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,739
I scream as loud as I can
and go, "Chairman!"

106
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,451
I told you I understand.

107
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:05,164
I still don't trust you.
Maybe it's because of that absurd perm.

108
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,377
In any case,

109
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,922
don't you dare even glance
at any of that weird stuff.

110
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:18,511
There are plenty of classy hobbies
that you can take up.

111
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,847
Like flower arranging.

112
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,516
Geez.

113
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,483
You know where it is? Submit it.

114
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,736
Man, it's so funny.

115
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,907
What's with this blazer?

116
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,577
Did you copy Detective Kim?

117
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,704
What are you talking about?

118
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,500
It was at the bottom of my closet.

119
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,627
I see.

120
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,547
Next time, let it stay in there.

121
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,174
Don't buy something
that would make you a laughingstock.

122
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,385
Where are you going?

123
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,638
I got a robbery report
from Geumje Supermarket. Bye.

124
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,187
It seemed like it was just a petty thief.

125
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,773
Why would he do as much as take a camera?

126
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,858
I know what you mean.

127
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,611
I went on patrol with him once.

128
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,281
He didn't seem to investigate too closely,

129
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,285
and he kept taking photos
to "understand the neighborhood better."

130
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,374
I think he…

131
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,168
Think he what?

132
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,088
Got into the police academy
through connections.

133
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,549
He seems so inept and unskilled.

134
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,426
That's rich coming from you.

135
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,554
You've shown your lack of skill
in more than a few cases.

136
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,681
-Geez.
-Always trash-talking about others.

137
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,641
Wait a minute.

138
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,354
Aren't you the one
who got into the force using connections?

139
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,900
Geez, if I had any connection like that,

140
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,361
I would've gotten you fired first.

141
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,446
What did you say?

142
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,283
It's okay, keep talking.
Sounds like you have a lot to say.

143
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,076
I'm all ears.

144
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,912
-No, I…
-When will I be fired?

145
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,288
I didn't mean that.

146
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,458
GEUMJE SUPERMARKET

147
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,766
I have to sell these at a time like this?

148
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,607
How can you handle your hope recklessly?

149
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,154
You said it was your last hope,

150
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,074
so I thought you'd keep it more dearly.

151
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,743
I don't know…

152
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,413
if hope even exists.

153
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,545
She reeks of alcohol.

154
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,798
How much more did you drink last night?

155
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,262
I had two bottles,
then another bottle and a half.

156
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,765
How did you know?

157
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,476
It's dangerous to walk around drunk.

158
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,728
You almost got hurt yesterday.

159
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,564
What?

160
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,983
Geez, are you all right?

161
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,193
But the pain still feels too fresh.

162
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,529
It still hurts.

163
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,202
I'm so sorry about last night.

164
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,204
Take care.

165
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,756
Oh, my. You're the handsome young man.

166
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,217
I'm here about the robbery.

167
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,594
I'm Detective Kim Do-hyeon.

168
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,095
You're a detective?

169
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,390
This one's pink.

170
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,933
It's feminine,

171
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,770
and there's spandex in the blend,
so it's tight but soft.

172
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,647
And here,

173
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,526
we have the same design
in a different color.

174
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,530
I wanted some bras
to lift these saggy things.

175
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,823
What's all this?

176
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,492
I know.
It's not like we're newlywed wives.

177
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,747
We're too old for these.

178
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,415
All the more reason you need them.

179
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:21,003
You've all been married
for over 20 years, right?

180
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,880
Of course.

181
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,131
Really?

182
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,467
Then here's a question for you.

183
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,721
Who's the prettiest woman
in the world to your husband?

184
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,849
-Who is it?
-It's not me, that's for sure.

185
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,142
Ding, ding, ding!

186
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,645
It's any woman who's not his wife.

187
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,942
Every woman they aren't married to
looks pretty to men.

188
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,401
You're so right.

189
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:50,282
The longer you live together,
the less you'll be seen as a woman.

190
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,742
-Right.
-True.

191
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,285
And before you know it,

192
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,205
he'll start having an affair.

193
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,458
-All men are the same.
-That's right.

194
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,542
So,

195
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,962
what if you turn into a woman

196
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,506
who's completely different
from the regular you?

197
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:10,344
And I have a red slip
that would be perfect for that moment.

198
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,263
It's the highlight of today. Jeong-suk?

199
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,604
Jeong-suk?

200
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,318
Jeong-suk? The red slip.

201
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,486
Right.

202
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,447
Here.

203
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,325
Is something going on with you?

204
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,370
You look so grim, and you've been sighing.

205
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,957
No, it's nothing.

206
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,542
Please have a look.

207
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,751
Everything's fine.

208
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,713
Look at this red slip.

209
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,923
Would you wear this normally?

210
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,094
-You think I'd wear this?
-Look at that!

211
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,723
BATHHOUSE

212
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,391
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

213
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,351
It's not your fault at all.

214
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,270
They were never going to buy.

215
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,066
Seriously, is there something wrong?

216
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,486
You do look pretty down.

217
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,074
No, I'm really fine.

218
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,453
-Really?
-Yes.

219
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,787
Okay.

220
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,416
At this rate, we'll keep treading water.

221
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,171
You did sell some stuff the last time,
but it's because they were your friends.

222
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,718
We need to come up with
a way to make money.

223
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,762
Is there any silver bullet?

224
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,057
I don't know.

225
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,060
We just started, so if we just…

226
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,689
If we keep working hard,
we'll be successful one day.

227
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,484
Sure. We'll keep trying.

228
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,568
Let's go.

229
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,597
Hey, Min-ho.

230
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,765
Hi, Mom.

231
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,393
-Did you have a good day at school?
-Yes.

232
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,481
Today, my teacher said
I have good handwriting.

233
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,899
I'll show you.

234
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,862
Jeong-suk, are you home?

235
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,533
She's looking for you.

236
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,368
Well…

237
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:48,293
Min-ho, we're playing hide-and-seek
with the landlord, okay?

238
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,004
It's her turn to find us,
so don't get caught! Hush!

239
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,929
I thought I heard her
coming up the stairs earlier.

240
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,652
You didn't find us,
so it's your turn again!

241
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,157
So you are home! Jeong-suk!

242
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,460
Why didn't you open the door
when you were home all along?

243
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,838
Min-ho said it was my turn or something.

244
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,465
Did you tell him
we're playing hide-and-seek?

245
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,217
Well…

246
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,929
You have to teach him to be upright
even if you're not well-off.

247
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,015
You shouldn't lie in front of him.

248
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,142
Now, be honest with me.

249
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,977
When can you pay the rent?

250
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,980
Right now.

251
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,794
This should go to the company.

252
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,510
Look. Mommy has lots of money.

253
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,970
Don't worry, okay?

254
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,041
Yes, Min-ho.

255
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,795
Mom, you can have this.

256
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,713
What?

257
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,051
I was saving up to buy a robot,

258
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,263
but I don't think I need it anymore.

259
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,474
I'm giving it to you. Open it.

260
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,666
I'm in first grade,
so I should've outgrown robots anyway.

261
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,055
Mommy shouldn't be like this right now.

262
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,267
What was I thinking?

263
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,450
HAIR DYE

264
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,373
Ju-ri.

265
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,918
Jeong-suk. What's up?

266
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,879
You want to do your hair?

267
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,505
It's not that.

268
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,758
I came to ask you something.

269
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,134
About what?

270
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,304
Have a seat.

271
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,898
Actually,

272
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,276
I need somewhere to sell my products.

273
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,947
If any of your clients are interested,
could you put in a word for me?

274
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,700
You want an introduction.

275
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,243
If it's too much pressure--

276
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,538
No, not at all.
Talking to people isn't a big deal.

277
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,125
-We're here!
-Ju-ri.

278
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,794
-Welcome.
-Hello.

279
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,171
Hey!

280
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,424
Didn't we have so much fun that day
thanks to Jeong-suk?

281
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,802
Well, I don't know.

282
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,888
She's looking for a place
where she can sell her products.

283
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,515
What about your houses?

284
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,350
No way!

285
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,312
Word got out about it, and we were both
in deep water with our husbands.

286
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,396
That's right.

287
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,276
Neither of us are interested
in that kind of lewd stuff anyway.

288
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,694
That's true.

289
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,530
I thought you were very interested.

290
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,572
-What?
-What?

291
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:32,327
When you flip through magazines here,
you devour anything related to sex.

292
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,206
"101 Positions That Will Make
Even Casanova Look Like a Prude."

293
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,375
"Sex Tips So Hot
They'll Lower Your Heat Bill!"

294
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,295
-What's she saying?
-Those pages are so worn after you leave.

295
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,048
What are you talking about?

296
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,092
You're confusing us with other women.

297
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,218
Right!

298
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,679
I usually read about

299
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,596
cooking!

300
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,889
And what else?

301
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,890
Education!

302
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,642
That's all I read about.

303
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,519
This is ridiculous.

304
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,856
I'm not doing my hair today.

305
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,774
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

306
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,193
-Wait for me.
-Take care.

307
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,823
They're too old to act coy like that.

308
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,907
Jeong-suk.

309
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,619
Don't let that get to you. Keep at it.

310
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,496
I know your business will take off.

311
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,791
-Will it?
-Yes!

312
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,459
I'd love to do it myself.

313
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,920
I need to make a lot more money
than other people

314
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,090
since I'm the breadwinner
without a husband.

315
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,303
-It's the same for me.
-What?

316
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,889
I mean,

317
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,018
I also want to make a lot of money.

318
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,813
Ju-ri, if you want to, you should do it.

319
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,440
I'll introduce you to the company.

320
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,651
I would love to,
but I have no time to prepare.

321
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,445
Prepare?

322
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,406
This is a business,
so there must be a lot to prepare.

323
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:57,954
Even today, I have to test
all the new hair dyes you see there.

324
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,332
All of them?

325
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,458
Yes.

326
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,294
I have to know my products
to sell them to customers.

327
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:08,632
To succeed, I'd have to study
and try out the lingerie and the toys.

328
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,675
I wouldn't have time for that. Right?

329
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,220
I see.

330
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,932
I guess so.

331
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,777
Hello?

332
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,362
Jeong-suk.

333
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,950
What? You can't come?

334
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,371
I figured you'd be busy.

335
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,457
It's all right.

336
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,756
I've arranged these going clockwise.

337
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,261
Next, we go like this.

338
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,472
Add the baby's breath in the empty spot.

339
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,765
This is so boring.

340
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,935
I'm bored out of my mind.

341
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,857
Jeong-suk's business must be doing well.

342
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,862
This one is the stretchiest.

343
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,239
Stretchy.

344
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,284
I finished researching the slips!

345
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,202
What's next, Jeong-suk?

346
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,163
Yeah, it's this.

347
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,253
NIPPLE, PENIS, INSERTION, GLANS

348
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,629
I found everything.

349
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,464
Gosh.

350
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,466
This is "nipple."

351
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,427
This is a man's "penis."

352
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,636
This is "penis."

353
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,555
-This is "insertion."
-"Insertion."

354
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,765
This is "glans."

355
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,519
-What is this one again?
-Glans.

356
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,313
-"Glans."
-Glans.

357
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,565
-Glans.
-Yes.

358
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,532
Oh, my.

359
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,412
Look at us, two women shouting "glans"
in broad daylight.

360
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,331
How ridiculous.

361
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,501
Are we all set here?

362
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,795
Yes, we're nearly done.

363
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,673
I'm having trouble
translating this sentence though.

364
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,300
Let me see.

365
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,975
Wait, there's no way
I'd know what this means.

366
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,396
You went to high school, but I didn't.
So if you don't know, I don't either.

367
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,398
What should we do?

368
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,319
Is there anyone who knows English?

369
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,157
I thought of someone!

370
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,659
The last sentence says this.

371
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,800
"This powerful magic stick

372
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,593
can stimulate the female"…

373
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,098
"It can stimulate that area,
leading you to a fantastic world."

374
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,641
-Amazing.
-Wow.

375
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,142
Wow.

376
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,560
You're so impressive.

377
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,271
Who knew my English degree
would be used like this?

378
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,940
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

379
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,234
-By the way…
-Yes.

380
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,486
Is it really like this?

381
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,780
Pardon?

382
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:23,326
Does it really feel
like you're entering a fantastic world?

383
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,955
As for that…

384
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,500
I'll let you know tomorrow.

385
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:35,338
That's the last bit
of research we have to do.

386
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,383
We've decided to study that on our own.

387
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,136
Self-study?

388
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,222
I see.

389
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,741
DAEJEON EXPO 93
CELEBRATION LOCALE

390
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:49,370
Look at those amazing fireworks!

391
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,208
My mom is so not amazing.

392
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:59,380
Seriously, how can I eat
green onion the size of my thumb?

393
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,551
Green onions help the immune system,
so they're good for preventing colds.

394
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,761
Says who?

395
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,138
The January issue of Woman Donga.

396
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,682
I told you not to read salon magazines.

397
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,104
Hello?

398
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,318
I'm busy right now. I'll call you later.

399
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,073
What is it, Mom?

400
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,784
Your boyfriend wants to see you?

401
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,578
No. I'll be with you today, my Dong-u.

402
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,955
Just go see him.

403
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,498
Overly focusing on a child

404
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:38,545
can cause a parent to develop
an unhealthy obsession with the child.

405
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,712
Says who?

406
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,091
A special report
in the February issue of Woman Joongang.

407
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,926
Stop reading those magazines already.

408
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,428
They're not appropriate
for children your age.

409
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,346
Why?

410
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:52,058
You said whatever it is,
it's good to be ahead of my age.

411
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,479
You always need to have the last word.

412
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,276
Let's taste this broth first.

413
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,196
It's especially refreshing today.

414
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,949
-What did they put in this today?
-It's so refreshing.

415
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,370
Detective Kim, you're not having any stew.

416
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,997
You're only eating rice.

417
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,206
Really?

418
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,250
You said you'd like kimchi stew earlier.

419
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,919
I don't feel like it now. Go ahead.

420
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,005
You don't feel like it? How absurd.

421
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,172
You little…

422
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,218
Are you learning the ropes okay?

423
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,304
What's there to learn?

424
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,557
We know the people
who cause trouble in this town.

425
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,602
Kim Du-seok,
Baek Seung-tak, Kwon Seong-su.

426
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,812
Who's Kwon Seong-su?

427
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,898
You know who he is.

428
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:44,611
The husband of Han Jeong-suk,
who sells adult toys.

429
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,071
When he was young,

430
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,658
he got into so many fights
that he was practically a regular here.

431
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,786
Even after he got married,
he'd throw punches

432
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,955
at anyone who set him off.

433
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,292
Recently, he beat up
the CEO of Geumje Gochujang

434
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,502
to a pulp.

435
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:06,090
How did that woman
end up with a guy like that?

436
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:10,011
She was famous for winning
Ms. Chili Pepper and for being smart.

437
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,512
What a mystery.

438
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,224
Didn't you see her
when you responded to that call?

439
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,101
What do you think?

440
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,147
I don't know.
Maybe they're birds of a feather.

441
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,608
It's not really fair to say that.

442
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:28,321
She cleans up all of her husband's messes.

443
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:33,159
She works a ton of side jobs
and even worked as a housekeeper.

444
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:38,706
You think she's selling adult toys
for a grand reason?

445
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,667
It's probably just to make ends meet.

446
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,670
Even so, that was going too far.

447
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,672
It's you who's going too far!

448
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,508
Stop taking all the meat!

449
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,219
I didn't even eat that much!

450
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,762
You did take a lot!

451
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,985
JACKPOT REAL ESTATE

452
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,987
Come on in.

453
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,655
I'm looking for a house.

454
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,865
Sure. Take a seat.

455
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,450
HEO YEONG-JA

456
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,576
All right.

457
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,378
I haven't seen you before.

458
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,550
I heard the gochujang factory was hiring.

459
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,802
-Do you work there?
-No. I'm a police officer.

460
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,804
The police.

461
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,809
A few days ago, did you respond
to a call about some women?

462
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,564
I was hoping to learn more
about what happened to them.

463
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:48,776
Why are you letting them roam free?
They should be in cuffs.

464
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,445
I just don't understand.

465
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,280
Did you report them?

466
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,993
Of course not! I just heard rumors.

467
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,995
Why would I report them?

468
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,039
If you do that in a small town--

469
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,540
Any homes I can see now?

470
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,085
Of course.

471
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,920
What's your budget?

472
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,257
I'd like to rent a place
for 500,000 won a month.

473
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,385
I see. Five hundred thousand won?

474
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,554
I want a quiet area

475
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,849
with a storage or basement.

476
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,937
You're quite greedy, aren't you?

477
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,899
Is 500,000 won too little for what I want?

478
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,150
I'm not an expert.

479
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,027
I see.

480
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,156
You want to pay 500,000 won for rent
and not for the key deposit?

481
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,491
Yes.

482
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,700
Right here.

483
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,496
-The area's okay, right?
-Yes.

484
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,623
Let's go in.

485
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,837
This grass is well-cared for.

486
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,924
Isn't this amazing for that amount?

487
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,425
You won't find a better deal.

488
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,676
Look at the story height.

489
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,972
It's very well-lit,
and the sunset goes all the way in.

490
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,101
That's right. Did you want a basement?

491
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,393
The basement's there.

492
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,021
Follow me.
The second-floor balcony is stunning.

493
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,106
Come follow me.

494
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,608
The balcony is incredible.

495
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,490
The back area is amazing.

496
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,076
That's a persimmon tree.
The tall one is chestnut.

497
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,619
It's just amazing.

498
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,372
Look at the river view.
Isn't it amazing? How lovely.

499
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,415
If it were me,

500
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,169
I'd get a place in town center
with that budget.

501
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,256
It's close to the police station
and has more stores.

502
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,843
Isn't this too secluded?

503
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,678
No, I love it.

504
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,973
I wanted to observe.

505
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,558
Observe?

506
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,643
Observe what?

507
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,442
You're quick to make your decision.

508
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,737
What about the furniture?
I know a place that's good and cheap.

509
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,656
I can get you a discount.

510
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,949
You don't have to do that.

511
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,659
I don't know how long I'll stay.

512
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,411
What do you mean?

513
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,663
Whose life is that flighty?

514
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:09,125
You might as well stay a few years
since you're just here.

515
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,420
What is it?

516
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,465
She still hasn't come to her senses.

517
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:26,726
I don't know if you've heard,
but the rumors say

518
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:32,231
she got into a huge fight with her husband
for selling terribly lewd adult products.

519
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,067
Her husband left her right after.

520
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,612
It's no surprise.

521
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,781
What kind of man would tolerate that?

522
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,035
I totally understand his feelings.

523
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,037
You do too, right?

524
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,330
Well, I'm not sure.

525
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,499
Whatever then.

526
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,251
Geez.

527
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,181
Well…

528
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,935
We can discuss the other products later.

529
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,061
Did you try it?

530
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,480
I didn't get to since we share rooms.

531
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,525
How was it?

532
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,528
Did it bring you to a fantastic world?

533
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,784
Quick, tell us.

534
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,247
Yes, for a moment.

535
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,040
For a moment?

536
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,292
Come closer.

537
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,130
-Wow.
-Wow.

538
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,215
Yes.

539
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,512
Ms. Kim was right.

540
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,514
Some women may never have used it,

541
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,767
but there's no going back
once you've tried it.

542
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,810
Wow.

543
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,812
I'm confident about this business now.

544
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,481
Me too. I believe it can succeed.

545
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:59,235
Yesterday, my kids were at my neighbor's,

546
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,155
so I was trying on the red slip
that looks like an onion net.

547
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,199
-My husband walked in.
-So, what happened?

548
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,284
Well…

549
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,454
I thought I was turning into a real onion.

550
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,206
He took off my clothes right away.

551
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,624
Every single layer.

552
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,625
Oh, my gosh.

553
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,877
Here, have some water.

554
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,337
All of it.

555
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,050
Your reviews are more scandalous
than I expected.

556
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,975
While we're on that…

557
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,689
I know this is so shameless of me.

558
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,193
But could we use your house one more time?

559
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,320
That would be great.

560
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,950
It would be so nice.

561
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,667
Congratulations!

562
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,336
Thank you so much!

563
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,089
If the customers are
a bit more honest this time,

564
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,799
I think we'll have a chance.

565
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,968
I think so too.

566
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,803
You're the best.

567
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,305
-Seriously.
-Thank you.

568
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,974
-You're so kind.
-Thank you.

569
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,642
-Let's kiss since no one's around.
-Well…

570
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,020
Hold your horses. We're almost there.

571
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:20,107
Don't make me cry

572
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,402
I don't want to be

573
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,989
Remembered as a sad song

574
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,242
Stay by my side

575
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,915
ALWAYS KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS

576
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,297
I hate it.

577
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,842
I'm sorry. I was too loud, right?

578
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,178
No, not you. It's me.

579
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,559
I'm hopeless, and I hate myself for that.

580
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,438
-What?
-Well,

581
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,818
is Ms. Heo in a good mood today?

582
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,486
-My mom?
-Yes.

583
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:10,449
Well, she seemed fine.

584
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,246
I don't think she's fine.

585
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,457
Did she say anything about my family?

586
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,377
That's--

587
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,255
I knew it! There is something.

588
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,092
Don't leave anything out and tell me.

589
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,889
But it'd be too harsh
if I told you everything.

590
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,226
It's totally fine.

591
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:41,272
How else will I understand
exactly how she feels?

592
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,648
I'll be fine.

593
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,444
So tell me everything she said,
word for word.

594
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,198
She said…

595
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,495
"I let these **** lowlives in
because they begged me,

596
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,247
but they don't know their **** place.

597
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,084
If I lease that **** building to them,
call me a ****, not Heo Yeong-ja!"

598
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,134
That's what she said.

599
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,178
Are you all right?

600
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,763
Dae-geun.

601
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,475
Is your mother at the office now?

602
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,522
Mom, see you later.

603
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:28,986
Okay. Why does she keep
calling you at night lately?

604
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:34,158
I'm sure she has her reasons.

605
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,286
-Watch out for cars.
-Okay.

606
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,498
-Go on then. I'm leaving.
-Yeah.

607
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,139
What are you doing there?

608
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,059
I'm just dusting them off.

609
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,728
You need something?

610
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,648
I'm making doenjang stew
but can't find anchovies.

611
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,484
They're under the rice container.

612
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,027
So that's where they were.

613
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,255
Ju-ri.

614
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,839
Hello.

615
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,677
Jeong-suk,
what brings you by at this hour?

616
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,805
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

617
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,765
Hold on. Let me wash my hands.

618
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,183
Okay.

619
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,562
Leave it for 30 minutes.

620
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:51,277
-Next, prepare the hot water to brew tea.
-Hi.

621
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:57,992
Once it falls between 70 and 80 degrees,
pour the water out of the kettle

622
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,952
into the teacup.

623
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,495
-To enjoy tea…
-What are you listening to?

624
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,622
It's a tea ceremony program.

625
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,459
When I listen to this, I feel classier.

626
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,462
Even if I'm just drinking hot chocolate.

627
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,047
When pouring,

628
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,801
only pour 20 percent of the tea at first.

629
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,888
Second, pour the tea into the cup.

630
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,560
When you drink tea,
hold the cup with your right hand…

631
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,270
-Go in.
-Okay.

632
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,814
-Welcome.
-Hello.

633
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,316
-Come on in.
-Yes.

634
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,609
Come on in.

635
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,447
Should we go to the living room?

636
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,909
Today, we're doing it in a different room.

637
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,036
A different room?

638
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,497
I see.

639
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,629
Gosh.

640
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,639
Here.

641
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,934
What's with the drinks?

642
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,229
This is alcohol
infused with ten-year-old ginseng

643
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,857
that my husband made.

644
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,360
It's great for the skin.

645
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,780
I'm offering it
as you're valued customers.

646
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,866
-If you'd like more, go ahead.
-Well…

647
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,078
Ginseng that's ten years old
is basically wild ginseng.

648
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,245
-I see.
-Really.

649
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,790
This must be very expensive.

650
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,960
Should we just have one glass?

651
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,045
-Sure.
-Yes.

652
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,963
Just a sip.

653
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,425
Thank you.

654
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,261
That's good.

655
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,640
It's basically medicine.

656
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,279
As we told you when you came in,

657
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,032
please enjoy yourselves today.

658
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,867
There's no pressure to buy.

659
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:08,038
We can really just look?

660
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,206
Of course.

661
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,418
First…

662
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,088
have a look at this slip.

663
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:23,595
This is a slip for sleeping,
giving you a beautiful, comfortable sleep.

664
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,890
The softly cascading silk

665
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:32,563
feels like the water of a gentle pond
lapping gently at you.

666
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,482
What does gentle lapping feel like?

667
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,609
Do you know?

668
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:43,574
I haven't been to a pond in ages,
so I don't know.

669
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,163
That's why I'll show you

670
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,083
exactly how that feels.

671
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,589
-What?
-What is it?

672
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,258
-What's she doing?
-It's behind?

673
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,694
-My heavens.
-My goodness.

674
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,238
Gosh. What are they doing?

675
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,953
-Geez.
-Oh, my goodness.

676
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,330
Oh, my.

677
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,583
-That's embarrassing.
-How crazy.

678
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:40,631
This really is pretty.

679
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,092
Her figure's similar to mine.

680
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,803
Should I get one of those?

681
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,804
How is it similar?

682
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,349
You both have
two arms and two legs, but the rest?

683
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,850
What do you mean?

684
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,561
I just have a bit more fat
because I'm older.

685
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,980
Other than that, it's the same.

686
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,149
-Let's just say she's right.
-Sure.

687
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,901
This is pretty.

688
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,820
You should get this one.

689
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,197
No, I like that one.

690
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,741
No. I've tried that one on.

691
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,493
You and I can't breathe in that.

692
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,954
This one's perfect.

693
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,289
Don't faint from lack of oxygen too early.

694
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,375
Just get this one.

695
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,584
Should I?

696
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,838
Gosh, it's so smooth.

697
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,007
I want to keep touching it.

698
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,092
Exactly!

699
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,095
If your husband sees you in this,

700
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,848
you won't get any sleep that night.

701
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,141
I'll bet my wrist on it.

702
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,852
You're being ridiculous!

703
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,313
How much did you say it was?

704
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,733
-What?
-You're buying?

705
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,903
I'll splurge. Why not?

706
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,703
So this is that infamous machine.

707
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,123
Whatchamacallit?

708
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,251
It's actually called a "vibrator."

709
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,754
I gave you one each
so you can see how it feels.

710
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,425
Now, everyone,

711
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:11,680
pick up the vibrator with your right hand.

712
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:16,435
You told me to grab it, so I am.
There you go.

713
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,437
-Goodness.
-It's smooth.

714
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,275
-Gosh!
-What's this?

715
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,819
See? This is what it does.

716
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,946
-It shocked me last time.
-My goodness.

717
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,116
-This is what it does.
-It's doing the same thing today.

718
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,994
That's so weird.

719
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,413
Do you all know who Cleopatra is?

720
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:40,917
Of course, I do.
The Egyptian queen with the bob.

721
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,254
That's right.
She was the queen of ancient Egypt.

722
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,798
Why are you randomly bringing her up?

723
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:50,844
Is she related
to this embarrassing thing somehow?

724
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,220
She is.

725
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:57,225
Cleopatra took papyrus
and rolled it up into a tube.

726
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,978
She put bees
inside the tube to make it vibrate.

727
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:04,149
She used the vibration
from bees buzzing in the tube.

728
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,152
Why is she being so serious?

729
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:12,991
When you say "used," are you saying
this "Cleopatty" lady used it to…

730
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,951
Yes.

731
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,206
It's an amazing world we live in.

732
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,833
We don't need to use bees for that.

733
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,046
-She's right.
-That's very true.

734
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:29,800
-Gosh.
-Well…

735
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,426
I'll pass.

736
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:36,098
With 20,000 won,
I'd rather feed my husband a ton of eel.

737
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,141
Maybe I shouldn't say this,

738
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:42,312
but your husband is so rail thin

739
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,566
that I don't think eel will make
much of a difference.

740
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,403
You're wrong.

741
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,155
Thinner logs burn longer.

742
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,533
Really?

743
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:59,705
When my husband was alive,
he had days when he was on fire.

744
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:05,085
Those days, he'd fold me
like a paper crane while doing it.

745
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,003
And?

746
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:08,588
That night,

747
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:14,219
I became a crane soaring into the sky.

748
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,014
How poetic.

749
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,558
You could be a poet.

750
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:25,897
I wish I could be folded up
so I could soar too.

751
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,482
He can't fold you.

752
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,861
I've bought so much
expensive beef bone broth for my man,

753
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,654
so 20,000 won is nothing.

754
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,782
-I would happily spend 200,000 won.
-Don't get greedy, ladies.

755
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,952
Should I just get one now?

756
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,829
I think it'll be better than bone broth.

757
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,498
-Just do it.
-Should I?

758
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,626
-It's cheaper than beef bones.
-It really is.

759
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,880
Anyone who wants to buy

760
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,133
can quietly raise their right hand,

761
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,136
and I will assist you with the purchase.

762
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,440
We sold almost everything, right?

763
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,691
Yes.

764
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,819
We'll have money left over
after paying the company back.

765
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,238
Congratulations, Jeong-suk.

766
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,448
Congratulations.

767
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,035
It's all thanks to your help.

768
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,787
You even modeled for us.

769
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,663
And you provided the alcohol.

770
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,043
The biggest hit was you, Jeong-suk.

771
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:32,964
Your explanation was elegant and classy.

772
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,218
That's right.
If I listened with my eyes closed,

773
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,762
I'd think I was buying
a tea set, not adult toys.

774
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,515
That's the perfect way to put it.

775
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,350
You did a great job, Jeong-suk.

776
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,603
I feel like we should party to celebrate.

777
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,522
Shall we go out for a drink too?

778
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,275
Sounds good. There's a new pub in town.

779
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,652
Should we go there?

780
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,736
It's a go!

781
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,740
It's your treat, right?

782
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,786
What?

783
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,705
Oh, yes, of course I'll…

784
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,958
Yes, I…

785
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,212
She was talking like a newscaster earlier,

786
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,464
but she's stuttering
now that we asked her to pay.

787
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,884
-It's my treat.
-What?

788
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,053
I want to.

789
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,807
You're second to none!

790
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,978
I just can't get used to
you buttering me up with your words.

791
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,188
What is it?

792
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,066
-Let's go, darling.
-My goodness.

793
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,985
-Let's go, darling!
-Let's go.

794
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,612
Goodness.

795
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,658
What's going on?

796
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,328
Hello?

797
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,496
Honey!

798
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,791
Get into a nice outfit
and come to Mokhwa Restaurant.

799
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,628
What? This is so sudden.

800
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,631
I arranged for you
to apologize to Chairman Eom's wife.

801
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,425
Come quickly and appease her.

802
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,678
Why should I?

803
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,972
I don't want to go.

804
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,432
Are you kidding me?

805
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:10,353
They didn't want to come,
but I begged them to make it happen.

806
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,522
We don't have the time for this. Come!

807
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,489
I don't think Geum-hui can make it.

808
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,327
No, I'm coming with you.

809
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,495
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

810
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,922
Tastes good, doesn't it?

811
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,513
I've made up my mind.

812
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,223
-What?
-About what?

813
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,559
I want to take up this work.

814
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,021
Really? Goodness me!

815
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,817
Since I got married
and came to this town with my husband,

816
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,279
I've never had this much fun.

817
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,239
After today,

818
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,242
I can't go back to how things were.

819
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,119
I do wonder

820
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,206
if it's okay that I'm so much older.

821
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:15,335
Can I join your business?

822
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,090
No.

823
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,303
You don't need my permission.

824
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,973
If you want to do this business,
then you can do it.

825
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,308
True.

826
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,769
So while I'm in no place to "allow" you…

827
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,690
I'm so thankful to you.

828
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,401
You'll be a great help to us.

829
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,319
She's right.

830
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,406
No one could be
more helpful to us than you.

831
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,326
I'd love your guidance.

832
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,828
Sure thing.

833
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:54,791
Let's congratulate the newest recruit
with a toast!

834
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,376
Can I drink soju, Geum-hui?

835
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,919
-Yes, order it!
-Soju!

836
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,088
Three bottles of soju here!

837
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,549
To be honest,

838
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:07,554
I don't really need adult toys.

839
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:13,727
Even without them, my husband
won't let me sleep at all every night.

840
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,230
We only stopped at four kids
because we ran out of space.

841
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,524
Otherwise, I'd be pregnant right now.

842
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,195
Yeong-bok, are you bragging?

843
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,739
I'm not bragging.

844
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,993
Having a good sex life
while you're poor is a curse.

845
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,829
If you have no money,
no connections, no house,

846
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:36,416
but a great sex life, what is the point?

847
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,251
At least you have a husband.

848
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,086
I only have a kid, no husband.

849
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,964
I did have a boyfriend,

850
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,466
but we broke up.

851
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,384
-Oh, no.
-What happened?

852
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,928
He was boring.

853
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,055
I hate being bored.

854
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:55,477
I won't need the slip for a while.
It's so pretty though.

855
00:55:57,353 --> 00:56:00,190
Ms. Oh, how was the slip you bought?

856
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,608
I never got to wear it.

857
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,319
Why not?

858
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:08,490
My husband is so conservative,
he'd faint from shock if he saw me in it.

859
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:15,038
So none of us can buy the slip
and put it to use, am I right?

860
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,790
You're right!

861
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,083
That's not true!

862
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,210
Jeong-suk is so pretty,

863
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:24,214
I bet her husband
would love seeing her in one.

864
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,965
She's pretty, so she doesn't need it.

865
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,009
-I see.
-Just seeing her is enough.

866
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,059
Oh, goodness.

867
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,894
It's not the case for me.

868
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,647
Jeong-suk! Honey, Jeong-suk is there.

869
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,856
Yes, I see her.

870
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,572
What a ridiculous situation.

871
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,782
I'm sorry.

872
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,409
I'm sorry.

873
00:56:53,993 --> 00:57:00,208
You're the one who begged us
to make time so she can apologize.

874
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,628
I don't even see a glimpse of her.

875
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,005
This is just ridiculous.

876
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,967
I'm so sorry. It's out of her character.

877
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,262
She's normally a very punctual person.

878
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,222
I think something may have happened.

879
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,932
That's enough.

880
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,435
I'm sure something came up.

881
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,941
Who could be busier than you in Geumje?

882
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,527
That must be it.

883
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,320
I've figured it out.

884
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,906
Geum-hui had no intention

885
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,868
of apologizing to me from the start.

886
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,872
No, that's not true.

887
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,916
Sir, please calm yourselves.

888
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,960
Please do sit.

889
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,462
Please sit.

890
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:51,050
I tried calling home,
but no one picked up.

891
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,677
I'm sure she's on her way.

892
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,263
Instead of waiting,

893
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,683
let's go ahead and order.

894
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:02,729
I'll treat you to the works today.

895
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:32,133
I debated whether to call or come see you.

896
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,553
But I couldn't.

897
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,680
I couldn't face you.

898
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,560
But now you can?

899
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:47,148
It was just that one time with Seong-su.

900
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,575
I'm sorry, Jeong-suk.

901
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:02,080
Since that day, I've been scared

902
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,165
that In-tae might find out.

903
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:08,419
That's when I realized
just how much I love In-tae.

904
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,217
I see.

905
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:18,012
You had to sleep with my husband
to realize who you love.

906
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:24,227
Do you want me to congratulate you?

907
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,982
Are you going to tell In-tae?

908
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,776
No.

909
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,280
Not for your sake, but In-tae's.

910
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,908
Because In-tae's my friend.

911
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:00,972
What?

912
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,142
What the…

913
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,643
Fucking bitch!

914
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,899
I mean…

915
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,903
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

916
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,448
Me neither.

917
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,912
I heard your husband hasn't been home.

918
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,081
Did he leave home after sleeping with her?

919
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,503
Goodness gracious me. That's crazy.

920
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,466
I had no idea that happened.

921
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,679
I can't just let this slide.

922
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,723
Me neither!

923
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,892
-Me neither.
-What?

924
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,822
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

925
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,533
Wait.

926
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,851
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

927
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:14,856
What is this?

928
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:16,816
What the heck?

929
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,533
What the hell is this?

930
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:26,784
It's cold!

931
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,510
-Come!
-Run!

932
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,721
Darling, your shoe!

933
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,514
Get it quickly!

934
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,937
-Quick, run away!
-Let's go!

935
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,399
-Geum-hui, hurry up!
-Quick!

936
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,193
Quick, run!

937
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,948
-Geum-hui!
-Hurry up!

938
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:24,443
Well, still got it.

939
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,367
Oh, no!

940
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,432
Were you at home?

941
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,475
Sitting pretty?

942
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,520
So what?

943
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,231
You really didn't come on purpose?

944
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:06,027
So, why did you arrange that
without talking to me first--

945
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,487
So? Just because we didn't talk first,

946
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,741
you humiliate me like this?

947
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,371
I'm sorry, but--

948
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,081
Have you been drinking?

949
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,044
Yes.

950
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:24,921
I drank.

951
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,716
With whom?

952
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,302
With those women?

953
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,262
Yes, that's right.

954
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,390
I'm going to join their business.

955
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,975
Their business?

956
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,937
You mean, selling adult toys?

957
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,899
Seriously, what's gotten into you?

958
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,318
This is not the kind of woman you are!

959
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,156
What kind of woman am I?

960
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,200
What?

961
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,243
Tell me what kind of woman I am.

962
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:03,292
A woman who sits at home all day,
whose biggest concern

963
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,379
is whether to make radish soup
or cheonggukjang?

964
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,923
Am I the woman who's understanding

965
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,842
of her busy husband,
even if the dinner she put in

966
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,596
so much effort to make goes cold
because he was out drinking,

967
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,849
so she finds happiness
in making him hangover soup?

968
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,061
-Honey.
-Or am I

969
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,647
a woman so ignorant of the world,

970
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,567
that gets used
by women selling adult toys?

971
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,153
Like a peabrain?

972
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,030
-No--
-No.

973
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,407
I'm not!

974
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,800
I know exactly what this work entails.

975
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,678
You know what?

976
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,473
I'm having so much fun lately.

977
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,144
My life used to be
the most boring one on earth.

978
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,188
I didn't even know that until recently.

979
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,405
Are you listening to me?

980
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:22,913
Shut that mouth.
You look like a dead fish.

981
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,585
No matter how much contempt
you look at me with,

982
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,754
I'm not giving in this…

983
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,634
-Quick, run away!
-Let's go!

984
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,889
-Let's go!
-Quick, run!

985
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,327
Come eat, honey!

986
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,004
Is this it?

987
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,590
Yes.

988
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,055
I mean, other people…

989
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:08,644
The morning after doing it,
they cook their husbands a hearty feast.

990
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:10,896
That's proof

991
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,275
that the night was unsatisfying.

992
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,484
What?

993
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,446
The wife is feeding her husband
so he can do better next time.

994
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,032
What about me then?

995
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,077
I think you've done well enough.

996
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,581
If you get better, it'd be too much.

997
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,378
Great!

998
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:39,175
If that's the case,
keep the meals simple going forward.

999
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:43,304
If there's too much on the table,
you won't get a wink of sleep.

1000
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:56,275
Oh, right.

1001
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,988
Are you really getting into that business?

1002
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,534
Do you really have fun with those women?

1003
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,455
There's definitely a fun aspect to it,

1004
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,209
but I also believe in its potential.

1005
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,044
-You do?
-Yes.

1006
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,670
Just look at us last night.

1007
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:20,174
Although you are naturally gifted,

1008
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,511
it was the slip that got you fired up.

1009
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,889
My goodness.

1010
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:31,393
Geez, I don't know what to do about this.

1011
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,731
Just don't say no.

1012
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,983
I'll take care of the rest.

1013
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:43,989
Here.

1014
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,249
My cucumber will stay rock solid.

1015
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,043
Time to go! Min-ho, let's go.

1016
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:58,462
Let's go. Here.

1017
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,298
-Watch out for cars.
-Yes.

1018
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,842
Study hard. Here.

1019
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,435
-See you later.
-Bye, Mom.

1020
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,561
Bye.

1021
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:23,320
Mom, someone scribbled on our house.

1022
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:24,405
Scribbled?

1023
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:29,994
What? Scribbled?

1024
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:24,089

A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

1035
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,998
This happened
because you're selling disgraceful things.

1036
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,041
-I'm going to continue.
-What?

1037
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,961
I'm not looking after Min-ho
if you keep doing this.

1038
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:27,296
Looking at the scribble,

1039
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:31,216
it's likely done by someone
who has a grudge against you.

1040
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:33,844
Min-ho isn't here?

1041
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,804
Why would he be here?

1042
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:36,889
Min-ho!

1043
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,182
A missing child report?

1044
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:40,225
Min-ho!

1045
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,436
Min-ho!

1046
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,855
You don't know anything.

1047
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:47,524
You never know what's going on

1048
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,067
right in front of your eyes.

1049
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,321
Have you seen a boy this tall,
around eight years old?

1050
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:55,282
Where could Min-ho be?
