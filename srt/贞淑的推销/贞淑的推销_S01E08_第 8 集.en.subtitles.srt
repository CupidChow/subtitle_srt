1
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,205
Detective.

3
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,333
Detective.

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,054
Are you okay?

5
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,059
Did you have a nightmare?

6
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,655
Who is it?

7
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,907
Detective, it's me, Han Jeong-suk.

8
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,202
I think I left my notebook there.

9
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,802
His voice was hoarse.

10
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,346
Was he asleep?

11
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,813
Hello.

12
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:31,317
I'm sorry. I was in such a hurry
that I left the notebook here.

13
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,866
You just got here, right?

14
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,742
Yes.

15
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,121
Why?

16
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,331
It's nothing.

17
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,044
-Here you go.
-Okay.

18
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,798
I must have woken you up. I'm sorry.

19
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,216
It's okay.

20
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,218
Bye then.

21
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,804
-Okay.
-See you.

22
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,739
A CATHOLIC WHO WAS WEARING
A WOODEN ROSARY RING

23
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,242
This is our stop!

24
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,994
-It'll be so much fun.
-Seriously.

25
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,579
-Let's hurry up.
-It'll be so much fun.

26
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,625
Hey, the poster looks so hot.

27
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,668
Did you watch
all the sequels of Madame Aema?

28
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,171
I watched the original
and all the sequels.

29
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,130
Really?

30
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,257
-I haven't watched anything.
-It's racy and fun.

31
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,175
It's electrifying.

32
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,093
-I can't wait.
-Let's hurry up and go.

33
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,013
MADAME AEMA 6

34
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,057
A free screening of Madame Aema?

35
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,810
Isn't it an erotic movie?

36
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,647
It's the best erotic movie.

37
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,525
I heard that a group of
barely dressed women are in the movie.

38
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,443
My goodness.

39
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,696
It's hard to find
new customers these days.

40
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,615
We should do something to attract them.

41
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:05,036
Why don't we give free movie tickets
to those who attend in-home sales events?

42
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,288
Oh, I like that idea.

43
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,584
The slip dress the main character wore
looked similar to ours.

44
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,420
It might sell better
once people have watched the movie.

45
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,713
It won't be any loss for us.

46
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,132
Morning tickets cost half the price.

47
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,842
The morning?

48
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,429
Would people watch
an erotic movie in the morning?

49
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,683
Most housewives get free time
in the morning

50
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,601
after their husbands and children leave.

51
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:33,106
You have a point. I'm the busiest
when my husband comes home in the evening.

52
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,816
If you agree to the idea,

53
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,277
I'll ask the movie theater
and proceed with the plan.

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,487
-Right away?
-Yes.

55
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,947
Jeong-suk,

56
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,075
you're so driven with the branch manager
promotion coming up.

57
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:49,622
I must let Yeong-bok know that
we should prepare a promotion party soon.

58
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,542
Yeong-bok said that she had
a family matter, right?

59
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,712
Yes, she's busy because of her in-laws.

60
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,713
I see.

61
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,008
OBSTETRICS
GEUMJE HOSPITAL

62
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,067
Ward 151, Ms. Kim Yeon-suk,

63
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,696
please return to the ward immediately.

64
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,209
Peek-a-boo!

65
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,384
What did the doctor say? Is it fatigue?

66
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,806
What is it?

67
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,976
Don't tell me…

68
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,561
Is it a serious illness?

69
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,356
I'm pregnant.

70
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,317
What?

71
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,946
I agonized over whether or not to tell you

72
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,908
that I'm pregnant.

73
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,954
But I thought you should still know.

74
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,415
Why did you agonize?

75
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,292
I won't have this baby.

76
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,006
There was a bit of blood.
There's a chance of miscarriage.

77
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,051
-I'm going to abort it in a few days.
-But…

78
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,677
How could you say that?

79
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,305
-You're too--
-What?

80
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,183
Am I too harsh?

81
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,437
I think it isn't right
to give birth to this baby.

82
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,564
Jong-seon.

83
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,151
Jong-seon.

84
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,029
Look at our situation.

85
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:51,035
Even now, we can't afford
to give our children

86
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,954
what we want to and should give them.

87
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,581
But you want another child?

88
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,167
Gosh, I can't do it.

89
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,877
But…

90
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,381
I scheduled an abortion,

91
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,551
so just pretend that this didn't happen.

92
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,530
MADAME AEMA 6

93
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,824
-You're here.
-Yes.

94
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,326
I'm glad you came.

95
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,777
My goodness.

96
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,864
Calm down, will you?

97
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,073
Look at that.

98
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,041
Please have some fruit.

99
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,044
-My goodness.
-Thank you.

100
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,340
Hold on. What's my height?
I became shorter with age.

101
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,092
Here. I'm done. Is this all you need?

102
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,552
Thank you.

103
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,014
I understand why
you need the measurements,

104
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,933
but why do you need to know my religion?

105
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,685
Well,

106
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,481
I thought it'd be good
to know each religion's taboos.

107
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:47,610
I also thought it'd be helpful
to know the customers' preferences.

108
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,576
RELIGION: NONE

109
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,829
"No religion"?
I thought you were Catholic.

110
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,123
Well, I stopped going to church
ten years ago

111
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,376
since I got so busy with work.

112
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,711
So now I should say
I don't have a religion.

113
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,881
All right.

114
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,180
-Here you go.
-Okay. Thank you.

115
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,855
This one suits your skin tone better.

116
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,982
-Really?
-Yes.

117
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,817
Then I should get this one.

118
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,823
Ma'am.

119
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,909
When you used to go to church,

120
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,744
did you wear a rosary ring?

121
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,124
A rosary ring? Yes, I wore it.
I used it whenever I prayed.

122
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,208
I see.

123
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,381
My friend has a silver ring.

124
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:54,760
Mine was neither silver nor gold.
It was wooden.

125
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,680
-Wooden?
-Yes.

126
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,851
This must be some kind of oil.

127
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,235
This smells so nice.

128
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,122
Detective!

129
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,707
Hello.

130
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,710
It's good to see you here.
I thought about calling you.

131
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,003
Is something the matter?

132
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,672
The owner of the gukbap place.

133
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,633
She went to church up until ten years ago.

134
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,344
She also had a wooden rosary ring.

135
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,804
Moreover,

136
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,140
she's left-handed just like you.

137
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:45,394
And fascinatingly, you two have
the same moles in the exact same spots.

138
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,229
-A mole?
-Yes.

139
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,522
Right here.

140
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,360
Her moles also make a triangle like this.

141
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,410
I ruled her out recently.

142
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:07,124
She was hospitalized
for two years around the time I was born.

143
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,751
What?

144
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:13,339
For your information,
moles and left-handedness aren't genetic.

145
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,008
And I'm ambidextrous.

146
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,134
I see.

147
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,890
They said they were in some TV drama.
I guess they were wrong.

148
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,352
I should've given you
information on the women I've ruled out.

149
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,187
I'll share what I know from now on.

150
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,106
Okay.

151
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,153
Since there aren't many clues,
I keep studying appearances closely.

152
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,116
I must have been mistaken
because I thought she looked like you.

153
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,326
She looked like me?

154
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,411
Yes.

155
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,414
The gukbap place owner's nose is…

156
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,292
How should I put it?
She has a high nose bridge.

157
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,088
And the nose tip is quite pointy too.

158
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,968
It really is okay. Don't worry about it.

160
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,680
I'll keep in touch.

161
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,003
A high nose bridge?

162
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,483
Jong-seon, I know that you're
a hardworking man.

163
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,650
Besides,

164
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,571
I don't have prejudices
against that matter.

165
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:04,033
But I just don't need
another full-time employee.

166
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,704
NOW HIRING

167
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,706
Why is that sign still up there?

168
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:15,002
Please call me if there's an opening.

169
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,003
Of course.

170
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,422
Take care.

171
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,883
Goodness.

172
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,771
It's hard for an ex-convict
to find a job, right?

173
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,150
They always talk about rehabilitation,

174
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,111
but society doesn't help.

175
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,239
If you're going to spout nonsense, leave.

176
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,076
You should hear me out first,

177
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,078
then decide if it's nonsense.

178
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,760
Robbing the jewelry store
Seung-tak's dad runs?

179
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,011
Come on.

180
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,849
I'm just getting my money back.

181
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,522
You know how Seung-tak stole
three million won from me whilst gambling.

182
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,485
I found out that he scammed me
with professional gamblers.

183
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,779
It was stolen money anyway.

184
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,574
I paid for my crime. Because of that…

185
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,160
Because of that, I went to prison.

186
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,455
That punk needs to pay for his crime.

187
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,460
That brings me to my point.

188
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,172
Just drive and keep watch for me.

189
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,758
-You're the only one I can trust.
-Nonsense!

190
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,679
Nothing more, nothing less.
Just three million won.

191
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,724
I'll just retrieve the stolen money
and split it with you.

192
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,395
One million won

193
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,482
will be enough deposit for a place
with two rooms and a living room.

194
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,153
I promised my wife

195
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,489
I'd live in a way
that isn't shameful to my children.

196
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,451
I'll take my leave.

197
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,412
Don't you think
the way you live now is shameful?

198
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,583
Your wife is struggling
as the sole breadwinner.

199
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,631
You'll pass down the poverty
you're sick and tired of to your children.

200
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,217
Are you proud of that?

201
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,221
What do you know?
Don't run your mouth like that!

202
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,806
Listen.

203
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:38,145
You should put your family
before your conscience.

204
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,274
I guess I wouldn't know
because I'm not the head of a family.

205
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,873
There's no one.

206
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,460
All of them moved away a long time ago.

207
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,838
All of them?

208
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,507
That's right.

209
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,052
It took a few years for people to think

210
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,221
that it was probably kidnapping,
not disappearance.

211
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,305
Yes.

212
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:19,353
Until then, the parents were treated
as sinners who lost their children.

213
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,022
They were already heartbroken,

214
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,859
but people pointed fingers at them
for losing their children.

215
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,653
So they couldn't hold out.

216
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,577
Do you happen to keep in touch

217
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,747
with the families of the victims?

218
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,125
Do you know where they moved to?

219
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,046
One family moved to the region
a junior of mine transferred to.

220
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,966
That's right. Yeongeup.

221
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,304
I kept in touch with the family
that moved there from time to time.

222
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,267
Hold on. Did they run a hanbok store?

223
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,145
They ran a business.

224
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,857
Not this one.

225
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,862
By the way,

226
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,490
why do you keep asking questions
about that case?

227
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,078
I became interested
while going through the cold cases.

228
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,791
You should let go of that interest.

229
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,004
-Why?
-It's been more than 30 years.

230
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,256
Catching the culprit
won't make a difference

231
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,925
since the statute of limitations
has expired.

232
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,219
Still--

233
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,640
I heard that you solved
many cold cases in Seoul.

234
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,643
But don't dig this up.

235
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,105
It has left too many people
scarred already

236
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,902
for you to dig it up
just to satisfy your curiosity.

237
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,551
HANYINHONG

238
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,372
Honey, it's red ginseng tea.

239
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,331
Okay.

240
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,924
Be careful.

241
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,640
It's nice.

242
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,144
It's only morning,
but I feel full of energy.

243
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,354
Should I skip work today?

244
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,356
I'll make it again tomorrow.

245
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,528
By the way, how did you know?
I thought you had forgotten.

246
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,990
How could I forget?

247
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,034
Chairman Eom told me yesterday.

248
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,120
Chairman Eom?

249
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,205
What's this date?

250
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,459
It's the day Chairman Eom and I will go
on an overnight hiking trip.

251
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,711
MOUNT JIRI

252
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,380
We'll go with my car, so wash it later.

253
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,136
Gosh, why do I feel cold suddenly?

254
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,559
Man, I can see my breath even in July?

255
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,647
What?

256
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,321
It's our wedding anniversary!

257
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,574
I can't believe you. How could you?

258
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,035
You'd never celebrated it properly,

259
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,704
so I told you I was sad
for the first time last year.

260
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,457
You said we'd celebrate it this year
no matter what.

261
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,502
But I can't pass up on this.

262
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,340
Chairman Eom is only taking two people,
and I'm one of them.

263
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,676
It means that he thinks of me
as a very special--

264
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,762
-Underling?
-Underling.

265
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,557
Unbelievable. How could you say that?

266
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,435
Put it in the sink.

267
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,312
You can make it yourself tomorrow.

268
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,858
I can't believe you.

269
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,833
Thank you for doing this.
You must be busy.

270
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,379
I'm glad that I can help.

271
00:20:55,462 --> 00:21:00,259
Like you said, it'll be a good idea
to visit as customers.

272
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,219
Since the shop specializes
in wedding gifts,

273
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,721
she could think we're
a couple who are shopping.

274
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,391
Here's my plan.

275
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,561
Let's pretend to be a couple
who are getting married soon.

276
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,063
When she lets her guard down,

277
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,983
we'll ask questions
as naturally as possible.

278
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,361
I made a list of questions too. Hold on.

279
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,780
I practiced all night long.

280
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,701
Here.

281
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,869
Is this one better?

282
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,873
WONBONG PHARMACY

283
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,294
You're in early.

284
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,088
The employee comes in late,

285
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:42,926
so I should come in early
to open the door and mop the floor.

286
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,845
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,061
By the way, Mr. Choi,

288
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,314
I have a question.

289
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,611
When was your first kiss
and how did it happen?

290
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,488
My goodness.

291
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,365
What's gotten into you?

292
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,825
I'm just curious.

293
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,493
Everyone has their first kiss

294
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,413
when they're immature
and they don't make a big deal out of it.

295
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,207
How was it for you?

296
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,754
That came out of nowhere.

297
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,980
May I hold your hand?

298
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,045
If it isn't too much trouble,
may I kiss you?

299
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,759
You don't need to get
my permission each time.

300
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,427
After all,

301
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,388
we got married today.

302
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,684
What?

303
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,855
You had your first kiss
with your wife after the wedding?

304
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,235
I was very cautious

305
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,694
with everything.

306
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,991
You were so prudent and pure.

307
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,245
If your first kiss was like white snow,

308
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,372
my first kiss was like…

309
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:41,211
the shattered briquette pieces
on the snow.

310
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,297
It was like that.

311
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,842
When and how did you have your first kiss?

312
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,802
It's nothing.

313
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,098
I've lost all my confidence now.

314
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,271
What's up with him?

315
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,655
You must have struggled a lot.

316
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,577
Since I made you wait for a long time,

317
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,580
I'll put in more effort from now on.

318
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,124
Please don't say that.

319
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,711
Geum-hui, you don't need to do anything.

320
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,756
Just use your hands to eat.

321
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,674
I'm serious.

322
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,759
Aren't you tired?

323
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,720
Not at all.

324
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,267
It's a historic day
when I finally married you.

325
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,520
I'll be happy
even if I roll around in poop.

326
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:45,025
To me, this day is
an overwhelmingly important day,

327
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,570
like the most important national holiday.

328
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,113
A national holiday, my foot.

329
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,034
Why am I the only one
who remembers the national holiday?

330
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,704
You sighed during the in-home sales,

331
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,081
so I wondered what was going on.

332
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,416
Did I do that?

333
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,754
Whenever I hear
about married couples who get along well,

334
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,631
I can't help but sigh.

335
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,634
It makes me wonder
if I'm the only one who lives this way.

336
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,970
Yeong-bok, how do you celebrate
your wedding anniversary?

337
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,181
Me? I just…

338
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,601
He just cooks for me.

339
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,561
-He cooks for you?
-Yes.

340
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,815
He promised me that I wouldn't need to do
household chores for the rest of my life.

341
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,735
He says he wants to keep the promise
even if it's just for one day.

342
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,197
I get to do absolutely no chores that day.

343
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,033
Gosh, your husband is so sweet.

344
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,120
He can't afford to buy me a present,

345
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,289
so he works his body instead.

346
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,958
It's the thought that counts.

347
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,461
Your husband really is amazing.

348
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,339
Of course, he is.

349
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,258
Jong-seon sure is.

350
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,513
Yeong-bok, it's good to see you.

351
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,307
I was wondering how you were.

352
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,103
Ms. Oh, we should get going.

353
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,564
Why are you ignoring me
as if I'm a piece of trash?

354
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,068
Why? Is it because I'm an ex-convict?

355
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,320
No.

356
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,448
Your husband is an ex-convict too.

357
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,158
So that can't be it.

358
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,494
So many years have passed,

359
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:22,539
so I thought that you'd be
much more easygoing.

360
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,624
Why are you still so cold?

361
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,793
At the end of the day,
I'm your husband's friend.

362
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,878
Can't you at least say hi to me?

363
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,215
Friend, my foot.

364
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,428
My husband's nothing like you.

365
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,473
He'll never get involved with you again,

366
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,393
so let's skip the greetings.

367
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,603
Ms. Oh, let's go.

368
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,192
She trusts him too much, doesn't she?

369
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,791
How could he be so rude?

370
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,170
That's my bus. I'll get going now.

371
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,388
LEE'S HANBOK

372
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,480
You must be very nervous.

373
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,440
You can put yourself at ease

374
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,026
because I'll be the one asking questions.

375
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,028
Okay.

376
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,076
-Let's go.
-Okay.

377
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,260
How's this, De…

378
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,350
Do… Do-hyeon.

379
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,270
Do-hyeon, I think

380
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,732
navy-colored ones like this
would look good on you.

381
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,985
I love it. It looks nice.

382
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,864
How about this one?

383
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,244
Jeong-suk,

384
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,830
I think pink would look good on you.

385
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,498
It's pretty.

386
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,917
You guys have a good eye.

387
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,170
That's the best quality hanbok
in this place.

388
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,755
Is that so?

389
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,925
Isn't it pretty?

390
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,264
Why don't you try it on behind the door?

391
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,306
Okay.

392
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,308
-I'll help you.
-Okay.

393
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,685
-Come.
-Okay.

394
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,314
Look around while I try it on.

395
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,024
Jeong-suk, take it slow.

396
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,912
IF YOU'VE SEEN…

397
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,457
All done.

398
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,919
Here comes the bride.

399
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,169
What do you think?
She looks like an angel, right?

400
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,672
Yes.

401
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,590
Is that all?

402
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,928
She's beautiful.

403
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,099
This hanbok is very pretty.

404
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,811
Take your time and look in the mirror.

405
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,647
Okay.

406
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,583
Hey.

407
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,086
Hey, can't you hear me?

408
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,713
What?

409
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,174
Are you going to try on
the hanbok you chose earlier?

410
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,885
Yes, of course.

411
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:31,055
My goodness. You're absolutely mesmerized.

412
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,017
I'll find one in a bigger size.

413
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,226
-Okay.
-Wait.

414
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,194
Did you find anything?

415
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,658
I think she should check those photos.

416
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,038
IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS BABY,
CONTACT ME

417
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,292
Could this baby be you?

418
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,627
No.

419
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,087
I thought that might be the case.

420
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,090
Judging by the characteristics
on the flyer, this isn't me.

421
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,717
LEE YEONG-HO, FIVE MONTHS OLD

422
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,801
By the way,

423
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,471
doesn't the fact that
she has kept this flyer mean

424
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,848
that she has been looking for her child?

425
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,475
-I think we should ask.
-Ask what?

426
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,648
You guys aren't here to buy hanbok, right?

427
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,368
I didn't know that was why you came here.

428
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,162
You could have told me from the start.

429
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,122
You must have struggled for many years.

430
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,460
I worried that I was digging up
an old memory you wanted to forget,

431
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,962
so I had to be cautious.

432
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,338
How could I forget?

433
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,717
My precious child suddenly disappeared.

434
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,387
Unless I find him,

435
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,683
I won't forget until the day I die.

436
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,690
For a while,
I could neither sleep nor eat.

437
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,193
Worried that I'd die,

438
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,904
my husband suggested moving.

439
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,448
He said that

440
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,452
we could never find
our Yeong-ho if I died.

441
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,205
That's when I came back to my senses.

442
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,500
That was why we moved.

443
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,337
I wanted to survive

444
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,173
and find him somehow.

445
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,720
So you made this flyer.

446
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,432
I still believe…

447
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,727
that my son

448
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,105
will appear someday like you did.

449
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,234
Your mother

450
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,862
must be waiting for you.

451
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,115
Do you think so?

452
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,034
I'm sure of it.

453
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,417
But this lady here…

454
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,671
Are you sure that she isn't your lover?

455
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,301
I'm sorry.

456
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,970
I'm so sorry.

457
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,601
I'm sorry.

458
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,273
No?

459
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,400
You said

460
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,279
that the company is
desperate to hire people.

461
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,239
Don't dwell on my past crime.

462
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,242
I've been a good man for over ten years.

463
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,203
Can't you focus on that instead?

464
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,956
Okay, bye.

465
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,629
You're home.

466
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,929
I'm sorry. I know you're tired,
but I need to step out to find a job.

467
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,597
Why did you live like that?

468
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:10,316
Why did you get involved with that bastard
and do something that'd get in your way

469
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,527
for the rest of your life?

470
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,157
Why would you go look for a job?

471
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,742
No one will hire you.

472
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,161
It'll do nothing but distress you.
Don't go.

473
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:27,416
I gave up on the hope
of you finding a decent job

474
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,378
a long time ago.

475
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,421
I know.

476
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,676
I know my life is hopeless.

477
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,971
But I can't just sit around
and do nothing.

478
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,224
I heard that the surgery was dangerous
and hard on the body.

479
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,603
What am I supposed to do then?

480
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,108
Goodness, do you want me
to do nothing in this situation?

481
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,318
Is that what you want?

482
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:58,948
Goodness.

483
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,119
Stop it.

484
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,204
-Stop it!
-Come on.

485
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,303
Where are you going?

486
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,583
All right.

487
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,252
Ms. Oh.

488
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,713
Hello.

489
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,216
Hello. You must be getting off work now.

490
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,383
Yes.

491
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,552
These supplements

492
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,888
are very hard to get.

493
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,558
They're valuable, so make sure
to give them to Chairman Eom.

494
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,601
Okay.

495
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,895
Please apologize to him on my behalf.

496
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,605
Yes, sir.

497
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,023
See you.

498
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:14,941
Bye.

499
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,067
Go on.

500
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,448
What are you so sorry about?
You always bend over backwards for him.

501
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,910
But I can't this week.

502
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,830
I told him I can't go on the hiking trip.

503
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,291
-Why?
-Just because.

504
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,920
To celebrate the national holiday.

505
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,135
I guess you finally remembered

506
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,555
how you used to be completely different.

507
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,185
Yes, I did.

508
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,398
You know,

509
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,859
you were completely different too.

510
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:04,699
Back in the day, you were like
a delicate cosmos flower.

511
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,119
-And now?
-Now…

512
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,373
Gosh, give me that.

513
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,042
I don't want the cosmos flower to break.

514
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,670
-I can't let that happen.
-You're being silly.

515
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,715
Is it for dinner?

516
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,758
Shall we just eat out?

517
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,640
So what's the plan for tomorrow?

518
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:42,069
NAESAN REST AREA

519
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,498
Why aren't you eating?

520
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,667
I'm eating.

521
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,097
I'm fine.

522
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,853
It looks like
you're struggling more than I am.

523
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,355
You cried a lot earlier.

524
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,942
I'm sorry, that was silly of me.

525
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,945
You didn't bring me here for that.

526
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,364
I couldn't help you either.

527
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,199
You did help me.

528
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,535
What?

529
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,748
Even when I read your note about
how my parents might be looking for me,

530
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,209
I doubted it.

531
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,921
But after meeting the lady today,

532
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,091
I think my mother…

533
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,638
might have struggled more than I have.

534
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,809
And it broke my heart.

535
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,563
Detective.

536
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,026
Thanks for crying on my behalf.

537
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,281
It was consoling to see you hurting
as much as I did.

538
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,075
So you did more than enough today.

539
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,452
And…

540
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,790
thanks in advance for more of your help.

541
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,423
Okay.

542
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,581
Ms. Han Jeong-suk?

543
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,758
Gosh, when did I fall asleep?

544
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,760
You should've woken me up.

545
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,137
It hasn't been long.

546
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,099
What? This is…

547
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,107
By the way,

548
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,153
I finished going over
the materials I borrowed.

549
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,030
But I need them for a while longer.

550
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,950
Is it okay to drop by your place tomorrow?

551
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:17,910
No.

552
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,497
I see. Are you busy tomorrow?

553
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,915
Yes.

554
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,127
-Then when--
-I'll give you a call.

555
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,129
Okay.

556
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,799
Okay. It was a long day for you today.

557
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,260
Have a safe trip home.

558
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,753
You'll pass down the poverty
you're so sick and tired of

559
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,921
to your children.

560
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,134
Your wife is struggling
as the sole breadwinner.

561
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,136
Are you proud of that?

562
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,725
You should put your family
before your conscience.

563
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,979
I guess I wouldn't know
because I'm not the head of a family.

564
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,902
JOB LISTINGS

565
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,072
EXPERIENCED POSITIONS

566
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,861
All right.

567
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,469
Yeong-bok.

568
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,644
I just wanted…

569
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,355
I…

570
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,235
I just wanted to be a good husband.

571
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,918
I'm sorry.

572
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,719
I'm sorry.

573
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:55,270
I really wanted to be a good husband.

574
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,653
I'm sorry this is the best I could do…

575
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,533
I'm pathetic.

576
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,746
I'm sorry. I love you.

577
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,099
I'm sorry.

578
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,695
I'm sorry.

579
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,652
No. He said that he'd call me first.

580
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,159
Hello?

581
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,079
Yes, Director.

582
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,374
Yes, it's fine. Please go ahead.

583
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,881
What?

584
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,677
Me?

585
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,055
Introducing
the first branch manager in Geumje,

586
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,765
Ms. Han Jeong-suk!

587
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,479
"With her outstanding ideas

588
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,482
such as the creation
of the Korean manual of the adult toys

589
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,275
and customer events,

590
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,986
Ms. Han Jeong-suk placed first in sales

591
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,615
in the first half of the year.

592
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,618
Thus, Fantasy Lingerie

593
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:19,247
appoints Ms. Han Jeong-suk
as the branch manager of Geumje."

594
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,584
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

595
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,920
You didn't have to do this for me.

596
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,129
Why not?

597
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,756
You became a branch manager,

598
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,884
but the company
didn't give you a ceremony.

599
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,719
So we should celebrate by ourselves.

600
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,555
Of course. It's a feat.

601
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,057
That's right.

602
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,976
Okay, everyone.

603
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,564
For Ms. Han Jeong-suk, who'll step forward
as a branch manager,

604
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,442
-let's give a big round of applause.
-My goodness.

605
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,362
Ju-ri, what you've done is enough.

606
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,823
-Thank you so much.
-All right.

607
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,409
I wanted to do more.

608
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,251
Will the branch manager training
start next week?

609
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,504
Yes. The director will call me
and give me the exact schedule.

610
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,967
Soon, you'll be on salary.

611
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:12,968
How much is it?

612
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,554
It's 100,000 won a month.

613
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,182
I'm so jealous.

614
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,728
-Yeong-bok, we need to work harder.
-Right.

615
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,231
You keep missing work these days.
There's no time to be down.

616
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,733
Okay. Don't worry.

617
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,819
I'll work hard so you don't tell me off.

618
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,824
This isn't all, right?

619
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,410
We should have a drink on this joyous day.

620
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,996
I'm so sorry.

621
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,748
I have an engagement this evening.

622
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:47,627
Then I'll treat everyone
to a meal next week.

623
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,756
Jeong-suk, buy us a drink instead.

624
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,175
-A drink.
-Okay. I'll buy you a drink.

625
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,894
Detective!

626
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,691
Do you have a minute?

627
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,612
The thing is…

628
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:18,033
Oh, I got promoted
at the in-home sales company.

629
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,203
I became a branch manager,

630
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,663
and the title is given
to top sales performers.

631
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,874
I'm now on salary, and…

632
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,292
In any case, it's good news.

633
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,086
I'm sorry, but I need to go
to the police station.

634
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,547
I see.

635
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,051
I didn't know you were busy. I'm sorry.

636
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:36,968
Bye.

637
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,845
Bye.

638
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,222
Detective Kim.

639
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,182
Hello.

640
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,519
You said that you'd visit a store
and go home.

641
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,895
Are you only going home now?

642
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,605
I'm jealous.

643
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,524
You can go home early
since there's no work

644
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,359
and enjoy the weekend.

645
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:56,655
Then you should get work done quickly
like Detective Kim.

646
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,157
We'll get going now. Bye.

647
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,242
Bye.

648
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,560
Yeong-bok.

649
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:28,979
I asked you to stay behind--

650
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,065
You must have been very startled.

651
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:39,447
My husband has been through a lot.

652
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,033
Before he met me,

653
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:47,163
he hung out with jerks like that guy
and got himself in trouble.

654
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,584
But Ms. Oh,

655
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,336
my husband

656
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,381
really is a good man.

657
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:01,553
He promised not to do such things
when he met me.

658
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,680
For over ten years,

659
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,892
he has kept that promise.

660
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,643
Of course.

661
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,772
I figured that much
from listening to your stories.

662
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,690
I mean it.

663
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,403
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

664
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,741
You asked me to stay behind,

665
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,954
so I got nervous about what you'd say.

666
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,542
I wondered if you'd cut ties with me.

667
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,378
Don't be ridiculous.

668
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,464
Actually…

669
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,093
I wanted to give you this.

670
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,733
I bought it at the market
because it caught my eye.

671
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,653
I've never raised a child.

672
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,698
I didn't know what your girls would like,
so I had to think for a while.

673
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,534
What do you think?

674
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,371
Do you think your girls will like them?

675
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,713
Of course. My goodness.

676
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,053
I have four children,

677
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:28,056
so you must have thought for a while.

678
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,434
No, it was fun.

679
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,271
I was picturing your house full of kids

680
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,023
and got jealous too.

681
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,109
You're jealous of me?

682
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:44,990
You say that because
you don't know what it's like.

683
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,868
You might be right.

684
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:51,997
But

685
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,250
if you look closely,

686
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,753
everyone has their own struggles.

687
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,382
I'm the same.

688
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,430
Things are tough these days, right?

689
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,515
Yes.

690
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,352
As for the finances, there's hope.

691
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,105
I really don't know.

692
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,233
Seriously,

693
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,778
is there hope?

694
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,697
Of course.

695
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,117
Our work is hope.

696
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,953
Things will go well

697
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,205
just as they did for Jeong-suk.

698
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,457
You're right.

699
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:42,839
I guess hope isn't so far away.
Isn't that right?

700
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,843
The person who's near us,
Jeong-suk, is our hope.

701
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,434
What's going on?

702
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,145
Did I do something wrong?

703
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,442
Is it because I left my notebook
when I'd just sworn to help him?

704
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:07,072
Or is it because I made a fuss
with my incorrect knowledge

705
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,239
and disappointed him?

706
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,493
Moles and left-handedness aren't genetic.

707
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,828
Or is it

708
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,956
because I promised to ask questions calmly

709
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,333
-but kept crying?
-I'm sorry.

710
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,211
Or is it because I fell asleep

711
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,171
when he had so much on his mind?

712
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,383
I made so many mistakes.

713
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,516
KIDNAPPING CASE LOG

714
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,365
Hello.

715
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,742
It's me, Han Jeong-suk.

716
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,331
Hello. Please go ahead.

717
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,876
You said that you'd call me.

718
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,463
I called because you haven't
and I got curious.

719
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:51,050
Is there anything I can help you with?

720
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,098
No, not really.

721
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,224
To be honest…

722
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,146
I might be mistaken, but…

723
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:09,777
I have a feeling that you are avoiding me.

724
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:15,909
Could it be that you want me
to stop helping you?

725
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,166
I see.

726
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,839
Ms. Han Jeong-suk? Hello?

727
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,549
Hello?

728
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,432
Detective.

729
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,728
Hello?

730
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,650
What?

731
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,985
Did he hang up on me?

732
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,656
Mom, let's have a party.

733
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,824
Grandma brought some meat.

734
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,618
Okay.

735
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,954
A party.

736
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,875
Thank you. Eat up.

737
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,420
My son, you placed first.

738
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:53,047
-Eat up. Here.
-How about me?

739
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,884
-Wait. Let our son eat first.
-I want to hurry up and eat.

740
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,722
My specialty is singing.

741
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:03,016
My hobby is reading…

742
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,350
It's reading.

743
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,812
I have neither a hobby nor a specialty.

744
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,939
And I don't want a baby, either.

745
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:17,280
How could you talk about having a baby
when we met ten minutes ago?

746
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,115
It's an important matter.

747
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,534
I heard that you were the eldest son.

748
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,745
You'll need to carry on the family name.

749
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,455
By the way,

750
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,126
may I ask you what your reason is?

751
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,299
I don't want to live an ordinary life.

752
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:40,011
I want to live as a modern woman.

753
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,638
I see.

754
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,641
Let's not waste each other's time then.

755
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,809
What?

756
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,937
But…

757
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,027
Geum-hui!

758
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,657
Who are you?

759
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,120
It's me. We went on a blind date
a month ago.

760
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,039
My name is Choi Won-bong.

761
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,085
What happened to your face?

762
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,089
I ran over as soon as I got permission.

763
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:20,551
I just got my parents' permission.

764
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,719
What?

765
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,973
Permission to marry a woman
who refuses to have a child?

766
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,058
Yes.

767
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,894
I stopped going to work

768
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,604
and refused to eat.

769
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:36,067
So they said they'd rather
give me permission

770
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,860
than see me die before them.

771
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,362
Geum-hui,

772
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:43,282
I'll make sure
that you don't live an ordinary life.

773
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:48,621
I'll make sure you live
as the number one modern woman in Korea.

774
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,293
I promise.

775
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,082
Welcome.

776
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,627
I heard that my wife was
a regular customer here.

777
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,129
It's you, Mr. Choi.

778
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,006
I heard a lot about you.

779
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,632
Ms. Oh's a regular customer here.

780
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,885
Do you want to buy her a present?

781
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,970
Yes. My goodness.

782
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:49,390
I want something women
wear around their necks.

783
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,225
-A scarf.
-Yes.

784
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,936
She wore it often back in the day.

785
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,646
It looked good on her.

786
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,941
Gosh, you're such a sweet husband.

787
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,194
Please come this way and pick one.

788
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,155
What? I'd rather you do the picking.

789
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,174
Mom, why do you keep looking at the clock?

790
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,344
Well,

791
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,639
your dad is running late.

792
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,017
I have something to say to him.

793
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,853
What is it? Is it good news?

794
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,233
Your dad will be ecstatic.

795
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,445
Isn't that what Eun-ji used to wear?

796
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,322
Not just Eun-ji.

797
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:49,200
This has been passed down
from your eldest sister.

798
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,763
Ms. Han Jeong-suk?

799
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,269
Hello.

800
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:19,897
I brought these.

801
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,986
These are the materials I borrowed.

802
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,029
I thought I'd give them back.

803
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,156
I see.

804
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,203
I'm sorry.

805
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:43,546
It felt like
you had suddenly become distant…

806
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,466
so I was a bit flustered.

807
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,886
But I looked back on my past actions,

808
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,555
and it all made sense.

809
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,601
I would have also thought
it'd be better to work on it alone.

810
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,650
Still, I wanted to say this one last time.

811
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,906
I may have been clumsy,

812
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:14,785
but I sincerely wanted to help you.

813
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:22,877
I didn't want you to think
that I was taking the case lightly.

814
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:27,131
As for that…

815
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,226
Okay. I'll take my leave then.

816
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,400
But the thing is…

817
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,610
Yes?

818
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:52,031
Well, I'm honestly a bit upset.

819
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,533
At the rest area,

820
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,827
you thanked me for feeling your pain,

821
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,747
and you thanked me in advance for my help.

822
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:04,126
I believed you
and was determined to do a good job.

823
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:09,090
If you had been honest,
I wouldn't have felt so backstabbed.

824
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,102
Bye.

825
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:27,858
You know…

826
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,824
I didn't mean to say I felt backstabbed.

827
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:41,122
I drank a few bottles of soju
to celebrate my promotion.

828
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,377
It's natural to become more upset
as you speak.

829
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,547
That's why I got worked up.

830
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,090
Please don't mind it.

831
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,009
Okay.

832
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,723
I have a feeling…

833
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,271
that after today…

834
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,942
things will become
more awkward between us.

835
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,572
So I thought it'd be best

836
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,366
to say everything I wanted to say.

837
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:20,369
Then I couldn't stop talking.

838
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,541
I'll take my leave for real now.

839
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,259
Ms. Han Jeong-suk.

840
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,600
Yes?

841
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,902
It's true that I was trying

842
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:54,820
to keep my distance.

843
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,325
But it wasn't because of the reasons
you had in mind.

844
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,870
It's just that when I'm with you…

845
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,999
I become a bit confused.

846
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,002
That was why I avoided you.

847
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,796
Because of me?

848
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,800
What are you confused about?

849
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,635
I don't know.

850
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,596
So…

851
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:24,809
I want to check.

852
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,228
What?

853
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,121
My goodness.

854
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:39,884
A person…

855
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,721
There's a dead person.

856
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,394
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

857
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,625
The hit-and-run culprits
and the jewelry store robbers

858
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,585
are the same people?

859
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:17,213
Someone saw a man using
the telephone booth.

860
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,759
He got into a hit-and-run yesterday.

861
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,969
What happened to him?

862
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,556
I don't know who it is, but the culprit
deserves divine punishment!

863
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,476
You guys rushed over and worried about us

864
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,728
and looked after us like a family.

865
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:38,275
Meeting you guys has been
the biggest blessing in my life.

866
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:41,111
If I have fun spending time with him,

867
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,614
that means I like him too.

868
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:46,283
Then that's it.
I should just go out with him.

869
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,118
I like you

870
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,037
a lot.

871
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:57,169
