1
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,674
-What should we eat?
-Tteokbokki!

3
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,886
-I want sundae!
-Enough!

4
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,105
Why are you so late?

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,024
I don't want to go to work.

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,567
You never do.

7
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,279
Yes, that's it.

8
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,447
Right here.

9
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,531
Is this right?

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,992
-It's right.
-How are you going to pay?

11
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,286
-Just put it in your ledger.
-I'm off.

12
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,788
-See you.
-See you.

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,791
-Hello.
-Long time no see!

14
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,084
-How are you?
-Good.

15
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:28,338
-How are you, my dear?
-Hello.

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,548
How are you, ladies?

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,883
-These look good.
-Of course.

18
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,384
YOUR HOMETOWN RUNNER
GEUMJE MS. CHILI PEPPER CONTEST

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,429
GEUMJE, 1992

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,766
Should I enter Mi-suk in that?

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,851
In what?

22
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,686
The National Assembly elections?

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,980
No, Ms. Chili Pepper!

24
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,484
It'd be faster
to make her an assemblywoman.

25
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,611
Why? What's wrong with my Mi-suk?

26
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:56,074
She may not be able to win Miss Korea,

27
00:01:56,157 --> 00:02:00,703
but she could win a countryside pageant.

28
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,373
You're new around here,
so let me tell you.

29
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:08,128
Geumje is as famous for beauties
as it is for chili peppers.

30
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,840
All the past winners are total knockouts.

31
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,883
How pretty could they be?

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,970
Well?

33
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,055
That pretty.

34
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,600
-Hello.
-Good morning.

35
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,894
Oh, no.

36
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,881
Hello.

37
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,090
Hi.

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,634
An egg, please.

39
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,844
You see her?

40
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:02,390
Min-ho's mother right here
won Ms. Chili Pepper when she was young.

41
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:07,729
You have to be this pretty
to win Ms. Chili Pepper.

42
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,314
That was ages ago.

43
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,816
-Did you pick up more work?
-Yes.

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,280
Thank you. Good-bye.

45
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,040
Everything is on sale!

46
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,584
What a waste of good looks.

47
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,545
What's she doing with those dolls?

48
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,756
Is she sewing on the eyes?

49
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,259
Yes, that's her side hustle.

50
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,805
With that face,
she should be living large.

51
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,933
She drew the short straw.

52
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,309
"The short straw"?

53
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,832
Gosh!

54
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,460
You're up.

55
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,379
You got more?

56
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,923
It doesn't even pay well.

57
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,429
You're right, but they're so cute.

58
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,476
There we go.

59
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,480
The once-blind Dooly
can now look here and there!

60
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,898
It makes me feel so proud.

61
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,108
Look.

62
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,944
Good for you.

63
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
Good morning.

64
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,077
Did you sleep well?

65
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,871
Go wash up! I'll get breakfast ready.

66
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,165
My boy.

67
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,174
Geez, she could be a farmer.

68
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,141
Let's go.

69
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,394
-Look at Mommy.
-You look like a real grade-schooler.

70
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,562
All set.

71
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,815
Is that it?

72
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,359
The thing you got from your cousin?

73
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,486
Yes. It was Jin-hui's.

74
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,447
Jin-hui? Their daughter?

75
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,660
It's red. It's a gender-neutral color.

76
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,830
But that's Magical Princess Minky Momo!

77
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,790
JIN-HUI'S PROPERTY
MINKY

78
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,502
-You could've bought a new one.
-It's not like I didn't want to.

79
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,921
But we can't even pay rent on time.

80
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,050
And that's why I'm working.

81
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,510
For the biggest loser
from high school, at that.

82
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,430
I know you're making an effort.

83
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,641
But the expenses
will get bigger and bigger.

84
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,809
We have to send him

85
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,855
-to cram school--
-Min-ho! Let's race to the intersection!

86
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,316
Ready? Get set.

87
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,026
Let's…

88
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,319
Not again!

89
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,656
Catch me if you can!

90
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,033
Wait for me.

91
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,452
GEUMJE GOCHUJANG

92
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,120
I knew it. My son's a genius.

93
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,832
Have a good day at school.

94
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,502
Remember what I told you?

95
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,005
-If anyone picks a fight?
-Break their nose first.

96
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,882
Geez, seriously.

97
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,093
-What's wrong with you?
-What?

98
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,177
Jeong-suk!

99
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,057
Okay, I'll be going.

100
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,600
Bye.

101
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,352
-Have a good time.
-Let's go.

102
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,357
Jeong-suk's the same as ever.

103
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,027
Like a flower blooming in a snowstorm,

104
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,239
she looks stunning
even though she's dirt poor.

105
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,993
What?

106
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,412
I was saying the truth!

107
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,750
That little…

108
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,835
WELCOME
GEUMJE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

109
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,753
-Let's go.
-Class Three, over here!

110
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,171
SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

111
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,297
Children, line up.

112
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,802
-My class, come with me.
-Class Three, this way.

113
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,888
The one in shorts.

114
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,224
I see you have only one kid.

115
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,851
Yes, that's right.

116
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,689
I also got emotional
when I sent my first to school.

117
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,400
But with my second,
I was too busy to get emotional.

118
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,903
Over there, in Class Two, that's my third.

119
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,405
And look here!

120
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,450
You see, I have four kids.

121
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,534
I see.

122
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,995
Can you put this on for me?

123
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,205
What a cute baby.

124
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,623
Thank you.

125
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,916
Ms. Seo.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,293
Hello.

127
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,589
You still haven't paid
for Min-ji's school milk program.

128
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,050
I'll pay it tomorrow.

129
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,012
All right. Please make sure
you settle up tomorrow.

130
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,144
She was my second's
homeroom teacher last year.

131
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,521
She's sexually frustrated for sure.

132
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,150
-Pardon?
-She's a spinster.

133
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,778
She treats men and women so differently.

134
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,824
She's so cold and condescending with me,

135
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:16,704
but with my husband,
she acts all coy and shy like this.

136
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,748
-Oh, my.
-I'm not even joking!

137
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,171
Goodness.

138
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,257
-The baby pooped.
-Oh, no.

139
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,260
You could say she's the lucky one though.

140
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,639
She's still living that single woman life.

141
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,099
-I'll see you next time.
-Sure.

142
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,395
-You're so pretty.
-Thank you. Take care.

143
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,385
Geez, look at you hustling.
Have a good day.

144
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,971
He's always so busy.

145
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,643
CHARMING HAIR SALON

146
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,825
-Goodness!
-Are you okay?

147
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,411
-Are you hurt?
-That hurts.

148
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,454
-Hey, Ju-ri.
-Welcome!

149
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,456
I'll be there in just a sec.

150
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,294
Are you okay?

151
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,337
-Help me up!
-Okay.

152
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,381
-What the heck?
-Goodness.

153
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,593
You're both getting perms?

154
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,011
-Yes.
-That's right.

155
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,971
Where's Dong-u? At school?

156
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,182
Yes. He was excited
for the entrance ceremony.

157
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,267
The entrance ceremony.

158
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,893
Shouldn't you go?

159
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,770
He said he's not a baby,

160
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,024
so I should use the time to do
more perms and buy him a tasty treat.

161
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,111
What a clever boy.
I wonder who he takes after.

162
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,988
Rice here.

163
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,659
I spilled so much of it
when I fell just now.

164
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,161
That's all right.

165
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,955
What's with that attitude?

166
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,749
Who do you think is at fault here?

167
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,083
Whose fault is it?

168
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,835
Of course, it's your fault.

169
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,753
What?

170
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:34,759
I was so shocked by your racy outfit
that I crashed straight into a handcart.

171
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:39,096
Can't you dress more respectably
when you're out in town?

172
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,144
Sure thing, dear. I'll do as you say.

173
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,604
"As you say, dear"…

174
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,440
No!

175
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,067
What do you mean, "dear"?

176
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,736
You're just one of those,
what do you call them?

177
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,321
-Husbandless?
-Single mom.

178
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,739
Yes, you're a single mom!

179
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,327
True. I'm a single mom without a husband.

180
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,579
I'm not your wife or anything.

181
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,873
So, why should I dress
the way you tell me to?

182
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,375
What?

183
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,044
Your wife has so many split ends

184
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,089
but keeps her hair long
because you like it that way.

185
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,425
You already have her.
So, why should I do as you say too?

186
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,514
Forget it and just pay for the rice.

187
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,598
All right.

188
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,062
Oh, right.

189
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,940
You spilled a couple of baskets of rice…

190
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,320
so I'm deducting this.

191
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,791
Right, the coffee.

192
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,752
Two coffee, two sugar, one creamer?

193
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,215
She didn't back down.

194
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:07,601
I ate out for lunch the past few days,
and now I feel bloated.

195
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,686
You know?

196
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,650
-Thank you, Jeong-suk.
-No worries.

197
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,531
I have to say,

198
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,951
home-cooked meals are the best.

199
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,121
What time will you be home tonight?

200
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,207
Same time as always, I guess. Why?

201
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,751
The Silence of the Lambs
is playing in Geumje.

202
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,295
Perhaps we can go see it?

203
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,673
The Silence of the Lambs?

204
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,383
No, thanks.

205
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:45,222
I don't like children,
and I hate baby animals even more.

206
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,141
It doesn't have real lambs in it.

207
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,020
In any case, I doze off
whenever I go to the movies.

208
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,897
It's a waste of money.

209
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,817
And if the lambs are silent,
they should be given medicine.

210
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,445
People are watching them
for entertainment instead?

211
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,447
How pathetic.

212
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,907
I'm off.

213
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,457
I can be so shortsighted at times.

214
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,712
I'm sure he must be tired
from dealing with pharmacy customers.

215
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,881
Don't you agree?

216
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,301
Of course.

217
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,368
I thought you'd stay
for a cup of tea as usual.

218
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:51,580
Today was the first day of school,
so I want to get groceries.

219
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,832
I see. Then you should go.

220
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,917
Thank you.

221
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,129
I'm sorry, but how about my weekly pay?

222
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,548
I put it right there.

223
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,929
Thank you, ma'am.

224
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,665
RETAIL PRICE
28,000 WON

225
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,770
GEUMJE BUTCHER SHOP

226
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,400
I'm the only one who can put up with him.

227
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,610
Hello.

228
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,862
It's Min-ho's mom!

229
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,488
I haven't seen you in so long.

230
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,699
I'll take 600 grams of ham.

231
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,284
Sure.

232
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,997
It's time for me to get going.

233
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,749
Give me some beef bones.

234
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,833
Again?

235
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,295
You're feeding him
expensive bone broth for every meal!

236
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,173
What's your husband
using all that energy on?

237
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,051
I need bone broth to get him
at least a little bit potent.

238
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,681
When he was young,
he'd have some grilled ham

239
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,600
and wouldn't let me sleep a wink.

240
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,937
He must've used up all his mojo then.

241
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,064
You're right.

242
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,318
That must be why Jeong-suk
is buying ham now.

243
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,446
See? At that age,
you don't even need the ham.

244
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:52,159
She just has to show him some of her hams,
and he should be chomping at the bit.

245
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,245
Is my order ready yet?

246
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,330
Just a moment.

247
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:02,127
You even have a kid.
No need to be all serious.

248
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,545
Are you that proper?

249
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,800
These conversations
are what make life fun.

250
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,344
Here. Thank you.

251
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,553
Good bye.

252
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,727
Well, now I feel embarrassed.

253
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,855
She's always been like that.

254
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,942
She seems like a decent person
with a bright personality,

255
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,611
but she's unusually weird
about this stuff.

256
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,117
My word, those jokes.

00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,209

Welcome home.

263
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,189
Since Min-ho started school,
I'm making bulgogi to celebrate.

264
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,899
What do you think?

265
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,825
Wait.

266
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,077
What happened to your face?

267
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,954
Did you get into a fight?

268
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,331
-Yes.
-Where?

269
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,833
At the factory.

270
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,669
Did you get into a fight with your boss?

271
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,299
He kept picking a fight with me,
so I lost it and hit him a few times.

272
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,177
He said he was taking
his medical expense out of my salary.

273
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,806
That's when it hit me
that he did it on purpose.

274
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,807
But why…

275
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,978
So,

276
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,564
you won't get paid?

277
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,232
I'll find another job.

278
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,860
What other place in Geumje will take you?

279
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,196
I know that!

280
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,364
That's why I tried to suck it up,

281
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,826
even though he was such an asshole.

282
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,498
But still…

00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,049
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: HAN JEONG-SUK

284
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,095
You're only hiring unmarried women?

285
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,515
That wasn't in the job posting.

286
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,478
How could you leave out
something so important?

287
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,693
Well, because of the nature of the work,
we don't hire married women.

288
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,905
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,200
Thank you.

290
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,911
I'll be going then.

291
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,759
She had a pretty face though.

292
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,844
Hey!

293
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,513
I'd still take an unmarried young lady
with worse looks

294
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,934
over a pretty married woman.

295
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,269
That's what I'm saying.

296
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,230
But…

297
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,065
But what?

298
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,194
I was just wondering.

299
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,198
What does being married have to do
with bookkeeping at a gas station?

300
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,327
It's not like married women can't
calculate receipts.

301
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,289
I just don't understand.

00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,048
Gosh.

304
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,844
Hello.

305
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,556
I'm happy to see you,

306
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,184
but I would be happier
if you paid rent on time.

307
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,398
I was going to pay today. Just a minute.

308
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,477
Honey.

309
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,731
You were waiting for me!

310
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,819
Did you take the money in our savings tin?

311
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,489
Yes, I spent it.

312
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,243
No, not spent. Invested.

313
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,494
Honey.

314
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,789
That was our rent money!

315
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,165
I know.

316
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:56,171
But if my plan works out,
we'll make a year's rent worth of money.

317
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,422
And if it doesn't?

318
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,093
What do we tell our landlord?

319
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,846
That's…

320
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,306
How could you?

321
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,643
-You wasted all that money.
-"Wasted"?

322
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,605
Why do you think everything I do is wrong?

323
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,149
-That's not it.
-Whatever.

324
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,026
Everyone looks down on me.

325
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,320
And you're no different.

326
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,161
Honey.

Fancy seeing you here!

00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,354
Hello.

333
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:02,274
I feel better seeing a familiar face here.

00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,067
Let's go in.

335
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,694
The thing is…

336
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,281
I think I should just go.

337
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,201
Wait. Let's go in together.

338
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,954
Not a single soul on earth
goes without underwear.

339
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,374
It's no big deal.

340
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,458
No.

341
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,712
This is not just underwear.

It's not used to cover and protect.

344
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,875
This underwear is meant to reveal.

345
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,128
This is a lot racier than I expected.

346
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:14,221
Most people assume
women are not interested in sex.

347
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,931
That is incorrect.

348
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,515
Even we women

349
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,310
are interested in having
passionate sex lives,

350
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,270
and we have every right to enjoy it.

351
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,446
If I'd known it'd be like this,
I never would've come.

352
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,323
I'll be leaving now too.

353
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,409
-What? Really?
-I expected this.

354
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,203
Still, how frustrating.

355
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:43,541
I thought you'd be desperate for money.

356
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,252
I guess I was wrong.

357
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:49,923
I do need the money.

358
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,761
But I can't take on just any job
just because I need money.

359
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,472
This clearly throws people off.

360
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,059
So, how can I sell these products
or make money?

361
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,687
What if I'm confident for a good reason?

362
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,608
People may find this
unfamiliar and uncomfortable at first.

363
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:12,028
But I believe you will succeed in the end

364
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,448
because I have precedents proving it.

365
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,040
These are materials I collected
while running my business.

366
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,458
There are precedents.

367
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,467
British physician Joseph

368
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:40,223
invented the electronic vibrator
to treat hysteria and anxiety.

369
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:46,396
People came to realize that it could be
used for erotic purposes over the years.

370
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,732
In the 1960s,

371
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,069
stores in the US
began to openly sell adult toys.

372
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:59,075
Interest in them grew,
and in 1977, Good Vibrations,

373
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,244
the first store dedicated to adult toys,

374
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,664
opened in San Francisco.

375
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,711
And that's when adult toys
were introduced to Korea, too.

376
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:20,055
I was a middle-aged woman that took items
out of the US army PX to sell.

377
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,601
I first encountered adult toys
through a US soldier.

378
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,771
What is it?

379
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,715
Geez! What is this?

380
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,050
Geez.

381
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,928
What do you think?

382
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,348
James…

383
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,435
This is a little…

384
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,316
This will absolutely make you money.

385
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,819
You said you wanted to be rich.

386
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,616
It'll get me rich?

387
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,747
That's how I started…

388
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,835
Fantasy Lingerie.

389
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,132
If she started in the 60s,

390
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,509
that means she's done it
for over 30 years.

391
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,012
Korea may be more conservative
than other countries,

392
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,266
but I took this on
because I knew there was potential.

393
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,893
And?

394
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:57,110
This is my 70-pyeong store in Seoul.

395
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,321
You may have seen it on your way in.

396
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,992
-The car parked outside is mine too.
-What?

397
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,959
My goodness.

398
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,463
I can't believe I'm selling adult toys.

399
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,882
I know, right?

400
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:25,930
But most housewives with a child
can't even dream of making 500,000 won.

401
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,392
I'd be happy
even if I couldn't make 500,000 won.

402
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:34,689
I'd be over the moon
if I made 300,000 won.

403
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,816
I wouldn't have to worry about rent.

404
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,778
I could buy my son a new school bag.

405
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,199
They said we have to bring
all the money from sales

406
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,660
back to the office to be paid our salary.

407
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:52,624
Yes. We don't need startup capital.
But if we can't sell, we can't get paid.

408
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,709
We also can't get more products to sell.

409
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,420
You think we can do this?

410
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,424
We've already signed up for it.

411
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,761
We have to make it work, no matter what.

412
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,230
And she was acting all virtuous
before we went in there.

413
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,940
Wait for me.

414
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:32,038
Where did the roof of that car go?

415
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,624
I've only seen that in the movies.

416
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,460
You don't get to see
a car like that in Geumje.

417
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,087
Who could that be?

418
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,403
Excuse me.

419
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,654
-What is it?
-What is it?

420
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,242
Is there a coffee shop nearby?

421
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,494
There's nothing like that here.

422
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,415
There's Black Teahouse down that way.
It's the only one we have.

423
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,374
"Black Teahouse"?

424
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:02,378
Or you can have coffee
from our vending machine.

425
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:06,341
You don't seem to be from around here.
You can sit and chat away with us.

426
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,510
We have plenty of rice cakes
that we can share with you too.

427
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,805
No, thank you.

428
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,766
Goodness!

429
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,728
Don't turn us down like that,
and sit for a minute.

430
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,104
No, it's all right.

431
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,148
It's really all right. Pardon me.

432
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,365
Maybe I should've grabbed him, not you.

433
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,329
Where should I do the sales?

434
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,165
A big house would be ideal.

435
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,397
Jeong-suk.

436
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,400
Could you iron my husband's shirts?

437
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,360
He has an important meeting this weekend.

438
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,571
-Plans?
-The Royal Club.

439
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,368
You know that my husband
wants to expand the pharmacy, right?

440
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:19,831
Yes. He said he liked a spot
near the movie theater.

441
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,459
The owner of that building
is the club chairman.

442
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,170
-The real estate agent's husband.
-I see.

443
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:30,383
At first, they said no.
But I think they're warming up to him.

444
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,759
What a relief.

445
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:38,057
If all this goes well,
I'm hoping to increase your hours.

446
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,226
I see.

447
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,730
Ma'am.

448
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:49,027
-I started another side job.
-Another job?

449
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,655
Yes. I'm exploring home sales.

450
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,868
Where you go to people's homes
and sell products?

451
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,745
Yes.

452
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,207
But

453
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,128
I don't know a lot of people.

454
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,173
And my place isn't fit
for selling stuff at.

455
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,011
Could I possibly use your home?

456
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,680
I'll pay an hourly fee for its use.

457
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,973
I'll also give you a gift.

458
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,687
It's you. Of course, I'll help.

459
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,568
But what are you selling?

460
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,779
Makeup? Pots?

461
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,990
Well…

462
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,790
I understand that you're shocked.

463
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,168
But it will be a new experience,
and it'll be fun too.

464
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,419
Jeong-suk.

465
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,381
As you know, I'm not that uptight.

466
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,218
-Of course, you're not!
-But…

467
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,263
I'm not that open-minded either.

468
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,458
Are you really
from Seoul Gangnam Police Station?

469
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,543
Yes.

470
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,004
You studied in the US through high school

471
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,589
then went to the police academy.

472
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,300
You're overqualified.

473
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,470
You're too big a fish
for our small country pond.

474
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,349
Why are you in a place like this?

475
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,184
Do you have a connection here?

476
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,980
No, it's just that it looks
like a good place to live.

477
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,523
I see.

478
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,025
You're right about that.

479
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,613
There's not much crime
out here in the boondocks.

480
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,534
The people are very different
from the ones in Seoul though.

481
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,121
-They're simple country folk.
-Is that right?

482
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,747
You still have to watch yourself.

483
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,458
If you talk too fast

484
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,753
and people think you're rude,
it'll be hard for you.

485
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,088
Greet people properly.

486
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,382
If people ask for small favors, do them.

487
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,925
That's right.

488
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:23,472
Detective Na, you've been here
the longest, so teach him the ropes.

489
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,767
It's going to be hard to teach
without knowing anything though.

490
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,227
Don't just puff yourself up.

491
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,814
I would never do that.
And with so few junior colleagues?

492
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,400
I'll treat him very well.

493
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,613
Why are you getting up so suddenly?

494
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,740
Were you not finished talking?

495
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,869
I guess we were more or less done.
But that surprised me.

496
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,708
Since you're here, let's have lunch.

497
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,336
You know Geumje's gochujang is famous,
right?

498
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,215
I'll take you out
for pork sautéed in gochujang.

499
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,219
I already had lunch.

500
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,554
But it's not even 11 a.m.

501
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,556
I have early lunches.

502
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,434
Tomorrow's my first day of work,
so I'll head home now.

503
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,019
Take care.

504
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,564
Damn.

505
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,862
He just lied to us
to get out of lunch, right?

506
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:24,200
You can tell he doesn't want
to spend time with us.

507
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,451
GEUMJE POLICE STATION

508
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,079
SAFE CITIZENS!
GEUMJE, A NICE TOWN TO LIVE IN

509
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:44,720
AERIAL VIEW OF GEUMJE-GUN

510
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,144
A new experience? Fun?

511
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,984
Is she saying I look bored?

512
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,322
There.

513
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,459
I hope he comes before it gets cold.

514
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,429
Ding!

515
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,849
Ding!

516
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,563
-Sit down. Sit!
-Okay.

517
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,409
Why did you turn the lights off?
I wasn't even home yet.

518
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,211
Are you sleeping or just pretending to?

519
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,143
It's hot. I almost burned my hand.

520
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,396
Wake up, honey.

521
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,899
Open your eyes. I know you're awake.

522
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,737
I just met with Chairman Eom.

523
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,575
Why didn't you call to say you'd be late?
I'd had dinner ready.

524
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,244
That's not important right now.

525
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:38,292
Today, it was as if we were
about to seal the deal.

526
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,132
Even if he's a huge pain in the ass,
it's worth keeping Dae-geun around.

527
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,469
That's great.

528
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,846
Why so cold?

529
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,391
Am I wrong?

530
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:58,396
I'm always trying hard,
and you don't seem to care.

531
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,774
-What?
-You could've supported me a little.

532
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,485
If you'd gotten close
with Chairman Eom's wife

533
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,154
and smoothed the way, it would've helped.

534
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,199
But you built walls, keeping everyone out.

535
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,744
I'm the only one begging, pleading
and fighting the fight alone.

536
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:20,209
You used to say I was better
than the gossips wagging their tongues.

537
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,546
And now you talk back to me?

538
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:29,718
If the times are changing,
you have to adapt.

539
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,471
It'd be great if you were
a modern, liberal woman

540
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,226
who goes out
and finds hobbies to do with friends.

541
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,771
It's too bad.

542
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,235
Anyway, I'm going to wash up.

543
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,654
Make me some honey tea.

544
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,950
The house is too freaking clean.

545
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,202
Is cleaning your only passion?

546
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,172
"Adapt"?

547
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,257
"Find a hobby"?

548
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,801
"A modern woman"?

549
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:25,524
Seong-su knocked all three flat
for harassing Jeong-suk.

550
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,944
It was four of them, including Chang-sik.

551
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,571
You're right.

552
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,114
What is this?

553
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,159
You only ever talk about
when you were the Three Musketeers.

554
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,162
Talk about something I know

555
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,748
so high school transfers
won't feel left out.

556
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,249
Right, Jeong-suk?

557
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,795
Hey, Han Jeong-suk!

558
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,591
What?

559
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,676
Don't worry, Jeong-suk.

560
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,346
I've asked a bunch
of places to hire Seong-su.

561
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,477
I'm not worried.

562
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,896
I'm sure he'll figure it out.

563
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:09,985
What?

564
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,445
-Let me get that.
-Yeah.

565
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,449
Drink up, buddy.

566
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,663
Hello?

567
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,289
It's me.

568
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,291
I'll get straight to the point.

569
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,087
About the home sales thing,

570
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,090
let's do it at my house.

571
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,716
Pardon?

572
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,097
Are you sure?

573
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:43,811
As you know, I don't know
a lot of people, but I'll ask around.

574
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,941
Thank you so much.

575
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,152
I know this was a hard decision.

576
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,115
-I…
-Honey!

577
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,578
We're out of face soap!

578
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,914
I'll get you some.

579
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:25,561
CHARMING HAIR SALON

580
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,820
Welcome.

581
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,995
You must be new here.

582
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,955
You can sit here.

583
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,832
All right.

584
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,928
What style do you want?

585
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,348
I'm not sure.

586
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,100
I don't have anything in mind.

587
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,937
Could you recommend something?
I have a meeting tonight.

588
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,023
I see.

589
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:14,777
If you tell me what kind of meeting it is,
it'll help me pick out a style.

590
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:22,076
My friend is selling lingerie
at a sales event at my house.

591
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,994
That sounds fun.

592
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,954
Can I come too?

593
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:26,872
Would you?

594
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,708
For us, the more the merrier.

595
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,168
That's an okay from you!

596
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:35,547
There's a perm that would be perfect.
Shall I?

597
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,759
Yes, please.

598
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,391
Ms. Lee.

599
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,893
-Welcome.
-Hello.

600
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,397
Well, now.

601
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,067
It's been long since I got my hair done.

602
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,781
Look who it is.
Fancy seeing you here, Geum-hui.

603
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,617
Do you know each other?

604
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:09,331
My husband is the Royal Club chairman.

605
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:15,003
Her husband is
one of the countless club members.

606
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,757
What are you doing to your hair?

607
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,510
A perm.

608
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,011
You? Geum-hui?

609
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,763
That's unexpected.

610
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,473
Why?

611
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,725
Are you copying me?

612
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,185
Excuse me?

613
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,397
This perm only looks good

614
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,857
because it's on me.

615
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,318
If you just copy me blindly,

616
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,905
it will look very different,
so you'll get disappointed.

617
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:51,415
Since you two know each other,
you should come to her house tonight too.

618
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,041
She's hosting a lingerie sale.

619
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,461
-No, but that's--
-Lingerie?

620
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,296
That's too bad.

621
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,257
My daughter's coming from Seoul
and I have errands to run.

622
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,092
I'm just too busy.

623
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,512
Really? What a shame.

624
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,849
Can you touch up this part?

625
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,380
-What happened?
-Tell me everything.

626
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,924
I'm finally going to sell.

627
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,636
What is it? Spill it!

628
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,429
So, what happened with Hyeon-su?

629
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,264
I'll see him.

630
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,350
You'll be dating? No way!

631
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,561
-Must be nice to be young.
-Weren't you dating Yeong-man?

632
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,896
-No.
-Yeong-man?

633
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,874
Just a moment, sir!

634
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,544
Ma'am.

635
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,212
It's so heavy.

636
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,713
Be careful.

637
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,340
-Thank you.
-Just a moment!

638
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,800
Here, sit down.

639
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,843
-Are you getting off or what?
-Yes, I am!

640
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,221
-The bus is leaving.
-I'm getting off!

641
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,223
-Thank you.
-No problem.

642
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,112
Wait, no!

643
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,863
Stop!

644
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,240
Sir!

645
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:52,911
What am I going to do?

646
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,248
Excuse me!

647
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,000
Excuse me!

648
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,210
Excuse me!

649
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,838
I left something on that bus.

650
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,673
It's very important to me.

651
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,719
I'm sorry, I'm busy. As you can see--

652
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,470
Please help me!

653
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:14,391
It's my last hope. Please!

654
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,517
What should I do?

655
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,687
Please! Help me!

656
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,368
Gosh.

657
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,299
-That bus?
-Yes.

658
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,634
My goodness.

659
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,236
Mister!

660
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,697
I'm sorry.

661
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,282
I'm so sorry.

662
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,576
I'm sorry! Thank you!

663
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,883
I found it!

664
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,903
What the heck?

665
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,072
What is happening to me?

666
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,742
Oh, dear.

667
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,828
What's this?

668
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,383
So, this is your last hope?

669
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,724
Yes.

670
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,394
I don't have time to explain.

671
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,607
But yes, this is my last hope.

672
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,193
Anyway, thank you so much.

673
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:31,945
Thank you!

674
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,030
Thank you so much!

675
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,991
Thanks!

676
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,329
Simple country folk, huh?

677
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,797
Jeong-suk.

678
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,467
I'm so sorry I'm late.

679
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,968
That's not the issue here.

680
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,262
She said she wasn't coming,

681
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,556
but the club chairman's wife came.

682
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,808
-What?
-It's pretty.

683
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:06,772
Well, this house is
smaller than I thought.

684
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,650
-Yes, it's small.
-Look at this.

685
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:14,237
Seo-yeon is here too.
We went to the same school.

686
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,741
Is her daughter
that's visiting from Seoul your friend?

687
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,621
We're obviously doomed
now that she's here.

688
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,584
Can we just stick to underwear for today?

689
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,714
If we're going to do it,
we have to go all the way.

690
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,634
I practiced a lot last night.

691
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,386
I'll explain well
so they don't feel uncomfortable.

692
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,764
Don't worry too much.

693
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,309
Jeong-suk.

694
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,187
Your hands are trembling.

695
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,105
What's wrong with me?

696
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,531
There's only Wangbangul Underwear
in this town.

697
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,116
-American lingerie! I can't wait.
-Me too.

698
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,035
When are we getting started?

699
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,328
Beats me.

700
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,206
She had us all come
and is wasting our time now.

701
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,542
They're coming soon.

702
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,377
-Shall we?
-Yes.

703
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,108
It's delicious.

704
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,863
Sorry. Just a sec.

705
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,365
Is that you, Jeong-suk?

706
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,160
Hi, Seo-yeon.

707
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:49,374
So you're the one selling underwear?

708
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,922
What an unexpected twist
for someone as proper as you.

709
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,050
Proper people still wear underwear.

710
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,220
I'm sure she's here
to sell underwear as proper as she is.

711
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,225
Fine. Let's take a look
at some very proper undies then.

712
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,476
-Yes, let's go.
-Right.

713
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,020
Quick, show us!

714
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,354
That's right. Go ahead!

715
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,024
-Yes, let's see them.
-Yes.

716
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,400
Let's take a look.

717
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,651
All right.

718
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,328
-What?
-What are those?

719
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,805
-What is all this?
-What?

720
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,392
Heavens! What is all this?

721
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,979
I was going to buy panties
to cover up my belly fat.

722
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,566
This is entirely see-through,
like a mosquito net.

723
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,444
-When would you wear this?
-What the…

724
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:03,156
It's always the quiet ones
who are the wildest.

725
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:07,285
She's never even laughed at a dirty joke,
but she's selling this stuff?

726
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,665
This is pretty!

727
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,209
-So she sells necklaces too?
-It's pretty.

728
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,544
-A necklace.
-Is this how you wear it?

729
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,505
That looks nice.

730
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,215
That's not a necklace.

731
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,800
What?

732
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,427
It's underwear.

733
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,388
-What?
-What?

734
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,473
-Heavens!
-Oh, my!

735
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,809
If this is a pair of panties…

736
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:33,728
Wait. Which side is the front?

737
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,814
Yes, that's the front.

738
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,816
My word.

739
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,234
Wait a minute.

740
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:43,571
This one must be defective.

741
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,574
The seams are missing from the bottom.

742
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,951
Right.

743
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,453
That's how it's supposed to be.

744
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,331
There's supposed to be no bottom?

745
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,876
But why?

746
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,212
That's…

747
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,301
How should I put this?

748
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,932
Well, you know

749
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,686
there are some stores
keeping their doors wide open?

750
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,312
Why do you think they do that?

751
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:20,942
Because it's a pain
to open the door every time.

752
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,236
It's for people to get in and out easily.

753
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,822
That's exactly it! Easy access.

754
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,491
Easy access for what?

755
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,452
You know, the thing.

756
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,996
The thing…

757
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,540
This is insane.

758
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,833
My gosh.

759
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,419
Am I dreaming right now?

760
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,421
What the hell is going on?

761
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,258
I'm so shocked. My heart.

762
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,344
I understand that you must be shocked.

763
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,388
I was shocked at first too.

764
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,931
-But--
-Geum-hui.

765
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,226
Did you know about this?

766
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,436
You didn't know, right?

767
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,730
You were conned by that woman, right?

768
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:05,153
You're not the kind of woman
to be tempted by such vulgar things.

769
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:09,032
I majored
in English literature in college.

770
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:13,995
Why is she bringing up college
all of a sudden?

771
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,915
It's not like the rest of us didn't go.

772
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,541
Mom, you never went.

773
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,793
Shush.

774
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,377
That's not what I mean.

775
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:25,256
Maybe it's because I consumed
so many books and movies in English.

776
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,217
I wasn't very shocked by this.

777
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,303
I'm just not that uptight.

778
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:36,851
These days, there are many movies
that turned eroticism to art.

779
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,395
Like Lady Chatterley's Lover.

780
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,147
Right.

781
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,483
The Lady Chattering thing.

782
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,360
-Oh, right.
-Right.

783
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:50,073
I guess that's in style at the moment.

784
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,368
I'm sure those of you
who don't read novels or watch movies

785
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,246
might've been a little shocked.

786
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,418
-I didn't think of that.
-True.

787
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:06,756
CHILI PEPPER

788
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,634
What? You gave Seung-tak
money for an investment?

789
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,053
Why would you trust him?

790
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,973
His father's the head of the town.

791
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,183
You really think he'd scam me?

792
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,853
It doesn't matter if his dad
or his granddad is town chief.

793
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,231
He was kicked out of his family long ago.

794
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,651
Why didn't you ask me first?

795
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,111
So, what?

796
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,656
It's not like we know
how it will turn out.

797
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:35,994
You're impossible.

798
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:46,045
This is fun, but there's not much variety.

799
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,714
Is this all you have?

800
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:52,552
I mean, I don't really see
anything I want to buy.

801
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:57,223
I have products I haven't shown you yet.

802
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,977
This is the main event.

803
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,065
There's nothing in my size.

804
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,276
-That's the thing.
-It has to fit perfectly.

805
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,611
-Right.
-I agree.

806
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,821
There aren't enough sizes.

807
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,907
What if it was made wrong?

808
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,117
This is it.

809
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,705
What is that?

810
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,290
Is it a mic?

811
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,167
But there's no cord.

812
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,462
It's a pestle to grind garlic.

813
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,923
-I see.
-So that's it.

814
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,761
That's not what it is.
It's like a kind of massager.

815
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:39,724
You press it against your face
and massage it like this?

816
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,809
-That exists.
-I've seen that before.

817
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,978
It's not for your face.

818
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,480
Then what is it for?

819
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,524
So it's for the shoulders.

820
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,026
-Right.
-That must be it.

821
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,696
What is it? Tell us!

822
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,366
Why won't they say it out loud?

823
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,576
-What?
-Why? What is it?

824
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,996
-What is it? What?
-That gave me a heart attack.

825
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,749
What did you say?

826
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,251
Put that away right now!

827
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,212
-Gosh!
-Oh, my!

828
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:19,430
What a bizarre-looking thing.

829
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,641
What does this do?

830
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,102
-My goodness!
-Heavens!

831
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,740
Why did you give it to me?

832
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,667
My goodness.

833
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,339
You must all be shocked.

834
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,983
I told you to just leave it.

835
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,736
Of course, I should clean up.

836
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:18,823
We didn't sell anything.
What will we do with all those things?

837
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,538
Jeong-suk.

838
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,082
That machine…

839
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,919
-I'll take one.
-What?

840
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,507
You will?

841
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,634
Yes.

842
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,761
That's great!

843
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,181
I'm so torn.

844
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,016
Which one looks better on me?

845
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,435
This one's cute sexy.

846
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:50,730
This is more spicy sexy.

847
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,359
To go with your vibe…

848
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,989
Who's that? It's not time
for my husband to come home yet.

849
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,911
Who is it?

850
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,704
This is the police.

851
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,915
The police?

852
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,467
Hello.

853
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,220
I'm Kim Do-hyeon, a new detective here.

854
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,182
-Are you the owner of this house?
-Yes, I am.

855
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:31,521
-Well…
-We got a report that this is a brothel.

856
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,232
That's outrageous!

857
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,610
-Hey.
-Hey.

858
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,071
You're a police officer?

859
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,698
You two know each other?

860
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,492
No, but earlier today--

861
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,744
Brothel? That's ridiculous!

862
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:47,912
That's right.

863
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,081
Who filed such an absurd complaint?

864
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,834
It must be my mother.

865
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,169
There are only women here.

866
01:01:55,253 --> 01:02:00,091
We got a report that you were using
lewd tools to engage in prostitution.

867
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:02,218
We'll examine the scene first.

868
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,513
If there's no problem,
continue with your business.

869
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,434
What's wrong with you?

870
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,894
I'll just take a look.

871
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,188
Excuse me, sir.

872
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,026
-Let's see.
-Sir…

873
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,154
-Well…
-Open the door.

874
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,197
Here, come in.

875
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,741
Just a quick look around.

876
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,869
There's nothing here.

877
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,120
Let's see.

878
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,709
This is a little suggestive.

879
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:39,547
It was just a group of women here
for an underwear sale.

880
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,508
I don't think anything here
is problematic.

881
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,762
That's for us to judge.

882
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:49,098
Detective Kim, look closely
to see if anything here's problematic.

883
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:50,641
Yes, sir.

884
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,560
Nothing here would be a problem.

885
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:57,982
What's wrong?

886
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:02,445
It looks like someone's in that room.

887
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:03,946
What?

888
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,950
Freeze!

889
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,537
Who the hell are you?

890
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,997
I'm a police officer!

891
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,124
I'm so very sorry!

892
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:33,059
So there's nothing else?

893
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,143
No.

894
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,103
All right.

895
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:39,524
You didn't find
anything problematic, did you?

896
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,569
I did not.

897
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,947
Then let's go.

898
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,074
-Thank you.
-No problem.

899
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,576
Thank you for your service.

900
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,377
But where did all the vibrators go?

901
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,170
-They're gone?
-They're gone.

902
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,589
They're right here!

903
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,473
My goodness.

904
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,642
Wasn't this clever of me?

905
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:19,021
I didn't think much good
would come out of the police seeing these.

906
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,232
Thank you!

907
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,789
What are you all doing?

908
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,750
Get the hell out of my house!

909
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,630
What a night. What the heck was that?

910
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,341
This is where respectable people live.

911
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,845
Those were some strange women.

912
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,061
-Cheers.
-You too.

913
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,611
-You should have another.
-Sure.

914
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,866
How's the investment coming along?

915
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:15,036
Don't worry about it. Trust me!

916
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,246
Of course. Let's drink.

917
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,000
My goodness.

918
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,211
So the pharmacist's housekeeper
was selling adult toys?

919
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,171
Yes!

920
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:30,676
My wife told me
they had really lewd lingerie

921
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,723
and weird machine-like things.

922
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,100
You hear that? What a sexy woman.

923
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,646
I want to play around with her,
whoever she is.

924
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:42,772
What?

925
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,774
You think that woman only sells toys?

926
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,233
Surely sex too.

927
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,779
What did you just say?

928
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,113
What?

929
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,452
Ass.

930
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,321
Did Mom leave?

931
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,740
What about Min-ho?

932
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,075
You really want to know?

933
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:39,578
I thought you only cared
about your sex meetings.

934
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:44,875
I heard

935
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:47,962
about what you've been up to.

936
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,800
I'm sorry for not telling you.

937
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,428
I know you hate that stuff.

938
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,140
But, honey,

939
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,269
this is just me running a business.

940
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,520
If I work hard--

941
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,604
"A business"?

942
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,315
What kind of business?

943
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,360
Is prostitution a business?

944
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,619
How can you say that?

945
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,620
I told you…

946
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,167
not to do it.

947
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,629
Am I a joke to you?

948
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:33,841
Damn.

949
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,386
Is it because I'm unemployed?

950
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,266
I can't deny that

951
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,977
after you were fired,

952
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,148
you drove me to the edge
when you spent our rent.

953
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,443
I had to do something.

954
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,905
So what people say is true.

955
01:07:57,698 --> 01:08:01,702
A lot of people say
your life's been ruined because of me.

956
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,331
Fine.

957
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:07,792
I'll get the hell out.

958
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,919
Better late than never.

959
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,372
What a disgrace.

960
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,375
How could you allow
such things in my house?

961
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,043
-Your house?
-Then is it yours?

962
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,548
Quit the silly behavior.

963
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,675
Your hair, that ruckus yesterday,

964
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,594
you're getting in trouble
by acting so out of character.

965
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:05,808
Gosh.

966
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:13,274
I thought you wanted me
to be an adventurous, modern woman?

967
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,620
What? Why don't you eat more?

968
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:28,706
I'm not hungry.

969
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,129
Jeong-suk hasn't called once.

970
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,797
She must know you're here.

971
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,968
She should be
begging for your forgiveness.

972
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,720
How dare she?

973
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:44,597
Stop it.

974
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,475
-I'm going to sleep.
-Okay.

975
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:50,477
Get some rest.

976
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,319
He didn't even touch his food.

977
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,737
Why are you only on his side?

978
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,865
You're closer with Jeong-suk.

979
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,742
That's why I'm angrier.

980
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:08,287
How did she get into something so vulgar?

981
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,747
Don't meddle.

982
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:14,001
They'll resolve their issue on their own.

983
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,464
I'm off to work, honey.

984
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,381
Okay.

985
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,260
-Drive safe, okay?
-Okay.

986
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,679
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

987
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,433
Here.

988
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:34,063
You couldn't take your things
because of my husband.

989
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,067
Thank you so much, and I'm sorry too.

990
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:43,864
And this too.

991
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,372
This looks like too much.

992
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:57,044
I'm buying this, so I added some money.

993
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:58,963
-You are?
-Yes.

994
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,841
I've been drawn to this
since I saw it yesterday.

995
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,885
I didn't want to do anything unlike me.

996
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:09,598
But the moment my husband told me
not to act out of character,

997
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,851
I wanted to act so out of character.

998
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,065
Darling, you're pretty cute.

999
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,610
I'm too old for you to call me "darling."

1000
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,028
Why?

1001
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,489
You're too uptight
for someone wearing this.

1002
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:27,032
In the US, where this is from,

1003
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,536
people call each other by name
even with a 60-year age gap. Geum-hui?

1004
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:31,996
My goodness.

1005
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:32,639
In-tae?

1006
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,230
Mi-hwa?

1007
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:48,697
In-tae.

1008
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:55,954
Mi-hwa.

1009
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,292
Mi-hwa.

1010
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:08,467
Oh, gosh.

1011
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,507
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

1012
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:00,352
SPECIAL THANKS TO RA MI-RAN

1013
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:12,614
Who's the prettiest woman
in the world to your husband?

1014
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,908
It's any woman who's not his wife.

1015
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,535
And before you know it,

1016
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,163
he'll start having an affair.

1017
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,665
Maybe they're birds of a feather.

1018
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:24,334
The rumors say she got into a huge fight
with her husband

1019
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,044
for selling terribly lewd adult products.

1020
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,589
The husband left her right after.

1021
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:32,092
Hey! She's looking for a place
where she can sell her products.

1022
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,011
No way!

1023
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:38,432
Neither of us are interested
in that kind of lewd stuff anyway.

1024
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,143
I've made up my mind.

1025
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,103
I want to take up this work.

1026
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,063
-Isn't this too secluded?
-No, I love it.

1027
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,773
I wanted to observe.

1028
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:55,407
