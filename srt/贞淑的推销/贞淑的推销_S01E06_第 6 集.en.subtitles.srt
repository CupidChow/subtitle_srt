1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,040
Says who?

3
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,500
My mom told me.

4
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,086
Jeong-suk, your dad got himself a mistress

5
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,630
and kicked you and your mom out.

6
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,466
We didn't get kicked out!

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,189
Hey, Kwon Seong-su!
What do you think you're doing?

8
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,816
You'd better not mock Jeong-suk again.

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,777
I'll knock out three teeth with one punch!

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,244
Let's go.

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,220
I was comfortable with the sadness
I didn't have to explain.

12
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,033
He was always on edge,

13
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,954
but he was gentle toward me,
and I liked it.

14
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,293
I felt like I'd be able to laugh off
any hardships if we were together.

15
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,925
Back then,

16
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,761
what brought me happiness was…

17
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,222
Happy birthday, dear Min-ho

18
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,267
-…being together and nothing else.
-Happy birthday to you

19
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,445
I've never imagined an end like this.

20
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,497
DIVORCE BY MUTUAL CONSENT

21
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,833
KWON SEONG-SU, HAN JEONG-SUK

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,626
How does it feel?

23
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,587
Are you ecstatic?

24
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,347
Even though we have a child together,

25
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,226
you seemed hell-bent
on getting a divorce, so I signed it.

26
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,354
I'm certain that you'll regret it.

27
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,150
What?

28
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,277
You may not know now,

29
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,071
but being without a husband
isn't as easy as you think.

30
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,366
That's why your mother
didn't finalize her divorce

31
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,119
despite suffering many heartaches.

32
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,663
She said she regrets it.

33
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,667
-What?
-She regrets not ending the marriage.

34
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,961
I won't repeat her mistake.

35
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,967
Fine, let's see
what an amazing life you'll have.

36
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,012
Cooperate whenever I want to see Min-ho.

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,433
That was the only reason
why I gave you custody.

38
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,647
But one thing is certain.

39
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,900
Now…

40
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,904
I won't look back.

41
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,873
Jeong-suk must be so upset.

42
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,378
Is there anything we can do for her?

43
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,297
Perhaps a gift will console her.

44
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,676
Shall we introduce her to a man?

45
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,977
They say you heal
the wounds of past love with new love.

46
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,271
She got a divorce this morning.

47
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,981
Do you think she'll be happy

48
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,108
if we introduce her to a man?

49
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,654
How is it any different than feeding meat
to someone with sudden indigestion?

50
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,782
-I was just saying.
-Okay.

51
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,576
No gift will console her
in this situation.

52
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,662
Only time will help.

53
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:52,000
She should see nice things
and eat nice food while she takes a rest.

54
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,584
You're right.

55
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,422
It'd be nice if she could go on a trip
to get some fresh air.

56
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,924
I don't think she will be able to do that.

57
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,805
We should just help her
so that she's not too stressed at work.

58
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:10,351
All right. Let's work harder
to relieve Jeong-suk's burden.

59
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,602
Okay.

60
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,732
Didn't the director want to
talk about something today?

61
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,817
That's right. That was why we met up.

62
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,319
We must be running late.

63
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,571
We were going to go
and update Jeong-suk afterward.

64
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,698
-Gosh, let's go.
-We're running late.

65
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,742
-Thanks for the coffee.
-Bye.

66
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,165
I feel anxious.

67
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,668
FANTASY LINGERIE
CONFIDENT WOMEN'S FIRST STEP

68
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,299
You're here.

69
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,969
Jeong-suk, when did you get here?
You must be upset.

70
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,637
Seriously.

71
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,390
-We could've updated you afterward.
-That's right.

72
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,478
I need to do my best to earn money.
I've already lost a lot of time.

73
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,189
Is everyone here?

74
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,816
I called you guys over to ask for a favor.

75
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,028
I have an in-home sale scheduled
for tomorrow, but something came up.

76
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,447
I wondered if you could go instead.

77
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,159
If we go instead,
how will the profits be divided?

78
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,120
Of course, the people
who made the profits will take them.

79
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,998
Where is it?

80
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,959
It's an island in Gyeongsang-do
called Gyesim-do.

81
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,629
It'll take four hours to get there.

82
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,840
Yes. It'll be an overnight trip
at the very least.

83
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,968
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

84
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,224
An overnight trip is a bit too sudden.

85
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,393
Well, I still think

86
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,479
it'll be nice to go.

87
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,023
It's hard to get opportunities
to sell the products.

88
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:43,569
We just need to go and make sales,
so I think it's an important opportunity.

89
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,573
That's right, Yeong-bok.
Let's go together.

90
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,952
Let's work and get some fresh air
as if we're on a trip.

91
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,163
We'll be able to refresh ourselves.

92
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,457
I see. Okay then.

93
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,292
I don't know how to feel about it,

94
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,586
but I have a jobless husband
to look after the kids.

95
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,587
That's good to hear.

96
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,131
Let's go to Gyesim-do.

97
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,675
We're going to an island!

98
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,495
GEUMJE LIBRARY

99
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,788
An island?

100
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,709
Yes. I'm going to Gyesim-do tomorrow
to sell products.

101
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,920
It's my first time going there,
so I want to gather information.

102
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,756
What brings you here?

103
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,051
There's a document I wanted to check.

104
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,558
By the way,

105
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,519
would you come to my place tomorrow?

106
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,271
What?

107
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,816
You said that you were
looking for something in the town.

108
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,862
My mom has lived in the town
for over 30 years.

109
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,032
She might be able to help.

110
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,909
Oh, that.

111
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,953
She wanted to repay you
for finding Min-ho.

112
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,165
Feel free to stop by.

113
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,586
I'll see you later, then.

114
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,484
GYESIM-DO

115
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,449
WONBONG PHARMACY

116
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,037
Oh, hello.

117
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,331
Oh, hello.

118
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,084
It looks like you're going somewhere.

119
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,047
I was going to visit
the hair salon for a haircut.

120
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,217
Oh, I see.

121
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,928
The thing is, I'm going to the countryside
for in-home sales.

122
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,514
I'll come back tomorrow afternoon.
Can you come tomorrow?

123
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,224
Of course, I can.

124
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,685
-Then make sure you come tomorrow!
-Okay.

125
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,526
She looks like Kim Wan-sun today.

126
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,199
If you're done sweeping, go back inside.

127
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,702
Mr. Choi.

128
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:26,042
If Kim Wan-sun and Shim Shin date, they'll
be the couple of the century, right?

129
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,133
Are Kim Wan-sun and Shim Shin dating?

130
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,719
Not yet.

131
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,847
But I think it'll happen soon.

132
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,229
Was there news on Entertainment Weekly?

133
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,858
Not Kim Wan-sun!

134
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:55,738
Hey, doesn't Kim Wan-sun
look better with Park Nam-jung?

135
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,699
TICKET OFFICE

136
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,411
Guys!

137
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,413
-There you are.
-She's here.

138
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,248
You look so pretty.

139
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,210
What's this?

140
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,505
-Music is a must on the beach.
-I see.

141
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,675
-Where the stars shine
-Where the stars shine

142
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,178
-Let's go to the beach
-Let's go to the beach

143
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,181
-Where the youth overflows
-Excuse me, Yeong-bok.

144
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,266
-Ju-ri.
-Yes?

145
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,144
I get the excitement
but don't forget what's important.

146
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,938
-Right.
-Right.

147
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,356
There's work to be done,

148
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,693
but this is primarily a chance to refresh
Jeong-suk's mind after the big change.

149
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,945
Yes.

150
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,280
So let me ask you for a favor.

151
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,575
To keep Jeong-suk from having
any depressing thoughts,

152
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,037
don't mention marriage at all.

153
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,248
In particular, don't mention husbands.

154
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,499
I understand.

155
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,961
I don't have a husband,
so you don't need to worry.

156
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,796
-That's right.
-Yeah.

157
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,381
There she comes.

158
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,966
-Hey!
-Come on.

159
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,968
-Jeong-suk!
-I'm sorry I'm late.

160
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,220
-I'm sorry.
-No, we just got here.

161
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,305
-Okay.
-Let's go. Shall I carry your bag?

162
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,890
You don't need to.

163
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,725
This top is so pretty.

164
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,352
You look pretty too. Shall we?

165
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,270
Okay.

166
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,856
-Let's go.
-You look so pretty today.

167
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,501
Help yourself.

168
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,670
Okay.

169
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,469
Thank you for the drink.

170
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:47,349
I heard that there is something
you wanted to ask me.

171
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,186
Feel free to ask me anything.

172
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,608
I heard that you've lived in this town
for over 30 years.

173
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,984
That's right.

174
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,279
I've lived here
since before Jeong-suk was born,

175
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,575
so it must have been about 35 years.

176
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:10,664
I heard there was a fire near the town
about 30 years ago.

177
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,209
Do you remember anything about it?

178
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,002
A fire?

179
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:19,548
Yes, there were fires
on regular houses every several months.

180
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,176
Back then, we lived in houses
with thatched roofs

181
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,970
and burned firewood in furnaces.

182
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,932
So fires were quite frequent.

183
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:28,933
I see.

184
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,560
Please excuse me.

185
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,359
Hello, there.

186
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,363
What? Is he badly injured?

187
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,782
Why didn't you call me sooner?

188
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:49,036
Okay. Where is he?

189
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,289
Don't worry.
You take care of yourself, okay?

190
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,499
Okay.

191
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,794
Gosh, I can't believe it.

192
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,170
Did something happen?

193
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,050
My son runs a business at the market.

194
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:07,471
He injured his leg in a car accident
and was admitted to a hospital.

195
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,808
My daughter-in-law gave birth
not too long ago,

196
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,352
so I'll have to go to the hospital.

197
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,146
But I can't go with Min-ho.

198
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:21,360
Jeong-suk said that she'd leave early
tomorrow morning,

199
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,363
so I just need someone
to babysit him for tonight.

200
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,866
But I have no one to ask
on such short notice.

201
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,959
Well…

202
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,378
Sir.

203
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,551
I…

204
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,397
-Hello.
-Hello.

205
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

206
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,695
We're from Fantasy Lingerie.

207
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,822
Is this the president
of the Women's Club's place?

208
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,241
Yes, it is.

209
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,327
-I see. Hello.
-Hello.

210
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,371
See? They came.
Let's sit down and listen before we go.

211
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,957
We need to hurry and go
before the next tidal wave.

212
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,292
Hurry up and come on out.

213
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,377
Hurry up.

214
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,968
-Excuse me.
-But…

215
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,638
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,806
We set up an appointment with you,

217
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,809
but the president of the Women's Club
just won't cooperate.

218
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,020
In that case,

219
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,315
you can listen to us
during your break from work.

220
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,150
We'll help.

221
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,653
-That's right.
-We can do a good job.

222
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,280
I'm so sorry.

223
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,991
-It's okay.
-Don't worry about it.

224
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,409
No.

225
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,994
Honestly, no pressure.

226
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,914
No, this isn't the right direction.

227
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,084
The work clothes are over there,
so go ahead and change.

228
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,169
You can't work in those clothes.

229
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,338
-I see.
-I see.

230
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,756
-Okay.
-Sure.

231
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,342
-We'll hurry up and change.
-Yes.

232
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,719
-Hurry up and change.
-We'll do that.

233
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,762
My, your skirt is short.

234
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,888
Transformation!

235
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,724
Supernova Flashman!
Transformation complete!

236
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,725
Let's go!

237
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,820
Hold on.

238
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,281
What's wrong? Do you have a stomachache?

239
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,616
No. I'm…

240
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,368
What's wrong?

241
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,536
I'm hungry.

242
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,664
If it isn't too much trouble,
could you get me some food?

243
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,790
That's right!

244
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,502
Mom told me that she made the batter
for chives pancake.

245
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,088
All right. I'll go and make it.

246
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,297
Keep playing.

247
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,008
Yes! Chives pancake!

248
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,650
It got burned a bit
because it was my first time making it.

249
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,444
What?

250
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,030
It didn't get burned a bit,
but it's almost--

251
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,407
What matters is the taste.

252
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,000
How interesting.

253
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,627
What? Does it taste okay?

254
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,795
No.

255
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,257
The outside is completely burnt,
but the inside is uncooked.

256
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,384
It's so interesting.

257
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,139
You're right.

258
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,768
These are precious chives. What a waste.

259
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,024
Where's the telephone book?

260
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,901
Over there.

261
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:16,637
CHIVES MIN-HO AND MOM
PLANTED TOGETHER

262
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,974
They're actually precious.

263
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,687
Hey, isn't that police officer
a bit scary?

264
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,857
It's obvious he was
forced to look after us.

265
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,235
He's a bit scary

266
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,404
since he doesn't say much
and is expressionless.

267
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,572
My thoughts exactly.

268
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,122
Shall we play a round of gonggi?

269
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,040
That's a good idea, my friend.

270
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,879
May I play gonggi with you guys?

271
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,339
You?

272
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,301
Yes. But I don't know the rules very well
because it's my first time playing.

273
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,720
I'll give it a try
if you guys explain them to me.

274
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,891
This is how you do it.

275
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,272
-There are levels one to five.
-Yes.

276
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,150
Pick up one for level one,
two for level two,

277
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,611
three for level three,
and so on and so forth.

278
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,696
It's easy.

279
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,533
Fail!

280
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,702
You said using
the piano skill is cheating.

281
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,956
It's your turn.

282
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,884
Fail. Moving from your seat is cheating.

283
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,801
Right?

284
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,429
Most people let it go.

285
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,680
I don't.

286
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,308
Here I go.

287
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,444
You're really good.

288
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,820
You're seriously cool.

289
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,965
Twenty-four-year old.

290
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,383
Did you win again?

291
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,221
Hundred and twenty years old.

292
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,681
-I want to stop playing.
-Me too.

293
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,267
Let's go and play ddakji with the kids.

294
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,477
Okay.

295
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,438
Why? I'm having fun here.

296
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,401
Hey.

297
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,298
Gosh, you'll catch
all the clams on Gyesim-do.

298
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,009
You should take it easy.

299
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,429
We should fill the basket quickly
so we have time to introduce the products.

300
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,226
The scenery is so good
that I don't feel tired at all.

301
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,479
That's right. The scenery is nice indeed.

302
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,691
It's quiet and tranquil.

303
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,651
I feel at peace.

304
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,779
-Hey!
-That startled me.

305
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,031
What nonsense are you spouting?

306
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,201
Why are you saying
that my daughter is full of herself?

307
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,038
My daughter, Mi-yeong filmed
a commercial for Thirsty Hippo.

308
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,125
Gosh, wasn't Kim Hye-soo
in the commercial?

309
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,252
Did Mi-yeong take Kim Hye-soo's place?

310
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,962
Kim Hye-soo?

311
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,549
No, she put on a hippo costume
and stood next to Kim Hye-soo.

312
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,760
Still, being on TV is a feat.

313
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,178
It's just…

314
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,763
Shouldn't you break off the fight?

315
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,558
No. This happened
when I tried to break it off last week.

316
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,394
Do they fight often?

317
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,104
The president's son

318
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,065
and that woman's daughter,
Mi-yeong, were engaged.

319
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,068
But Mi-yeong moved to the city
to become an actor

320
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,611
and broke off the engagement.

321
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,657
The two of them used to be so close.

322
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,743
Now, they're the worst enemies.

323
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,870
They fight all the time.

324
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,832
Could it be that the president
rejected us on purpose?

325
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,960
-Tell me. You still hold a grudge…
-She invited us here.

326
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,171
…because Mi-yeong
rejected your son, right?

327
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,007
-Nonsense! I thank the heavens!
-I bet she does.

328
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,469
-Oh, my goodness.
-…promiscuous since childhood.

329
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,013
Let's see if she can find a nice man!

330
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,181
What did you say?

331
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,016
You think she can't find a nice man?

332
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,311
How dare you speak ill of my daughter?

333
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,064
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

334
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,691
Do you have a death wish?

335
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,944
-Hey!
-Let go of me!

336
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:43,987
Let go!

337
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,174
Ms. Oh! What should I do?

338
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,426
Oh, no. Ms. Oh, are you okay?

339
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,929
-Help me up.
-Oh, no.

340
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,722
-Help me up.
-My goodness!

341
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,184
-Gosh.
-Let go of me.

342
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,478
Let go of me. Move out of the way.

343
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,232
Damn you! Eat this!

344
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,694
What's this?

345
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,116
Come over here!

346
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,456
Gosh, it's cold!

347
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,750
You're stuck. What should we do?

348
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,169
-Hold on.
-Shall I pull it out? One, two…

349
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,587
It's too small!

350
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,550
-It's too cold!
-Yeong-bok!

351
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,970
-It's too cold!
-Hey!

352
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,472
-Help me.
-One, two, three.

353
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,350
It came off, Ms. Oh.

354
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,769
-My goodness.
-Oh, no. Are you okay?

355
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,105
-I'm not okay.
-Oh, no.

356
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,566
You brat, stop already!

357
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,402
You started it first!

358
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,535
You're the one who started it.

359
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,620
I can't believe these crazy women!

360
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,081
I give up.

361
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,416
What's wrong with them?

362
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,418
Please stop!

363
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,211
Stop it already!

364
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,839
Stop it!

365
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,134
Hold on. That's… No.

366
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,386
Oh, no. What?

367
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,975
-Oh, no.
-No!

368
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,473
I don't think we can sell these.

369
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,434
Of course, we can't.

370
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,687
How much money did we lose?

371
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,858
Why are you glaring at me?

372
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,027
Because it's your fault.

373
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,155
If you have a conscience,
you should pay for the products.

374
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,698
Why would I do that?

375
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,534
It's their fault
for bringing them to the mudflat.

376
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,036
I can't believe her!

377
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,121
Ju-ri, calm down.

378
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,542
Forget it.
I'm sick and tired of Gyesim-do.

379
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,544
Let's dry them and leave.

380
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,671
Okay.

381
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,256
-That's good enough.
-Okay.

382
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,600
What are you looking at?
Go prepare dinner.

383
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,520
-All right.
-Okay.

384
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,230
My goodness.

385
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,527
What? I thought
you guys only sold strange items.

386
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,821
Do you guys sell cosmetic products too?

387
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,656
Is that so?

388
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,076
I was out of facial cream.

389
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,369
That…

390
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,122
isn't for your face.

391
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,416
Then what is it for?

392
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,836
Vagina.

393
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,339
-Vagina?
-I see. Vagina.

394
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,675
Vagina?

395
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,719
Did she really say,

396
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,472
"vagina"?

397
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,643
What are you looking at?

398
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,188
Watch where you look!

399
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,689
When you're doing it,

400
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,276
this cream eliminates the pain
that comes from the friction.

401
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,489
Especially during menopause,
your estrogen levels drop,

402
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:41,284
and your vagina becomes dry.
That's why this cream helps.

403
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,664
So there was a reason behind the dryness.

404
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,749
Seriously.

405
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:52,087
By the way, does it really help?

406
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,588
Of course.

407
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,386
If you're curious,
we can give a detailed explanation.

408
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,096
There are materials we prepared.

409
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,598
I think it'd be nice

410
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,684
if you listened to the explanation
comfortably during dinner.

411
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,685
That's right.

412
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,106
Their products got ruined because of you.

413
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,317
If you can't pay for the damage,
at least listen to them!

414
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,694
I'm so sick of your complaints.

415
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,447
Fine.

416
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,741
You keep pestering me,

417
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,910
so I'll listen to them
and get this over with.

418
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,078
Go ahead.

419
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,664
-Go ahead and explain everything.
-My goodness.

420
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,417
-Okay.
-Please wait.

421
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,210
Jeong-suk, what are you doing?

422
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,055
Dong-u.

423
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,433
We need to go to the bathhouse. Come on.

424
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,602
Man, I don't want to take a bath.

425
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,648
Kwon Min-ho, cheer up.

426
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,900
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

427
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,027
-Bye.
-Bye.

428
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,238
Hurry up.

429
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,740
All right.

430
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:11,750
Hey, did your mom and dad
really get a divorce?

431
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,168
What?

432
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:14,919
Yes.

433
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,212
Aren't you sad?

434
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,132
I'd keep crying.

435
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,760
Mom and Dad told me
that they love me all the same

436
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,012
even though they don't live together.

437
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,765
Don't pretend to be okay.

438
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,017
Aren't you the one who isn't okay?

439
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,687
You're picking a fight because you're mad
you lost your ddakji to me.

440
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,317
How dare you?

441
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,568
-Hey!
-What?

442
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,029
Call your mom if you're mad.

443
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,656
I'll call both my mom and dad.

444
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,409
Right.

445
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,745
Your mom's gone away to work.

446
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,664
That means no one is on your side.

447
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,333
I am.

448
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,215
Police officer.

449
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,341
Police?

450
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,642
Mister, how do you know him?

451
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,646
Since I haven't seen you before,
you can't be a relative.

452
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,107
What about you?

453
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,152
Since you're bullying him,
you can't be a friend.

454
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,988
I didn't bully him.

455
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,161
Let's go.

456
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,997
Okay.

457
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,201
Isn't Mom pretty?

458
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,161
Yes.

459
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:20,545
She won an award because she was
the prettiest woman in Geumje.

460
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,005
I see.

461
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,134
You must be proud.

462
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,763
I see you're handsome
because you take after your mom.

463
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,517
-Let's go.
-Okay.

464
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,691
Lie down.

465
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,904
I'll turn off the light.

466
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,494
Would you turn that on?

467
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,041
Okay.

468
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,594
You also sleep with a lamp on.

469
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,264
Yes. Mom turns on the lamp
and reads me a book.

470
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:19,979
I wasn't asking you to read me a book.

471
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,575
Thank you, mister.

472
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,955
If it weren't for you earlier,

473
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,790
it would have become a bigger fight.

474
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,212
-Were you scared?
-No, I wasn't.

475
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,592
Had the fight turned bigger,
Mom would have found out.

476
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,096
Finding out the reason behind the fight

477
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,806
would have made her sad.

478
00:32:56,557 --> 00:33:00,561
I don't want Mom to be sad anymore.

479
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,731
Speaking of that,

480
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:08,069
would you keep today's incident a secret?

481
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,280
Okay, I'll do that.

482
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,420
"Once upon a time, deep in the sea,

483
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,797
there was a beautiful castle.

484
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,219
It was an amazing castle that was made

485
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,346
of conches, pearls, and corals."

486
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,280
-Jeong-suk!
-Jeong-suk!

487
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,202
What are you doing alone?

488
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,621
I was looking at the sea.

489
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,249
Come on. We like the sea too.

490
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,917
We should enjoy it together.

491
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,754
That's right. And they say

492
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,256
you shouldn't enjoy the sea sober.

493
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,885
-Is there such a saying?
-Isn't there?

494
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:17,221
I don't care either way.
I'm going to drink myself to death.

495
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,433
-Let's go.
-Jeong-suk, I'll save you.

496
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,559
No!

497
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,395
-It's tasty.
-It's really good.

498
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,986
Jeong-suk, you're drinking a lot today.

499
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,614
Today drinks taste sweet.

500
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:39,035
It must be because the work went well
and you're feeling at ease.

501
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,664
I was so upset earlier.

502
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,878
We almost lost a chance to make money
and got our products dirty at the mudflat.

503
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,174
Thank goodness they warmed up to us.

504
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,259
-Seriously.
-That's right.

505
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,845
To celebrate the occasion,

506
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,889
we should open up as well

507
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,016
and play Truth or Dare.

508
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,770
-There was something I wanted to know.
-What is it?

509
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:12,568
What kind of sex do you want to have?

510
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:16,572
What do you think will turn you on?

511
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,953
Are you asking us about
the sex fantasy from the survey?

512
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,621
Bingo.

513
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:28,292
We keep telling people to be honest,

514
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,670
but we should be honest first.

515
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,339
What's the desire in your heart?

516
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,425
I do have one.

517
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,178
Gosh, what is it?

518
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,721
-Come on.
-I can't tell you.

519
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,475
-I can't tell you!
-Come on.

520
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,227
Oh, goodness.

521
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,478
Come closer.

522
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,023
You know,

523
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,110
I want to try doing it in the car.

524
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,028
The car?

525
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:56,988
Yes.

526
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,322
In the car?

527
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,827
Ms. Oh, owning a car
is a symbol of wealth.

528
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,037
People like me can't dream of it.

529
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,457
That must be why I want to do it.

530
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:13,045
In a movie I watched,

531
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,256
a couple did it in a car.

532
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,842
What movie was it?

533
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:22,847
If I do it in my car,

534
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,143
how good would it feel?
I would love to know.

535
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,309
Hurry up.

536
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,145
Take off your clothes.

537
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,853
Yeong-bok!

538
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,274
Why am I so embarrassed
when I didn't even do it?

539
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,110
It's not like I did it!

540
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,655
-Yeong-bok!
-Hurry up and tell me yours.

541
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,864
What's yours?

542
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,241
-As for me…
-Okay.

543
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,285
…the location doesn't matter.

544
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,955
Is might be because I'm self-conscious
about being uneducated.

545
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,957
I want to sleep with an intelligent man

546
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,418
in an intelligent atmosphere.

547
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,504
-Intelligent?
-What kind of an atmosphere is that?

548
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,423
Well…

549
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,969
In any case, I want him to talk about
smart-sounding things.

550
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:29,015
I want him to speak English well.
I want to do it with that kind of guy.

551
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,516
I see.

552
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,728
Would it be something like this?

553
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,812
What?

554
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,157
-Honey.
-Yes?

555
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,701
How long will you keep kissing me?

556
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,953
I'll get a rash at this rate.

557
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,581
Ju-ri.

558
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,713
Have you heard that
the essence of joy is in the process?

559
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,381
Is there such a saying?

560
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,091
Who said it?

561
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,886
Shakespeare.

562
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,182
Sexspeare?

563
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,063
I don't know who it is,
but the name sounds erotic.

564
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,650
He's not Sexspeare,

565
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,363
but the world-renowned playwright,
William Shakespeare.

566
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,910
I know who he is.

567
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,120
It was a joke.

568
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,916
You should pronounce it as "joke."

569
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,042
Say, "joke."

570
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,381
Put more accent on the J. Joke.

571
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,808
Come on! I'm not that stupid!

572
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,850
She's that stupid.

573
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,894
You're so mean.

574
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,563
I was playing around.

575
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,190
Ms. Oh, it's your turn.

576
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,734
We can't skip you. What's yours?

577
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,693
-Me?
-Yes.

578
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,195
What is it?

579
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,822
I don't know.

580
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,742
I briefly entertained the idea

581
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,496
of doing it like the actress
in a movie I recently watched.

582
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,124
What kind of a movie was it?

583
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,129
Well…

584
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,307
Understood.

585
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,362
This way, please.

586
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,951
INTERVIEW ROOM

587
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,005
No smoking in the interview room.

588
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,138
What are you going to do,
charge me with smoking?

589
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,101
What was your relationship
with Kim Sam-cheol?

590
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,105
I had intercourse
with him on the odd occasion.

591
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,441
I liked doing it with him.

592
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,861
He wasn't afraid of experimenting.

593
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,533
I like men like that.
Men who give me pleasure.

594
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,790
In that case,

595
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,043
why did you kill Kim Sam-cheol?

596
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,669
Kill him?

597
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,131
I may have pleased him to death…

598
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,676
but I didn't kill him.

599
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,970
You're lying!

600
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,722
We have evidence right here!

601
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,706
Changing legs like this?

602
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,041
-Ms. Oh.
-No.

603
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,876
Ms. Oh.

604
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,381
I just wanted to create
a risqué atmosphere like that.

605
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,423
-Jeong-suk.
-Yes?

606
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,967
What's your fantasy?

607
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,343
What is it?

608
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,513
Well, as for me…

609
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,682
I don't have one.

610
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,808
Come on.

611
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,561
-Jeong-suk.
-What's wrong with you?

612
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,482
My ex-husband didn't like it

613
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,068
when a woman was assertive in the bedroom.

614
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,154
So I became used to going along
with what he did.

615
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,074
Now,

616
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,661
I plan to think about what I want.

617
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,790
You can take your time and think about it.

618
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,333
You think I would say that?

619
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,793
Forget it!

620
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,838
If you don't have an idea,
pick one of ours.

621
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,298
-Hurry up.
-That's right.

622
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,425
We can't be the only ones to reveal.

623
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,801
Number one, car sex.

624
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,095
Number two, intelligent sex.

625
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,639
Number three, risqué sex.

626
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,849
She's drunk.

627
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,269
Among them, what's your choice?

628
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,814
I think the best one is this.

629
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,859
Number three.

630
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,902
Number three.

631
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,448
I see that Jeong-suk is
a fan of risqué sex.

632
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,867
-A fan?
-Seriously.

633
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,243
That's right.

634
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:47,124
You're so dirty,
so you have a desire to toy with men.

635
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,251
-Ju-ri.
-That makes sense.

636
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,504
With this face and body,
she can be the femme fatale.

637
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,633
-Of course.
-That's right.

638
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,676
Sure. You're right.

639
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,388
I want to become the femme fatale
and toy with men now.

640
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,641
-You can do it.
-You can. That's right.

641
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,392
-You can do anything.
-That's right.

642
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,144
-Do everything you want to do!
-Yes.

643
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,771
-Femme fatale!
-Femme fatale!

644
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,731
Femme fatale!

645
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,900
I'm in a good mood today.

646
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,861
The drink tastes sweet.

647
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,867
THE LITTLE MERMAID

648
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,435
Yes! Three more years!

649
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,020
I'm on a roll today.

650
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,523
-Don't you think?
-Yes.

651
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,774
I'm so jealous.

652
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,944
You can't use the piano skill.

653
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,030
Welcome, Ms. Han.

654
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,617
What are you doing here?

655
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,287
The thing is… Hold on.

656
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,539
Mister, you failed.

657
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,541
Fail. Give me the stones.

658
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,502
I couldn't help it.
Would you give me one more chance?

659
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,711
Forget it.

660
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,130
Hurry up and give them.

661
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,425
-Give us the stones.
-Give us the stones.

662
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,597
All right. Have a good day.

663
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,021
Honey.

664
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,190
You're back. That's too--

665
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,275
Ms. Oh.

666
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,487
-You're back.
-Yes.

667
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,114
-I'll carry your bag.
-Okay.

668
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,121
Hey.

669
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,166
Hey!

670
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,375
Yes?

671
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,211
Why are you so happy to see my wife?

672
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,762
She came back safely with her coworkers.

673
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,390
So of course, I'm happy to see her.

674
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,850
Why are you smiling?

675
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,980
Mr. Choi, if it isn't too much trouble,

676
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,484
may I get off work early today?

677
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,235
It's too much trouble,

678
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,779
so don't say such nonsense.

679
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,282
He'll be off work soon anyway.

680
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,575
Go ahead.

681
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,829
-Go ahead.
-Thank you, Ms. Oh.

682
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,289
Hey!

683
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,082
Hey! That little…

684
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,004
Does Dae-geun have a crush on someone?

685
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,050
He had the eyes of someone in love.

686
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,593
The eyes of someone in love?

687
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,180
He had the eyes
of someone who has a screw loose.

688
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,362
CHARMING HAIR SALON

689
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,035
Welcome.

690
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,411
Please sit down and wait.

691
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,663
Okay.

692
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,837
What do you think?

693
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,927
My goodness.

694
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,305
You said you'd improve my looks
since I resembled Chow Yun-fat.

695
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,350
And you turned me into Chow Yun-fat!

696
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,476
Right?

697
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,395
I told you that you resembled him.

698
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,898
My goodness.

699
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,359
Wow. How much is it?

700
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,111
-It's 4,000 won.
-4,000 won.

701
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:48,407
Yi, èr, san, sì.

702
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,370
-Xièxie.
-Xiè… It means "Thank you," right?

703
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,832
I was going to go straight home,
but I should order a coffee.

704
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,917
-Thank you.
-Okay. Take care.

705
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,002
Okay.

706
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:01,878
Please take a seat.

707
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,879
Okay.

708
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,639
What kind of style would you like?

709
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,267
Well, I want…

710
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:20,480
You told me that I looked like
a certain celebrity.

711
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,149
I want his hairstyle.

712
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,359
Right.

713
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,821
Which celebrity was it?

714
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,490
What?

715
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,038
You told me that I resembled him a lot.

716
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,207
Can't you remember by looking at my face?

717
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,210
-He's a singer.
-A singer.

718
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,005
-His last name is Shim.
-Shim.

719
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,758
I know!

720
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,468
Shim Soo-bong!

721
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,555
That can't be right. She's a woman.

722
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,433
I'm afraid that…

723
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,354
I don't exactly remember.

724
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,023
Shim…

725
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,485
-Shim…
-Forget it.

726
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,076
What's up with him?

727
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,000
Mom, did you have good in-home sales?

728
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:22,959
Yes.

729
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,754
-Mr. Shim Shin actually came.
-What?

730
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,422
At the pharmacy,

731
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,841
you told him
that he looked like Shim Shin.

732
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,969
I remember because it was
absolutely ridiculous.

733
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,681
That's right. It was Shim Shin.

734
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,892
Gosh. Okay, Mom.

735
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:41,144
Let's talk tomorrow. Okay.

736
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,859
How's Uncle?

737
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,821
He's okay. He's recovering well.

738
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,114
I'm glad to hear that.

739
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,532
Yes.

740
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,908
I'm so sorry.

741
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,744
I asked you to come
because I wanted to help.

742
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,204
But I ended up inconveniencing you.

743
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,248
It's okay.

744
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,916
It was my first time babysitting,

745
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,918
so Min-ho and Dong-u struggled more.

746
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,091
I'll get going now.

747
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,843
-Okay. Say goodbye.
-Let's play again next time.

748
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,929
That's right. Would you like some clams?

749
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,014
I got them at the island I visited.

750
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,725
They're quite fresh.

751
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,352
They're tasty in stew and kalguksu.

752
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,819
What was that?

753
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,490
He cannot cook.

754
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,117
Just cook for him.

755
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,840
Or…

756
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,968
We're going to make kalguksu.

757
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,264
Would you like to eat with us?

758
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,434
Oh, kalguksu.

759
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,645
Eat before you go, mister.

760
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,240
-That's enough.
-Okay.

761
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,745
-Thank you for the food.
-No worries.

762
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:32,130
Mister, isn't Mom a good cook?

763
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,465
Isn't she the best?

764
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:38,178
Min-ho, there are many people
who can cook better than me.

765
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,137
Really?

766
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,683
Is your mom a better cook than my mom?

767
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,565
No.

768
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,234
See? You're better.

769
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,820
All right.

770
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,738
Hurry up and eat. Your food will go cold.

771
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,782
Okay.

772
00:51:58,865 --> 00:51:59,825
Eat up.

773
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,288
Here's another one.

774
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,999
Eat slowly.

775
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,923
You should go back.

776
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,592
You don't have to see me off.

777
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,057
I need to get colored foam sticks
for Min-ho's class tomorrow.

778
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,727
I see.

779
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:36,403
You probably didn't talk to my mom enough
because of the chaos.

780
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,990
I'll talk to her once she comes back.

781
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,745
To be honest, I regretted it the next day.

782
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,875
I told you things you didn't need to hear.

783
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,255
But it didn't really make me
feel uncomfortable,

784
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,216
even though we aren't close at all.

785
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,720
It's probably because we aren't close.

786
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,472
I felt the same.

787
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,435
"Am I worrying this person?"

788
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,396
"Then this person will try to console me."

789
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:17,068
Because I didn't have such worries,
I could be more open and honest.

790
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,280
How should I put it?

791
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:25,285
You're like a stranger
who's more comfortable than my friends.

792
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,372
"A stranger who's more comfortable
than your friends."

793
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,250
You might be right.

794
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,466
Would it be okay to ask

795
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,802
who you're looking for in this town?

796
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,851
It's okay. If it's too personal,
you don't need to tell me.

797
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,519
My mother.

798
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,366
I was adopted in the US when I was little.

799
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,536
I have no information
about my birth parents.

800
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,791
Geumje was my only lead,

801
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,626
so I came here.

802
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:16,878
I see.

803
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,633
That was why.

804
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,845
You don't need to worry or console me.

805
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,764
I told you

806
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,142
because you were a stranger
who was more comfortable than my friends.

807
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,460
Mom, am I handsome?

808
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,713
What?

809
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,549
Mister said that you were pretty.

810
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,385
He said I'm handsome
because I take after you.

811
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,389
I see.

812
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,934
Mister read me that book.

813
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,353
Did he read you a book?

814
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,688
Yes.

815
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:20,233
When I told him that you read me
a book before bedtime,

816
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,403
he read that book for me.

817
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,158
I see. How kind of him.

818
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,831
I guess his mom never read him a book.

819
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,667
He told me that he was jealous

820
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:42,047
because I could go to bed every night
while listening to my mom's voice.

821
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,707
That isn't enough.

822
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,754
Captain, wasn't there one
when you were a rookie?

823
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,339
A serial arson case. Right?

824
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,299
There was such a case.

825
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,927
The fire wasn't what was important.

826
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,949
GEUMJE POLICE STATION

827
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,035
Gosh, I'm aching all over.

828
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,372
Captain doesn't have the stamina anymore.

829
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,749
Why does he like hiking so much?

830
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,626
Besides, he can go hiking alone.

831
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,253
Why does he always call me out…

832
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,592
What were you talking about
that you had to stop so suddenly?

833
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,345
I was talking about
hiking with you yesterday!

834
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,430
Seriously,

835
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,099
it was so much fun!

836
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,767
I want to go again!

837
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,228
Is that so?

838
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:24,357
Why don't we bring a tent next week
so that we can spend a night there?

839
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,900
Gosh,

840
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,277
I can't wait.

841
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,487
-Really?
-I'll write it down on my calendar.

842
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,700
All right. You really got into hiking.

843
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,369
I knew you would like it.

844
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,206
Captain.

845
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,499
What is it?

846
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,294
I see. Do you want to join us?

847
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:47,130
No, I…

848
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,340
Would you spare me some time
in the evening?

849
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,509
What? Are we having a get-together?

850
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,098
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

851
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,017
I'd like to see you privately.

852
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,393
Is that so?

853
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,729
Do you want to come to my house?

854
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,689
Let's talk over a glass of infused liquor.

855
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,733
That sounds great. I'll see you then.

856
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,901
Okay.

857
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:13,114
Detective Kim, about that case…

858
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,699
Yes.

859
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:18,161
Will you tell him I bad-mouthed him
behind his back?

860
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,540
I trust you, okay?

861
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,212
Okay. You do that. Well done.

862
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,844
We will share the same amount

863
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,597
with Ms. Oh Geum-hui,
Ms. Seo Yeong-bok, and Ms. Lee Ju-ri.

864
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,516
Thank you for your hard work.

865
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,519
I didn't expect you to sell
all of those products.

866
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:47,315
I'll say this again
when the others arrive,

867
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,236
but why don't you try becoming
the branch manager?

868
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,487
The branch manager?

869
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,657
Think of it as doing similar work as me.

870
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,534
Educate the sales representatives,

871
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,328
come up with sales strategies,
and manage the sales.

872
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:04,290
You get a fixed monthly salary
on top of the in-home sales profits.

873
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,461
A fixed monthly salary?

874
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:14,884
If I sell 100,000 won's worth
of products more this month…

875
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,138
I'll have a chance.

876
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,148
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

877
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,400
Han Jeong-suk.

878
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,277
It's me, Gyeong-sik.

879
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,612
Kim Gyeong-sik.

880
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,823
The cleaning officer
of Class Four in 12th grade.

881
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,703
I'm sorry. It has been a while.

882
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,164
I understand.
I run a flower farm in the suburbs,

883
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,709
so I rarely come to the town.

884
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,461
I really wanted to see you,
so I'm glad that I ran into you.

885
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,590
Me? Why?

886
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,426
I heard about your in-home sales.

887
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,887
My wife wanted to meet you.
I think you know her.

888
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,348
She went to school with us.
Yoon Jeong-rim.

889
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,225
What? Jeong-rim?

890
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,769
Is Jeong-rim doing well?

891
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,396
Yes.

892
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,984
She seriously injured her back
while working at the farm.

893
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,403
-My goodness.
-She's been bedridden for months.

894
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,071
Oh, no.

895
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:23,661
So I wanted to ask,
would it be possible to come to my house

896
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,954
for in-home sales?

897
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,498
Of course, I can do that.

898
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,250
Jeong-rim will be very happy.

899
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,379
Will other sales representatives come?

900
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,214
What?

901
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,717
Since Jeong-rim is in bad health,

902
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,303
she gets uncomfortable
when there are many people.

903
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,348
But she knows you,

904
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,933
so I'd appreciate it
if you could come alone.

905
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:48,519
You understand, right?

906
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:50,897
Yes.

907
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:57,028
Okay. I'll try to come alone.

908
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,613
Thank you.

909
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,032
How about today?

910
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,326
Work will get busy at the farm
starting from tomorrow.

911
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,332
Okay. Today is fine.

912
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,250
-Can you give me the address?
-Okay.

913
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,338
Yeongcheon-myeon.

914
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,342
-San.
-"San."

915
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,928
-27-1.
-"27-1."

916
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,221
-Is this right?
-Yes.

917
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,431
-Okay.
-Thank you.

918
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,641
Don't mention it.

919
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,560
-See you later.
-Okay.

920
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,354
-Say hello to Jeong-rim for me.
-Okay.

921
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,098
Yeong-bok.

922
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,726
I'll be going to the home
of my friend named Gyeong-sik

923
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,478
for in-home sales in a short while.

924
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,230
He runs a flower farm in the suburb.

925
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,275
Would you be able to come with me?

926
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,319
I'm so sorry.

927
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:26,033
I thought I was carsick,
but I have indigestion,

928
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,995
and my body feels heavy.
I don't feel well.

929
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,957
Why don't you ask Ms. Oh?

930
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,001
She has a gathering today.

931
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,046
Okay. Please take care.

932
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,590
Okay.

933
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,851
I guess I'm old now.

934
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,147
It's rare for me to get carsick.

935
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,525
A long-distance trip got me exhausted.

936
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,527
It's my fault.

937
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,489
I made you struggle a lot
in your younger days.

938
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:05,573
No.

939
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:06,657
I know that I did.

940
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,118
No.

941
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,831
It wasn't just in my younger days.

942
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,959
You make me struggle a lot even now.

943
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,296
Why did you use the past tense?
It should be the present tense.

944
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:26,219
Girls, don't bother your mom
when she's sick.

945
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,930
You're bothering me more.

946
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,140
Mom.

947
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,517
What is it this time?

948
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,061
If you need something, tell me.
What do you want?

949
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,313
Sanitary pads. Do you know where they are?

950
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,397
What?

951
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,151
Of course not.

952
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:47,448
Aren't they on the bathroom shelf?

953
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,534
There's only one.

954
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:52,703
You get your period before I do.
Didn't you know?

955
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,541
I've been having irregular periods
ever since I had Eun-ji.

956
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,710
It'll be a bit embarrassing,

957
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,964
but shall I buy them for you?
Which one should I get?

958
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,757
A man shouldn't do that.

959
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,802
Forget it. I feel restless,
so I'll get some air.

960
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:08,886
I'll go and buy it.

961
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,555
Don't. I can go.

962
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,682
Please. Watch Eun-ji.

963
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,214
GYEONGRIM FLOWER FARM

964
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,976
-Take care.
-Okay.

965
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,317
Hello.

966
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,444
-Yeong-bok!
-Hello.

967
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:08,946
I wanted to ask you something.

968
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:09,989
Okay.

969
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,699
Did Seong-su and Jeong-suk get a divorce?

970
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,659
Gosh.

971
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:17,038
It's not something to be happy about.

972
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,332
Why are you asking so excitedly?

973
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,168
No, I'm not excited.

974
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,377
You're quite excited.

975
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,881
No. I asked because I was worried.

976
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,635
They fought
because of in-home sales, right?

977
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,556
Now that she got a divorce,

978
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,808
-she'll quit.
-Yes.

979
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,687
Why would she quit?

980
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,483
Jeong-suk is so busy these days.

981
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:49,737
Today, she went to a flower farm

982
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,990
her friend from high school runs
for in-home sales.

983
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,826
Her schedule is packed. She's so busy.

984
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,662
A flower farm?

985
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,163
The one Gyeong-sik runs?

986
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:02,416
I don't know who its owner is.

987
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,126
Her schedule was packed,

988
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:08,589
but she went because her friend
and his wife begged her to go.

989
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:09,799
His wife?

990
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:12,760
Gyeong-sik's been single for a while now.

991
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,305
-What?
-I heard that his wife ran away.

992
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,975
No way.

993
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:23,187
A few days ago, he bought
canned peaches for his wife.

994
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,981
-Really?
-Yes.

995
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,191
Did I get it confused with another family?

996
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,484
How frustrating.

997
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,570
The shop isn't open, is it?
I'll go someplace else.

998
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,698
It's open. Go on in.

999
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,908
Don't be like that.

1000
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,120
-Why would you talk about her divorce?
-Okay. Go on in.

1001
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,913
-What do you want?
-I'm so upset.

1002
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:41,956
Freedom pad!

1003
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,339
Jeong-suk.

1004
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,195
Jeong-suk.

1005
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:06,957
Jeong-suk.

1006
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,595
You've played hard to get long enough.

1007
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:27,853
Stay away.

1008
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,564
Hey, why do you keep making me
look like a bad person?

1009
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,899
I'm not like Seong-su.

1010
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,151
Let us be honest.

1011
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,444
-Let go!
-Come on out.

1012
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,363
Let go!

1013
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,094
Ms. Han Jeong-suk.

1014
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,931
Ms. Han Jeong-suk.

1015
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,735
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

1016
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,236
What happened yesterday…

1017
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,240
There's no way
people will find out about it, right?

1018
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,451
I wouldn't do something like that!

1019
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:09,622
Due to the nature of the crime,
the victim needs psychological stability.

1020
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,374
To separate the two sides,
I'll receive the statement in writing.

1021
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,836
Jeong-suk. Become successful as soon
as possible and show everyone!

1022
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,381
Apparently, Gyeong-sik feels
really wronged.

1023
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,885
Running away and covering up
might not be the best option.

1024
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,679
Why didn't you tell us?

1025
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:29,266
How could they corner the innocent victim?
They're less than human.

1026
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,185
Whether it's psychological or physical,

1027
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:33,062
let's win no matter what.

1028
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,271
I'm coming too.

1029
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,898
It's my business.

1030
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:44,156
