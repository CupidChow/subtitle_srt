1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,091
-I'll pour you a glass.
-That's very nice of you.

3
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,535
The color is so brilliant.

4
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,871
My parents in the US
used to drink it often.

5
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,207
It has a nice aroma,
so I have it from time to time.

6
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,168
That's right. You're from the US.

7
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,127
Yes.

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,421
Thanks to you, we're drinking wine.

9
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,844
Jeong-suk, what are you doing there?

10
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,930
Come and join us.

11
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,389
Okay.

12
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,435
There's more food than I expected.

13
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,604
-I'll grill meat if we run out of food.
-Okay.

14
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,314
-Sit here.
-Thank you.

15
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,447
-Do you want wine too?
-Okay.

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,624
Gosh, unlike our glasses,
Jeong-suk's glass is full.

17
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,709
It's about to overflow.

18
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,796
That's love, not wine.

19
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,172
Good for them.

20
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,342
Such lovebirds.

21
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:20,056
Mr. Choi, would you give a toast
before we clink our glasses?

22
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,852
I'm too shy to do that. Forget it.

23
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,271
You're today's star.
Please say a few words.

24
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,439
A round of applause.

25
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,904
Let's go.

26
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,115
Goodness.

27
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,203
Goodness me.

28
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,083
I'd like to thank

29
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,796
the many honorable guests
who came to the house

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,553
despite their busy schedules to celebrate
my discharge from the hospital.

31
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,848
Thank you very much.

32
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,019
-All right.
-Gosh.

33
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,478
There's

34
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,148
an old saying…

35
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,279
"If you lose money, you lose a small bit."

36
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,574
"If you lose honor, you lose half."

37
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,536
"But if you lose health,
you lose everything."

38
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,663
So, at all times,

39
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,208
health comes first.

40
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,837
I'd be thankful
if you could remember that.

41
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,467
Cheers.

42
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,178
-The next important thing is--
-All right.

43
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,180
Cheers.

44
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,433
-Cheers.
-Cheers, Jeong-suk.

45
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,186
Why would you cut me off?

46
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,146
I was getting in the zone.

47
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,649
The food was going cold.

48
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,984
Everyone understood your valuable message.

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,819
"Valuable"?

50
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,988
-"Valuable."
-Right?

51
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,496
This is nice. Please go ahead and eat.

52
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,877
-Have this.
-Okay.

53
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,674
Yeong-bok, you're such a homemaker.
You're so good.

54
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,011
Ms. Oh, the plates are so pretty.

55
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,054
Really?

56
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,847
All your plates are so pretty.

57
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,058
My goodness.

58
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,811
Seriously. It looks nice like this.

59
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,857
He seems nicer than I expected.

60
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,986
-Excuse me?
-I mean Detective Kim Do-hyeon.

61
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,238
I thought he was just taciturn.

62
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,700
From what I've seen today,
he seems kind and warm-hearted.

63
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,664
You seemed really fond of him.

64
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,626
Is it because he's Jeong-suk's man?
My heart just gets tender.

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,628
I just want to keep talking to him.

66
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,927
I'll give this to the children.

67
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,137
-Okay.
-Okay.

68
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,267
Hi.

69
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,856
-You didn't have to.
-I'm almost done cleaning up.

70
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,534
-Are you hurt?
-Oh, no.

71
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,457
My goodness. You should've been careful.

72
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,667
Please hold on.

73
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,918
I'm okay.

74
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,968
It must hurt.

75
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,220
It's a deeper cut than it looks.

76
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,057
Why didn't you listen
when I told you to leave them there?

77
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,808
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,272
People would think
you're a mom scolding her son.

79
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,195
I'm sorry. I was just startled.

80
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,324
I wasn't scolding you.
I just feel bad for you.

81
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,705
This cut…

82
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:27,136
Mister, would you please
hang out at my place?

83
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,598
Min-ho, it's too late. Maybe next time.

84
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:31,933
No.

85
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,688
Then the three of us
should play together next time.

86
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,773
Sure, sounds good.

87
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,066
What should we do?

88
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,621
Okay. Let's do that.

89
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,581
Promise?

90
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,750
I promise.

91
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,462
Go on, it's cold.

92
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,672
I'll call you. Bye.

93
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,965
Bye.

94
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,216
Bye!

95
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,344
Bye, mister.

96
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,347
Bye.

97
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,080
Hello?

98
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,832
Jeong-suk, it's me.

99
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,129
Yes, Ms. Oh.

100
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,215
You said you needed a camera
to take photos of the products.

101
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,551
I just found it. So don't worry about it.

102
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,054
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

103
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,599
Okay. See you tomorrow.

104
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,184
Ms. Oh.

105
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,518
Yes? What is it?

106
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,857
Well, by any chance…

107
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,531
It's nothing. See you tomorrow.

108
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,742
What was that?

109
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,910
See you tomorrow.

110
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,346
I'm glad the culprit is caught,

111
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,890
but you must be very disappointed.

112
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,894
Your search for your biological parents

113
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,438
went back to square one.

114
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,106
I'll start over.

115
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,818
Thanks for helping me out.

116
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,028
Goodness.

117
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,280
Tell me if you need anything.

118
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,949
Okay.

119
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,040
What are you doing?

120
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,167
Can't you see? We're enjoying coffee.

121
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,920
Why are you guys hanging out
so early in the morning?

122
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,589
-Let's go inside.
-Yes, sir.

123
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,760
Captain!

124
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,097
You used to enjoy coffee
in the morning with me! Gosh, it's hot!

125
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,982
What are you doing?

126
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,027
Is it broken?

127
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,488
I can't see anything.

128
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,575
Take off the lens cap.

129
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,245
I see.

130
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,711
-Can you see now?
-Yes, I can see well.

131
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,754
How frustrating.

132
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:53,759
You know nothing about cameras,
but you'll take pictures of the products?

133
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,511
Do you want my help?

134
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,846
Forget it.

135
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,641
You always make me
look short and ugly in your photos.

136
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,437
No man in the world can ever satisfy
women with their photos.

137
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,771
Geez.

138
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,317
That's right.
Dae-geun is good at taking photos.

139
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,402
He studied photography at school.

140
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,778
My goodness, really?

141
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,615
Yes. Although he's a dropout,

142
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,742
he did study photography.

143
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,869
He must be better than us.

144
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,143
-My goodness.
-How cool.

145
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,300
Go home. I need to drop by my place first.

146
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,802
Okay.

147
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,679
What are you guys whispering about?

148
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,056
I'm curious too.

149
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,184
Well, I was just telling him

150
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,144
thanks for taking photos today.

151
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,062
I see.

152
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,231
-Yes.
-Is that so?

153
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,194
Dae-geun, you worked hard all day long.

154
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,404
Thank you.

155
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,947
Thank you, Dae-geun.

156
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,116
No, it was nothing.

157
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,993
Here you go.

158
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,372
-These are the films from earlier.
-Okay.

159
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,754
I have plans in the evening.

160
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,673
I'll get going now.

161
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,216
-You should've had more.
-It's okay.

162
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,634
Thank you.

163
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,095
-Bye.
-See you later.

164
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:08,978
I'll also get going.
I need to get back to the salon.

165
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,647
-Okay. Bye. I should get going too.
-Bye.

166
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,524
-Ju-ri, good work today.
-Okay.

167
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:20,156
So we need to develop the photos
and bring them to the print shop?

168
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,242
Yes. I'll drop off the films
at the photo studio on my way home

169
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,244
and pick them up tomorrow.

170
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,955
Shall we go together tomorrow?

171
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,083
I was going to finish proofreading
the descriptions today anyway.

172
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,294
Let's take them and the photos
to the print shop.

173
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,505
Okay. That works.

174
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,590
Okay.

175
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,845
Gosh, why are you so fretful today?

176
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,847
-Are you sick?
-Let me hold the baby.

177
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,058
You couldn't even eat because of the baby.

178
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,436
Hey, Eun-ji.

179
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,440
All right. Let's play.

180
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,984
Play with me so your mom can have a snack.

181
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,944
Sweet baby.

182
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,239
-Gosh, I've had this thought for a while.
-Clap your feet.

183
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,658
You're a wonderful babysitter.

184
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,660
-Really? Am I?
-Yes.

185
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,662
You really are.

186
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,539
-Do you like me?
-Seriously.

187
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,126
-There you go.
-She usually refuses other people.

188
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,171
It's okay. I'll look after you.

189
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,089
Let your mom enjoy the snack.

190
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,392
Who are you?

191
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,562
It's me, Dae-geun.

192
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,273
Ju-ri.

193
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,736
Wow, I didn't recognize you
because you looked so different.

194
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,697
I changed up my style
so people don't recognize me.

195
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,492
If I straighten my hair
and wear plain clothes,

196
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,701
they don't recognize me.

197
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,872
You look very pretty in this outfit.

198
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,876
Well, please praise me more
inside the house.

199
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,169
Okay.

200
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,505
-Let's go.
-Okay. Please come inside.

201
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,966
My goodness.

202
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,886
My goodness.

203
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,184
I knew that Ms. Heo was rich,

204
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,936
but this is something else.

205
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,357
What's this?

206
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:24,238
I noticed how you enjoyed wine
the other day.

207
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,574
I took out the whiskey my mom had hidden.

208
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,786
Let's have a drink here first,

209
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,956
then I'll show you my room.

210
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,211
So you want to set the mood first.

211
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,547
Okay.

212
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,591
Please take a seat.

213
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,313
Did you find me sexy? Really?

214
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,480
Yes.

215
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,818
Men look sexy
when they're focusing on something.

216
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,030
You must love photography a lot.

217
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,032
I used to love it.

218
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,160
That was why I studied it in university.

219
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,120
Then why did you quit?

220
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,916
My parents were against it.

221
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,922
They said it was embarrassing
and that it wouldn't bring in any money.

222
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,674
It was a lowly university anyway.

223
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,385
Is "lowly" the name of the university?

224
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,389
No. It's Geumshin University.

225
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:39,146
Then why do you call it
a lowly university?

226
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,481
Well,

227
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:46,445
all my sisters and relatives
went to prestigious universities.

228
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,575
I got used to people looking down on me

229
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,077
and calling my school lowly.

230
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,081
Why would they look down on you?

231
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,374
It's impressive.

232
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,585
Impressive?

233
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,670
Yes!

234
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,715
Maybe it's because I didn't go
anywhere near university.

235
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,470
The fact that you went
to university itself is incredible.

236
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,932
It's cool that you're a good photographer.

237
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,350
It's wonderful.

238
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,817
What?

239
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,029
Are you crying?

240
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,698
No.

241
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,205
No one has said that to me before.

242
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:45,379
I always thought to myself,
"Why am I so pathetic?"

243
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,342
To someone,

244
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,138
I can be a cool person.

245
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,601
I'm so thankful for that.

246
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,187
But I'm also sad.

247
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,733
Don't cry.

248
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,362
Thank you so much.

249
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,829
Stop crying. You're such a crybaby.

250
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,295
This is your routine, you punk.

251
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,380
I mean…

252
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,300
You always cry
and kiss me when I console you.

253
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,260
It's the same as last time.

254
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,515
No, it's different from last time.

255
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,936
Today, I won't let you lead me.

256
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,732
Sit still. I'll go to you.

257
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,696
My goodness.

258
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,118
You're crazy.

259
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,458
What are you guys doing?

260
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,211
Must you ask? It's obvious.

261
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,138
Why are you here?
What about the trip to China?

262
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,766
China? That isn't the point right now.

263
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,142
You little brats!

264
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,022
Eom Dae-geun! Stop right there!

265
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,565
You little punk!

266
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,942
Stop right there, you punk!

267
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,653
You brat. Stop right there!

268
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,905
Oh, no.

269
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,324
Mom, hear me out!

270
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,283
-Stop!
-Hold tight!

271
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,791
You little punk! I got you!

272
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,209
You little punks!

273
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,214
I'm the one you need to talk to.
Why is Ju-ri here?

274
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,305
I'll cut to the chase.

275
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,979
Break up.

276
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,188
Mom.

277
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,733
Could this be…

278
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,239
COMMERCIAL LEASE AGREEMENT

279
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,908
It's a lease agreement.

280
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,993
Yes.

281
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,829
If you won't break up,
move out immediately.

282
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,708
You're being ridiculous.

283
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,626
Ridiculous? How so?

284
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,005
You dared to seduce my son.

285
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,591
How could you say that it's ridiculous?

286
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,011
You could be angry with me,

287
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,971
but this is about my livelihood.

288
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,932
How dare you glare at me
and talk back to me?

289
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,985
Stop watching dramas.

290
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,945
-You punk, be quiet!
-I won't!

291
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,198
You always threatened to disown me.

292
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,908
Don't act like I'm your precious son.

293
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,492
You little…

294
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,581
You've just gone too far!

295
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,333
Out of all women in the world, how--

296
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,751
Seriously!

297
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,589
You can mistreat me all you want,
but I won't let you mistreat Ju-ri!

298
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,886
My son, did you just yell at me?

299
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,848
Are you so crazy
about this lousy woman with a child?

300
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,141
She isn't lousy.

301
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,812
In my entire life,
you've never given me validation.

302
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,983
She told me that I was enough
and that I was cool.

303
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,860
She acknowledged me for who I am.

304
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,822
I feel like I can do anything
when I'm by Ju-ri's side.

305
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,452
I want to become a better person
because she believes in me!

306
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,958
So,

307
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,835
Ju-ri,

308
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,213
don't abandon me.

309
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,633
I love you.

310
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,635
Me too.

311
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,137
I love you too.

312
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,139
Don't cry.

313
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,726
Seriously. Why are you crying again?

314
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,812
You silly crybaby.

315
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,817
-You fool.
-My goodness, what an eyesore.

316
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,529
My goodness.

317
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,324
Gosh, they came out better
than I expected.

318
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,994
He sure is an expert.

319
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:31,081
To be honest, I was a bit nervous
because he made such a fuss taking them.

320
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,332
Actually, me too.

321
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,421
I'm hungry.

322
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,506
Shall we eat
before going to the print shop?

323
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,842
Okay.

324
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,138
Detective.

325
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,308
Are you on the clock?

326
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,393
Yes, I just wrapped up.

327
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,439
It's lunchtime.
Why don't you join us for lunch?

328
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,774
We're on our way to eat.

329
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,735
Shall we?

330
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,739
Let's go.

331
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,620
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

332
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,706
Here you go.

333
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,791
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the food.

334
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,256
That's a lot of pepper.

335
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,426
Well, I like pepper.

336
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,184
Detective, you must like pepper too.

337
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,685
Yes.

338
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,646
I carry pepper with me
because I feel bad for the restaurants.

339
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,523
My goodness. I do the same.

340
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,277
People say
that I won't be able to taste the soup

341
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,321
if I sprinkle so much pepper.

342
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,948
-Doesn't it heighten the taste?
-Exactly!

343
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,377
What is it? Do you think it's weird
I add so much pepper?

344
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,254
No.

345
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,058
It's good to see you eat with gusto.

346
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,644
Did you have breakfast?

347
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,064
No. I normally skip breakfast.

348
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,568
Your parents are abroad.

349
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,821
It must be a hassle to cook for yourself.

350
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,826
You don't seem to live
so far from my place.

351
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,162
Come over
when cooking feels like a hassle.

352
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,374
Eating out all the time
will ruin your health.

353
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,502
Okay, I'll do that.

354
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,719
It's okay. Please eat.

355
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,237
By the way…

356
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,659
you told me
that you excluded Ms. Oh early on.

357
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,704
May I ask you why?

358
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,788
What?

359
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:28,925
It's just that watching you spend
more time with Ms. Oh

360
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,887
got me curious.

361
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,641
The timeline didn't add up.

362
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,605
Ms. Oh Geum-hui got married
and followed her husband to Geumje

363
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,356
about 20 years ago.

364
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,484
Before that, she had
no connection in Geumje.

365
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,404
I see.

366
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,324
Besides, I saw she received treatments

367
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,577
for infertility for many years
at the Geumje OB-GYN Clinic.

368
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,581
It'd be very nice, though.

369
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,542
What?

370
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,670
If I find my mother someday,

371
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,174
I wish she'd be warmhearted
and cheerful like Ms. Oh.

372
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,349
You know…

373
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,401
There's something I need to tell you.

374
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,624
-You're home.
-Yes.

375
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,128
Why are you so gaunt?

376
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,338
Don't even ask.

377
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:52,217
Dae-geun suddenly called off work
due to an emergency.

378
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,177
I'm exhausted from working all day.

379
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,137
Really? I wonder what happened.

380
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,224
In any case, cheer up.

381
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,269
Your favorite dish,
fried chicken will be delivered soon.

382
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,478
Fried chicken?

383
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,399
The last episode of Jealousy airs today,
so let's watch it as we eat.

384
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,025
That's right. It's today.

385
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,444
What time is it? It'll be on soon.

386
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,822
Choi Soo-jong and Choi Jin-sil.

387
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,908
They'll become a couple like us, right?

388
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,827
I bet they'll break up.

389
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,538
-What? That can't happen.
-Let's see.

390
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,499
The fried chicken is here. I'll get it.

391
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,131
Fried chicken is here

392
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:34,634
Tasty fried chicken is finally here…

393
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,181
Honey.

394
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,977
I think there's a problem.

395
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,479
What? Is something wrong
with the fried chicken?

396
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,607
No, it isn't about the fried chicken.

397
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,692
Geum-hui.

398
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,695
What? Ju-ri, what are you…

399
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,160
Hello.

400
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
Please excuse me.

401
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,378
Well…

402
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,016
So, the two of you are dating,

403
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,811
and Ms. Heo caught you guys
being all lovey-dovey.

404
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,647
I get why she's mad,

405
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,692
but she shouldn't have
kicked you guys out right away.

406
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,446
I thought she was just trying to scare us.

407
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,864
But she acted right away.

408
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,870
Min-ho's grandma seems to be
around at Jeong-suk's quite a lot.

409
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,290
May I please stay here
until I find a new room?

410
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,458
Of course--

411
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,835
I'm not sure about it.

412
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,629
What?

413
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,173
Ms. Heo is firmly
against this relationship.

414
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,344
If she finds out that you're staying here,
I'll be put in a tight spot.

415
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,014
Mr. Choi, that's so cold of you.

416
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:03,932
Goodness.

417
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,517
Is it my mom or me?

418
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:11,231
I can't believe you.
We've gone through a lot together.

419
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,192
Still, I choose Ms. Heo.

420
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,196
Seriously, please help us out
just for a few days.

421
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,699
I'll try to persuade Mom, okay?

422
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,078
Honey.

423
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,500
Geez.

424
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,589
I made it. It's nothing big.

425
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,596
Is it a mouse? It's very cute.

426
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,264
It's a rabbit.

427
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,643
It's a signature of mine.

428
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,855
Many people mistake it for a mouse.

429
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,370
Eat anchovies too.

430
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:58,087
Mom, are we meeting up
with the police officer this evening?

431
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,007
Yes.

432
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,093
But I'll need to check later.

433
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,596
I don't know if he's okay.

434
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,808
Why? Did something happen to him?

435
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,435
No.

436
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,022
Min-ho, did you pack clay
for your class today?

437
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,524
Yes.

438
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,860
I'll make a cat today.

439
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,363
What did Dong-u say that he'd make?

440
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,909
I'm so frustrated.

441
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,663
Hey, are you done yet?

442
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,416
It's been over 20 minutes.
When will you come out?

443
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,380
I'm sorry.
It takes me a while in the morning.

444
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm about to soil my pants. Oh, no.

445
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,677
This is driving me insane.

446
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,972
Honey, use the bathroom
on the second floor.

447
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,017
I know there's a bathroom
on the second floor, okay?

448
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,228
But I've used that toilet all my life.

449
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,272
My butt will be so upset.

450
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,859
You're being dramatic.

451
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,318
-Man, I can't hold it anymore.
-What?

452
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,611
You can go in now.

453
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:08,074
What? Did you read a magazine
while using the bathroom?

454
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:12,287
Yes. Catching up on world affairs
while using the bathroom

455
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,663
is my morning routine.

456
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,916
How could an eight-year-old
have such a routine?

457
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,130
The smell tells me
that you have no time to talk.

458
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,798
Go on in.

459
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,094
I think it came out.

460
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,973
Honey, please bring me new underwear.

461
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:37,478
-Dong-u, let's go and eat breakfast.
-Okay.

462
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,654
You should eat it.

463
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,199
No, sir. A nonpaying lodger
shouldn't be so shameless.

464
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,534
Please go ahead and eat.

465
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:59,375
Where did you learn
a word like "nonpaying lodger"?

466
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,588
How could you eat it for real?

467
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:13,014
He ate five out of seven meatballs!

468
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,516
I'm not even allowed to have two?

469
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:20,063
I'm sorry. He isn't considerate to kids.

470
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,775
It's okay. Dong-u did eat a lot.

471
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,361
-Dong-u, pack your bag if you're done.
-Okay.

472
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,404
-Thank you for the food.
-You're welcome.

473
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,825
I'm heading off too!

474
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,621
Meatballs…

475
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,458
I need to get going now.

476
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,253
I need to find a new place
for the hair salon.

477
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,713
It must be hard.

478
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,676
Leave it there, Ju-ri.
It's okay, so get going.

479
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,094
Thank you.

480
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,476
It's so dirty.

481
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,863
Nice. How did you know that?

482
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,201
Detective Kim, do you want corn?

483
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,756
What are you doing?

484
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,803
How dare you ignore Captain?
What were you thinking about?

485
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,680
Captain, I'm sorry.

486
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,892
May I get off work early?
There's something I need to check.

487
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,562
Sure. Go ahead.

488
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,069
Is black tea okay?

489
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,197
Yes.

490
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,699
What is it that you want to ask me?

491
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,910
Is it about Jeong-suk?

492
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,537
No, it isn't.

493
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,297
I think it'll be better to show you.

494
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,930
What's this?

495
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,243
This…

496
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,371
Why is this…

497
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,879
It's what I was wearing
when I got adopted by an American family.

498
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,924
On it,

499
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:40,555
I saw the same embroidery
that was on the handkerchief you gave me.

500
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,520
So I wanted to ask you for an explanation.

501
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,232
Well…

502
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,243
I don't know.

503
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,288
-What?
-I don't know.

504
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,581
Detective, I…

505
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,126
In any case,

506
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,714
I don't know who you're looking for,
but I can't help you.

507
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,466
Bye.

508
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,637
Please wait.

509
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,182
Honey, I'm home!

510
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,416
You're home earlier than I expected.

511
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,709
Yes.

512
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,961
I brought some meat from the butcher shop.

513
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,629
It's for meatballs, okay?

514
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,300
Make a lot this time.

515
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,760
I don't want to compete
with the kid again.

516
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,971
Okay.

517
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,890
There's something else.

518
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,521
Here.

519
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,066
What's this?

520
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,568
Open it.

521
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,325
For our wedding anniversary,

522
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,910
I bought you a scarf
but only made your heart ache.

523
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,538
So I bought a new one.

524
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:58,294
When I met you for the first time,
you were wearing a scarf.

525
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,213
You looked so elegant and beautiful.

526
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,716
I thought, "I'll marry this woman

527
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,803
and make her happy
for the rest of her life."

528
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,978
Why the long face? Don't you like it?

529
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,027
It isn't like that. I like it.

530
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,907
What do you think? Does it look nice?

531
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,827
Gosh, you look beautiful.

532
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,498
You haven't changed at all.

533
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,166
Nonsense.

534
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,543
Go wash up. I'll prepare dinner.

535
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,711
Okay.

536
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,423
The little one must've made a mess,

537
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,761
but the house is still sparkling clean.

538
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,833
How did you know that it was easier
to catch marsh snails at night?

539
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,376
Grandma told me.

540
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,838
Yes! I caught two.

541
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,554
How about you, mister?

542
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,764
I haven't caught any yet.

543
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,642
Mister, is it your first time?

544
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,185
Yes, it's my first time.

545
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:43,357
Didn't you catch them with your parents
when you were little?

546
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,069
No.

547
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,782
Min-ho, he grew up in the US.

548
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,201
You can teach him well, right?

549
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,619
Yes.

550
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,996
Mister, watch.

551
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:02,293
There are slippery bits like this.

552
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,838
-You can find many of them on those.
-Okay.

553
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,132
It's because these parts
have been untouched.

554
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,759
-A part like this?
-Yes.

555
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,052
Hold on.

556
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,182
I caught them, right?

557
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,808
Put them here.

558
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,977
So this is how you do it.

559
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,229
Min-ho, this is fun.

560
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,565
Shall we see who can catch more?

561
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,649
That sounds good.

562
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,861
I won't go easy on you
just because it's your first time.

563
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,572
Okay. Ready, set, go.

564
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,536
Here.

565
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,581
Okay, I got them.

566
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,917
See how many I got, right?
One, two, three.

567
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,752
-What?
-Right?

568
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,547
Catch them.

569
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,103
Min-ho, come on out already.

570
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,774
Okay. Let me catch five more.

571
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,328
I met up with her today.

572
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,332
Ms. Oh?

573
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,710
She became very startled
upon seeing the baby clothes.

574
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,922
She said she didn't know anything.

575
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,177
It looked like
she didn't want to admit it.

576
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,432
You should've rested at home today.

577
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:46,230
I'd imagined meeting my mother
hundreds of times.

578
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,068
In my imagination,
I wasn't always welcomed.

579
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,320
Perhaps because of that,

580
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,240
I feel better than I expected.

581
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,211
Mister, I won.

582
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,005
No way.

583
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,925
-Are you certain?
-Of course, I am.

584
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:15,843
Let's see.

585
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,095
-What?
-Look.

586
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,472
Gosh, you caught so many.

587
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:25,352
Just how many did you catch?
One, two, three, four, five, six…

588
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,192
Mom.

589
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,739
Please cook sujebi tomorrow
with the marsh snails I caught with him.

590
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,199
Okay.

591
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,959
Sleep tight, my son.

592
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,836
Okay. Good night, Mom.

593
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:51,920
Okay.

594
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,475
Hello?

595
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,019
Hey, Ju-ri.

596
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:11,065
Yes. The brochure will be ready
around 11 a.m. tomorrow.

597
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,192
Let's meet at the print shop.

598
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,570
I see. I'll relay the news to Geum-hui.

599
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,655
Okay.

600
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,743
Jeong-suk said we should meet
at the print shop at 11 a.m.

601
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,790
Do I really have to go?

602
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,750
Why? You put the most amount
of effort into it.

603
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,545
That's right. Didn't you say
that it'd be the busiest day?

604
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,507
Are you feeling unwell?

605
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,385
-Open your mouth.
-It isn't like that.

606
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,970
I was just asking.

607
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,306
Keeping yourself well-fed sure is a chore.

608
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,976
All of you guys are working hard
without getting much rest.

609
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,523
My goodness, where did you learn
an idiom like that?

610
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,608
September issue of Jubu Life.

611
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,903
Help yourself.

612
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,073
You're also working hard
reading magazines.

613
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,119
-Is it tasty?
-Eat up.

614
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,205
SEONGGWANG PRINT SHOP

615
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,334
-Girls!
-Hello.

616
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,586
Welcome.

617
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,713
-You're here.
-Yes.

618
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,884
The brochure looks amazing.

619
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,848
It looks incredible.

620
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,268
I'll be upset
if someone throws it away on the street.

621
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:33,772
We should emphasize the fact
that there's a coupon in the last page.

622
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,567
Why don't we distribute them
as teams of two?

623
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,735
We can be a team.

624
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,612
Ms. Oh and Jeong-suk can be a team.

625
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,615
Wouldn't it be faster to do it separately?

626
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,159
Right.

627
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,077
Shall we do that, Ms. Branch Manager?

628
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:52,291
Okay. Let's do it separately
and meet at the office to take calls.

629
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,501
-Okay.
-Okay. Good luck!

630
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,753
-I'll take this. Let's go.
-Gosh.

631
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,255
-See you later!
-Bye.

632
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,519
RESERVATION LIST
VIBRATOR 1, LOVE GEL 1, CONDOM 1

633
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,438
The brochure has worked wonders.

634
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,689
Right, Geum-hui?

635
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,858
What? Yes.

636
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,568
I know, right?

637
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:24,281
Imagine how difficult it would be
to sell all those in person.

638
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,450
-Well done, everyone.
-Yes.

639
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,577
A get-together would be perfect.

640
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,079
But I need to check out
a unit for my salon today.

641
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,665
I need to go and take care
of the children.

642
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,459
The girls are babysitting Eun-ji.

643
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,631
After I find a new place,
let's go out for a drink.

644
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,050
Dae-geun and the detective too.

645
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,802
It was so nice the other day.

646
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,137
What do you think?

647
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,389
Okay.

648
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,266
You're in too, right?

649
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,018
Of course, she is.

650
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:57,523
Ms. Oh seemed
really fond of the detective.

651
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,857
Right?

652
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,776
Right.

653
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,487
Everyone is busy, right?
Let's get going now.

654
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,906
-Okay. I'll get going.
-Bye.

655
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,991
-Bye.
-Okay.

656
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,834
Please check the alibis
of the two suspects.

657
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,044
Yes, sir.

658
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,848
Please wait.

659
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,939
Let me ask you a question…

660
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,693
one last time.

661
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,830
Why…

662
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,421
Why did you abandon me?

663
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,092
It's no special story.

664
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,889
I dated recklessly
and got pregnant by mistake.

665
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,517
I was scared of what others would think

666
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,936
and didn't want to take responsibility.

667
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,900
You must've expected
a heartrending story, but that's all.

668
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:25,902
So…

669
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,363
don't get so hung up on it

670
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,199
and move on with your life.

671
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,536
As I have so far,

672
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,539
I want to live quietly.

673
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,002
Okay.

674
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,756
I understand perfectly.

675
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,689
I'm back.

676
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,570
Geum-hui.

677
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:33,864
Hey.

678
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,242
What are you so deep in thought about?

679
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,163
It's nothing.

680
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:45,375
By the way, Dong-u fell asleep
while watching a movie with my husband,

681
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,501
so I put him to bed.

682
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,587
Thank you.

683
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,338
You came later than I expected.

684
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,133
I can't find a good unit.

685
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,053
It looks like Ms. Heo told
the estate agents about me.

686
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,847
They wouldn't even show me properties.

687
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,475
Perhaps I should move to Oksan.

688
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,268
It must be hard.

689
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,437
Oksan?

690
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,397
Yes.

691
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,650
I really don't want to start over
in another town.

692
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,362
At first, settling down here was so hard.

693
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,198
Really?

694
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,326
Customers would praise me
for my hairdressing skills

695
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,454
and stop coming upon finding out
that I was a single mom.

696
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,876
It was so exhausting
since they pointed fingers at me.

697
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,754
It must've been hard.

698
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,926
Raising a child alone
couldn't have been easy.

699
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,095
It wasn't easy.

700
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,474
When I got pregnant with Dong-u,

701
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,520
the father ignored me.

702
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,856
My parents were against me having him.

703
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,944
That was why I moved out
and settled down here.

704
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,864
Nothing was easy.

705
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,618
I cried a lot.

706
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,372
But when I cried,
people looked down on me.

707
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,375
That was why I began to laugh more.

708
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:13,296
I thought, "Let's just laugh
and say what's on my mind."

709
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,260
Have you ever regretted…

710
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,098
your decision?

711
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,772
No, never.

712
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,985
At first, I laughed to seem strong.

713
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,863
But raising Dong-u

714
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:42,534
has given me
so many things to laugh about.

715
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,252
Mom.

716
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,338
-My Dong-u, you're awake.
-Yes.

717
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,340
-Did you have a bad dream?
-Yes.

718
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,385
It's okay. Let's sleep together.

719
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,180
I heard that you watched a fun movie
with Mr. Choi today.

720
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,473
What did you watch?

721
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,752
Why…

722
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,591
Why did you abandon me?

723
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,805
Okay.

724
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,517
I understand perfectly.

725
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,873
Do-hyeon.

726
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,169
Do-hyeon.

727
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,507
Do-hyeon!

728
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,845
What's wrong?

729
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,475
You're burning up.

730
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,727
One moment.

731
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:42,589
Why didn't you call me
when you're so sick?

732
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,967
Are you getting angry at a sick person?

733
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,178
No.

734
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,390
Things are hard, right?

735
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:01,232
I'll get better soon.
You don't need to worry.

736
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,027
I won't.

737
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,699
When I first learned about your story,

738
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:14,329
my heart ached, and I felt bad for you.

739
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,041
The one and only dependable ally
who'll never change.

740
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,877
I realized you didn't have that.

741
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,380
However,

742
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,675
I don't feel sorry for you at all now.

743
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,428
I can be that person.

744
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,307
I'll be that person.

745
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,485
We're out of medicine.
Let me go to the pharmacy.

746
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,445
Get some shut-eye.

747
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,376
Here's the order form.

748
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,920
Thanks. I'm sorry
that I made you come here.

749
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,755
-It's okay.
-Man, I've got to hurry.

750
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,175
Hello.

751
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,137
Do you need something?

752
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,639
Yes.

753
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:18,726
I think it's sickness due to fatigue.
Can you get me fever medicine and such?

754
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,312
What? You look fine.

755
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,273
Who's sick? Min-ho?

756
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,025
No.

757
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,238
Is the detective sick?

758
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,950
Yes.

759
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,828
How did such a young man get sick?

760
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,329
Please wait.

761
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,136
Wait.

762
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,433
Ms. Oh.

763
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,526
Well…

764
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,533
Is he very sick?

765
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,830
His fever broke.

766
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,336
You know, right?

767
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,177
I know

768
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,264
that you must resent me
and think I'm cold-hearted.

769
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,518
I don't know enough about you
to have such thoughts.

770
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,895
I don't think that way.

771
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,235
I was flustered.

772
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,822
It's been way too long.

773
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,453
I wanted to ask him how his life has been.

774
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,749
But what's the point?

775
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:09,796
I thought it'd be best
to live separately as we have so far.

776
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:17,345
In any case, he grew up to be
an upright and respectable man.

777
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,268
Remember what happened
with the owner of the video rental shop?

778
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,938
Detective Kim was

779
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:31,067
after the culprit because he thought
that he was a victim of that case.

780
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,320
He believed
that he got kidnapped as a baby

781
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,658
and that his parents must be
looking for him desperately.

782
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,079
For many years, he thought
that he was abandoned.

783
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,957
But he thought
that it might not be the case

784
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,543
and got hopeful.

785
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,256
Do-hyeon

786
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,343
did grow up
to be an upright and respectable man.

787
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:05,143
But he desperately waited
to meet his mom for many years.

788
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,608
I don't know what to do.

789
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,821
My husband doesn't know anything.

790
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,782
He has lived in ignorance all his life,

791
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,534
but if

792
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:26,414
he finds out that I had a baby
before marrying him, he'd--

793
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,375
Mr. Choi, what are you doing there?

794
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,566
So you have

795
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,944
a son.

796
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,991
And it's that detective.

797
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,285
Yes.

798
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,998
I only just found out recently.

799
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,255
I'm sorry.

800
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,553
I should've told you.

801
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,807
Was that why you didn't want a child?

802
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:29,894
In my life,

803
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:35,233
whenever I felt your sincere love for me,

804
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,277
my heart broke.

805
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,449
I thought about

806
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,037
how betrayed you'd feel
upon learning the truth.

807
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,751
I thought that you'd abandon me forever.

808
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,046
I did have a hunch.

809
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:01,926
What?

810
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:12,895
Where were the pliers?

811
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,649
Living in a house comes with so much work.

812
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,068
Perhaps we should move. Are they in here?

813
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,490
What's this?

814
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,996
What's this?
Is it a traditional cookie box?

815
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,081
I think it was just after our wedding.

816
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,586
Among your belongings,

817
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,922
I found baby clothes and a plushie.

818
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,551
I thought they weren't just nothing.

819
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,848
You didn't want a baby because
you wanted to live like a modern woman.

820
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,643
But whenever you saw a baby,

821
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:56,022
you got teary.

822
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,570
I thought

823
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,199
there must be a story.

824
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,204
Then…

825
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,248
Then why…

826
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,960
Why didn't I say anything?

827
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,255
Must you ask?

828
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:30,807
It seemed like
you wanted to keep it buried.

829
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,355
There was no other reason.

830
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:41,776
So,

831
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:47,990
if you're being hesitant because of me,

832
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,410
you don't need to be.

833
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,373
Honey.

834
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,423
You know,

835
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,345
my life has always
been complete because I had you.

836
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,349
I mean it.

837
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,486
You must've struggled by yourself
all these years.

838
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:28,990
Don't cry.

839
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:30,950
Stop crying.

840
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:36,956
You'll turn 60 soon,
but you still cry like a little girl.

841
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,251
It's okay.

842
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,097
Are you okay?

843
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,266
Is this…

844
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,776
What are you doing here?

845
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,074
There's something I want to say.

846
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:39,912
I feel like…

847
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:45,251
I didn't get to say
what I really wanted to tell you.

848
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,261
I'm sorry.

849
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,362
I'm sorry.

850
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,455
It's all Mommy's fault.

851
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,335
I'm so sorry.

852
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,340
I'm sorry.

853
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:35,152
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

854
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:39,698
About Do-hyeon, tell him to come by often.

855
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,702
He should start eating
his mom's tasty dishes.

856
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,163
You don't have much time.

857
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,873
It's next week.

858
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,043
You'll be transferred
to the Cold Cases Team.

859
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,628
It's so sudden.

860
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,380
It has been a few days.

861
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,091
Ms. Heo asked me to kick him out
of the pharmacy as well,

862
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:59,760
but I'm stalling time.

863
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,263
I'll end the relationship.

864
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,515
But there's a condition.

865
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,434
What does that mean?

866
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,687
What should we do?

867
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,480
I don't know

868
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,441
when we will be able to sell it again!

869
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:22,074
