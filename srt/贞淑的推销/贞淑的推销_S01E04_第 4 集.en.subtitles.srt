Detective Kim,
are you back from questioning?

4
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,009
-Yes.
-I put the enlarged photo you requested

5
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,219
on your desk.

6
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,680
I put notes
from the forensics team on it too.

7
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,765
Thank you.

FORENSICS REPORT

10
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,314
Hello, this is Detective Kim Do-hyeon.

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,441
Hello, detective.

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,403
I think I found the culprit.

13
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,866
Who is it?

14
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,402
Let's go.

JANGAN HARDWARE

16
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,459
That's it?

17
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,337
How do you know
that this is my English handwriting?

18
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,132
Did you study everyone's handwriting here?

19
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:58,177
How can a few rushed letters be evidence?

20
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,471
My husband was at the store all day.

21
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,225
He didn't set foot
anywhere near her place.

22
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,144
Are you sure?

23
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,770
Of course, I'm sure.

24
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,647
Why would I go to her house?

25
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,985
Then why is there evidence
that you were at Jeong-suk's house?

26
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,781
There were many footprints
in front of her house.

27
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,826
They're from size-280 military boots.

28
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,788
They're an exact match
for your boots, which are rare these days.

29
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,294
Do you need to hear more?

30
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,965
Say something.

31
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,344
Well?

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
Did you really do it?

33
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,432
Why?

34
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,059
Why did you do it?

35
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,230
I was disgusted.

36
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,526
You were selling such vulgar items

37
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,696
and being a bad influence on my wife.

38
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,075
I did it so you'd feel
the shame you deserve.

39
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,495
Mister.

40
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,247
Have you gone insane?

41
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,456
Are you crazy?

42
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,917
How could you do that

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,796
to someone we see around town
all the time?

44
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,509
You give me the shivers.

45
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,470
Jeong-suk is the one
that gives you the shivers!

46
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,181
I see you're still selling those
even after what happened.

47
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,935
You seem to have a lot to say.

48
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,063
Come to the station,
and I'll give you plenty of time to talk.

49
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,066
I can't believe you.

50
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,569
Jeong-suk.

51
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,906
I'm sorry. I'll talk some sense into him.

52
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,995
Please forgive him.

53
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,623
I'm begging you.

54
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,891
He should apologize
before I can forgive him.

55
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,944
Apologize to me.

56
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,488
I won't leave before you do.

57
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,505
Are you all right?

58
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,136
Yes. I had to twist his arm,
but I did get an apology.

59
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,390
It's just…

60
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:55,063
sad to see a relationship
go sour so quickly.

61
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,692
I've known them for a while.

62
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,155
They helped us when we moved.

63
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,453
Tae-sik used to be a sweet neighbor
that would give Min-ho candies.

64
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,122
Is that why you let them off?

65
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,833
Without any punishment?

66
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,339
No.

67
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,926
I think the punishment

68
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,845
has already begun.

69
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,515
What?

70
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,768
Even if I don't say anything,
people will find out soon.

71
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,356
Judging looks from neighbors,

72
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,608
public condemnations,

73
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,944
and humiliation.

74
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,282
I think

75
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,078
that's the true punishment.

76
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,962
Was that too cold of me to say?

77
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,297
It's not cold.

78
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,135
It's cool.

79
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,223
-Excuse me?
-Let's hope they're properly punished.

80
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,860
CHARMING HAIR SALON

81
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,069
A woman should…

82
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,279
CLOSED EVERY TUESDAY
I NEED A BREAK TOO

83
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,198
-What are you doing?
-Hold on a sec!

84
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,367
Cold water!

85
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,077
Here's cold water.

86
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,287
Ju-ri?

87
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,291
Gosh, Seong-sil! You can't do that!

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,170
Gosh, it's my day off.

89
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,756
What? 100,000 won more?

90
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,550
What are you so shocked about?

91
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,762
I heard New York Salon in town center

92
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,890
pays a monthly rent of 300,000 won.

93
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,142
But that's a new building
and a lot bigger.

94
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,978
So you're saying this place
is shabby and cramped?

95
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,855
It's not that.

96
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,192
I noticed yesterday
that you had tons of customers.

97
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,068
To be perfectly honest,

98
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:11,866
your skills aren't that good.

99
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,744
You're only successful
because the salon is in a great location.

100
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,248
I know.

101
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,918
I owe it to you
for renting me a good spot.

102
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,379
But Dong-u just started school,

103
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,466
so paying 300,000 won so suddenly
is too much for me.

104
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,969
Is it?

105
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,139
I suppose it would be bad

106
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:40,144
to force a rent raise
on a tenant as a landlord.

107
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,648
Thank you for understanding.

108
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,150
It's no problem at all.

109
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,655
I have no desire
to force a higher rent on you.

110
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,783
So let's close up the store

111
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,326
and be at peace, all right?

112
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,747
-What?
-Tons of people are interested

113
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,998
in this spot.

114
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:06,921
You don't have to worry
that it might stay vacant after you leave.

115
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,965
I'll be going now.

116
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,967
Wait, Ms. Heo.

117
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,051
Ms. Heo!

118
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,850
-That's what I found.
-Really?

119
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,853
-Let's hang out later.
-Sure.

120
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,399
Mom!

121
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,525
Dong-u!

122
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,111
-Hello.
-Hi, Min-ho.

123
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,379
Is it your first time playing dalgona?

124
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,547
Yes.

125
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,674
It'll break if you do it like that.

126
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,801
Look and learn.

127
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,469
Lick the back.

128
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,098
Hold it up to the sun.

129
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,935
Lick it more to melt it.

130
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,815
It broke.

131
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,615
Who cares if you win and get another one?

132
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,618
If you like free stuff, you'll go bald.

133
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,126
Mom, you've seemed off since before.

134
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,878
Is something wrong?

135
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,630
No, it's nothing.

136
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,716
I think you're lying.

137
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,428
I just want to make a lot of money.

138
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,601
Mr. Kim Deuk-chul, a man in his 30s
living in Geumho-dong in Seoul,

139
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,188
opened an accessories shop
as his side hustle

140
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,856
and made a ton of money.

141
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,611
Maybe you need a side hustle too?

142
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,072
I told you to stop
reading those magazines.

143
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,079
I did it!

144
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,290
Wow! Mister, we get another one, right?

145
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,376
One more!

146
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,588
-One more!
-One more!

147
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,383
One more!

148
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,970
-One more!
-One more!

149
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,764
A side hustle.

150
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,099
I had fun today.

151
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,434
Me too.
I always have so much fun with you.

152
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,894
Hello, ladies!

153
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,813
-Hello.
-Hello.

154
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,773
Are you heading to Jeong-suk's place?

155
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,650
Did you hear the news too?

156
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,276
I can't believe it.

157
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,695
What happened?

158
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,833
My goodness.

159
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,545
It must've been a big mess
given that you repainted it all.

160
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,464
-I know.
-How did you find out?

161
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,344
We heard on the way back
from picking up more products to sell.

162
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,682
Next time, tell us
if something like this happens.

163
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:09,353
We can't resolve anything,
but we can curse them out with you.

164
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,896
That's right.

165
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,983
He did it because he was disgusted?

166
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,694
He's the disgusting one here.

167
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,611
I know.

168
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,530
I bought floor tape there the other night.

169
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,323
Should I use it

170
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,576
-to tape up his mouth?
-Please.

171
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,203
Or should I write the same word s…

172
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,622
-right on his forehead?
-What did you say?

173
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:30,958
"Thex."

174
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,090
I'm relieved to see you smiling.

175
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,259
As she should.

176
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,635
The hardware store will fail,

177
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,471
and this business will prosper.

178
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,972
Why?

179
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,350
I'm planning to join you.

180
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,477
-What?
-What?

181
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,978
You are?

182
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,439
You said you were too busy with the salon.

183
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,859
Saving my energy for the salon
might cost me the salon.

184
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,861
Ms. Heo is raising the rent.

185
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,032
I'll advertise to my customers
and host sales events on my days off.

186
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,618
-Yes, that's great!
-Yes.

187
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,997
Not your rent going up. You joining us.

188
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,542
I think the four of us
can achieve great things.

189
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,170
Right, Jeong-suk?

190
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,258
Yes.

191
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,761
Good choice.

192
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,599
It's so pretty.

193
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,353
Are those bubbles?

194
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,147
They're pretty.

195
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,483
-The kids have fun together.
-I know.

196
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,820
What a relief.

197
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,823
You're closing it as a civil case?

198
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,035
Yes, the victim, Ms. Han Jeong-suk,
didn't want a harsh punishment.

199
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,330
She also resolved the issue
with her landlord.

200
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,874
They reached a settlement
faster than I expected.

201
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,669
-Yes.
-She probably wanted to avoid trouble.

202
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,003
They live close by,

203
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,881
and everything in the hardware store
can be a murder weapon.

204
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,926
She must have been scared of revenge.

205
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,344
No.

206
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,263
She isn't that weak.

207
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,639
What?

208
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,228
Anyway, I handled it wisely.

209
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,272
"Wisely"?

210
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,023
Yes.

211
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,735
What's this?

212
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,113
Did you just give me a side-eye?

213
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:27,867
I would never.

214
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,915
You know Detective Kim is always frowning.

215
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,086
This was quick and easy. I like it.

216
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,630
All right.

217
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,965
How about this?

218
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,094
Let's go for a team dinner
to welcome Detective Kim.

219
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:51,098
It will be more meaningful
if Detective Kim pays.

220
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,143
Then instead of going
to Granny's Spicy Pork,

221
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,729
let's get a light dinner of beef ribs.

222
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,772
There's a new beef ribs place nearby.

223
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,191
Beef ribs sound good.

224
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,610
I love beef ribs!

225
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,822
I'm not feeling well today,
so I'm going home right after.

226
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,242
Oh, really?

227
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,745
Then we'll go by ourselves.

228
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,288
All right.

229
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,207
-We're still getting beef, right?
-Are you paying?

230
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,960
There's nothing better than
Granny's Spicy Pork for a team dinner!

231
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,606
POLICE ARCHIVE

232
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,199
Be careful.

233
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,287
When you get home, Grandma will be here.
I have to go to work.

234
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,580
I know.

235
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,753
I have three colleagues now.

236
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,213
Wow.

237
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,549
But what work do you do, Mom?

238
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,759
What?

239
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,014
Well, I sell things.

240
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,308
What kind of things?

241
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,936
Well…

242
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,190
Well, the thing is…

243
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,484
I…

244
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,697
I sell items that adults use.

245
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,202
You're going to be late!
Hurry along to school.

246
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,538
I'm not late at all.

247
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,083
I have to get ready for work.
Go to school with Dong-u, quick.

248
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,461
Let's go. Go on!

249
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,504
Mom, good luck!

250
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,714
Thank you!

251
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,551
Gosh.

252
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,247
I look like a proper working woman.

253
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,424
It's nice not to worry about what to wear.

254
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,712
We'll do well.

255
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,214
I agree.

256
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:20,849
Now that I have the products in hand,
it really feels like I'm starting this.

257
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,894
I know. We'll only get busier.

258
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,481
So, what do we do now?

259
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,236
What should we do now?

260
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,364
Jeong-suk, what should we do?

261
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,537
Let's discuss that now.

262
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:50,170
Now that all four of us are here,
we can have meetings, share ideas,

263
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,588
and work systematically.

264
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,382
-Systematically.
-Agreed.

265
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,591
That's a good idea.

266
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,718
We can start brainstorming now.

267
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,722
Can we share our ideas freely

268
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,307
and not make it complicated?

269
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,643
I was saying the same thing.

270
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,941
Did you know that?

271
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,403
What? Of course I did.
Who wouldn't know that?

272
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,321
It's the "brain" thing.

273
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,994
Let's share our ideas freely.

274
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,078
Sure, let's.

275
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,766
Maybe something sweet
will make us think better?

276
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,779
IDEA

277
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,451
They say starting is half the battle.

278
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,161
We may not have a good plan yet,

279
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,830
but if we keep talking,
we might think of something.

280
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,917
Just a minute.

281
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,296
Who is it?

282
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,923
Cosmetics, ma'am!

283
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,508
My goodness, I completely forgot!

284
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,886
What is it?

285
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,139
I ran out of cosmetics.

286
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,017
I called an in-home sales rep
for cosmetics and a massage.

287
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,644
I forgot that was today.

288
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,021
That's okay.

289
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,982
Let's all think about it more at home

290
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,026
and meet again tomorrow.

291
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,111
Wait.

292
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,866
If it's okay with you,
what if we all get massages?

293
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,369
Us too?

294
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,041
Thanks to Ms. Oh,

295
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,502
we're getting such a treat.

296
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,339
The room is warm, and it smells lovely.

297
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,885
Lying here is making me so sleepy.

298
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,347
I often doze off while getting a massage.

299
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,933
It makes me feel more rested.

300
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,185
She's the one who needs sleep the most.

301
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,354
Her skin's so rough,
probably from a lack of sleep.

302
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,856
What a waste of such a beautiful face.

303
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,401
Give me your face
if you're going to waste it.

304
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,737
She's had a lot of stress lately,

305
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,614
so she must have lost sleep.

306
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,533
That's understandable.

307
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,660
Jeong-suk, take a nap.

308
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,246
I want to,

309
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,623
but I'm a light sleeper

310
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,959
and can't sleep unless I'm home.

311
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,255
So you never dozed off in school either?

312
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,216
No, never.

313
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,095
She speaks so elegantly,

314
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,597
so I figured she must've been
a good student.

315
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,516
That's very impressive.

316
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,809
I slept so much in class,

317
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,729
my teacher joked that I should pay rent.

318
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,443
Even when I was teaching,
I never had a student not doze off.

319
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,071
You were a teacher?

320
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,406
Briefly before getting married.

321
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,995
Anyway, it'd be nice if Jeong-suk
could nap during the massage.

322
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,913
It's too bad, Jeong-suk.

323
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,416
No need to feel bad.

324
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,585
What?

325
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,712
She's sleeping like a baby.

326
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,891
Oh, my skin is so tight.

327
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,020
-Really?
-She's out cold.

328
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,822
What?

329
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,699
Did you have a good nap?

330
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,580
I must've dozed off for a bit.

331
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,124
It was more than "a bit."

332
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,709
You slept for two whole hours!

333
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,794
What?

334
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,630
There's no way I slept two hours.

335
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,633
It's good. You needed it.

336
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,720
Please fill out
this one-page survey for me.

337
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,430
Headquarters makes me do it.

338
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,557
Finish it and you get double the samples.

339
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,895
CUSTOMER SURVEY

340
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,107
Why do they do this?

341
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:25,112
To find out what people like or dislike
about a product or service.

342
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,782
They do it every year
saying the data helps increase sales.

343
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,534
Please fill it out for me.

344
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,494
I will.

345
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,624
Thank you for today. I'll be in touch.

346
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

347
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,589
If we use this sparingly,
this could last half a year.

348
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,007
You used a lot.

349
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,342
Take some of mine too.

350
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,136
No, I can't do that. You use it.

351
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,388
-I want to try this one too.
-Sure!

352
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,515
Here.

353
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,268
What if we try that too?

354
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,896
In-home cosmetics sales?

355
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:04,276
But I just got adult products to sell.
We're changing already?

356
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,736
No, a survey.

357
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,531
The sales rep earlier said

358
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,034
it shows what people like or dislike
in products and services.

359
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,079
We need to know that first
to increase sales.

360
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,915
Our business needs that too.

361
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,750
You have a point.

362
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,171
I thought people would feel awkward
because these are adult products.

363
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,549
If we know the exact reason,
it'll help our sales strategy.

364
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,633
Yes.

365
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,178
Jeong-suk's so smart!

366
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,182
It's probably because
this sensitive person got so much sleep.

367
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,646
I took an extra survey earlier.

368
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,858
Let's adapt it
so that it fits our products.

369
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,235
Okay. I'll bring the typewriter.

370
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,868
-Thank you.
-Take care.

371
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,389
PARK SO-YEONG

372
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,121
PRINT SHOP

373
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,508
Shall we meet at Ju-ri's salon
after surveying our assigned areas?

374
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,676
Sure thing.

375
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,302
-Good luck.
-Good luck!

376
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,220
See you later!

377
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,724
Let's do the supermarket area.

378
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,851
Okay. By the way, this…

379
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,905
I'll get a survey from this store.

380
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,990
Sure.

381
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,171
Ms. Oh!

382
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,590
What style are you looking for today?

383
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,758
Actually,

384
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,637
I'm here today to ask for a favor.

385
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,888
A favor?

386
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,519
I'm doing a survey for my new business.

387
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,022
Could you fill this out for me?

388
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,233
-Gosh, you started a business?
-That's right.

389
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,484
My goodness.

390
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,153
What is that?

391
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,572
Ms. Heo.

392
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,991
What's the business?

393
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,618
What business did you start, Geum-hui?

394
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,208
These high-class ladies are so secretive.

395
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,335
Let me see.

396
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,338
Let's take a look.

397
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,884
"Fantasy Lingerie Survey." What?

398
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,972
Adult products?

399
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,185
Geum-hui, you're in this business?

400
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,773
Yes, that's right. I'm doing it too.

401
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:33,318
Geez, I had no idea.

402
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,571
You should've told me earlier.

403
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,782
-Excuse me?
-If you had,

404
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,785
I would have…

405
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,205
stayed away from you.

406
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,831
That's just how I feel.

407
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:52,128
It makes me a little uncomfortable
that people lump us into the same class.

408
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,630
This is great.

409
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:57,258
Ms. Park, take this opportunity
to spread the word.

410
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,012
Tell people Geum-hui and I
have grown distant.

411
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,181
Please.

412
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,936
Trying to sell this stuff
around the neighborhood.

413
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,313
Goodness. How vulgar.

414
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,823
-You know how…
-Hello.

415
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,241
Hello.

416
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,201
Hey, Jeong-suk.

417
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,787
We're doing a survey
regarding our in-home sales.

418
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,831
If you have a quick moment…

419
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,960
Gosh, my eyes are tearing up.

420
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,254
-I should go.
-What time is it?

421
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,338
I don't know.

422
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,714
-You can go.
-Bye.

423
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,341
-I'm taking off too.
-Sure.

424
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,801
-Bye.
-See you.

425
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,511
-See you.
-Bye.

426
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,266
Oh, I forgot.

427
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,310
I have to make dinner for my husband.

428
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,616
STAR VIDEO RENTAL

429
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,830
-Hello.
-Hello.

430
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,331
Welcome, children.

431
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,708
CHO SUN-AE

432
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,885
When in doubt, pick the cheaper one.

433
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,304
Ureme Six is 500 won.

434
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,223
Syupeo Hong Gil-dong is newer,
so it's 1,000 won.

435
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,475
Really?

436
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,185
Then I'll borrow Ureme.

437
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:37,275
-Return it by the day after tomorrow.
-Okay.

438
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,819
Here.

439
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,446
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

440
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,072
Bye now!

441
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,283
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

442
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,079
Hello. I'm from Geumje Police Station.

443
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,291
I know you.

444
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,960
You're the handsome detective.

445
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,173
I'm Detective Kim Do-hyeon.

446
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,717
I'm just here

447
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,304
to ask a few questions
about a case I'm investigating.

448
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,181
Do you have a few minutes to spare?

449
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,392
I'm usually very busy.

450
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,730
Today, I have some spare time
since I put the posters up already.

451
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,856
Sure.

452
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,069
I hear you've lived
in Geumje for a long time.

453
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:21,986
Yes.

454
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:27,700
Was there a big fire in town
about 30 years ago?

455
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,537
A fire 30 years ago?

456
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,999
I do remember one incident.

457
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,129
My youngest sibling

458
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,007
was playing with friends
when his shoe caught on fire.

459
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,677
And his shoe burned to ashes.

460
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,928
And so,

461
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,015
they were all beaten to a pulp.

462
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,936
Anything besides that?

463
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,437
Besides that?

464
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,897
-Like--
-Hello.

465
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,151
Hello.

466
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,904
What are you doing here?

467
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,033
We're doing a survey
for our in-home sales business.

468
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,078
I'm very busy right now.

469
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,373
I have to replace all the posters.

470
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,422
Could you respond
to questions while you work then?

471
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,465
I said I won't do it.

472
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,845
I'm having an important conversation
with the detective.

473
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,181
Oh, okay.

474
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,142
Get going then.

475
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,769
All right. Take care.

476
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,827
You scared me.

477
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,788
What is it?

478
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,916
Were you waiting for me?

479
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,917
Yes.

480
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,087
I'm doing a survey for my work.

481
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,505
Are you very busy?

482
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:09,802
I'm on the clock so can't spare any time.

483
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,472
It won't take long. Just 15 minutes?

484
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,514
I'm sorry.

485
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,432
Then ten minutes!

486
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,559
I can wrap it up in five.

487
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,436
I really can.

488
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,156
Just five minutes, then.

489
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,808
All right.

490
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,352
Since you're busy,

491
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,646
I'll only ask you the key questions.

492
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,531
Four minutes and thirty seconds left.

493
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,366
Yes, all right.

494
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,493
"Does dildo know who you are?"

495
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,870
What?

496
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,544
I mean… Never mind.

497
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,841
"Do you know what a dildo is?"

498
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,809
I know what it is.

499
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,896
I saw a wide range of products

500
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,733
when I helped you pick it up.

501
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,942
Right.

502
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,362
Next question.

503
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,034
This is the next question.

504
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,078
"Of the following adult products,

505
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,956
which would you be
most interested in buying?

506
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,792
One, a vibrator. Two, a dildo.

507
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,712
Three, a G-string.
Four, a flavored condom."

508
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,425
-None of the above.
-Okay.

509
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,928
So, "Six, no interest in purchasing."

510
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,932
Yes, this one. Next.

511
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,352
"Where are your sexual fantasies set?

512
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,605
One, the bedroom. Two, the bathroom.

513
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,731
Three, at work.

514
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,733
Four, outdoors, like a beach or forest.

515
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,234
Five, other."

516
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,032
Do I have to answer that?

517
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:43,664
In case you're concerned,
I'd like to let you know

518
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,751
we guarantee your anonymity
in this survey.

519
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,462
No one will know what your answers are.

520
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,922
But you know.

521
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,590
What was that?

522
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,051
It's nothing. Please continue.

523
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,178
All right.

524
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,055
Here's the next question.

525
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,307
Which adult product…

526
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,683
Number three.

527
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,019
Wait, number four.

528
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,396
Number two. Three. Wait.

529
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,651
Number one.

530
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:13,986
Three.

531
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,701
TRAFFIC LIGHT HARD CANDY

532
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,832
I was worried about our low response rate,

533
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,416
so thank you.

534
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,504
I wanted to give you something,
but I only had the candy I got for Min-ho.

535
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,681
Thank you so much.

536
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,351
I'll head off first. Thank you.

537
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,604
Excuse me! Hello!

538
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,690
Do you have a few minutes?

539
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,650
Hello.

540
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:57,071
I'm doing a survey.
It only takes 15 minutes.

541
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,490
No, it'll take ten. Five is fine, too.

542
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,161
I must not be a convincing speaker.

543
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,871
That's not it.

544
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,583
I've been talking a mile a minute,
but everyone ignores me.

545
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,835
Take care!

546
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,004
Ladies!

547
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,172
Ju-ri.

548
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,633
You sound upbeat.

549
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,760
You must've gotten many responses.

550
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,345
Oh, well, I got…

551
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,598
one.

552
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,893
-You too?
-You guys too?

553
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,856
-Everyone's pretending to be busy.
-Tell me about it.

554
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,483
I didn't expect that
they'd welcome us with open arms,

555
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,319
but this is too much.

556
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,113
What if Jeong-suk scolds us later?

557
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,993
Maybe it would be better
to go together than to split up?

558
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,369
-Yes.
-Should we do that?

559
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,957
The butcher shop was closed earlier.

560
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,000
Let's go there.

561
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,211
Let's get just one more.

562
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,629
Great idea.

563
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,297
Let's go to the butcher shop.

564
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,398
-Hello.
-Hello.

565
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,983
Hello.

566
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,694
What are the three of you
doing here all together?

567
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,238
What can I get you?

568
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,450
We want to ask for a favor.

569
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,453
Hold on. Let me get that call first.

570
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,621
-Sure.
-We'll be here.

571
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,705
-Okay.
-Take your time.

572
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,792
-The meat here is always so fresh.
-Right.

573
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,709
Go ahead.

574
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,630
-Should I buy some meat?
-Can you?

575
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,548
Is the butcher out?

576
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:43,552
She's on the phone.

577
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,013
I see. Oh, look at that.

578
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,682
Should I ask those ladies too?

579
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,101
That's a great idea.

580
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,019
-Did you hear that?
-What?

581
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,688
The vandalism on Min-ho's house

582
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,564
was done by Mr. Jang
from the hardware store.

583
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,191
I heard.

584
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,027
The rumors are already spreading.

585
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,195
You're right.

586
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,614
My husband feels for them too.

587
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,742
How upset Mr. Jang must be.

588
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,829
Mr. Jang is always so upright.

589
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:14,834
He must've been so frustrated and angry
to have done something like that.

590
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,170
I heard that woman
pulled all sorts of devious tricks

591
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,214
to sell her lewd things

592
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,718
and Mr. Jang's wife spent
a fortune on them.

593
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,803
Any husband would be angry.

594
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,846
You're so right.

595
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,974
If my husband saw me doing that,

596
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,978
he wouldn't stop at vandalism.
He'd burn the house down and then some.

597
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,397
You're right.

598
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,817
Shouldn't the town ladies
call a town meeting

599
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,778
to force her to stop that business?

600
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,779
They should!

601
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,947
-Excuse me!
-Excuse me!

602
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,199
-That scared me!
-Geez!

603
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,744
What was that? You all in a choir or what?

604
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,081
Watch what you say.

605
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,752
Choose the right side to be on.

606
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,839
It's obvious who the victim
and the criminal are.

607
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,758
If your heads are on straight,

608
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,218
you'd never think like that.

609
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,762
What a mess!

610
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,013
Hold on.

611
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,351
You're saying
we're not in our right minds?

612
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,436
Is that it?

613
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,022
How obnoxious!

614
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:22,193
Do you need me to teach you a lesson?

615
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,236
Move aside.

616
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:31,660
Everyone was born with a mouth,
so we can talk this out.

617
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,164
Why are you turning this
into a show of strength?

618
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,250
What's this lesson you want to teach?

619
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,086
Show us.

620
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,337
I'm so curious.

621
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,130
How dare you.

622
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,633
You really want to learn it?

623
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,928
She's really going to hit you.

624
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,264
We're not scared of you at all.

625
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,350
There's three of us.

626
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,980
I quit fighting.

627
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,359
There's three of us.

628
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,798
Are they retired athletes?

629
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,760
Oh, no. You have a nosebleed!

630
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,887
-Blood! It's a nosebleed!
-You're bleeding!

631
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,432
-You're bleeding!
-Her grip was incredibly strong.

632
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:38,018
I don't think she's an ordinary person!

633
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,186
She definitely isn't.

634
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,729
Yeong-bok.

635
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,400
How could you hide behind me at the end?

636
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,988
I hurt my back last time, so I…

637
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,990
I'm sorry.

638
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,242
It must have hurt a lot.

639
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:58,414
What they said hurt me more
than the hair they pulled out.

640
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,457
I know.

641
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,461
It's even more frustrating
that all the women here are in on it.

642
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,212
That's why everyone avoided us.

643
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,464
Right.

644
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:11,051
If it's upsetting to us,
what will happen if Jeong-suk finds out?

645
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,762
We can never let her find out.

646
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,348
I'm sure Jeong-suk was rejected a lot.

647
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,517
Yes. I'm sure.

648
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,685
Yes.

649
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,314
She's being rejected even as we speak.

650
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,068
-When you take a look…
-No.

651
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:40,789
What?

652
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,334
-Quick, tidy up!
-Oh no.

653
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,669
Oh, my gosh!

654
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,549
What happened? Your hair looks…

655
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,968
Did you get into a fight?

656
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,930
The thing is…

657
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,226
Amongst ourselves!

658
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,393
-Yes.
-Yes.

659
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,313
Why?

660
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:09,985
It was over something petty.

661
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,405
-It was an accident, right?
-Yes.

662
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,115
Of course.

663
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,701
People usually get closer after fighting.

664
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,748
We made up quickly,
and now we're even closer.

665
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,832
-Yes.
-Yes.

666
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,085
It's the result that's important.

667
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,127
-Right!
-Spin.

668
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,422
Now we're good friends.

669
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,344
Just be honest with me.

670
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,138
Something happened, right?

671
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,438
Wow. I'll enjoy it.

672
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,568
The strawberries aren't sour at all.
They're so sweet.

673
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,821
-I bought them.
-Is that so?

674
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,239
My wife loves them.

675
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,324
That was why he bought them.

676
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,826
JANGAN HARDWARE

677
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,578
-Thank you!
-Good night.

678
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,955
He's so sweet.

679
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,583
He's trying to comfort me
after making me so upset.

680
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,420
I saw Min-ho's mom was doing a survey.

681
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,463
Did you all do it?

682
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,049
-No way.
-Are you insane?

683
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,011
I made an excuse that I was busy.

684
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,888
In a way, she's impressive.

685
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:24,518
She's still trying
to sell those things after all that.

686
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,728
You're right.

687
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:31,066
She may not look it,
but I think Jeong-suk's a tough cookie.

688
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,194
Maybe that's why her husband left her.

689
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,947
-What?
-What? He left her?

690
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,159
I heard it from her landlord.

691
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,079
It's been a while since he left.

692
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,958
My goodness! So even with that mess,

693
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,085
she still hasn't gotten her act together?

694
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,212
Whether she's gotten
her act together or not,

695
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,923
she keeps causing trouble day after day.

696
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,176
She shouldn't sell in this town anymore.

697
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,137
-Oh, dear.
-Don't even go near her.

698
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,597
She should close up.

699
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,475
-Don't even tell her about it.
-True.

700
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,185
How considerate of you.

701
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,646
That's how you manage with him.

702
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,854
Ms. Han Jeong-suk?

703
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,187
What?

704
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,938
"A tough cookie"?

705
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,815
That's why my husband left?

706
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,109
What is she doing?

707
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,654
I only cause trouble?

708
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,241
And why?

709
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,160
Why do I have to hear that?

710
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,704
Close my business?

711
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,373
I won't. I can't!

712
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,924
Oh, no.

713
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,885
Geez.

714
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,813
Let's do this!

715
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,493
She really is a cool woman.

716
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:24,049
Where have you been
without saying anything in the morning?

717
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,014
I just did my revenge.

718
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,687
What do you mean?

719
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,816
What do you mean, "revenge"?

720
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:44,861
You couldn't sleep last night
since you were angry at the townspeople.

721
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,489
I had to do something.

722
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,450
They should know what happens
when they look down on others.

723
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,620
I had to show them.

724
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,503
So?

725
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,090
What did you do? What is this?

726
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,759
What is this?

727
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,386
What is it?

728
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,812
-Radishes?
-Yeah.

729
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,982
You said you needed some
to make cubed radish kimchi.

730
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,818
I didn't buy them here,
and I walked for 50 minutes

731
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,195
to buy them in another town.

732
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,532
This town lost the opportunity
to make 3,000 won.

733
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,534
We needed a new hammer too.

734
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,079
I bought one in that town.

735
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,331
Mr. Jang's place?

736
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,917
I took away Mr. Jang's chance

737
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,003
to make 2,000 won.

738
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:46,965
Just you wait and see.

739
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:53,013
I'll take my revenge
on each of them, one by one.

740
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,977
I see. Okay.

741
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,646
I'm proud of you.

742
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,523
You're the incarnation of revenge.

743
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:08,570
I bet everyone in the town
is scared to death now.

744
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,411
Now that I've had a break,
I'll go prepare the radishes.

745
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,746
Hey, you!

746
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,583
That pathetic fool.

747
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,752
He scared me.

748
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:25,837
That scared me.

749
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,466
Hello?

750
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,550
It's me.

751
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,637
Jeong-suk.

752
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,472
What are you up to?

753
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,226
Nothing. I'm just home.

754
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,022
You sound so upbeat.

755
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,233
I thought you'd be discouraged.

756
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,734
I'm all right.

757
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,653
There's nothing right around you.

758
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,698
You must be so upset right now.

759
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,076
You were just getting established.

760
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,869
You didn't do anything wrong,

761
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,247
but your business is
about to be shut down.

762
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,582
Whether the business closes or not…

763
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,045
is up to the owner.

764
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,093
Until the owner closes shop
and locks the doors,

765
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,469
it's not over.

766
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,179
Even if nothing sells,

767
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,932
if I sweep and dust the store
at the break of dawn,

768
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,851
then it means my business is open.

769
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,187
That's true.

770
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,107
I feel this is too unfair,

771
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,151
so I won't close my business over this.

772
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,695
I'll show them it's not over yet

773
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,615
as I sweep and dust my store.

777
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,025
I think we're almost ready.

778
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,028
Now, let's open up properly.

779
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,070
-Yes!
-Yes.

780
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,367
This place is really good!

781
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,495
-Isn't this tasty?
-Yes.

782
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,704
-I make them better.
-Oh?

783
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,831
-I'll ask my husband.
-Last time…

784
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,584
-With makgeolli no matter what.
-No way! Not makgeolli.

785
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,170
-Hello.
-Hello.

786
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,428
What are they up to?

787
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,642
There's something written there.
I can't see it.

788
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:48,897
"Fantasy Lingerie Customer Survey Event."

789
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,025
"Free high quality gift
for participating."

790
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:55,111
They're not done with this survey?

791
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,113
We only started yesterday.

792
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,741
If you have time, please take it.

793
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,661
We're giving out briefs as free gifts.

794
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:07,791
Only businesses that do well
give out free gifts like that.

795
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,544
No one here is interested.

796
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:14,840
I thought she'd have
changed her mind by now.

797
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:15,799
Excuse me?

798
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,758
By the way…

799
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,724
exactly how should I change my mind?

800
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,893
-What?
-I just…

801
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:32,148
need money to survive like you.

802
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,861
I've never harmed anyone

803
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,072
or harassed anyone,
so how should I change my mind?

804
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,827
I really don't understand.

805
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,973
Gosh, isn't this a Wangbangul product?

806
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,391
It is Wangbangul.

807
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:10,437
It's so soft.
Designer brands sure are different.

808
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,274
You would drink poison if it were free.

809
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,360
We won't force you to buy
if you don't like it,

810
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,904
so please stop this and go.

811
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,033
I'm busy. I should get going.

812
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,871
It's just a few questions.
Would you do it?

813
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,749
Yes, I'll take one
since I have some free time.

814
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,375
Here you go.

815
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,003
I'll take one too then.

816
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,296
I'm a size 100.

817
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,382
I'm a size 95.

818
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,009
Please take a seat here.

819
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,012
I'll be taking off then.

820
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,932
I'll go see Ms. Joo at the hardware store.

821
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,771
I'll go with you.

822
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,940
So we get one if we fill this out?

823
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,275
What do I have to do?

824
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,319
"Do you know

825
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,404
what a vibrator is?"

826
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,156
Do you know what a vibrator is?

827
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,200
You don't? Then choose "no."

828
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,868
"If you chose this answer,

829
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,828
-explain your choice."
-Hello.

830
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,622
-"Why 'no'?"
-We gave you free gifts.

831
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:14,292
-You just fill this out for free gifts.
-"No reason."

832
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,418
Take care.

833
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,671
It doesn't even take five minutes.

834
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,674
Hello. Please sit here.

835
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,926
What's your underwear size?

836
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,177
It's 95?

837
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,638
Have some coffee. We also have gifts.

838
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,473
It takes less than five minutes.

839
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,934
Goodbye.

840
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,942
-Hey. He's the son of the chairman.
-Really? Oh, my.

841
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,369
-Why?
-I mean…

842
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,829
Number three for question four.

843
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,348
We got more responses than I expected.

844
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,979
In-home sales is all about the freebies.

845
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:20,900
I'm sure the underwear cost a lot, though.

846
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,028
Will we make any profit?

847
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,656
Since Ms. Oh's a regular,
they gave us a discount.

848
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,868
We need to go strong on the next sale
to make up for the loss.

849
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:30,785
-I see.
-Yes.

850
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,456
But as Jeong-suk said,
it left a strong impression

851
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,791
that we'll never stop.

852
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,545
I think your personality
left a strong impression too.

853
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:45,175
The "how should I change my mind" thing.

854
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:48,136
I got scared
when your eyes were shooting sparks.

855
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,888
Me? My eyes were shooting sparks?

856
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,724
I did that? Sparks?

857
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,310
No, they weren't shooting sparks.

858
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,895
It was scary, though.

859
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,397
But I was smiling.

860
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,899
Let's wrap up!

861
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:01,983
-Sure.
-Yes.

862
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,527
-Yeong-bok and I will move the tables.
-Yes.

863
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,155
-I'll bring the chairs back to the pub.
-Okay.

864
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,698
-Table.
-Okay.

865
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,451
WONBONG PHARMACY

866
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,288
How was it?

867
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,166
They're cleaning up now.

868
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,709
Why?

869
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,586
"Why?"

870
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,214
They're making an embarrassing scene
in the middle of the town.

871
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,049
I can't pass by there!

872
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,843
I'm going to sneak by after they're gone.

873
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,970
But why?

874
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,806
I thought your wife looked cool.

875
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,933
Cool, my ass.

876
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,310
-I'm serious.
-What the…

877
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,773
She looked beautiful focusing on her work.

878
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,151
Shall we clock out now?

879
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,528
Stop right there.

880
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:52,617
You need to clean the floors first.

881
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,453
I finished it earlier.

882
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,163
Do it again.

883
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,707
Focus on your work

884
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,252
and do a beautiful job, okay?

885
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,011
How many times must I clean the floor?

886
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,931
I'll end up slipping on it.

887
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,308
Gosh.

888
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,061
Welcome.

889
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,479
Is the pharmacist gone?

890
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,524
He just left.

891
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,777
I hurt my finger
while clearing the tables,

892
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,070
so I'm here to buy bandages.

893
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,906
I can get you some.

894
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,326
Where are they?

895
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,289
That's 500 won.

896
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:42,959
Thank you.

897
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,883
I think you may need a haircut.

898
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,766
What?

899
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,185
Me? Oh, right.

900
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,061
Yes, I know.

901
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,731
I'll go to the barber shop soon.

902
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:06,858
The barber shop?

903
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,359
Yes.

904
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,945
Do you know I run
Charming Hair Salon right here?

905
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,491
I'm an expert at finding the right style.

906
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:19,078
I think you look like a celebrity.

907
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,830
I know what would fit you perfectly.

908
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,373
A celebrity?

909
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,792
Yes. He's…

910
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,171
You know, the one…

911
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:34,219
Don't leave with regrets…

912
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,386
-Shim Shin!
-Bingo!

913
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,890
You'd look good
with a Shim Shin-style shorter cut.

914
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,768
You think so?

915
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,645
Yes. Come by sometime.

916
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,197
I look like Shim Shin? No way.

917
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,841
You really think he looks like Shim Shin?

918
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,135
I couldn't see that at all.

919
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,721
Me neither.

920
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,349
What? Then why did you say so?

921
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,352
Well…

922
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,815
The same reason we had
a promotion in front of the store today.

923
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,483
To make money?

924
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,402
Yes.

925
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,116
Still, I shouldn't have lied
in front of my son, right?

926
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,868
It's okay. Parents aren't perfect people

927
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,829
but people who are trying to be good.

928
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:47,083
You were trying to be good to me,
so it's fine.

929
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,338
Woman Sense, April issue, right?

930
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,716
-Bingo!
-Bingo!

931
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,677
By the way, Shim Shin
is really going too far.

932
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,846
I'm sorry.

933
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,724
UPHOLD TRAFFIC LAWS
TO BE NUMBER ONE CITIZENS

934
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,520
Captain! I'm here.

935
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,940
What's with the fuss?

936
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:12,984
What's that?

937
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,695
The women selling adult products

938
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,990
were giving away free underwear
for taking their survey.

939
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:20,908
So I got one.

940
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,745
You did that while on the clock?

941
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,749
What is that? It's women's underwear.

942
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,001
I'll give it to my mother.

943
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:33,129
What a good son you are.

944
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,923
Doing a survey
instead of investigating cases.

945
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,926
Your mother will be so proud

946
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,180
that you brought home
two pairs of women's underwear.

947
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,057
One's for your wife.

948
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,144
You didn't have to do that.

949
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,775
I thought they'd go bust

950
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,902
trying to sell that in these backwaters.

951
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,112
But they're able to give these away?

952
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,156
They must be doing well.

953
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,742
You know who I am.
I went and did some research.

954
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,328
After the vandalism incident,

955
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,581
the townspeople refused
to associate with Han Jeong-suk,

956
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,875
saying she keeps causing trouble.

957
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,752
-Really?
-Yes.

958
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,838
"Ignore me if you want.
I'll just keep doing my thing."

959
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:19,175
With that attitude,
she handed out surveys and freebies.

960
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,052
Isn't she so persistent?

961
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:26,224
Why are you smiling?

962
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,226
You know something?

963
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,439
By any chance,

964
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,858
did you also take the survey?

965
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,819
Don't be ridiculous.

966
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,487
There's no way he did.

967
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:43,991
You think he'd answer
those absurd questions while on the clock?

968
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,493
Right?

969
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,248
I'm taking off.

970
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,332
Take care.

971
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:59,090
-I wish the color was prettier.
-Yeah.

972
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,551
And here's the last one.

973
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,345
It's written in English.

974
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,265
It's a trio called "Seo Taiji and Boys."

975
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:10,810
They're one of the rare teams that rap.

976
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,312
A big round of applause
for "I Know," please.

977
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:17,400
GEUMJE ELECTRONICS

978
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,021
Listen up, Mr. Seo Taiji.

979
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,732
This person says the melody
wasn't up to par.

980
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:00,276
Let's hear the next judge's comment.

981
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,738
You must have focused on the lyrics.

982
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,783
When I listen to music,

983
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,952
it's a habit of mine
to focus on the lyrics first.

984
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,871
Right.

985
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,708
When I listen to lyrics,
I look at two things.

986
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,628
I first consider if it's written
in proper language.

987
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,296
In other words,

988
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,548
I look at whether it makes sense. Then…

989
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,801
The review is worse than I expected.

990
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,014
It's ahead of its time.

991
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,099
It's not familiar or seen often.

992
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,268
Maybe that's why.

993
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:40,525
People tend to reject new things
that they aren't familiar with.

994
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,401
He put so much work in.

995
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,030
He must be hurt by this.

996
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,492
I think it'll still be a hit.

997
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,578
What?

998
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,290
People who persevere
even after going through the pain

999
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,168
that could destroy them
tend to be successful in the end.

1000
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,256
That's who he seems to be.

1001
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,767
I hope so.

1002
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,479
Since he's committed to this,

1003
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,190
I hope he doesn't give up.

1004
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,944
I hope he succeeds.

1005
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,364
I'm sure he will.

1006
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,077
He's a strong person, so believe in him.

1007
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:41,836
Pardon?

1008
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,220
Gosh.

1009
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:44,357
EPILOGUE

1010
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,693
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

1011
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,715
Detective Kim,
you have a scar on your arm.

1012
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,175
It looks like a burn scar.

1013
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,969
Captain, wasn't there one
when you were a rookie?

1014
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,262
A serial arson case. Right?

1015
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,682
Jeong-suk. Let's get through this.

1016
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,600
I see. Hello.

1017
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:43,851
Trash.

1018
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,021
It's as if you have
ill feelings toward me.

1019
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:49,815
Where can we find women with a fat wallet

1020
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,609
and no purchase history?

1021
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,195
-I know such women.
-Who?

1022
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,447
I'm here to see you.

1023
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,532
He didn't seem like a person.

1024
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,534
He was like a beast.

1025
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,536
You need to protect your family,

1026
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,956
and I need to protect my family.
Isn't that right?

1027
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:08,626
Mi-hwa is pregnant.

1028
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:16,008
