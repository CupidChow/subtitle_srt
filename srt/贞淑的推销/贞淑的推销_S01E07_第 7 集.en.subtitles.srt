1
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

2
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,823
Welcome, Jeong-suk.

3
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,408
Hi.

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,327
Shall I go in?

5
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,995
Yes, come on in.

6
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,004
-It wasn't an easy journey, right?
-It was okay.

7
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,548
I thought you might be hungry,
so I made some food.

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,430
Where's Jeong-rim?

9
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,517
She was feeling drowsy from medicine
and fell asleep a moment ago.

10
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,020
I'll wake her up in ten minutes.
Take a seat.

11
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,104
Okay.

12
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,364
I made this liquor with acacia flowers.

13
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,449
Would you like a glass?

14
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,827
No, thanks. I don't drink during work.

15
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,869
It's just a glass.

16
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,542
You're still as uncompromising
as you were in the past, Jeong-suk.

17
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,302
You know what?

18
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,389
I liked you back in the day.

19
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,892
-What?
-I liked you a lot.

20
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,270
But I couldn't do anything
because of Seong-su.

21
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,023
That's right.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,568
I heard that you got a divorce.

23
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,780
Had I known,
I would've made a move on you.

24
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,908
Is it too late now?

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,163
Where's Jeong-rim?
I think you should wake her up.

26
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,877
-Over there.
-Okay.

27
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,844
Jeong-rim.

28
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,566
What's this?

29
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,068
Where's Jeong-rim?

30
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,367
She ran away about two years ago.

31
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,871
I guess you were mistaken.

32
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,249
I only sell products to women.

33
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,960
Had I known, I wouldn't have come.

34
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,087
I wasn't mistaken about anything.

35
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,757
I lied to you on purpose.

36
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,843
You wouldn't have come otherwise.

37
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,222
You know,

38
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:47,060
you're still so pretty.

39
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,990
I see. This is it.

40
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:03,868
Put it on.

41
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,373
Hey, where are you going?

42
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,292
You can't leave like this.
Shall I help you put it on?

43
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,919
Let go of me!

44
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:13,878
Hey.

45
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,006
Damn it.

46
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,258
Hey!

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,115
Jeong-suk.

48
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,472
You've played hard to get long enough.

49
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,856
Stay away.

50
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,567
Hey, why do you keep making me
a bad person?

51
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,901
I'm different from Seong-su.

52
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,779
-Let's be honest.
-Let go!

53
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,365
-Come on out.
-Let go!

54
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,044
Who are you?

55
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,591
You jerk.

56
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,270
Are you okay?

57
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,567
Detective.

58
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,738
Behind you!

59
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,701
Detective.

60
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,955
Hey, who do you think you are?

61
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,199
Ms. Han Jeong-suk.

62
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,036
Ms. Han Jeong-suk.

63
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,822
You can rest easy now.

64
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,325
I'll be by your side.

65
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,576
I apprehended the suspect.
Go inside the storehouse.

66
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,660
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

67
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,800
You must be shaken up.

68
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,136
Yes.

69
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,096
Let go of me!

70
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,141
-Come with us.
-What did I do wrong?

71
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,144
Let go of me!

72
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,437
Damn it!

73
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,232
Hey! You tell them.

74
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,610
What did I do to you? Say it!

75
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,947
-Let go!
-That's enough.

76
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,252
I'll drive you home. Let's go to my car.

77
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,838
Okay.

78
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,255
I think you should go to the hospital.

79
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,048
No, it's really okay.

80
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,680
A detective told me earlier
that they need my statement.

81
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,849
You don't need to do it today.

82
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,935
Taking care of yourself
should be your priority,

83
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,229
so don't think about anything today.

84
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,106
Get some rest.

85
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,775
Okay. See you then.

86
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,108
Jeong-suk!

87
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,195
Jeong-suk, it's us!
The in-home sales rep sisters!

88
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,577
Okay. Give me a second!

89
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,249
You came after hearing the news.

90
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,088
Yes. It sounds like
being the branch manager is amazing.

91
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,464
You get a fixed monthly salary.

92
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,967
It's the sweetest word
I've heard in my life.

93
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,886
It's sweeter than this tomato.

94
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,140
Jeong-suk, you heard the news first.

95
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,060
Out of the four of us,
you're most likely to become one.

96
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,062
That's right.

97
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,189
Jeong-suk.

98
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,608
Become successful as soon as possible
and show everyone!

99
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,986
"Show everyone"?

100
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,365
What? It's nothing.

101
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,951
What is it?

102
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,954
She's avoiding eye contact,
so there must be something.

103
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,456
Hurry up and spill.

104
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,250
I'm still upset about it.

105
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,087
I guess the supermarket lady heard
about your divorce.

106
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,423
She was saying all sorts of things.

107
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,550
She asked if the business was the cause,

108
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,052
said she knew it was trouble,
and asked if you'll quit work--

109
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,013
Geez, what a nosy woman she is!

110
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,223
My goodness.

111
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,603
So I told her
Jeong-suk wasn't the one at fault.

112
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,772
I told her that she got over it

113
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,692
and that the business is thriving.

114
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,861
I told her

115
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,364
that she had an in-home sales job
at her high school friend's house.

116
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,451
Oh, I see.

117
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,745
Useless rumors circulate
because the town is so small.

118
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,164
-It can't be helped.
-That's right.

119
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,040
Don't mind it too much.

120
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,668
That's right. It doesn't matter.

121
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,505
At times like this,
you should focus on work and show them.

122
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,093
Yeong-bok, you should go to
that in-home sales job with Jeong-suk.

123
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,597
Jeong-suk, it's at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.
You have time, right?

124
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,892
At 2:00 p.m.? Yes.

125
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,976
Okay.

126
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,979
This is ridiculous.

127
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,315
How did this happen
in the middle of the night

128
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,484
in a quiet town like this?

129
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,027
Seriously.

130
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,361
My goodness.

131
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,538
Did the interrogation go well?

132
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,916
He keeps denying the charges.

133
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,877
Hold on! Damn it.

134
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,380
Captain, you've known me since childhood.

135
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,508
I wouldn't do something like that!

136
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,181
This is frustrating.

137
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,143
It really is.

138
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,396
Goodness.

139
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:39,443
By the way, Detective Kim,
how did you catch him in the act?

140
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,198
Who cares? What's important is
that he caught the culprit.

141
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,743
I didn't know what had happened,

142
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,372
so I wondered why he didn't come over
last night like he promised.

143
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,040
I almost got offended.

144
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,209
I apologize. I'll visit you soon.

145
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,505
All right.
After we wrap up this case nicely,

146
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,839
I'll invite you again.

147
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,387
So when will the victim come?

148
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,225
Due to the nature of the crime,
the victim needs psychological stability.

149
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,936
To separate the two sides,
I'll receive the statement in writing.

150
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,439
That punk will claim to be innocent.

151
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,650
Cross-examination
will speed up the process.

152
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,360
I'll take care of it on my own.

153
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:26,156
Right. The high and mighty one
will take care of it on his own.

154
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,577
What did you do just now?

155
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,079
What? It was just a light slap.

156
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,373
What?

157
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,333
Isn't this blood?

158
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,004
Blood? Why… Why are you bleeding?

159
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,173
No way.

160
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,718
Did you get hurt at the scene?

161
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,304
That must be it.
You said there was a physical fight.

162
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,973
I can't believe that bastard.

163
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,975
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

164
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,351
It's nothing.

165
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,061
I'll get treatment after work.

166
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,189
See? It wasn't me.

167
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,484
It doesn't look like it's nothing.

168
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,361
Gosh, that could've been bad.

169
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,844
This is it.

170
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,262
Put it on.

171
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,795
Hello?

172
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,755
This is Detective Kim Do-hyeon.

173
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,050
Yes, Detective.

174
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,928
I plan to receive
your statement in writing.

175
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,807
So I want to give you the documents
and explain them to you in person.

176
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,684
Do you have time tomorrow afternoon?

177
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,105
I have work then.

178
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,399
You're going back to work already?

179
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,902
You should take a few days off.

180
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,614
No, I need to work.
My family's livelihood depends on it.

181
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,534
You know…

182
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,746
I'd like to ask you something.

183
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,916
What happened yesterday…

184
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:48,048
There's no way
people will find out about it, right?

185
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,300
Excuse me?

186
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,637
People already think
that my business has brought trouble

187
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,891
to a quiet town, so I'm a bit worried.

188
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,519
I'll make sure to keep this quiet.

189
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,480
Thank you.

190
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,235
I think I'll start working around
2:00 p.m. and finish around 5:00 p.m.

191
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,238
It's near the place where we met
that one time.

192
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,116
Okay. See you there tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.

193
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,418
Make sure Ms. Han Jeong-suk's case
doesn't become public knowledge.

194
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,711
Okay.

195
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,464
Where's Detective Na?

196
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,425
He'll talk to the possible witnesses
of the motorcycle theft case

197
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,593
and go home from there.

198
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,182
Will he…

199
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,647
When I hit his vital point,
he was stricken like this.

200
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,318
I landed another kick
and finished him off with a flying kick.

201
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,111
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

202
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:55,032
-Then came a 540-degree roundhouse kick.
-Goodness.

203
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,492
He's different.

204
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,452
-He's different.
-Yes.

205
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,207
After finishing him off,

206
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,751
I approached the woman to help her up.

207
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,253
Suddenly, this punk came up behind me

208
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,464
-with a shovel.
-No way.

209
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,510
With a big and hard shovel,
he hit me in the back.

210
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,264
So what happened then?

211
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,683
It was like…

212
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,436
-I felt like my bone was broken.
-Of course.

213
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,772
But I knew
that I couldn't pass out like that.

214
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,940
That's right.

215
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,400
So I turned around right away

216
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,445
and grabbed the shovel.

217
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,284
What? Did you bend the shovel?

218
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,956
Gosh, you're incredible.

219
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,751
I almost made an action film
in that flower farm storehouse.

220
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,921
-My goodness.
-You're cool.

221
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,881
-You're truly amazing.
-Yes.

222
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,759
By the way, isn't that Jeong-suk's story?

223
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,929
She sells adult products.

224
00:18:59,012 --> 00:18:59,972
What?

225
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,269
-You said you went uptown yesterday.
-Yes.

226
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,397
The flower farm uptown
is run by Gyeong-sik.

227
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,606
Yes.

228
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,650
Jeong-suk went there to sell products.

229
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,943
What?

230
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,155
All the pieces are coming together.

231
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,074
How are you so good
at putting the clues together?

232
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,909
You should be a detective. I'll retire.

233
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,746
-What? So was it really Jeong-suk?
-Was it?

234
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,916
No. I didn't say anything.

235
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,171
A police officer shouldn't talk
about an ongoing investigation.

236
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:38,260
Don't go around telling stories, okay?

237
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,388
My back hurts.

238
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,522
It was her.

239
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,691
-I'm 100% sure.
-I'm 1,000% sure.

240
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,989
-That means Jeong-suk's the victim.
-That's right.

241
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,242
Yes, it's a little bit tasty.

242
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,702
"A little bit tasty"?

243
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,665
Jeong-suk, talk to us for a second.

244
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,083
Jeong-suk, are you home?

245
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,212
-What brings you here at this hour?
-Is the rumor true?

246
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,380
-What…
-Gyeong-sik.

247
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,217
Why did you go to a single man's house?

248
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,469
-What?
-Mom.

249
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,931
Yes. Let's talk about that later.

250
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:28,018
I knew you were something else
when you began selling such items.

251
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,688
Apparently, Gyeong-sik feels
really wronged.

252
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,024
He said you were the one
who seduced him first.

253
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,444
My child is here. Please stop and go home.

254
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,155
-Where do you think you're going?
-Hey.

255
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,117
I'm not done talking.
What's with your manners?

256
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,703
If you cherish your child,
you should behave yourself.

257
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,830
Stop this and leave!

258
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,957
Seriously!

259
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,710
What have you done so right
for you to yell at us?

260
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,920
That's right!

261
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,421
Mom.

262
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,091
-It's okay.
-Will you be able to live in this town?

263
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,052
How could you be such a Jezebel
behind our backs?

264
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,846
How could a mother do that?

265
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,433
-Behave yourself.
-You won't be able to live here.

266
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,894
This is a small town, okay?

267
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,548
CHARMING HAIR SALON

268
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,316
What?

269
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,402
Was he the son
of the real estate agency's owner?

270
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,279
He looks nothing like his mom.

271
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,447
Let's go inside.

272
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,907
What? Mom.

273
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,076
New York Hair Salon is better.

274
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,078
-Really?
-I got my hair done there.

275
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,664
-Is that so?
-Yes.

276
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,125
Then I should go to Charming Hair Salon.

277
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,377
Why do you want me to get my hair done?

278
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,838
Is Aunt coming as well?

279
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,382
Yes.

280
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,635
The entire family will come. Grandma too.

281
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,429
What? Grandma's coming?

282
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,513
Didn't you know?

283
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,807
We're having Grandma's
birthday dinner today.

284
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,647
Why didn't you tell me?

285
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,441
You didn't need to know.

286
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,693
I plan to tell her

287
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,280
that you're studying late every day
to transfer to a pharmacy school.

288
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,493
Are you telling me not to come?

289
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,162
-It's Grandma's birthday.
-So what if you come?

290
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,415
In front of your relatives who went
to good schools and became doctors,

291
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,125
you'll say stupid stuff.

292
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,336
That's too harsh, Mom.

293
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,421
-He--
-Be quiet!

294
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,091
Hurry up and go to work. You follow me.

295
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,595
Ju-ri.

296
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,448
-Is he behind bars?
-Of course.

297
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,410
-I can't believe it.
-You can never know someone's true colors.

298
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,497
-I thought he was the nicest man.
-Seriously.

299
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,666
-My goodness.
-Everyone is here.

300
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,584
-Did you hear about it?
-What?

301
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,128
Gyeong-sik's case!

302
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,380
It's a total ruckus.

303
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,632
Jeong-suk went through a lot.

304
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,467
Oh, no.

305
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,512
-Don't spread the story.
-Is it true?

306
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,057
Jeong-suk!

307
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,726
-Come over here.
-Hey.

308
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,853
Hey.

309
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,398
What? Did she leave?

310
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,283
Who…

311
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:58,663
Oh, you must be the in-home sales lady.

312
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,582
Right? Come on in.

313
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,668
My wife is busy
doing something in the kitchen, so wait.

314
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,922
Well, the thing is…

315
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,006
What?

316
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,050
What's wrong?

317
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,899
My wife is waiting. Hey!

318
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,525
Wasn't she an in-home sales rep?

319
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,652
I think so, but…

320
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,084
It's me, Detective Kim Do-hyeon.

321
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,129
Yes, Detective.

322
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,381
Are you okay?

323
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,342
Yes, I'm okay.

324
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,473
Like I said before,

325
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,143
you should take a break from work.

326
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,812
I'll drive you home.

327
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,188
No.

328
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:10,443
I've worried my coworkers many times
with my personal issues.

329
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,737
I don't want more ridiculous rumors.

330
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,241
Running away and covering up
might not be the best option.

331
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,370
Even if it's stressful,

332
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,540
don't you want to set things right
by facing it and tackling it?

333
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,878
That's what the Han Jeong-suk
I know would do.

334
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,185
Exactly what should I face

335
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,354
and tackle?

336
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,486
I'll take care of my business.

337
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,410
Ms. Oh, thank you for coming
on such short notice.

338
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,287
Don't mention it.

339
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,416
By the way, it's unlike Jeong-suk
to cancel on things.

340
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,709
Did something happen?

341
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,627
I know.

342
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,756
She might be very sick,
so I'm going to drop by.

343
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,551
She looked a bit down yesterday,
so I'm worried.

344
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,677
I know.

345
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,681
-Hello.
-Hello.

346
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,141
Did you go somewhere?

347
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,519
We're on our way back from work.

348
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,521
At a time like this?

349
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:14,025
Jeong-suk's case
has turned the town upside down.

350
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,444
What are you talking about?

351
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,775
Did I thank him?

352
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,907
I'm a mess.

353
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,670
Jeong-suk.

354
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,590
She's coming.

355
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,551
Ms. Oh. Yeong-bok.

356
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,179
My poor thing.

357
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,681
Yeong-bok, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

358
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,767
We know what happened to you.

359
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,269
Why didn't you tell us?

360
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,232
How do you know?

361
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,485
The video rental shop owner told us.

362
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,112
All the women in the town seemed to know.

363
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,408
-I see.
-It's my fault!

364
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,203
I should've gone with you that day.

365
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,664
I should've realized
that something was off yesterday.

366
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,667
I'm so sorry, Jeong-suk.

367
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,211
Don't be.

368
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,296
I'm the one who should apologize.

369
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,340
I canceled on today's sales.

370
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,259
My desire to get promoted led to this.
It's my fault.

371
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,304
How is it your fault?
It's that scumbag's fault!

372
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,972
That's right!

373
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:12,227
I think women in this town are so mean.

374
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,230
How could they be so shameless?

375
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,899
What do you mean?

376
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,946
Well, Gyeong-sik's mother

377
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,658
asked townspeople
for petitions and statements.

378
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,121
The owners of the supermarket,
hardware store and butcher shop

379
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,749
will go to the police station
and testify tomorrow.

380
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,848
For now, let go of your worries and rest.

381
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,432
That's right.

382
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,061
Ju-ri will have in-home sales
until late today,

383
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:58,773
so we'll talk to her tomorrow
and resolve the matter.

384
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,484
"Resolve the matter"?

385
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,488
How could they corner the innocent victim?
They're less than human.

386
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,866
I'll teach them a lesson tomorrow.

387
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,201
I'm not taking out my anger on them.

388
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,371
What was the term, Ms. Oh? Serve…

389
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,956
-Serve justice.
-Yes.

390
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,083
This is serving justice.

391
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,760
Running the hair salon
and doing the in-home sales…

392
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,430
It's exhausting to have two jobs.

393
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,851
JINHYANG HOF

394
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,985
It's too late
to call the girls over, right?

395
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,784
-Sir.
-It has been a while.

396
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,952
Yes.

397
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,246
Ju-ri, are you coming
from the in-home sales?

398
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,333
Yes. It's my sister's day off,
so she's babysitting Dong-u.

399
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,876
It's free time for me.

400
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,836
I'd like whelks and soju.

401
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,265
Sir, a table for four.

402
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,517
Okay. All right.

403
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,061
Please wait.

404
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,815
Please wait.

405
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,945
It seems like you know him.

406
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,405
Would you please sit with him?

407
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,533
As you can see,
we don't have enough tables.

408
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,952
I'm sorry.

409
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,337
Okay.

410
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,508
All right. Please sit here.

411
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,511
Welcome.

412
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,887
Please take this table.

413
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,390
What would you like?

414
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,183
Well, this is awkward.

415
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,229
I'm sorry.

416
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,148
What?

417
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:09,278
I was the one who got the wrong idea.

418
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,406
Then I became sullen.

419
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,742
What do you mean?

420
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,038
You told me

421
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,333
that I looked like Shim Shin.

422
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,546
I thought you liked me.

423
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,674
-It's funny, right?
-I mean…

424
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,511
I'm not used to receiving compliments.

425
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,933
My mom never told me
that I looked handsome.

426
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,186
So hearing your compliment…

427
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,524
made me excited.

428
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,948
Well, it's okay.

429
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,908
I said empty words.

430
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,493
I'm sorry.

431
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,164
So, we're even.

432
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,958
We're even.

433
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,715
-Hey.
-What?

434
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,550
Stop drinking.

435
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,513
You didn't do anything wrong, okay?

436
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,725
Yes, I did.

437
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,940
Had I studied

438
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,902
a bit harder…

439
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,198
Had I been a bit more successful…

440
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,577
I would've been able to see my grandma.

441
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,207
Grandma.

442
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,877
Grandma.

443
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,424
If you miss her so much, go and see her!

444
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,806
Follow me.

445
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,519
What?

446
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,687
Hurry up.

447
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,815
-Hurry up.
-Where are we going?

448
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,274
Let's hurry up and go.

449
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,819
Hold on.

450
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,654
My goodness.

451
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,572
Yeong-ja, thanks for the meal.

452
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,242
-If only you visited more often.
-Thank you so much.

453
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,619
-You should visit often.
-Okay.

454
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,747
-Seriously.
-Have a safe trip home.

455
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,208
She's your grandma, right?

456
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,297
She has aged a lot.

457
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:41,430
Grandma, please live a long life.

458
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,478
I want to become successful

459
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,981
and meet you as a proud grandson.

460
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,776
I think it'll take too long.

461
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,529
-Have a safe trip home.
-All right.

462
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,446
Bye.

463
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,408
I'll call you.

464
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,704
Grandma.

465
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,043
Don't cry.

466
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,174
Blow your nose.

467
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,933
It's okay.

468
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,019
It's okay.

469
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,606
Let me see you.

470
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,945
Why are you crying? Goodness.

471
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,411
I'm sorry.

472
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,916
I must be very drunk.

473
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,377
You suddenly looked so pretty.

474
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,174
So when you're sober, I don't look pretty?

475
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,801
You still look pretty.

476
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,966
He should've controlled himself.

477
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,760
Why did he leave such a big mark?

478
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,680
Was it his first kiss?

479
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,684
Then he must be very excited now.

480
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,924
CHARMING HAIR SALON

481
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,142
No way.

482
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,145
At his age,
it couldn't have been his first kiss.

483
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,400
Ju-ri, I can't believe you.

484
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,236
You shouldn't have drunk so much, Ju-ri.

485
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,364
What? Hello.

486
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,325
What brings you here?

487
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,951
We have something to tell you.

488
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,411
Where's Dong-u?

489
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,371
He's at Jeong-suk's place.

490
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,581
What?

491
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,208
Jeong-suk needs some rest.

492
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,462
Why? Is Jeong-suk sick?

493
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,935
Are you worried about something?

494
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,064
No.

495
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,149
Eat some melon.

496
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,194
Here you go.

497
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,450
I wish you'd stay home every day.

498
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,994
You're such a kid.

499
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,082
Even a single game costs money.

500
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,669
Moms need to work
so that we can do what we want.

501
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,880
You need to look far ahead.

502
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,050
Still, I like it when Mom stays home.

503
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,470
By the way, can we play outside?

504
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,263
I don't want to.

505
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,182
It's because of Yeong-min, right?

506
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,270
Mom, there's a kid
who always picks a fight with us.

507
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,649
It's not that I'm a coward.

508
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,860
He's this big like Lee Man-gi.

509
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,280
It's best to avoid Yeong-min.

510
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,698
Why should we avoid him?

511
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,161
Why should the ones
who did nothing wrong go into hiding?

512
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,496
Isn't it unfair?

513
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,500
Even if we get hurt,
we should face him head-on.

514
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,296
That way, a bright future will come
to this beautiful planet Earth.

515
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,218
Did you watch Flashman yesterday?

516
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,136
Yes.

517
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,180
That was what Number One said
to Number Five.

518
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,809
You're right.
Flashman always speaks the truth.

519
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,439
Okay. There's no bright future
for the cowards

520
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,357
who always run away and hide.

521
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,733
Let's face him head-on.

522
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,154
Okay. Let's go.

523
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,321
Let's go.

524
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,283
-See you later.
-See you later.

525
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,826
Be safe.

526
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,792
SUPERNOVA FLASHMAN

527
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,337
Even if it's stressful,

528
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,632
don't you want to set things right
by facing it and tackling it?

529
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,594
That's what the Han Jeong-suk
I know would do.

530
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:16,432
How could they corner the innocent victim?
They're less than human.

531
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:27,151
KEEP YOUR CHIN UP FOR JUSTICE!

532
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,593
Is this the solution?

533
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,055
I know this since I've had many fights
in my younger days.

534
00:41:56,138 --> 00:42:00,518
In a fight, you should break
the other's spirit to win.

535
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,603
You have to look charismatic.

536
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,938
That's right.

537
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,398
Whether it's psychological or physical,

538
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,026
let's win no matter what.

539
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,944
That's right.

540
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,363
I'm coming too.

541
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,114
What? Jeong-suk.

542
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,202
You're coming?

543
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,790
Yes.

544
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,751
It's my business.

545
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,634
GEUMJE POLICE STATION

546
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,723
Come on!

547
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,157
Are you certain?

548
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,618
We're certain. Isn't that right?

549
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,996
That's right.
There have been many problems.

550
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,499
I haven't met a nicer person.

551
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,003
Please make sure that there's no harm.

552
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,439
Ms. Han Jeong-suk.

553
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,359
What brings you here?

554
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,652
Who are these women?

555
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,987
We're town residents.

556
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,739
We're here to testify.

557
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,450
We talked to Jeong-suk
on the phone that night.

558
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,952
We'll tell you everything we remember.

559
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,331
That's right. Don't pay attention
to what those women said!

560
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,251
I'm certain their statements
are just emotional and absurd!

561
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,544
Is that so?

562
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,465
All of their statements were in her favor.

563
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,133
What?

564
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,469
Are you serious?

565
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:41,887
Yes.

566
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,971
Yes, it's true.

567
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,306
They told us

568
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,934
about Mr. Kim's unusual tendencies
they heard from his ex-wife

569
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,561
and how he pretended to be married

570
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,523
even after she ran away.

571
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,526
They gave such statements.

572
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,985
Why?

573
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:01,365
You always said
that we cause trouble in this town.

574
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,826
You bad-mouthed us and called us indecent.

575
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,161
"Bad-mouth"? Not at all!

576
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,665
The products you guys sell are indecent.

577
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,459
Jeong-suk did nothing wrong.

578
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,671
That's right.

579
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:20,217
We bought those items
only because Jeong-suk was selling them.

580
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,971
We know that she's decent and hardworking.

581
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:30,310
Why on earth would you seduce
a scumbag like Gyeong-sik?

582
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:35,649
You were Ms. Chili Pepper
in your younger days.

583
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,532
Give me a break.

584
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,242
-What?
-What?

585
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,243
It's that bastard.

586
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,287
She's fooling all of you.

587
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,415
She isn't fooling us, you bastard!

588
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,877
Had Jeong-suk needed money,
she would've borrowed it from us.

589
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,879
Why would she go to your house?

590
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,047
-She was scheming all along.
-What?

591
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,384
She was going for the settlement money,
not some petty sales money!

592
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,261
-How dare you…
-Goodness.

593
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,972
When she showed me
those promiscuous clothes

594
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,724
and seduced me, I should've said no.

595
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,477
-Hey, Kim Gyeong-sik!
-What a crazy bastard!

596
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,188
Hey, I'll grant your death wish!

597
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,272
-You punk.
-Let go.

598
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,983
-Why are you laughing, you punk?
-Yeong-bok.

599
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,110
Women, be quiet!

600
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,613
The police station
is not some kids' playground!

601
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,866
How are we supposed to be quiet?

602
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,368
He keeps spouting nonsense!

603
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,536
Isn't that right?

604
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,206
-My goodness.
-Come here.

605
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,666
-Hey, come here.
-Please.

606
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,543
-Stay still.
-No!

607
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,307
Stop!

608
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,212
What?

609
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,339
Do you have something to say?

610
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,259
Shut your mouth.

611
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,762
What was that?

612
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,973
What are you whispering?

613
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,892
She's like that.

614
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:38,939
She was all bleary-eyed
and whispered things to me that day.

615
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,733
Shut your mouth, you perverted freak!

616
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,715
My goodness.

617
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:09,386
What should I do?
I shouldn't have used violence.

618
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,221
I didn't see anything.

619
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,724
What?

620
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,060
I'm sure other people
didn't see anything either.

621
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,570
I'm sorry.

622
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,283
You even got hurt because of me that day.

623
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,579
But I didn't even thank you properly.

624
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,666
I also got sensitive
when you were just worrying about me.

625
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,085
It's okay.

626
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,837
I regretted saying those words

627
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,506
because I think I only thought
about my frustration.

628
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,217
That frustration was relieved
a moment ago though.

629
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,640
Jeong-suk!

630
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,894
She's out.

631
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,438
Many people are waiting for you.
You should get going.

632
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,066
I hope you take care
after what happened today.

633
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,419
Why did I get tofu?

634
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:29,591
Seriously. People will think
that she got discharged from prison.

635
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:34,012
She was at the police station,
so she should eat it.

636
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,514
Of course. Eat it.

637
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,933
You need to eat white tofu

638
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,310
to keep out of dirty troubles.

639
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,021
So eat it and poop it out.

640
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,565
Yes.

641
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,734
You really surprised me this time.

642
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,819
What?

643
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,072
I thought you had grudges against her.

644
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,659
Grudges? No way.

645
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:01,373
It's natural to favor your family,

646
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,876
so I had no choice but to take
my husband's side.

647
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,922
But a part of me felt indebted to her.

648
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,717
So I paid off my debt this time.

649
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,511
Stop worrying about it and eat your tofu.

650
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,975
There you go.

651
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:25,397
Technically, all of us have been
to the police station. We need tofu too.

652
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:30,569
You're right. Please give one tofu each
to all the police station visitors.

653
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,862
I'll pay for yours too.

654
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,739
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

655
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,158
-Great.
-How much is the total?

656
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,911
Then would it be okay
to have a soft drink as well?

657
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,621
Of course.

658
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,832
All right. That's a good idea.

659
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,710
One, two, three, four, five and six…

660
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,546
-I'll be back.
-I was asking her only for three of us.

661
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,715
Ms. Oh, you're the best.

662
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,008
Thank you.

663
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,218
I feel so much better.

664
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,430
By the way, wasn't Jeong-suk
absolutely insane?

665
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,143
She didn't even slap him.
She suddenly smacked his head.

666
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,272
I didn't know Jeong-suk
was so good at swearing.

667
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,399
-Yes.
-She went, "Shut your trap!"

668
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,942
-Yes.
-Really?

669
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,987
I don't think I said "trap."

670
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,197
Did I?

671
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,325
I found it so satisfying.

672
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,493
That's right.

673
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,830
I don't think I'd be able to say anything
in front of someone like that.

674
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,790
That's right.

675
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,958
Jeong-suk, how are you so gutsy?

676
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,210
Did you get coached?

677
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,713
Come to think of it, I did.

678
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,672
-What?
-What?

679
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,757
Who coached you?

680
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,593
Flashman.

681
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,886
What?

682
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,721
What?

683
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,806
And…

684
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,767
there was one other person.

685
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,531
PERPETRATOR: KIM GYEONG-SIK

686
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,534
HAN JEONG-SUK

687
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,542
Shut your mouth, you perverted freak!

688
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,893
This is Detective Kim Do-hyeon
of Geumje Police Station.

689
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,187
Detective, it's me, Han Jeong-suk.

690
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,355
Hello.

691
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,444
Is something wrong?

692
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,446
No, nothing's wrong.

693
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:42,284
Are you free tomorrow by any chance?

694
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,327
Tomorrow?

695
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:46,454
Yes.

696
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,835
GEUMJE POLICE STATION

697
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,461
What? What's this?

698
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,298
Did you pull an all-nighter?

699
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,591
Yes.

700
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,635
The report on the Kim Gyeong-sik case
is on your desk.

701
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,305
Man, things are moving along so speedily.

702
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,642
Thanks to you, I'll be able to save face.

703
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,903
It's suspicious.

704
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,113
What do you mean?

705
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:23,450
It must've been a hassle,
but he visited her to investigate

706
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,660
and stayed up all night
to finish the report.

707
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,330
He cares a lot
about that in-home sales rep.

708
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,207
I smell something.

709
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,668
I am sure…

710
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,965
that he wants a discount
on the adult products.

711
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,218
What?

712
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:46,473
Adult products for men
are quite expensive.

713
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,933
A power ring is 10,000 won.

714
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,810
A fragrant condom is 3,000 won a piece.

715
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,856
A tiny bottle of massage oil is
10,000 won.

716
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,360
By the way, how do you know

717
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,446
such details?

718
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,573
You sound like someone
who wants those items.

719
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:09,371
Gosh, what? As if I need them!

720
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,539
So stop spouting nonsense

721
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,792
and focus your attention on Du-seok.

722
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,669
He got discharged from prison today.

723
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:20,632
We'll have a lot to deal with from now on.

724
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,775
Man, watch where you're going.

725
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,959
It's nice to be back home.

726
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,712
It has been a while.

727
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,640
EOM DAE-GEUN, LEE JU-RI

728
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,691
Sixty-two percent?

729
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,821
The compatibility is worse
than I expected.

730
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:25,989
Who cares?

731
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:29,242
We can work together to make up
for the missing 38%.

732
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,537
Thirty-eight percent.

733
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,373
-What are you doing?
-You startled me!

734
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,545
You startled me, Mr. Choi.

735
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,964
Did I startle you?

736
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,759
I'm terribly sorry.

737
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,011
There are a ton of medicines
that need to be sorted.

738
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,471
-I mean--
-But I shouldn't have startled

739
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,056
an idle employee.

740
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,265
-I was--
-Right?

741
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,850
-I was--
-I feel so bad

742
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,394
that I don't know what to do!

743
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,022
I was about to do it, okay?

744
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,900
Why is this fly being so loud
at this very moment?

745
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,903
He'll be the death of me.

746
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,032
-Hello.
-Welcome.

747
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,494
I've been so queasy these days.

748
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,828
I keep having an upset stomach.

749
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,413
Give me your hand.

750
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,498
-Okay.
-The other one.

751
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,624
Okay.

752
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,127
How does it feel?

753
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,629
I feel nothing.

754
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,049
Right? You seem to be okay.
This part isn't hard or anything.

755
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,968
You didn't eat anything bad, did you?

756
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,472
Yesterday evening,
I had tofu with other people.

757
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,516
But everyone else is fine,

758
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,851
so I don't think it's food poisoning.

759
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,812
Just give me some digestion medicine.

760
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,188
-Please.
-Okay.

761
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,655
By any chance…

762
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,156
Yes?

763
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,492
Is there a chance you're pregnant?

764
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,954
Me?

765
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,248
It hasn't been long since I gave birth.

766
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,750
I'm still breastfeeding her.

767
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,962
It is only a myth
that breastfeeding prevents pregnancy,

768
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,131
so you should check and make sure.

769
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:10,051
Gosh, I have four children.

770
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,638
I'd know if I were pregnant.

771
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,265
Just give me the digestion medicine.

772
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,933
Okay then.

773
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:42,959
Damn it.

774
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:47,881
Hello?

775
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,757
It's me, Du-seok.

776
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,553
So you're alive.

777
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:57,223
I wondered if something had happened
since you never visited.

778
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,349
I'm sorry.

779
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,187
I couldn't visit you
since I was busy with my children.

780
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,813
I understand.

781
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,775
In any case, let's meet up.

782
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,861
Where do you live?

783
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,739
Don't tell me you still live
in that studio.

784
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,911
You're far from the brightest
when it comes to life.

785
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:21,789
Hey.

786
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,792
There's a job coming up.

787
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,628
Do you want to join me?

788
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,006
-What?
-I know that you quit,

789
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,550
but this one is really safe.

790
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,677
You have four children.

791
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:38,848
You should live in an apartment
with two rooms and a living room.

792
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,225
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

793
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,602
You might think otherwise,

794
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,897
but I'm perfectly happy.

795
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:51,110
If you're going to say such nonsense,
don't call me again.

796
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,114
I'd feel embarrassed
if you shut me down like that.

797
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,077
Don't be so certain.

798
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:08,836
No man steals money because he wants to.

799
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,798
It's the situation that drives him.

800
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,138
-You're back.
-Yes.

801
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,766
-Did you buy digestion medicine?
-Yes, I took it.

802
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,522
Hold on. Let me make some porridge.

803
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,606
Okay.

804
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:57,885
Detective.

805
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,431
You got here first.

806
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,516
Yes. Please take a seat.

807
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,274
Have you thought about my offer?

808
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,360
Yes.

809
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,782
I came here to say no.

810
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,161
I'm really thankful
that you want to help me

811
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,830
find my parents.

812
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,335
But I think this is a problem
I should solve

813
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,046
by myself.

814
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,717
I think you felt the same.

815
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,222
You felt bad when you saw me
bottle up my problems

816
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,059
without asking for anyone's help.

817
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,894
Oh, that's--

818
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,271
It's nothing complicated.

819
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,399
Why don't we just begin?

820
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,735
If I'm not much help,

821
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:59,364
you can cut me off heartlessly then.

822
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,506
Come on in.

823
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,843
I only sleep here,
so there's nothing to see.

824
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:21,928
I see.

825
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,935
It's in the basement,
so I'll go turn the lights on.

826
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,103
Okay.

827
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,452
You can come downstairs now.

828
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,620
Okay.

829
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,707
All right.

830
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:52,709
Be careful.

831
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,590
Wow.

832
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,553
There is so much material.

833
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,096
Yes.

834
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:13,521
I thought it was very likely
that the woman who left me

835
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,649
at the church nursery was from Geumje.

836
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:22,321
But I'm not sure if she still lives here.

837
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,950
Are you saying that one of these women

838
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:29,412
might be your mother?

839
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,166
I don't know.

840
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:38,004
I don't know if she was my mother
or someone who found me by chance.

841
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:42,258
I narrowed down the candidates
in order to hear the story myself.

842
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,512
I found a new clue.

843
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,724
A clue?

844
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,402
BABIES KEEP DISAPPEARING
WITH THE FIRE

845
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,862
KIDNAP AFTER ARSON? FIFTH CASE

846
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:07,116
I had no idea
that there were such cases in Geumje.

847
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:12,538
So this person set houses on fire

848
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,874
and kidnapped babies amidst the chaos.

849
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:16,876
That's right.

850
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:21,547
In many cases, babies from poor families

851
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,049
were the targets.

852
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:28,805
How did this happen to so many babies?

853
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,725
At first, they thought it was
a simple disappearance.

854
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,813
They found out belatedly
that it was a serial kidnapping case

855
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,689
and switched to a public investigation.

856
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,862
Had the case been public from the start,
there would've been fewer victims.

857
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,242
By the way,

858
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:55,540
may I ask you why you think
this case is related to you?

859
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,554
My goodness.

860
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,057
It's a burn scar I've had
ever since I got left at the nursery.

861
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,560
The woman who left me there said

862
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,895
that she found me without my parents

863
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,439
after a big fire in the town.

864
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,441
And…

865
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,321
I keep having the same dream.

866
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,201
I don't know when it began,
but I've been having the same nightmare.

867
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,830
I don't remember the last time

868
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:38,875
I slept peacefully.

869
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:42,837
Now,

870
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,424
we need to look into this case.

871
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,134
Yes.

872
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,137
We need to reinvestigate from the start

873
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,180
and take a different approach.

874
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,684
Then you'll definitely need

875
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:58,352
my help.

876
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,856
I often meet up with women in the town,

877
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:04,108
so I'll interview them.

878
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:09,280
I think they'll feel more comfortable
talking to me than to you.

879
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,100
I'm sorry about leaving so suddenly.
I lost track of time.

880
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,019
I should've helped you clean up.

881
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,812
It's okay.

882
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,065
I'll walk you home.

883
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:47,443
It's okay.
The bus stop is right out front.

884
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,653
Please go back inside.

885
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:30,069
POSSIBILITY OF BEING THE VICTIM
OF SERIAL KIDNAPPING AFTER ARSON

886
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,035
IF HE'S THE VICTIM OF THE CRIME,

887
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:40,121
HIS PARENTS MIGHT BE
LOOKING FOR HIM

888
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,540
They might be looking for me?

889
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,334
What? It's Mom.

890
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:28,919
Mom!

891
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:34,258
My goodness.

892
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:37,511
You said I was the best
when I bought you an ice cream.

893
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:41,557
But you don't even hesitate to ditch me
at the sight of your mom.

894
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,641
I understand.

895
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,937
There's no one in the world
a child loves more than his mom.

896
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,689
You're right.

897
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,733
Mom is the best in the world.

898
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,944
Did things go well?

899
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,489
-What were you up to?
-Well…

900
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,788
What? My notebook!

901
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,386
Why is the door open?

902
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,307
Detective.

903
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:27,686
Detective.

904
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,399
Detective.

905
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,028
Detective.

906
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,050
Detective.

907
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:03,722
I don't know when it began,
but I've been having the same nightmare.

908
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,142
I don't remember the last time

909
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,227
I slept peacefully.

910
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:10,896
Could it be…

911
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:46,390
Detective.

912
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:50,060
Detective.

913
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,534
Are you okay?

914
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,914
Did you have a nightmare?

915
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,262
A VIRTUOUS BUSINESS

916
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,138
We should do something to attract them.

917
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:12,559
Why don't we give movie tickets
to those who attend in-home sales events?

918
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,686
Jeong-suk,

919
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,605
you're so driven with the branch manager
promotion coming up.

920
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:20,651
Why did you get involved with that bastard
and do something that'd get in your way

921
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:23,279
for the rest of your life?

922
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,073
It's been more than 30 years.

923
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,242
Catching the culprit
won't make a difference

924
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:31,245
since the statute of limitations
has expired.

925
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:33,998
She could think we're
a couple who are shopping.

926
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:38,335
Let's pretend to be a couple
who are getting married soon.

927
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,129
When she lets her guard down,

928
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,965
we'll ask questions
as naturally as possible.

929
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,302
It's just that when I'm with you,

930
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,470
I become a bit confused.

931
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,722
I want to check.

932
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:57,229
