Mr. Hu.

Her name is Junko Nakamura.

11

It was a hit and run.

12

We haven't found out who it is yet.

13
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,850
What's the background of that Japanese girl?

14
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:03,390
Her father is a military officer working for the Water Department.

15
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,750
He's been looking for his daughter.

16
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,950
He has reported it to the Public Security.

17
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,170
But the Public Security is afraid of trouble.

18
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,300
So they haven't dared to ask him to identify the body yet.

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,770
A Japanese soldier?

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,660
Sir.

21

Do we continue to investigate this?

22
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,770
I'm afraid it has something to do with Guan Kai.

23

Since that Sergeant died,

24
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,970
Guan Kai has been acting strange.

I didn't know there's a prison in the southern suburbs.

If you see a prisoner in a striped uniform,

45
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,020
kill them immediately.

00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,040
Go away!

192
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,760
It's infectious!

193
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,020
What's wrong with him?

194
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,300
What's wrong with him?

195
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:05,850
Don't go there.

196
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,600
Zhuowen!

197
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,470
What happened?

198
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,240
Zhuowen.

199
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,000
Song Zhuowen!

200
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,370
Who are you?

201
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,610
This is the quarantine zone.

202
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,690
Please leave now.

203
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:58,810
Song Zhuowen!

204
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,900
Leave now.

205
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,700
Do you hear me?

206
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,680
What's wrong with him?

207
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,390
Why is there no doctor inside?

208
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,240
This is the quarantine area.

209
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,320
No one is allowed

210
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,060
to enter without permission.

211
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,490
Where is the doctor?

212
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,740
Why isn't anyone saving him?

213
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,740
Ms. Guan. Ms. Guan.

214
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,910
He's very contagious.

215
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,120
We have no right to treat him.

216
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,090
Unless the Military approves.

217
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,500
Mr. Song has another message for you.

218
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,440
He has clues to the fugitive of the Water Department.

219
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,460
Is this the Water Department?

220
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,170
I'm Asano Daigo.

221
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,440
I understand what you mean.

222
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,330
I believe in his importance.

223
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,850
But he's not Japanese.

224
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,830
It's against the rules to treat him with medicine.

225
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,200
Even if you negotiate with the Military Headquarters,

226
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,720
we won't compromise.

227
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,850
Sir, I'm sorry.

228
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,280
Mr. Asano.

229
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,290
I can't accept the fact that

230
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,750
they are not treating Zhuowen.

231
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,280
This is not what we deserve.

232
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,290
You must obey orders!

233
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,010
This order will disappoint everyone.

234
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,880
Asano!

235
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,130
How dare you talk to me like that?

236
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,520
That's your job.

237
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,510
With all due respect, General Ishii.

238
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,280
If,

239
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,420
without my security plan,

240
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,260
all your work may be

241
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,630
be leaked by these escaped prisoners.

242
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,960
Then you should go and catch them, no?

243
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,280
General Ishii, please tell me.

244
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,190
Why

245
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,290
did you not inform me as per the rules

246
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,580
that you changed the time and location of the experiment?

247
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:36,890
Now that

248
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,970
Maruta have ran away, it means the experiment will be leaked

249
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,240
yet the only person who has the clue has been infected!

250
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,810
He needs treatment!

251
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,400
So,

252
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,410
only by saving him and getting the clue

253
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,370
can we save this situation.

254
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,100
Your failure will not be disclosed to the public.

255
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,650
Xie Yue.

256
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,000
Xie Yue.

257
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,080
Xie Yue.

258
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,870
Who are you? I don't know you.

259
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,239
I've known you for a long time.

260
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,420
Now I dare to talk to you.

261
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,530
I wrote who you

262
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,820
and Song Zhuowen met

263
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:33,850
and did down.

264
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,719
Down to the time.

265
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,480
Just tear it. I'll help you with it.

266
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,659
I still have the original copy.

267
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,210
This small picture is quite accurate.

268
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,560
You noted the time very specifically too.

269
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,540
What can that say?

270
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,310
Just tell me the truth.

271
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,420
What do you want?

272
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,230
Xie Yue, you know what?

273
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,480
There's this energy you have

274
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,140
that normal girls don't have.

275
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,780
You're still stubborn when you're about to die.

276
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,960
But I like it.

277
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,690
So?

278
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,800
Be my girlfriend.

279
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,330
Don't you know you're as ugly as a toad?

280
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,330
I know.

281
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,510
I know you're a swan too.

282
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,650
Even someone like Song Zhuowen

283
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,110
is okay for you,

284
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,450
why can't I be?

285
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,630
Think it through.

286
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,520
Not only am I stubborn,

287
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,570
I am also cruel.

288
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,120
I like those who hit hard.

289
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,320
Okay, wait for my message then!

290
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,920
Are you Xie Yue?

291
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,820
That ugly guy is your classmate?

292
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,680
You have a peculiar taste.

293
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,520
Who are you?

294
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,580
What are you doing?

295
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,750
What are you doing?

296
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,630
What are you doing?

297
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,590
Don't close the door.

298
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,790
Who are you?

299
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,660
Both you and Song Zhuowen have something like this, right?

300
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,770
We're allies.

301
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,750
What do you want to ask?

302
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,240
Do you do it

303
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,050
with Song Zhuowen often?

304
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
I'll say it again.

305
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,680
It's none of your business what I do with him.

306
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,790
Do you have the light on when you do it with him?

307
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,520
What does it have to do with you?

308
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,740
How can I explain it to you?

309
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,720
It has nothing to do with me,

310
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,210
but it has something to do with you.

311
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,130
Every time

312
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,410
you do it with him,

313
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,640
do you think he's Song Zhuowen?

314
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,850
Could there be two people?

315
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,840
I mean twins!

316
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,020
I won't answer any of your questions. Let me go!

317
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,150
I'm from the Secret Service.

318
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,160
I have the right to question

319
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,520
anything I suspect.

320
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,910
Go ahead.

321
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,050
Do you think recently,

322
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,890
Song Zhuowen

323
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,830
has some habits

324
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,320
or actions that are

325
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,730
different from before?

326
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,540
Nope.

327
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,160
You've never done it before with him.

328
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,260
You should go ask Song Zhuowen

329
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,050
whether we have done it before.

330
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,850
It's something so intimate.

331
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,950
Will he tell you about it?

332
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,390
Or you can ask Ms. Guan too.

333
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,940
How dare I?

334
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,460
I'm telling you, I dare.

335
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,090
I'll tell Ms. Guan

336
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,990
there's a man named Pan Yue from the Secret Service

337
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,470
who came to school to cause trouble

338
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,290
and harassed female students in the name of Song Zhuowen.

339
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,020
That student's name is Xie Yue.

340
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,910
Let her to tell you what to do.

341
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,290
She will tell me.

342
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,240
Do whatever you want with this little bitch

343
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,220
named Xie Yue.

344
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,190
Thank you for your cooperation.

345
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,770
[Missing Person]

346
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,300
Kill him.

347
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,280
Is that what you're thinking?

348
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,410
Can you beat him?
