He deserves to die.

195
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,260
After he speaks,

196
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,600
he's worthless.

197
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,390
All right.

198
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,110
He should wake up.

199
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,590
Hurry up.

200
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,800
What's going on?

201
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,170
What's going on?

202
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,770
Official.

203
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,280
I warned you

204
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,400
he's too weak

205
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,020
to withstand

206
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,600
s-such strong acupuncture.

207
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,190

209

210

How dare you trouble us

211
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,120

212
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,140
We need new methods.

213
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,600
The interrogation room shouldn't be a morgue,

214
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,440
but where the Secret Service

215
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,890
can get more intel.

216
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,920
Nothing's achieved by killing.

217

Please stop.

218
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,760

219

220
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,990
I told Mr. Hu just now too.

Sorry it took so long. Enjoy.

224
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,980
Hello, Mr. Zhang?

225
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,590
I'm really sorry.

226
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,320
I suddenly have a patient.

227
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,270
It’s urgent.

228
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,710
Dr. Shi,

229
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,950
you can’t do this!

230
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,790
I rescheduled everything!

231
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,710
You're keeping me from getting the watch

232
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,710
at Yongshun Corp!

233
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,260
Li.

234
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,970
Stop what you're doing.

235
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,390
Wait at the street east of Yongshun Corp

236
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,620
till Dr. Shi shows up.

237
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,480
Okay.

238
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,050
Come in.

239
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,050
Ms. Guan, something's off.

240
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,100
What is it?

241
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,050
Wu sent that doctor off,

242
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,980
but he got off halfway

243
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,310
to visit a patient.

244
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,450
Something's fishy about Shi.

245
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,350
Tell them to

246
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,150

247
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,100
Yes.

248
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,550
Wait!

249
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,500
Check on Dr. Shi at the clinic.

250
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,290
Yes.

251
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,910

252
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,740

Hang in there.

257
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Can we save him?

258
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,350
Shut up!

259
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,150
Drive steadily!

260
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,180

261
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,460
Can't you drive steadily?

262
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,720
Right away.

263
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,870
Wake up!

265
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,800

and send it to Renhe Hospital.

282
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,690
Ask the staff to heat it up.

283
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,640
I'll pay for it.

284
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,690
Hold him.

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,140

Ms. Guan.

309
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,030
Why do you suspect Dr. Shi?

310
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,020
We hired him last minute.

311
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,150
How many times have we asked Dr. Shi for help?

312
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,070
Someone answer me.

313
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,610
A few times.

We'll be targeted.

318
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,830
Dr. Shi may be a communist.

319
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,480
He's dead meat.

320
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,240

389
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,910
What do you want?

390
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,550
I'm Japanese!

391
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,520
Put the gun down.

392
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,670
I'll count to three.

393
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,620
One.

394
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,510
-Can’t you hear me?
-Two.

395
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,340
Let go of me!

396
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,230
Let go of me!

397
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,010
-Let go of me!
-Don’t move!

398
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,570
Let go of me!

399
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,560
Let go of me!

400
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,480
Get up!

401
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,150
Let go of me!

402
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,690
I'm Japanese!

403
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,510
Who's that?

404
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,890
Pan Yue.

405
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,270
Let him get in my car.

406
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,410
[Entrance]

407
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,370
Have I changed?

408
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,360
Yes.

409
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,270
Now I have this.

410
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,100
No one can bully me.

411
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,070
Get in.
