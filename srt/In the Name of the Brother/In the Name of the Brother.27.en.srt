Nobody move!

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,150
Don't move!

6
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:43,870
What?

7
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,700
Do you know who I am?

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,270
Get off!

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,280
Keep up!

10
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,150
Get down!

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,080
Behave yourselves!

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,300
Get down!

13
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,620
Stop there!

14
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,870
I don't care who you are!

15
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,810
I'm on a mission!

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,880
Junko!

17
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,560
Don't touch her!

Go!

19
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,710

Go!

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,890
Take him there!

24
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,710
Wait!

25
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,829
Get up!

26
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,540
Yes.

27
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,100
He...

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,910
He's Xia Tao.

29
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,540
I don't know him.

30
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,560
I don't know him.

31
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,750
Officer, I really don't know him.

32
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,230
I'm just an underground transporter. I...

33
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,110
Except Xia Tao,

34
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,510
I don't know anyone else.

35
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,540
I...

36
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,270
Are any of them the shooter?

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,550
No.

38
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,260
They're carrying revolvers

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,140
with no trace of shooting.

40
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,940
Those were Mauser C96 gunshots.

41
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,950
I'm sure about it.

42
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,400
That means the shooter

43
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,750
is still among these people.

44
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,150
He couldn't have got out of the encirclement.

45
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,670
The Japanese Secret Police and the Military Police

46
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,400
have already blocked the exit.

47
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,550
We don't know

48
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,870
how many communists

49
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,930
are plotting here.

50
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,750
I hope they're all in the pockets

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,810
of the Japanese Secret Police and the Military Police.

52
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,230
Don't be afraid of trouble. Check them one by one.

53
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,230
No more mistakes.

54
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,790

You said you'd let me go!

58
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,550
Be reasonable!

59
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
You have to be reasonable!

60
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,019
You said you'd let me go!

61
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,190
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,830
I'm from the Police's Secret Service.

63
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,960
We're arresting a communist suspect.

64
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,860
Thank you for your hard work.

65
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,180
From now on,

66
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
we'll take over

these people.

68
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,530
Back off!

69
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,590
Before taking over,

70
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,920
-shouldn't you wait for us to...
-Shut up!

71
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm a soldier.

72
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,580
I received an order

73
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,790
to take over these people

74
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,060
and take them away.

75
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,740
Understand?

76
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,210
Ms. Guan, what's going on?

77
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,950
Are you asking me?

78
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,110
Should I call Mr. Asano?

79
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,010
Will it work?

80
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,460
Bastard!

81
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,590
Take him away!

82
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,350

86
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,230
-Yes.
-Tell him.

Yes.

91
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,920
His dad's the Finance Director, Mr. Long.

92
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,830
You got the wrong person. Don't take him away.

93
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,520
You're safe. He can't leave.

94
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
He's my classmate. Please!

Please help me.

Please let him go.

Please let him go.

99
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,550
Take him away!

00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,470
No!

Find out how many Buicks there are in Harbin.

Yes, the boxy car.

Why would the Japanese drive

an American car with a fake plate?

150
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,590

Let's wait and see.

152
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,290

194
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,760
Director Long's son?

195
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,830
0933.

196
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,870
What do you mean?

197
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,010
Anyone who enters here is a Maruta, a log.

198
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,590
They don't have names;

199
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,350
only serial numbers.

200
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,310
If you come in,

201
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,750
you can't get out alive.

202
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,430
It's okay. I can get out of here.

203
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,160
It's okay. I can get out.

204
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,910
I checked with the Transport Department.

205
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,710
All the plates of the Military Police's cars

206
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,550
were fake.

207
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,190
But why did the Japanese

208
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,650
use fake car plates?

209
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,550
Is there any point in investigating this?

210
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,580
I told you before.

211
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,040
Are we still building a new ledger with Asano?

212
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,230
I thought you'd change after escaping death.

213
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,310
You're one to talk. I can't change my bad temper.

214
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,640
What do you wanna do?

215
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,760
I really have no idea this time.

216
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,770
So I'm asking you.

217
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,430
Over the years,

218
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,950
many people went missing in the hands of the Japanese.

219
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,490
There are also many rumors about them.

220
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,710
We can’t even ask about it.

221
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,260
Do you remember Tian Xiaojiang?

222
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,910
We don’t even know if he’s alive.

223
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,720
Where could the Japanese have sent him to?

224
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,400
Zhuowen.

225
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,150
Zhuowen.

226
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,320
I'm Xiaojiang.

227
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,730
Do you remember me?

228
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,550
Every day here,

229
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,390
apart from my parents,

230
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,780
you were the one I hoped to see the most.

231
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,070
I talk about you all the time.

232
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,030
It's not in vain.

233
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,980
Buddy.

234
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,990
You've got the wrong person.

235
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,970
Police cadet of the sixth batch.

236
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,070
Assistant instructor

237
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,070
of the Prison School in 1940.

238
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,150
Jiangbei Railway patrolman in 1941.

239
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,950
I remember your resume clearly!

240
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,670
Buddy.

241
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,490
Let me repeat.

242
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,230
You've got the wrong person.

243
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,440
I'd never

244
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,930
mistake someone else for you, Song Zhuowen.

245
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,300
Why didn't you kill me then?

246
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,780
You should've just killed me!

247
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,390
Feeling better?

248
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,120
Feeling better?

249
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,600
You have no chance to kill me in this lifetime.

250
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,510
You have no chance to kill me in this lifetime!

251
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,470
You're next!

252
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,950
And then him!

253
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,010
And then him!

254
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,740
What is it?

255
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,110
What is it?

256
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,880
What did you see?

257
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,570
What did you see? Tell me!

258
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,230
Say something.

259
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,750
Are you dumb?

260
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,180
What did you see?

261
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,480
Gosh! Say something!

262
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,230
Say it.

263
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,350
What did you see?

264
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,080
Tell me. Don't make me anxious.

265
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,340
Bro, what is it? I can't see it clearly.

266
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,620
Tell me what it is.

267
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,150
Can't see it clearly?

268
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,320
That's a good thing.

269
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,690
Why didn't you go home?

270
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,790
Don't you have a business trip tomorrow?

271
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,760
I found the gun,

272
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,910
but not the shooter.

273
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,520
Intercepted by the Japanese again?

274
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,850
It's not the first time.

275
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,870
I think Zhuowen is right.

276
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,180
We can do dirty work,

277
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,510
but we need to know what it's for.

278
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,770
If this continues,

279
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,590
when will the days end?

280
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,470
I really want to

281
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,430
curse at the Japanese right now.

282
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,710
Sure.

283
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,790
Go do that.

284
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,380
The problem is

285
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,160
who will you

286
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,590
curse at?

287
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,070
Asano Diago?

288
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,110
Akio Doi?

289
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,330
In the eyes of the Japanese,

290
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,290
let alone the Secret Service,

291
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,690
the Harbin Police Agency is nothing.

292
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,350
Can we make waves?

293
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,830
It's not the time yet.

294
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
What should we do?

295
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,990
Endure it.

296
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,190
Asano Diago's a sly old fox.

297
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,080
He's sending me on a business trip

298
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,090
just to get me out of the way.

299
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,560
Did you really release He, that communist?

300
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,330
Of course not.

301
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,670
I asked Hu Bin to bring him back.

302
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,790
By the way, my gun should be changed.

303
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,420
I customized that Browning for you just half a year ago.

304
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,420
So what if I want a new one?

305
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,300
Why?

306
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,470
I just wanna.

307
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,530
It's jammed.

308
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,510
Jammed?

309
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,110
Jammed?

310
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,180
I'll change it.

311
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,670
Hello.

312
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,270
Hello, Zhuowen.

313
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,310
I'm Xie Yue.

314
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,430
One of my classmates went missing.

315
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,830
It might be related to a Japanese classmate

316
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,190
called Junko.

317
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,670
Relax. Speak slowly.

318
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,300
Tell me where you are now.

319
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,640
Listen. Follow from afar first.

320
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,610
Don't do

321
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,530
anything else.

322
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,850
I'll be right there.

323
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
What did Zhuowen say?

324
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,000
He asked us to wait.

325
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,060
He'll be here soon.

326
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,910
How is it? Are you used to the school?

327
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,980
It's yummy.

328
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,730
Okay, eat more.

329
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,880
Okay.

330
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,330
Rice tastes best.

331
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,050
Dad.

332
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,310
Was my classmate Long Xinliang

333
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,910
sent to that place of yours?

334
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,940
Have I seen him?

335
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,770
Anyone who enters that place is a Maruta

336
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,020
with no names; only serial numbers.

337
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,250
Dad.

338
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,900
I've never begged you.

339
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,630
But Long Xinliang

340
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,570
is a close friend of mine.

341
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:47,430
His dad is Harbin's Finance Director.

342
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,790
Do you know him?

343
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,980
You must know him.

344
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,430
Dad.

345
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,950
Please save him.

346
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,750
Dad!

347
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,470
Please help me.

348
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,830
Junko.

349
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,770
Who should you be thankful to

350
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,300
for being able to attend college at this time?

351
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,630
Young Master Ishii again?

352
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,570
Why do you keep mentioning him?

353
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,140
You mention him whenever something happens!

354
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,500
You always mention him!

355
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,910
If Young Master Ishii

356
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,300
hadn't brought us to Manchukuo,

357
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,900
I might not have raised you to this age.

358
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,190
So, we must be loyal

359
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,510
to Young Master Ishii

360
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,470
and to His Majesty!

361
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,310
Understand?

362
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,670
Don't mention it again.

363
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,429
Dad!

364
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,030
Dad!

365
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,739
Dad.

366
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,920
This conversation's over.

367
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,470
The Japanese girl in the school uniform

368
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,710
is my classmate.

369
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,300
The one in the military uniform next to her should be her father.

370
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,030
They often wait for buses here.

371
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,230
For the shuttle bus?

372
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,620
No idea.

373
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,240
Junko, let's go back.

374
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,130
Where are they going?

375
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,530
I don't know.

376
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,510
Do you know this person?

377
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,800
No.

378
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,050
Follow him.

379
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,570
You guys go back to school first.

380
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,500
Leave this to me.

381
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,990
Go.

382
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,710
You want your sister to know?

383
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,150
Bye.

384
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,470
Shuttle buses?

385
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,990
Welcome.

386
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,780
What would you like to drink?

387
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,100
A bottle of sake.

388
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,760
Okay.

389
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,250
Here you go.

390
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,140
Boss.

391
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,550
Who drew this painting?

392
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,230
Wanna buy it?

393
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,590
How much is it?

394
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,320
100 yuan.

395
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,070
It's a bunch of rotten stomachs and intestines

396
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,380
and it reeks of death,

397
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,870
yet it's 100 yuan?

398
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,990
The painter must be out of their mind.

399
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,310
Sir.

400
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,900
If you don't like our paintings,

401
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,650
pay for your drink and leave.

402
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,820
What did you say?

403
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,330
Get out!

404
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:04,870
Enough!

405
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,090
He's right.
