Hello, can I speak to Mr. Morikawa?

Please go in.

-It's him!
-Stop!

Are you talking about me, miss?

188
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,900
Wait. What does this have to do with me?

189
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,750
What? You don't dare admit it?

190
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,360
Is it because of Guan Kai?

191
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,560
What did I ever do to you?

192
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,280
She's just jealous.

193
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,670
Who are you talking about?

194
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,990
I'm talking about you!

195
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,590
What do you want?

196
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,670
Listen to me.

197
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,400
Go eat in the canteen

198
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,760
or go back to your dorms.

199
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,080
You, wait.

200
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,660
Don't go anywhere.

201
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,310
Go home immediately.

202
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,090
Answer your sister honestly after she gets back.

203
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,120
Don't lie to her.

204
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,960
Listen.

205
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,230
I have a way to make everyone in the school

206
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,230
believe that what's between us

207
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,760
isn't what they think it is.

208
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,500
Don't look at me. It's embarrassing.

209
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,480
That doesn't matter at all.

210
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,270
Can you do me a favor now?

211
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,470
What's it?

212
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,850
Take me away in front of them.

213
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,440
Do you dare?

214
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,590
Where do you want to go?

215
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,550
Anywhere.

216
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,750
Traitor! Get lost!

217
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,300
Stop causing us trouble at school.

218
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,310
Get lost! Go away!

219
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,630
Get lost!

220
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,670
Traitor! Betrayer!

221
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,430
Get out of our school!

222
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,310
Traitor!

223
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,140
Aunt Chang.

224
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,260
Come in.

225
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,020
Sir, you're back.

226
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,150
This is Miss Xie.

227
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,950
Aunt Chang.

228
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,590
Miss Xie.

229
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,320
She'll stay here for a few days.

230
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,570
Make up the storage room.

231
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,700
She'll sleep there.

232
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,870
Is there anything to eat?

233
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,420
There's…

234
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,280
No need to cook.

235
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,460
Anything warm will do.

236
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,980
Okay.

237
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,350
I'll leave tomorrow.

238
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,250
Since you're already here, forget about what happened today.

239
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,870
Solve tomorrow's problems tomorrow.

240
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,350
Hope you don't mind staying here.

241
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,010
Let me look.

242
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,950
I'm not trying to scare you.

243
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,400
Disinfect your wounds.

244
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,800
If they leave scars, it'll be hard for you to get married in the future.

245
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,290
Can I do anything for you?

246
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,570
I need to think about it.

247
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,490
Just don't stab me in the middle of the night.

248
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,680
I can't guarantee that.

249
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,520
Xie Yue is staying at your place.

250
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,050
Does Guan Xue know about it?

251
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,950
No.

252
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,280
Have you thought about

253
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,140
how she'll react if she finds out?

254
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,010
I can ask Xie Yue to move out immediately.

255
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,470
I just think Guan Xue won't go so far

256
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,330
as to interfere with my personal life at the moment.

257
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,200
Fine. You think this is a personal affair?

258
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,000
You invited a girl you don't know very well

259
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,420
to stay at your place

260
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,730
and will then ask her to leave without a reason.

261
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,060
Isn't that suspicious?

262
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,510
For people like us,

263
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
any abnormal change

264
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,510
will arouse people's curiosity.

265
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,670
And curiosity itself

266
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,270
means danger and disaster.

267
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,540
You're right. I admit I didn't think this through.

268
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,750
But there's really nothing

269
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,070
between Xie Yue and me.

270
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm talking about Guan Xue.

271
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,600
She won't let this go.

272
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,970
In for a penny, in for a pound.

273
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,920
I might as well make Xie Yue stay

274
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,630
and let Guan Xue think

275
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,760
there's something between her and me.

276
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,530
Will that work?

277
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,720
I'll do it.

278
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,270
Has Song Zhuowen's appointment been officially announced?

279
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,400
Yes. He's now the acting chief of the Intelligence Unit.

280
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,680
The meeting just ended.

281
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,630
Ms. Guan announced it herself.

282
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,800
Are you upset about something?

283
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,400
You may leave.

284
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,400
Okay.

285
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,370
Who's it?

286
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,090
It's me,

287
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,710
Song Zhuowen.

288
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,330
[Chief of the Intelligence Unit, Song Zhuowen]

289
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,870
I wanted

290
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,670
to tell you about my promotion

291
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,950
to acting chief myself.

292
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,510
But someone beat me to it.

293
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,720
Are you here for the key?

294
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,710
Mr. Jin told you

295
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,460
I was the only one who had the key to my office.

296
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,040
He doesn't have a spare.

297
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,720
If I really wanted your position,

298
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,680
I could just change the lock.

299
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,030
To be honest,

300
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,860
I don't have a spare one either.

301
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,340
Actually, you don't want to go back to that office.

302
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,080
What do you mean?

303
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,750
Because it's too small for you.

304
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,070
Mr. Pan.

305
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,870
I'll take over your duties for now.

306
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,400
Get better soon.

307
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,730
[Chief of the Intelligence Unit, Song Zhuowen]

308
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,130
There must be a lot of useful information

309
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,890
in Pan Yue's lockers.

310
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,460
This is what I joined the Secret Service for.

311
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,280
Come in.

312
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,690
Here's the full personnel list of the Intelligence Unit. Please take a look.

313
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,950
[Personnel List of the Intelligence Unit of the Secret Service of Harbin Police Agency]

314
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,790
Why have I never seen

315
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,910
this guy called Yu Hong?

316
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,160
Mr. Pan decided what everyone's job was.

317
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,960
I don't know.

318
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,030
I see.

319
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,950
Congratulations, Zhuowen.

320
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,270
Mr. Hu.

321
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,970
You know what? It's the first time

322
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,930
I've taken a good look around Mr. Pan's office.

323
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,360
It's your first time in this office over all these years?

324
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,310
The Intelligence Unit is always mysterious.

325
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,590
So are Pan Yue and his subordinates.

326
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,850
It felt weird when I dealt with them.

327
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,080
The guy called Qiao Liang,

328
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,790
I'll teach him a lesson sooner or later.

329
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,500
He's worked for Pan Yue for a long time.

330
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,550
If I were him,

331
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,480
I'd give you the cold shoulder too.

332
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,800
So it's normal for me

333
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,320
to find one name or two unfamiliar.

334
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,460
I've never met them, let alone you.

335
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,350
They're affiliated with the Intelligence Unit,

336
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,430
but they've been assigned different tasks.

337
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,490
Others in the section call them rats.

338
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,460
Rats that move in the dark.

339
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,160
Great. I'm the head rat now.

340
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,950
Actually, those two guys you haven't met

341
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,710
don't have any specific tasks.

342
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,430
They just hang around the bar

343
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,750
at Modern Hotel all year long.

344
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,690
What are they doing there?

345
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,470
Make one for yourself.

346
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,500
That bar

347
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,470
is a secret place

348
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,230
where everyone goes for intel exchange.

349
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,360
It's neither too big

350
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,350
nor too small.

351
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,310
Everyone in Harbin who gathers intel for a living

352
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,570
frequents that place.

353
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,990
There are people from Russia, Japan, North Korea, Britain, Germany,

354
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,400
and even Belgium.

355
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,350
But most of the intel there is fake.

356
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,210
There's not much valuable intel.

357
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,260
Since everyone knows about that place,

358
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,590
why do the Japanese just let it be

359
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,850
without intervening?

360
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,790
Here.

361
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,640
Eat up.

362
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,790
The Japanese

363
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,720
turn a blind eye to it with purpose.

364
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,910
They're playing a long game?

365
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,710
You can also say it's their bait.

366
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,870
Harbin

367
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,430
is a strategic point in the Far East,

368
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,270
with various forces intertwined.

369
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,390
Take one force down, and another will emerge.

370
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,350
Banning those underground dealings only makes them more secretive,

371
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,390
making them harder to monitor.

372
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,550
So they might as well infiltrate their men into that place.

373
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,310
Who knows?

374
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,710
Maybe they can find something unexpected.

375
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,510
Zhuowen.

376
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,110
Can I say now

377
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,870
that from here on out,

378
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,150
we'll be Ms. Guan's right-hand men?

379
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,170
I'm still not capable enough.

380
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,190
Here.

381
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,650
I'll just take over Mr. Pan's duties for now.

382
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,350
Come here. Play for me.

383
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,190
You know what?

384
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,590
I had a straight flush

385
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,090
but lost to a full house. I went all in.

386
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,310
Really?

387
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,870
As long as you're still in the game, you haven't lost.

388
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,190
I can't believe I lost.

389
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,950
Sometimes, once the game starts,

390
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,110
you can't quit.

391
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,370
You're not the dealer.

392
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,840
If you don't want to play, find someone to take your place.

393
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,260
Who can take my place?

394
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,790
Pan Yue.

395
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,190
Hu Bin.

396
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,920
Zhuowen.

397
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,480
They can take turns to play for you.

398
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,520
But the current balance

399
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,710
has been disrupted by Asano Diago,

400
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,840
and he's the dealer.

401
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
It's a bit tricky.

402
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,510
I've been pondering over it recently.

403
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,230
Why haven't I ever won

404
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,990
since this dealer joined the game?

405
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,150
Actually,

406
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,790
you haven't really lost.

407
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,510
Asano Diago

408
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,550
just shook things up a bit.

409
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,850
He didn't kick you out of the game.

410
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,310
It's just that you don't know what he's up to.

411
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,390
I'm afraid that when I figure that out,

412
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,720
I'll have been bled dry.

413
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,510
He's not the only dealer in the world.

414
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,450
If this game is not fun for you,

415
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,650
go play another one.

416
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,290
I'm the dealer in the Secret Service.

417
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,950
I'll bleed Song Zhuowen dry too.

418
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,420
I gave him that position, so he has to work for me.

419
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,750
Zhuowen is always lucky.

420
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,560
Let him play for you.

421
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,950
I'll go play again.

422
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,890
Maybe I'll be lucky this time.

423
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,160
Move.

424
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,830
Don't ever be complacent.

425
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,810
Who are you talking about?

426
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,219
Me?

427
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,949
Am I?

428
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,750
Haven't you noticed that

429
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,400
you have intel written all over your face now?

430
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,230
I know. I know.

431
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,030
But honestly,

432
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,760
I've indeed gained more than I thought this time.

433
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,750
Pan Yue left us a treasure.

434
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,969
I'll find out what's valuable as soon as possible

435
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,570
and send it to you in batches.

436
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,130
We're short on time,

437
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,530
so you need to prioritize

438
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,550
and first sort out the key information

439
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,550
related to the fortresses of the Kwantung Army.

440
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,429
I understand.

441
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,659
Construction specifications, building materials,

442
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,590
garrison composition, weapons and equipment,

443
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,920
and supply quantities.

444
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,670
If we're lucky,

445
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,630
we can also obtain their firepower deployment diagrams.

446
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,550
One more thing.

447
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,470
You must find out the real reason

448
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,530
Asano Diago came to Harbin this time.

449
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,850
That's

450
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,630
too hard.

451
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,980
With Xie Yue and Aunt Chang at my place,

452
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,270
I appear to have a normal home

453
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,750
and be a normal man

454
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,120
in other people's eyes.

455
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,310
But for me,

456
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,690
I need to be wary of both those in the Secret Service

457
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,010
and Aunt Chang

458
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,160
at home.

459
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,470
Coming.

460
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,270
Who's it?

461
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,870
It's me.

462
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,910
Ms. Guan.

463
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,580
What happened?

464
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,690
So many dishes. Quite a feast.

465
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,590
Can you finish them all by yourself?

466
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,630
I'm in a good mood

467
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,710
because of the promotion.

468
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,640
So I asked Aunt Chang to make a few more dishes.

469
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,770
Have you had dinner?

470
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,710
How can you eat without wine?

471
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,880
Fortunately, I've brought wine with me.

472
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,810
You're my superior. It should be me giving you gifts.

473
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,310
You have a bright future.

474
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,810
I have to curry favor with you now.

475
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,880
I don't know what you want me to say.

476
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,120
Take a guess.

477
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,190
Why am I here today?

478
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,750
You're wearing the same clothes as you did during the day,

479
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,480
which is quite unusual for you.

480
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,490
Normally, when you drive yourself,

481
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,550
you'll have your car key in your hand.

482
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,190
It seems that you left it in the car today.

483
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,110
So I guess

484
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,470
you came here without going home or having dinner.

485
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,730
But you're not here for dinner.

486
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,120
You need to talk to me about something.

487
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,370
So observant.

488
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,960
I can't hide anything from you.

489
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,890
Keep guessing.

490
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,630
If you guess right, I'll eat with you.

491
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,220
If you guess wrong, you'll have to buy me two meals.

492
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,270
I guess it's still about the bombings.

493
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,730
Pan Yue is in the hospital.

494
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,670
Hu Bin searches the streets every day

495
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,070
but has made no progress.

496
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,470
Mr. Asano must have called to ask about it.

497
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,050
Take a look at the file.

498
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,400
Mr. Asano said

499
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,650
we have three more days at most

500
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,510
and must give him a clear answer.

501
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,930
I need to use the bathroom.

502
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,990
Don't mind me. I know this place.

503
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,830
You didn't let me down.

504
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,070
You're quick.

505
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,270
You've already moved in.

506
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,360
How do you know I'm here?

507
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,630
You just left the table.

508
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,970
The cushion was still warm.

509
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,030
Do you like how Song Zhuowen smells?

510
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,100
Smell?

511
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,070
I don't know how he smells.

512
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,790
Then hurry up and find it out.

513
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,630
Tell me when you have the answer.

514
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,150
I couldn't see your flaws in the past.

515
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,010
That scared me.

516
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,600
People who hide their flaws

517
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,800
usually hide their intentions and weapons.

518
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,390
Now that I've seen your flaw,

519
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,620
I'm not afraid anymore

520
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,650
but feel jealous instead.

521
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,270
I feel that I'm old now

522
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,520
and can't compare to that young girl.

523
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,590
Actually, Xie Yue…

524
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,860
It doesn't matter who she is.

525
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,990
You like her. That's all that matters.

526
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,310
Fine.

527
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,120
You really like her?

528
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,780
Not really.

529
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,790
I'll be frank with you then.

530
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,910
I don't like the way she looks at you.

531
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,630
I want to gouge her eyes out.

532
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,550
Can I ask you for something?

533
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,830
What do you want?

534
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,030
Just tell me yes or no.

535
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,830
Anything but my life.

536
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,220
I'm very patient.

537
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,780
I can wait.

538
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,600
But I don't have a big heart.

539
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,130
You'd better not upset me.

540
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,990
If I'm upset,

541
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,890
I may do anything.

542
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,470
Just tell me what you want.

543
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,870
What soap do you use?

544
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,300
It smells good.

545
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,150
I want one.
