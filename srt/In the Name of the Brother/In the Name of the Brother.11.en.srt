[Episode 11]

4
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,390
Come down!

5
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,630
Come down!

6
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,670
Get up!

7
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,710
Up! Get up!

8
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,030
Get up!

9
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,910
Get up!

10
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,860
Move!

11
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,810
Keep moving!

12
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,490
Come down!

13
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:28,030
Why are you arresting me?

14
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,920
You've got the wrong guy.

15
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,870
Keep moving!

16
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,920
It's Shi Mingfa!

17
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,390
Shi Mingfa is a communist!

18
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,430
Keep moving!

19
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,550
You've got the wrong guy. He's a communist!

20
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,630
-Shut up!
-You should take him!

21
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,230
Shut up!

22
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,480
He's a communist!

23
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,990
I know.

24
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,920
If you don't vent your anger,

25
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,680
you'll have a sleepless night.

26
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,079
Do you really think I'll be wary of an old woman?

27
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,700
I must be out of my mind to do that.

28
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,350
The last time something like this happened,

29
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,510
it was when my uncle was killed.

30
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
He went down right before me.

31
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,590
I still remember

32
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,320
the smell of his guts.

33
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,430
Actually, it's my fault.

34
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,370
I was too careless today.

35
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,830
It was a stupid mistake.

36
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,320
In our business,

37
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,190
you'll get shot if you're not careful enough.

38
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,630
That's hindsight.

39
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,560
It's not anyone's fault.

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,300
The enemy won't listen to your excuse before shooting you.

41
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,830
If this happens again,

42
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,310
don't worry about anything

43
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,590
or think about anything.

44
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,510
Just run.

45
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,110
Don't look back.

46
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,550
Forget your responsibilities.

47
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,560
Don't worry about disgrace

48
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,960
or other people's lives.

49
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,630
Okay?

50
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,010
Do you understand?

51
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,180
Can you read my mind?

52
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,250
That's what I want to tell you.

53
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,310
Actually, I was so scared earlier that I almost wet myself.

54
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,970
My knees are still weak now.

55
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,950
But in front of you,

56
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,910
I had to hold on.

57
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,870
If it gets out and Hu Bin and the others know,

58
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,200
I'll never live it down.

59
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,350
Hello?

60
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,280
Put your Ms. Guan on.

61
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,920
Is that for me?

62
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,220
It's Mr. Pan.

63
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,290
Asano Diago has decided to chalk up last night's chaos

64
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,240
to a tripped circuit breaker.

65
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,810
I don't think it's appropriate.

66
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,390
He must be joking.

67
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,750
No one will believe that.

68
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,830
But I think

69
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:37,150
maybe Mr. Asano

70
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,510
wants to keep something from us.

71
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,030
What do you think?

72
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,220
You know what to do, don't you?

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,880
Just do it.

74
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,210
Don't let me make all the decisions.

75
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,110
I have an idea.

76
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,070
Say it.

77
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,200
Detain everyone participating in tonight's event,

78
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,470
take them to the Police Agency,

79
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,230
and question each of them thoroughly.

80
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,950
Okay.

81
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,430
Give the order in the name of the Secret Service.

82
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,790
Don't cut anyone slack, including me.

83
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,640
Mr. Pan is as efficient as he always is.

84
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,440
He actually got the number here.

85
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,940
I should go back to sleep.

86
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,870
I can only fall asleep in my own bed.

87
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,050
I'll get a car for you.

88
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,780
They've sent a car to pick me up.

89
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,390
Give me a hug.

90
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,710
Nothing happened today.

91
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,720
Including this moment.

92
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,230
Understand?

93
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,020
Yes.

94
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,920
Are you crazy? Do you know how risky this is?

95
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,680
You saw it?

96
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,340
Has Guan Xue changed?

97
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,850
She's no longer the Guan Xue

98
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,050
I met eight years ago.

99
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,530
Do you regret saving her?

100
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,290
That's a different thing.

101
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,400
She was a good girl back then.

102
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,870
She's like a bad apple now.

103
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,810
Rotten to the core.

104
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,940
When I held a gun against her head,

105
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,130
she didn't flinch at all.

106
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,050
Let me look at you.

107
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,750
It hurt a lot, didn't it?

108
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,660
It should hurt.

109
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,180
Give me the camera.

110
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,720
You almost ruined everything.

111
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,540
You're crazy. You're completely crazy!

112
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,070
I asked you to keep Song Zhuowen around.

113
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,190
That's how you keep him around?

114
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,720
Aren't you always on guard?

115
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,590
Aren't you controlling?

116
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,810
Say something!

117
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,440
No one can let me drop my guard.

118
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,430
He's no exception.

119
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,230
Nonsense!

120
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,820
You slept in his bed.

121
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,400
Do you have a death wish?

122
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,170
Are you possessed?

123
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,750
I'm not.

124
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,550
Shut up.

125
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,870
Don't act so aggrieved.

126
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,590
Since you got into the game, you've been working with me.

127
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,810
I'm kind of your mentor.

128
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,920
Drop it.

129
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,970
I know you better than anyone else.

130
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,060
Since the day you went to Japan for training,

131
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,590
your life has been a living hell.

132
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,400
You've been through so much.

133
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,000
Have you forgotten all of that?

134
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,730
You've forgotten it.

135
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,190
It's fine.

136
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,540
Come with me. Look in the mirror.

137
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,000
-Look at your scars.
-You…

138
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,500
Look at your scars!

139
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,790
Look at your scars. Come here.

140
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,460
Take your shirt off.

141
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,630
"I'll carve these scars on other people."

142
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,350
That was the first thing you said to me

143
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,080
after you came back from Japan.

144
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,310
You've forgotten every word of it!

145
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,600
You've forgotten everything.

146
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,930
It means nothing to you now.

147
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,210
Guan Xue.

148
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,000
Don't forget your aspirations.

149
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,600
You know better than anyone

150
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,110
how hard it is

151
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,900
to live for aspirations.

152
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,110
I can't do it.

153
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,390
But you can.

154
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,190
Don't be disturbed.

155
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,790
Don't get carried away.

156
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,420
If one day you find me an obstacle,

157
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,400
don't hesitate to wipe me out.

158
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,160
That day won't come.

159
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,340
Don't have any

160
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,040
unnecessary feelings for Song Zhuowen.

161
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Don't trust him completely.

162
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,510
Drink up.

163
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,070
The coffee is getting cold.

164
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,270
I don't like its taste.

165
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,670
We'll discuss the script again today.

166
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,710
We need to finalize it, or we won't have time for rehearsals.

167
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,070
Why do we have to discuss it here?

168
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,190
It's quieter at school.

169
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,450
Isn't this place good?

170
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,870
We're discussing it with the wrong people.

171
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,360
Even if we find the problems, it's useless.

172
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,310
Li Dongzhu, what do you mean?

173
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,080
Calm down.

174
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,910
Make it clear. Who are the wrong people?

175
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,910
He bought us expensive coffee.

176
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,750
You're so rich.

177
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,220
-Your parents don't just do small business, do they?
-Get up.

178
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,260
So you think just because you're rich,

179
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,550
you can invite anyone into the drama club,

180
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,150
don't you?

181
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,850
Nakamura, you got promoted again.

182
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,170
Congratulations.

183
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,410
What's your secret?

184
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,630
Tell me about it.

185
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,070
Nakamura.

186
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,630
Tell us about it.

187
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,920
When you set off,

188
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,630
hire locals as guides.

189
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,970
If

190
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,480
they can't find the Counter-Japanese Army,

191
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,390
just kill them.

192
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,350
Does the student council president

193
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,670
have the right to forbid a student from asking questions?

194
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,620
Xie Yue is very introverted.

195
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,120
Let's rehearse the play.

196
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,890
Why are we doing this play?

197
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,510
The biggest problem here is you.

198
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,550
What did I do? Why am I the problem?

199
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,230
The people you killed were all civilians?

200
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,990
The mountain roads were so bumpy.

201
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,569
The forests were so dense.

202
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,510
It's not easy to find the Counter-Japanese Army.

203
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,510
The other troops did the same.

204
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,750
Did the locals rise up?

205
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,540
Find local reporters

206
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,480
to make up proper excuses and accusations.

207
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,790
Then it'll be foolproof.

208
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,890
All right.

209
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,870
Cheers! Cheers!

210
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Stop. Stop. Stop.

211
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,900
Secretary Cai.

212
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,910
I remember I was in the cold dish area.

213
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,380
This spot by the bar.

214
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,010
Mr. Xu.

215
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:30,670
Here.

216
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,840
I was at the bar in the cold dish area.

217
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,690
This spot.

218
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,710
This spot.

219
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,620
Okay.

220
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,240
Ding Peng, where were you?

221
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,700
I was patrolling outside.

222
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,640
I was in the parking lot.

223
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,200
Be specific.

224
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,350
In front of that Buick.

225
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,810
I remember the driver being Wu.

226
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,510
Which Buick?

227
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,460
The Secret Service alone has four Buicks.

228
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,590
How many Buicks would there have been in the parking lot?

229
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,260
Wu.

230
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,870
The plate number is 0921.

231
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,910
Mr. Hu.

232
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,600
Where were you at that time?

233
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,570
I was standing by the bar.

234
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,190
Standing next to me

235
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,640
was her.

236
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,060
Yes.

237
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,000
We were at the bar alone.

238
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,870
Mr. Hu was reading my palm.

239
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,260
How did the reading go?

240
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,910
I forgot.

241
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,970
Mr. Hu forgot.

242
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,040
Did you forget?

243
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,150
I…

244
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,620
He didn't read your palm.

245
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,910
Song Zhuowen.

246
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,310
I remember

247
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,270
you spending most of that day with Ms. Guan.

248
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,750
That's not the case.

249
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,750
By that moment, Ms. Guan

250
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,610
had gone upstairs with Mr. Asano.

251
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
I was in the lobby on the first floor.

252
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,110
Approximately,

253
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,780
this spot.

254
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,430
Behind Mr. Zhao.

255
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,860
Mr. Zhao.

256
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,710
I was here.

257
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,220
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

258
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,910
Ms. Guan.

259
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,130
Who is the telegram from?

260
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,770
Squirrel.

261
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,650
What is an encoded telegram?

262
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,910
You should give it to me personally

263
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,330
when we're alone.

264
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,210
Squirrel-encoded telegram?

265
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,050
Why didn't you just say it through a speaker?

266
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,640
[Telegram]

267
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,940
Encrypt it with the highest level of security and send it immediately.

268
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,450
Yes.

269
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,610
She replied to that encoded telegram so quickly,

270
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,720
so the codebook must be near her.

271
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,670
I need to find both the encoded telegram and the codebook.

272
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,960
It's so hard.

273
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,690
It's a Squirrel-encoded telegram again?

274
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,010
What does that mean?

275
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,890
In the Secret Service, don't inquire into things you should not know.

276
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,690
And be careful with what you say.

277
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,040
Fine. Even you two are not qualified to know about it.

278
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,940
He's a senior informant reporting directly to Ms. Guan, right?

279
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,460
It was with this informant's help

280
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,010
that your Guan Xue became the Section Chief.

281
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,190
Have you met Squirrel?

282
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,760
Who am I to meet Squirrel?

283
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,240
You've been working under Ms. Guan for a long time.

284
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,980
Okay.

285
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,350
A man or a woman.

286
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,470
Old or young.

287
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,710
I even think

288
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,390
it may not be a human.

289
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,180
Ms. Guan is really something.

290
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,020
Otherwise, she wouldn't be the Section Chief.

291
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,480
Ms. Guan, have you ever thought about this?

292
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,610
If…

293
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,870
I mean, if…

294
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,180
If you hadn't joined the Secret Service,

295
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,720
what would you be doing now?

296
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,230
If I hadn't met you back then,

297
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,070
I might be dead now.

298
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,670
If I hadn't met you,

299
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,230
I'd still be patrolling the square,

300
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,980
changing shifts every eight hours,

301
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,580
and standing for a whole day.

302
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,820
That's just fate.

303
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,330
What if you hadn't saved me?

304
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,200
There's no "if."

305
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,040
[Harbin Station]

306
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,750
My informant on the square told me

307
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,700
that a young girl used to run a stall there,

308
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,140
but the day after Watanabe was killed,

309
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,510
she disappeared.

310
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,580
The death of that Japanese man was a serious matter.

311
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,670
The patrol team and the Public Security Section

312
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,790
both stepped in.

313
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,190
Those unlicensed vendors

314
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,620
around the square

315
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,850
definitely don't dare to show up again.

316
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,510
To be honest,

317
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,630
since I joined the Secret Service,

318
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,670
I get jitters a lot.

319
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,370
Things come up every day.

320
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,810
No one has been caught,

321
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,870
yet I'm interrogated like a criminal every day.

322
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,710
You regret it?

323
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,780
No.

324
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,630
If you regret it one day,

325
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,510
don't tell me.

326
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,390
I don't want to know.

327
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,180
Here we are. Pull over.

328
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,700
[Modern Hotel]

329
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,320
Keep what you said in mind.

330
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,600
There is no "if."

331
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,050
What would you like to drink?

332
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,210
Two cups of coffee. Thank you.

333
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,740
Okay. Please wait a moment.

334
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,830
There must be a reason why you chose this table.

335
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,300
It's just my habit.

336
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,150
In relatively enclosed spaces

337
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,830
like restaurants,

338
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,660
don't leave your back exposed to others.

339
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,950
And it's convenient to observe the people coming in and out.

340
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,590
Enjoy.

341
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,510
I like coming out.

342
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,160
It's more interesting than the training for newbies.

343
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,090
Any more advice?

344
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,820
In a word,

345
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,430
don't have a routine.

346
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,690
Change your barber now and then.

347
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,990
Go to different bathhouses.

348
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,740
Eat at different restaurants.

349
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,960
Too many people hate us.

350
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,060
Don't give them a chance.

351
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,870
But it's a pity that we have to eat

352
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,400
at different restaurants.

353
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,530
I quite like this restaurant.

354
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,600
For people like me who killed their way here,

355
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,640
what they like never matters.

356
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,150
I have no choice.

357
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,330
No one is reliable.

358
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,620
I can only rely on myself.

359
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,870

360
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,850

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,130
I'm thinking about

363
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,850
how to keep your words in mind.

364
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,230
Cut it out.

365
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,110
Your dish. Enjoy.

366
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,430
Didn't you just eat in a Western restaurant?

367
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,890
Why are you gobbling here?

368
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,760
When eating with her,

369
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,310
I had to focus all my attention on dealing with her.

370
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,310
I barely ate.

371
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,690
You just mentioned agent principles. What are they?

372
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,000
Just the basics.

373
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,710
Like, don't visit the same restaurant twice

in a short period of time.

375
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,480
And learn to take advantage of the environment.

376
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,080
Find the best spot in places like Modern Hotel.

377
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,350
Nothing special.

378
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,600
Where is my brother?

379
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,790
He's sleeping.

380
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,050
He was exhausted last night.

381
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,120
Years of roaming free have left my brother undisciplined.

382
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
You've got to keep a close eye on him.

383
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,500
Guan Xue gave us a reminder.

384
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,720
You come here very often.

385
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,740
You need to have a good excuse.

386
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,590
Yeah.

387
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,430
Your cooking is light on oil but heavy on salt.

388
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,340
It's far-fetched if I say

389
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,980
I'm here for your cooking.

390
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm running a small business.

391
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,970
It'll be weird if my cooking is light on salt but heavy on oil.

392
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,290
Plus refined grains,

393
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,110
the economy police will show up at my door.

394
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,840
We should hurry up

395
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,790
and find a new way of communication.

396
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,020
Does the Secret Service order newspapers every day?

397
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,820
Binjiang Daily. It's delivered to every section.

398
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,090
Then, let's do this.

399
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,130
When I need to contact you,

400
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,470
I'll put up a notice in the newspaper

401
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,250
looking for someone or something.

402
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,570
Then, starting from the second line,

403
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,990
I'll pick out every fourth word,

404
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,520
skipping three in between,

405
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,560
and make them a message.

406
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,720
Unless it's urgent,

407
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,990
don't make calls.

408
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,590
Qian, table A wants a stew.

409
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,580
When I need to contact you…

410
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,980
Remember my balcony that faces the street?

411
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,860
I'll buy two plants later and put them there.

412
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,220
When I need to meet you,

413
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,710
I'll turn the spout

414
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,590
of the watering can inward.

415
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,510
As for the time and place,

416
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,810
we'll decide in advance

417
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,240
during our last meeting.

418
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,450
Also, I have a stake in your restaurant.

419
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,140
You're using those dirty tricks you learned on the railways

420
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,170
on me now.

421
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,060
Here.

422
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,470
Coming.

423
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,200
It's hot.

424
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,550
Fine.

425
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,320
Let's make it clear.

426
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,310
Back then,

427
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,440
when you were working on the railways,

428
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,550
you tricked me

429
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,220
into letting you invest in this restaurant.

430
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,260
You put in 20 silver dollars, right?

431
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,560
That's a 20% stake.

432
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,380
I want it in black and white.

433
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,360
I'll take care of it.

434
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,600
So salty.

435
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,210
Where is the water?

436
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,220
Well, in the pot. Help yourself.

437
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,600
Yes, the train station.

438
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,760
Go by yourself.

439
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,330
Ask around about a girl who used to run a stall.

440
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,830
She sold feather dusters.

441
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,120
She's suspicious.

442
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,460
The day after Sheriff Watanabe was killed,

443
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,190
she disappeared.

444
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,230
Should I arrest her once I find her?

445
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,980
Report to me first.

446
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,490
Is this your stall?

447
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,690
Yes.

448
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,700
What's wrong?

449
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,980
Did you sell feather dusters before?

450
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,680
A girl once ran a stall

451
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,410
selling feather dusters here.

452
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,410
Have you seen her?

453
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,110
No.

454
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,410
Why did you do that?

455
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,150
[The goods are ready.]

456
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,350
[Please come and get them.]

457
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,570
[Time and place]

458
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,699
Don't visit the same restaurant twice

459
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,239
in a short period of time.

460
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,270
Find the best spot in places like Modern Hotel.

461
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,550
Nothing special.

462
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,060
[Two days later, 11:30 p.m.]

463
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,790
[Modern Hotel near the train station]

464
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,580
[Sign of recognition: a white scarf]

465
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,510
[The password remains the same.]

466
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,540
Got it.

467
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,330
Ms. Guan.

468
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,510
The girl who sold feather dusters

469
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,350
only set up her stall for three days.

470
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,550
She fought with the Japanese vendor next to her.

471
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,030
No one knows where she lives

472
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,110
or her name.

473
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,090
It was Watanabe who mediated between them in the end.

474
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:23,990
Watanabe

475
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,710
was trying to rape a woman

476
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,450
when he was killed.

477
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,210
Stop looking into her.

478
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,180
Why?

479
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,820
What one fears most tends to happen.

480
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,950
Another Japanese soldier was killed.

481
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,070
The bullet went straight through.

482
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,200
He should've been shot at close range.

483
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,360
He was Nakamura,

484
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,270
affiliated with the Garrison of Heihe Military Police.

485
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,800
Before the incident, he was drinking with two fellow Japanese.

486
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,910
They said

487
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,360
he had no enemies in Harbin.

488
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,880
However, when they were drinking,

489
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,740
he said things he should not have.

490
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,750
What did he say?

491
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,430
Both of them are very agitated.

492
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,690
And they're Japanese.

493
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,940
They're only willing to talk to you.

494
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,270
I'll talk to them.

495
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,430
Thoroughly inspect the café.

496
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,380
Find out who was there at that time.

497
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,900
Also, take a close look around the scene.

498
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,340
Figure out what kind of bullet and gun killed him.

499
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:46,870
Yes.

500
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,700
This is a list of people

501
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,830
who visited that café from the afternoon to the evening.

502
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,340
Is the autopsy report out?

503
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,780
The bullet penetrated his skull,

504
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,010
from which we can infer that

505
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,810
the shooter was within three meters of the victim.

506
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,500
There are 6 students on the list.

507
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
What are their names?

508
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,270
They're all from Harbin Institute of Technology.

509
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,250
Is Guan Kai one of them?

510
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,760
They're just students.

511
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,420
How could they possibly be involved in a murder?

512
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,430
Kai.

513
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,840
It's my first time here. Is this how you welcome me?

514
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,180
How did you know it was me?

515
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,540
I gave him the gun.

516
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,640
No one in the café

517
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,680
had the motive to kill that Japanese.

518
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,940
Now, there's total resistance against Japanese aggression in the south.

519
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,070
Maybe someone from the outside did it.

520
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,430
Think about it. A few Japanese country folks,

521
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,050
amidst a time when everyone clamors to wipe out the Counter-Japanese Army,

522
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,120
talked about the despicable act

523
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,150
of killing the innocent and claiming undeserved credit.

524
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,780
They were all wasted

525
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,280
and didn't even know their friend was shot to death.

526
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,600
There's no way to find out the truth.

527
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,510
There's no way.

528
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:29,630
There's no way.

529
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:54,830
Get up.

530
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,820
What are you doing?

531
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,820
What's wrong with you?

532
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,070
What are you looking for?

533
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,810
Where is your gun?

534
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,550
I lost it.

535
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,140
Give me your gun.

536
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,020
I told you I can't find it.

537
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,900
How dare you lie to me

538
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,920
at this point?

539
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,150
I'm not lying!

540
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,560
Are you trying to get me killed?

541
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,880
Are you trying to get me killed?

542
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,950
Why did you kill that Japanese man?

543
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,570
Why didn't you tell me?

544
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,190
Why did you kill that Japanese man?

545
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,370
I didn't kill any Japanese!

546
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,830
-I didn't!
-Are you crazy?

547
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,410
Give me your gun.

548
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,390
I don't have it.

549
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,030
I lost it.

550
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,680
Don't force me to go hard on you.

551
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,770
I have 100 ways to find your gun.

552
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,630
But I hope you can give it to me yourself.

553
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,950
I need to go to school!

554
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,510
Ask for leave!

555
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,870
But if you dare to play dirty with me,

556
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,470
I'll make you pay.

557
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,210
You're just like those Japanese!
