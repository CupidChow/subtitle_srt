00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,820
Can I park my car inside?

7
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,800
No.

8
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,940
My wife's discharged today.

9
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,090
When did she give birth?

10
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,920
A week ago.

11
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,140
How can I get to Modern Hotel?

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,960
No idea.

13
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,910

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,230
What happened?

20
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,030
They ran away.

21
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,710
Interrogate Tian Xiaojiang.

22
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,700
Yes.

23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,940
Guys!

24
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,350

Tian Xiaojiang insisted on going to

30
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,710

31
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,880
What about you?

While working,

33
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,470
we saw many people running into the building.

34
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,530
Xiaojiang was sure

35
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,540
it's an operation

36
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,950
to catch communists.

37
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,750
Many people were mobilized,

38
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,360
so I thought they must be

39
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,390
making arrests.

40
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,300
Is there a problem?

41
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,110
Go on!

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
After that,

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,100
Xiaojiang ran away with the team.

44
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,950
Zhuowen said

45
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,420
to follow him.

46
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,670
I followed him

47
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,870
to Renhe Hospital,

48
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,070
where I met Ms. Guan.

49
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,950
Xiaojiang said he could

50
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,590
catch Mrs. Shi

51
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,910
quickly.

52
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,640
Yes.

53
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,950
I told Zhuowen

54
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,420
to report my plan

55
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,310
to Ms. Guan.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,480
Ms. Guan

57
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,280
asked us to guard the hospital entrance.

58
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,670
To be honest,

59
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,200
we were both unwilling.

60
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,840
Then Xiaojiang asked me to pass a message to Ms. Guan.

61
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,730
What about the woman holding a child?

62
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,670
A woman holding a child?

63
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,780
Yes.

64
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,670
Her man was lost and asked me

65
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,670
where Modern Hotel is.

66
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,550
That's all.

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,820
I kindly

68
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,310
returned him his wallet

69
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,350
that he dropped.

70
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,310
When did I let a woman with a child go?

71
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,050
I know who's the real communist!

72
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,659
It's Song Zhuowen!

73
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,450
Let him go.

74
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,830
Evidence!

75
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,820
Evidence?

76
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,310
Evidence?

77
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,890
Evidence?

78
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,409
The fountain pen

79
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,630

80
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,360
A pen?

81
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,040
Go on.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Mr. Pan.

83
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,630
Mr. Pan.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,010
That night, you were there too.

85
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,290
I recall that a fountain pen

86
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,750
killed Watanabe.

87
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,620
Right?

88
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,750
Watanabe's murderer

89
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,850
must be someone he knew.

90
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,170
Zhuowen fits the bill.

91
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,430
Song Zhuowen.

92
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,260
How do you know

93
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,350
the pen belongs to Zhuowen?

94
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,130
I saw that he recently replaced

95
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,020
his pen nib.

96
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,470
Pen?

97
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,470
Pen.

98
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,590
Where is it?

99
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,170
I have it.

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,580
I have it.

101
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,980
I have it.

102
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,790
I have it.

103
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,780
I have it.

104
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,920
Tian Xiaojiang!

105
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,040
You’re slandering me!

106
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
Playing tricks, huh?

107
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
Trying to kill me?

108
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,550
You've long disliked me!

109
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,810
I'm not your stepping stone

110
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,370
to climb up the ranks!

111
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,710
Tian Xiaojiang!

112
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,530
I won’t forgive you!

113
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,160
I won't forgive you!

114
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,490
Let go!

115
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,450
Is this pen yours?

116
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,330
Yes, it's mine.

117
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,460
I lost it yesterday.

118
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,110
Why is it here?

119
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,180
Did you just replace the pen nib?

120
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,990
Yes.

121
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,310
I broke it while writing.

122
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,640
When did you replace it?

123
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
I can't remember.

124
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,000
Think carefully before you speak.

125
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,690
A few days ago.

126
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,270
Where did you replace it?

127
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,460
The pen repair shop on Wenmiao Street.

128
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,470
Exact date?

129
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,930
Have you seen this pen?

130
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,220
Yes, I fixed it.

131
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,940
This pen is rare in Harbin.

132
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,170
Are you sure?

133
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,980
Yes, I used the nib from an old Parker 1922 pen.

134
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,760
When did you replace it?

135
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,990
A few days ago.

136
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,870
Let me think.

137
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,840
It checked out.

138
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,340
Get Song Zhuowen.

139
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,030
Okay.

140
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,960
Ms. Guan wants to see you.

141
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,320
It's strange.

142
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,870
Why do you have my pen?

143
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,080
Tian Xiaojiang.

144
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,530
You mustn't have slept well last night.

145
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,300
Did he say that too?

146
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,980
It's his mission.

147
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,850
I'll kill you.

148
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,680
I used this pen to kill him,

149
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,850
but the nib cracked.

150
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,950
Give it to me.

151
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,470
I'll fix it.

152
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,840
How?

153
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,880
They may investigate it.

154
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
You've to cover your tracks.

155
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,560
There's a pen repair shop in Wenmiao Street.

156
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,260
Remember,

157
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,450
you replaced it two days ago.

158
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,850
It cost 3.6 yuan.

159
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,360
So you suspect me?

160
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,080
Why?

161
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,100
Shouldn't we?

162
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,140
Kai.

163
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,790
What a grand welcome for a first visit.

164
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,800
How did you know it's me?

165
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,320
Look at your shaky hands. Practice more.

166
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,630
I never have guests.

167
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,390
It's my first time.

168
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,160
I thought I could scare you.

169
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,120
Let me see your gun.

170
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,470
Walther PPK?

171
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,350
Nice one.

172
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,070
I can take you

173
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,070
to the suburbs to hunt rabbits.

174
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,430
The gun's bullets are hard to find.

175
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,470
Only four left.

176
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,270
Forget it.

177
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,860
I gave him the gun.

178
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,750
Our job makes many enemies.

179
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,800
He's always home alone.

180
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,630
It's good to be careful.

181
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,120
I bought some food,

182
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,230
so I'm back late.

183
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,570
I came early.

184
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,950
Come on.

185
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,820
You can even cook?

186
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,210
Unlike you,

187
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,270
I have

188
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,870
a mouth to feed.

189
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,560
I've to make it work.

190
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,370
Be honest.

191
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,390
Did I scare you just now?

192
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,140
No.

193
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,820
It's a formality.

194
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,000
I know the rules.

195
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,270
If it's a formality,

196
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
you wouldn't be having dinner here.

197
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,720
Thank you.

198
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,010
I thought you don't drink.

199
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,210
I don't drink outside.

200
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,470
Aren't we at your home?

201
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,030
You're forward.

202
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,180
Good wine.

203
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,910
Pan Yue said I'm scary.

204
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,080
Are you afraid of me?

205
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,350
I'm just a pawn in your hands,

206
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,550
under your control.

207
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,010
What's there to fear?

208
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,040
You're not a pawn.

209
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,230
You should be a knife.

210
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,670
Wait.

211
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,720
Isn’t that Xiaojiang?

212
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I can’t be a knife.

213
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,410
You're acting

214
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,030
like I wronged you.

215
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,090
No.

216
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,910
What did I do?

217
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,920
No, no, no.

218
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,550
No. I'm sorry.

219
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,210
I should've invited you home for dinner sooner.

220
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,470
A meal's

221
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,990
no big deal.

222
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,150
You must've thought you would

223
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,420
work less and earn more

224
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,030
as a special agent.

225
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,260
But in fact,

226
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,710
it's daily bloodshed.

227
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,670
You were even nearly wronged.

228
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,349
If I were you, I'd think...

229
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
it's not worth it.

230
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,010
How will you deal with Tian Xiaojiang?

231
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,330
In the Secret Service,

232
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,350
don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

233
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,840
Don't see what you shouldn't see.

234
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,470
-Yes.
-Don't say what you shouldn't say.

235
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,660
Yes.

236
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,830
Don't just stand there.

237
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,510
Mix the noodles.

238
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,330
Look at me.

239
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,560
Pour some wine, Kai.

240
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,330
We risk our lives everyday

241
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,190
just to have a meal on the table.

242
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,830
Zhuowen, wait a bit longer.

243
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,150
After I find your brother,

244
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,410
you'll be with family.

245
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:30,660
Come on.

246
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,340
Come on.

247
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,280
Thank you, Ms. Guan.

248
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,270
I'll dig in then.

249
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,740
Here, Kai.

250
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,930
It's for me.

251
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,800
Eat up.

252
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,450
Zhuowen, eat up.

253
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,160
Her calls take forever.

254
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,470
Hello?

255
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,540
Ms. Guan.

256
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,740
You asked us to tail Mr. Fan.

257
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,150
But he's a big shot

258
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,470
with guards everywhere.

259
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,600
It's impenetrable.

260
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,070
Mr. Fan's wife runs the casino

261
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,970
in Far Eastern Department Store.

262
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,010
Go there when you're free.

263
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,810
Here.

264
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,710
-Thank you.
-Do I have to teach you everything?

265
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,750
Dating anyone?

266
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,230
Who'd like me?

267
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,080
The girl with the pockmarked face at the counter.

268
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,810
Your sister won't let you date?

269
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,150
No.

270
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,030
Talk to her.

271
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,550
Girls get scared when they know

272
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,960
she's my sister.

273
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,610
Is she that scary?

274
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,190
Don't you work at the Secret Service?

275
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,480
You'll find out.

276
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,430
Badmouthing me?

277
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,210
Kai asked me about work.

278
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,910
Zhuowen.

279
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,160
Don't be a cop.

280
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,840
It's too dangerous.

281
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,470
Everyone's seeking peace

282
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,670
in this chaotic times,

283
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,490
so it's a lucrative job.

284
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,670
You're being used by the Japanese

285
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,140
and scolded by your people.

286
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,140
It's not worth it.

287
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,470
You can't live for money.

288
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,600
What are you trying to say?

289
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,240
You students

290
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,630
are brainwashed by

291
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,510
Chongqing

292
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,190
and Yan'an broadcasts.

293
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,220
Be it the Qing dynasty

294
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,480
or the Republic of China,

295
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,540
it's normal to change with the times.

296
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,830
Sister, it's different.

297
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,660
How?

298
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,980
Why don't you revolt against Qing to restore Ming dynasty?

299
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,760
Childish.

300
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,460
Here, Kai.

301
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,770
I've had enough.

302
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,290
I'm done.

303
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,690
Childish!

304
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,360
Don't be angry. Let's eat.

305
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,180
Here.

306
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,880
What are schools

307
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,590
teaching students nowadays?

308
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,830
Take it easy.

309
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,590
I always thought humans are fickle

310
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,470
but eating habits don't change.

311
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,600
I guess not.

312
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,980
Haven't I been eating?

313
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,130
Eat as much as you want.

314
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,580
A Japanese friend went back to Japan,

315
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,910
so he entrusted me with his house.

316
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,310
Someone has to live in it.

317
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,290
So I need a favor.

318
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:44,720
No.

319
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,920
Ms. Guan, I really can't.

320
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,320
You can rent this house out.

321
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,790
Didn't you say

322
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,390
you're under my control?

323
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Ms. Guan.

324
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,160
Mr. Song.

325
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,490
Aunt Chang's

326
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,510
been with me for almost four years.

327
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,440
She'll take care of your household affairs.

328
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,060
Her fried pork's really authentic.

329
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,420
I want to help.

330
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,940
But if I live here,

331
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,830
I'd be a freeloader.

332
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,650
I won't force you.

333
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,260
But don't reject me just yet.

334
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,850
Just open it.

335
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,700
Let's talk business.

336
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,300
Yes.

337
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,630
Forget about the hospital.

338
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,620
We must've lost the lead.

339
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,770
Go interrogate Shi with Ding Peng.

340
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,280
Will it work?

341
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,110
It's up to you.

342
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,370
If it doesn't work,

343
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,200
deal with him.

344
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,940
How?

345
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,300
Two options.

346
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,840
One is to shoot him to death.

347
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,220
Do we do it?

348
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,400
It's a rite of passage

349
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,910
for new special agents.

350
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,930
What's the second option?

351
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,550
The Japanese will handle it.

352
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,610
It's none of our business

353
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,030
how they do it.

354
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,620
Nice?

355
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
Aunt Chang!

356
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,720
Help me pack these.

357
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,950
I'm taking them away.

358
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,310
Hu Bin is

359
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,510
someone who needs to be

360
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,720
humbled.

361
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,670
Don't hold back because of me.

362
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,240
Teach him a lesson

363
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,860
and you'll have an easy time here.

364
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,220
Having blood on your hands gives you a hostile aura

365
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,410
that toughens you up.

366
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,950
Got it.

367
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,850
I have good news for you.

368
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,530
Your wife's given birth.

369
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,290
I know.

370
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,600
How did you know?

371
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,910
I heard the baby crying.

372
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,510
Just now too.

373
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,180
Now it's probably asleep after drinking milk.

374
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,880
Enough small talk.

375
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,690
I can even hear its breathing clearly.

376
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,670
Familial ties

377
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,270
are the hardest to sever.

378
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,040
Siblings,

379
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,690
father and child,

380
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,220
husband and wife.

381
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,510
Did it cross your mind

382
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,200
that if you're gone,

383
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,720
they'll lose their last hope?

384
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,110
Your baby's born

385
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,000
into a life of suffering.

386
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,870
Whose words are those?
