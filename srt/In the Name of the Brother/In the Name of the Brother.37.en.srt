4
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,760
Have you been to Chongqing?

5
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,870
No.

6
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,460
But I heard it's mountainous

7
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,720
and very hot in summer.

8
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,390
It's not for Manchus.

9
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,110
But Chongqing hot pot

10
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,590
is addictive.

11
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,410
Do you think Jiang will stay in Chongqing

12
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,660
and not go back to Nanjing

13
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,470
if the Japanese lose?

14
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,550
Nanjing, Yan'an, Chongqing;

15
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,200
they're all too far now.

16
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,040
Hiking and sweating's better than

17
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,900
living in a cave eating potatoes.

18
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,740
Got it?

19
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,790
Yes.

20
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,590
If you need me to explore the way,

21
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,390
just tell me.

22
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,590
Two options.

23
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,960
Which one should I explore?

24
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,480
I don't think you want to take either.

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,200
This way.

26
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,590
Do you know why I brought you here

27
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,520
to feed pigeons?

28
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,250
You have an informant.

29
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,070
You deliver intel with pigeons.

30
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,270
His code name is Squirrel, yeah?

31
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,400
Honestly,

32
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,480
it's quite old-school.

33
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,340
Go to Hsinking with me.

34
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,040
Then to Japan.

36
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,190
That's confusing me.

37
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,680
How could it be me?

38
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,870
Are you really gonna go all the way?

39
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,610
Do you remember me?

40
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,950

At worst, you're here to kill me.

44
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,510
I don't need to know who you are.

45
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,510
I shouldn't have disturbed you

46
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,740
at this time.

47
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,390

Yes.

53
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,610
I gave him a lot of pocket money on the day he went missing.

54
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,560
I think he went on a date.

55

58
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,490
So many people told me this.

59
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,010
So what if I believe it

60
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,270
or not?

61
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,630

Where is she?

64
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,730
You need to ask the Police's Secret Service

65
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,060
or the Military Police.

66
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,440
Answer my question first.

68
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,910
Go ask him.

69
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,150
He was in the Water Department.

70

77
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,970
the chicken and egg question

78
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,320
is stupid.

79
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,510
Listen carefully. The ceramic I develop

80
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,480
will be the germ bombs' carrier.

81
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:43,830
It requires much experimenting.

82
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,470
Of course, we also need healthy Marutas.

83
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:59,670
But you can't guarantee the Maruta supply.

84
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,780
What are you doing?

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,830
and stopping me from doing experiments.

88
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,990
It means you're worse than a fool.

89
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,490
I don't understand

90
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,910
why General Ishii put you in charge

91
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,790

92
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,450
I'll be frank.

Dr. Kojima.

94
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,640
I'm sure you know the war's situation better than I do.

95
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,920
To be honest,

96
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,210
my human, material and financial resources

97
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,600
have been greatly reduced.

98
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,700
That's why...

99
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,630

100

all your experiments

101
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,910
will be in vain.

102
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,500
If this is why you are

103
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,000
halting the research and production of ceramic bombs,

104
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,280

I'm only interested in my experiments.

113

All I care about are my experiments,

114

experiment materials,

115
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,390
the quantity of Marutas,

116
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,010
rats, and fleas.

117
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,480
It takes time to reproduce bugs.

118

No one can be forgiven

119
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,920
for stealing my time!

120
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,340
Don't you want Ishii to take you back to Japan?

121
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,370
Then shut up

122
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,530
and do your job!

123

I'll tell you what he does.

are gathering two days later.

159
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,660
It'll be a mess

161
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,440
Mr. Asano's assigned us

165
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,240

from Harbin to Hsinking in three days.

169
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,820
That's why I say the Japanese are absurd.

170
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,050
It's their escape plan.

171
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,830
Can't you see?

172
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,710
They're acting like things

I can't think straight.

177
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,630
I think we should change our plan.

178

182

Got it.

183
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,220
It's also part of Operations' job.

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,460
Don't squeeze.

194
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,880
Hunch down.

195
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,320
Here.

196
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,500
Should I drink this or not?

197
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,910
Are you also a communist?

198
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,830
Think bigger.

199
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,400
Kuomintang?

200
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,870
Within two years,

201
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,570
I'll be the director of Fengtian Police Bureau.

202
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,920
Pan.

203
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,670
Good for you.

204
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,280
You're such an ingrate.

205
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,740
If you're the director,

206
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,200
what about me and Ms. Guan?

207
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,010
Director of Kuomintang's Shenyang Police Bureau,

208
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,360
Pan Yue.

209
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,050
Ms. Guan might not even

210
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,710
keep her life.

211
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,230
When the Japanese run away

212
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,590
and Kuomintang returns,

213
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,120
she'll only suffer.

214
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,450
And you.

215
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,120
You have...

216
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,200
taken many lives,

217
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,980
so Kuomintang's Secret Service will let you go.

218
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,320
Of course, I'll speak up for you then.

219
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,090
But you have to have the ability.

220
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,950
I'm afraid

221
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,780
my words aren't enough.

222
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,730
That's too far.

223
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,360
I always rely on my ability.

224
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,270
No matter how many chefs change,

225
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,230
they still have to light the fire.

226
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,740
Then I'll help you boost your resume.

227
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,500
For the alumni reunion at Sakura Hall,

228
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,950
Song Zhuowen would make a move.

229
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,440
If you find anything strange at the scene,

230
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,870
don't take action.

231
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,100
Push him out first.

232
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,590
Mr. Asano stationed me there

233
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,660
with my men.

234
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,620
Ding Peng will be waiting outside.

235
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,020
It's a deal then.

236
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,650
If we really catch him,

237
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,410
his intel will be yours

238
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,090
and he'll be mine.

239
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,970
Don't interfere with how I deal with him.

240
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,460
Skin him alive for all I care.

241
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,450
But leave him

242
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,080
his last breath.

243
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,120
[Harbin Police Agency]

244
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,510
Mr. Jin.

245
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,010
[Chang Yuming, Female, Communication Unit Chief]

246
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
Why didn't you give Aunt Chang more?

247
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,670
There's so much left.

248
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,530
Aren't you afraid she'll flee with the money?

249
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,790
No one can stand the test

250
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,170
of money.

251
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,410
Is the gunman reliable?

252
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,820
Do you remember Yu Hong?

253
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,060
He has been in prison.

254
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,070
A few years ago,

255
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,950
he fought the Japanese with Xie Wendong.

256
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,920
After they disbanded,

257
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,470
you recruited him.

258
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,470
Two years ago,

259
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,350
he drunkenly killed a Japanese.

260
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,780
You asked someone to protect him

261
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,180
from the death sentence.

262
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,460
His position

263
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,130
in the Intelligence Unit still exists

264
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,910
and he still receives salary.

265
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,510
Isn't Pan Yue

266
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,990
taking care of his family?

267
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,830
What if they run into each other?

268
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,570
Don't think too much now.

269
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,480
There are 12 individual photos

270
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,910
of the special agents.

271
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,370
Ten of them and other special staff

272
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,850
are for the Japanese.

273
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,470
That one's for Yu Hong.

274
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,670
The rest are the group photos you want.

275
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,360
Where's the gun I asked for?

276
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,640
Belgian Browning.

277
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,390
Just like Pan Yue's.

278
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,140
Close the door.

279
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,610
Why are you acting like a thief?

280
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,220
Ms. Guan

281
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,670
has an uncle in Harbin.

282
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,670
Do you know about this?

283
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,510
When I was checking backgrounds in Japan,

284
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,950
Guan Xue's mentioned it.

285
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,660
Didn't he die later?

286
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,980
No.

287
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,270
No?

288
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,110
Isn't it better if he's dead?

289
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,730
This is...

290
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,960
This is Ms. Guan's uncle.

291
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,660
I heard they're close.

292
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,330
After his accident,

293
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,550
Ms. Guan's been paying

294
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,630
for all medical expenses

295
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,750
and visits him often.

296
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,530
You know

297
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,310
how cautious Ms. Guan is.

298
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,560
Besides going to the office,

299
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,590
going home,

300
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,140
and working outside,

301
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,140
she seldom goes out.

302
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,990
But she often goes to this nursing home.

303
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,600
He's an expert.

304
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,900
What?

305
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,490
I said the shooter's an expert.

306
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,600
Seven shots in total.

307
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,310
All hit the target.

308
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,070
But he avoided

309
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,860
the vital areas, the brain and the heart.

310
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,220
He wanted to make him suffer.

311
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,340
Must be a huge grudge.

312
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,020
Sober up.

313
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,000
The shooter's

314
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,030
your beloved Guan Xue.

315
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,800
Jin helped her suppress this.

316
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,750
One more tidbit.

317
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,990
The nursing home said

318
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,340
last month, an expert

319
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,870
who returned from Japan told Ms. Guan

320
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,580
that a surgery

321
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,020
could help her uncle stand again,

322
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,620
but she rejected it at once.

323
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I got it.

324
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,990
Guan Xue

325
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,850
must've been assaulted by her uncle.

326
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,410
Mr. Hu.

327
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,110
I'm not telling you this

328
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,160
as gossip

329
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,480
because I'm free.

330
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,700
If a woman

331
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,750
has such a big burden in her heart,

332
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,990
how can there be a place for you?

333
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,930
Search every guest

334
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,990
for weapons tomorrow,

335
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,530
including the Japanese.

336
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,340
Yes.

337
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,330
Search.

338
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,320
Cheers!

339
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,800
Kojima!

340
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,900
Long time no see.

341
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,240
I missed you.

342
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,340
Teng.

343
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,630
Mr. Hu.

344
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,730
Did you check the cabinet?

345
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,810
No.

346
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,370
Check it.

347
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:02,880
Yes.

348
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,510
If all goes according to my schedule

349
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,470
and my route,

350
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,870
I can successfully

351
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,340
get Dr. Kojima out

352
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,160
and pass him to Zhuowu at the back door.

353
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,900
It's going too well.

354
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,030
It's unbelievable.

355
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,650
Out of the many kidnapping plans for Kojima,

356
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,460
this is the most reasonable one

357
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,570
with the highest success rate.

358
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,340
From the agents

359
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,190
being arrested in Hulan

360
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,320
to Director Long

361
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,380
suddenly saying Kojima will show up,

362
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,470
isn't it all too smooth?

363
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,310
It's as if the alumni

364
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,570
are your underlings,

365
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,320
following your schedule

366
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,050
and escape route.

367
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,790
Kojima will finally

368
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,670
appear at the spot you confirmed

369
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,360
and surrender?

370
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,260
You're right.

371
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,890
But I'll set the time

372
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,940
of the explosion in advance.

373
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,120
At the exact time.

374
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,550
During an explosion,

375
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,260
everyone only thinks of escape.

376
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,730
Kojima's no exception.

377
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,510
I'm just worried

378
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,590
someone will see me placing the bomb.

379
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,660
Hu Bin's eyes

380
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,600
are sharper than eagles.

381
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,100
Director Long's suddenly holding an alumni reunion.

382
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,460
Won't Guan Xue question it?

383
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,230
Qian.

384
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,130
I've thought about all that.

385
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,070
But at this critical moment,

386
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,730
we'll have to take a bet.

387
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,200
So what if we're exposed?

388
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,220
I beg you.

389
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,710
The Japanese will be defeated.

390
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,550
I'd hate for

391
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,810
a comrade to be killed!

392
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,970
Qian.

393
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,870
If so,

394
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,200
it'll be my turn.

395
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,670
You've switched them?

396
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,300
I asked everyone

397
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,040
to hand in their guns for an operation today.

398
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,780
Pan Yue agreed without a thought.

399
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,020
I'm drinking with him tonight.

400
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,280
Why?

401
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,909
Something might happen at Sakura Hall.

402
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,770
He wants to get drunk

403
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,280
and ignore it.

404
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,310
Got it.

405
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,230
Has Yu Hong arrived?

406
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:41,830
Yes.

407
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,830
Right across Sakura Hall.

408
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,750
Okay.

409
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,700
[Sakura Hall]

410
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,700
For the alumni reunion at Sakura Hall,

411
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,950
Song Zhuowen would make a move.

412
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,480
If we really catch him,

413
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,560
his intel will be yours

414
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,190
and he'll be mine.

415
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,390
Skin him alive for all I care.

416
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,550
Dr. Kojima.

417
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,560
You really came.

418
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,470
I'm not here for the reunion.

419
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,460
Do you know

420
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,740
the University of Tokyo

421
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,230
has nothing to do with me?

422
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,670
We even made a bet

423
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,090
if you'd show up for my sake.

424
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,700
You can't watch me lose money.

425
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,280
Long.

426
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,320
This is Dr. Kojima.

427
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,510
Welcome.

428
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,930
I happened to see your name on the list.

429
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,740
I heard you were in Harbin.

430
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,240
So I called you here

431
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,080
to get together.

432
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,780
Welcome.

433
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,450
Welcome.

434
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,350
I really came here for you.

435
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,160
I heard

436
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,210
you're promoted to Minister of Transport.

437
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,140
Congratulations.

438
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,560
No.

439
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,290
It's a hard job.

440
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,670
Don't complain.

441
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,480
I came here today

442
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,150
to ask for a favor.

443
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,710
Is it also about transport?

444
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,460
No.

445
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,200
Why'd I come to the Minister of Transport?

446
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,410
As you can see,

447
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,870
we just launched the Tonghua Defense Plan,

448
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,910
where everyone

449
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,580
will move to Tonghua.

450
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,260
The Russians are really coming.

451
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,050
My friend in China said

452
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,270
the war is getting worse.

453
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,390
I'm afraid Okinawa can't be defended either.

454
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,090
Before the last moment,

455
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,470
every soldier of the empire will not give up.

456
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,990
During the General Staff meeting,

457
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,930
everyone was very depressed.

458
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,190
Only...

459
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,510
General Ishii

460
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,200
was full of fighting spirit and confidence.

461
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,310
His attitude

462
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,790
must be related to your research.

463
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,100
Of course.

464
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,700
Thank you, Peng.

465
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,410
Peng.

466
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,610
Keep watch.

467
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,390
Don't worry.

468
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,220
Come on, let's drink.
