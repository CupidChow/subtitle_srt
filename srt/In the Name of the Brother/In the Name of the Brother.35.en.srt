[In the Name of the Brother]

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,900
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,920
Be quiet.

5
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,210
Everyone, your attention, please.

6
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,140
Director Yan has something to say.

7
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,740
Alright!

8
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,539
Good work, everyone.

9
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,470
The operation to destroy the Communist Party's underground contact points

10
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,670
has been successful.

11
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,640
You all deserve the credit.

12
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,950
Thank you, Director.

13
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,710
Raise your cups.

14
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,590
Toast to the Director.

15
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,870
Cheers.

16
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,950
To the Director!

17
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,620
To the Director!

18
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,210
Don't space out. Keep working.

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,490
Don't you know?

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,000
Russians have already crossed the Oder River.

21
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,050
Oder River?

22
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,100
What kind of river is that?

23
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,790
Is your radio a decoration?

24
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,680
Is it right next to Harbin?

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,560
The Oder River is as far away from Berlin

26
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,910
as the Songhua River is from Harbin.

27
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,600
Dumplings are here.

28
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:17,900
Here.

29
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,829
Here.

30
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,810
Cheers.

31
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,070
Come on, cheers.

32
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,230
One, two, cheers.

33
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,870
Here, Ding Peng.

34
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,590
Add more.

35
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,920
It's okay. Give it to me.

36
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,590
Go peel some garlic for Mr. Song.

37
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,090
Dumplings need garlic to be nutritious.

38
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,810
There's no more wine. Pour some wine.

39
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,540
No more wine.

40
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,350
Everyone is saying that this is the Secret Service's

41
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,270
first time

42
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,030
eating dumplings on a non-festive day.

43
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,670
That's why Section Chief Ban is in charge of administration.

44
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,000
Look at the difference.

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,100
The director said this was a celebration meal.

46
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,440
You must be upset.

47
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,430
You went and picked out an outfit with your girlfriend.

48
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,940
You went through all that trouble.

49
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,760
Who would have thought that...

50
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,010
you would make such a big loss?

51
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,110
It's not a clean victory.

52
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,710
No one got an easy win.

53
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,790
Pan Yue is very active.

54
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,260
He must have recovered.

55
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,330
I don't think he was ever sick.

56
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,710
No way.

57
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,880
Let him get sick first.

58
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,600
The dumplings are good.

59
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,630
If the Germans are done for,

60
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,550
they'll turn around and beat the Japanese.

61
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,240
It's not that easy.

62
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,710
They only have the Siberian railway.

63
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,920
Do you think they can transport

64
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
everything over?

65
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,480
There was no railway in the Gengzi year either.

66
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,590
It didn't stop the Russians from

67
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,110
invading us back then.

68
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,159
Zhuowen, it's a pity that someone like you

69
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,710
is working for the Communist Party.

70
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,340
Why don't we work together?

71
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,070
Who's working for the Communist Party?

72
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,670
Work together against whom?

73
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,670
Section Chief Guan, or the Japanese?

74
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,310
No, that's your job.

75
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,600
My target is the Russians.

76
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,860
Russians have broken through the Oder River.

77
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,830
The Staff HQ estimated that

78
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,310
the Germans can't last past May.

79
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,790
The war in Europe will be over

80
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,310
by the middle of next month at the latest.

81
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,430
If the war in Europe

82
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,350
ends before May 15,

83
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,070
we must implement Manchukuo's defenses urgently.

84
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,990
Chief of Staff,

85
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,050
please approve the plan to increase

86
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,040
ceramic bomb production mentioned in the last meeting.

87
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,159
If we double the funds you need,

88
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,350
how long will it take to make

89
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,310
enough ceramic bombs?

90
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,310
Yes.

91
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,000
The end of July at the latest.

92
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,630
The end of July at the latest?

93
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,470
The Russians will be able to

94
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:55,070
send a million more troops from Western Europe to the Far East.

95
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,100
But sir, our ceramic bombs

96
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,990
can wipe out one million people

97
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,790
within a short time.

98
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,620
Sir,

99
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,590
we just intercepted a telegram.

100
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,350
The Soviet Army has informed

101
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,030
Harbin's communist underground organization

102
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,070
to do whatever it takes

103
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,930
to destroy Ishii's team's weapon production plan.

104
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,970
Start the meeting.

105
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,330
Chief.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,510
Why did we have to fake the telegram?

107
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,710
If you take half of the time you spend

108
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,750
on those Russian girls

109
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,260
and listen to the enemy's radio instead,

110
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,430
you won't be asking such a stupid question.

111
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,440
I've never visited those places again.

112
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,990
Have you heard of Guadalcanal?

113
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,350
Yes.

114
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,360
The one where half of Division Two starved to death.

115
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,300
Manchukuo will be

116
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,350
the second Guadalcanal soon.

117
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,620
General Ishii just said

118
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,870
our new weapon

119
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,740
can kill one million of them.

120
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,909
But the Soviet Union currently has

121
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,640
more than 11 million soldiers.

122
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,210
Do you think

123
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,760
General Ishii has no other plans?

124
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,050
He knows his research is valuable

125
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,190
to the Germans, Americans,

126
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,910
and even the Russians.

127
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,460
No matter what the end of this war is,

128
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,740
as long as he still has these research results,

129
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,260
he'll have a way out.

130
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,310
That's why you...

131
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,910
Yes.

132
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,700
Chief of Staff,

133
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,510
please hear me out.

134
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,770
I want someone who is familiar with this place

135
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,410
and trustworthy

136
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,160
to be in charge of the plan's security.

137
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,630
Do you have a candidate?

138
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,370
Yes.

139
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,630
Asano.

140
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,720
Asano!

141
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,580
Officer Ishii.

142
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,910
Sir!

143
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
We'll be counting on you.

144
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:18,960
Yes.

145
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,300
What your enemy fears

146
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,550
is the most valuable part of your army.

147
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,060
Our fake telegram was

148
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,240
to prove this point.

149
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,180
But we still have to stay in Manchukuo.

150
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,820
The Americans have invaded the Philippines.

151
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,580
The whole empire is preparing

152
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,150
for the final battle in our homeland.

153
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,940
At this time, the Army Headquarters

154
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,920
will keep a useful tool like Unit 731

155
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,040
in Manchukuo.

156
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,410
We just need to let

157
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,050
General Ishii know that

158
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,770
we're important.

159
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,390
So important that he needs

160
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,030
to bring us back to Japan.

161
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,220
Understood.

162
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,180
Japanese anti-aircraft cannons.

163
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,860
The Americans left all their bombs in Harbin.

164
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,400
We can imagine the situation in Hsinking.

165
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,410
The Imperial Household Agency and the Japanese talked for half a month

166
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,910
and got a few cannons.

167
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,190
Mr. Jin.

168
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,240
Have we really come to this?

169
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,620
No one knows

170
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,670
for sure.

171
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,040
It will be too late once we do know.

172
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,490
If the day really arrives,

173
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,750
what will happen to His Majesty?

174
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,690
If His Majesty is safe,

175
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,710
the country of our ancestors is safe.

176
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,450
If His Majesty is gone,

177
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,880
there will be nothing left.

178
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,250
What about us?

179
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,270
Must we go to Japan?

180
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,630
I know.

181
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,350
You transferred Aunt Chang there first

182
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,900
to start all over again.

183
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,430
Aunt Chang just took the money.

184
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,430
The most important thing now

185
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,240
is people.

186
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,870
You've been in the Secret Service for so many years.

187
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,800
You must have been through a lot.

188
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,620
Some died,

189
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,320
while some lived.

190
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,460
If you have to leave alone,

191
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,130
won't you regret it?

192
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,490
Among the people you have,

193
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,270
who is trustworthy

194
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,390
and who is not?

195
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,900
Who should stay,

196
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,710
who should leave,

197
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,170
and who should be eliminated?

198
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,080
I'm sure you know the answers.

199
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,240
Hello?

200
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,670
This is Jin Qingyuan.

201
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,410
Yes.

202
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,160
Mr. Asano wants to speak to you.

203
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,320
Mr. Asano.

204
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,220
I'm Guan Xue.

205
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,420
Yes.

206
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,320
I'll be right there.

207
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,830
A few operative vehicles

208
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,310
belonging to the Operations Unit need their tires changed.

209
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,650
The back engine in one of the cars has a broken gear.

210
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,910
It needs changing too.

211
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,150
The gas and oil in the tanks are dry too.

212
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,630
But every dollar needs

213
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,730
your signature

214
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,390
before it can be spent.

215
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,030
This...

216
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,680
Stop looking. You can't understand it anyway. Just sign it.

217
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,310
Yes.

218
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,750
How is it?

219
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,150
You seem pretty

220
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,710
comfortable staying here.

221
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,880
This must be the coolest office

222
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,780
in our Police Agency.

223
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,589
You just accepted it?

224
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,730
You seem content to be here.

225
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,339
Mr. Hu,

226
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,830
have you ever thought about why

227
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,080
Ms. Guan refused to marry you?

228
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,580
Deputy Section Chief Pan,

229
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,800
what you said

230
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,350
won't hurt my heart.

231
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,950
If one day

232
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,050
you become the section chief,

233
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,270
or higher,

234
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,030
the deputy department director...

235
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,760
-Do you think she would still...
-Enough of that.

236
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,250
Pan, you are ambitious.

237
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,950
I'm not. I only care about the people.

238
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,950
This is not ambition.

239
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,080
This is called looking out

240
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,030
for my own survival.

241
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,360
Think about it.

242
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,540
If one day,

243
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,240
the Secret Service,

244
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,520
the Police Agency,

245
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,810
and even the whole country

246
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,940
is gone.

247
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,940
You should think about something else.

248
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,450
We'll see.

249
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,620
I can't think that far.

250
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,710
Then I'll leave first.

251
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,120
Please do something for me.

252
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,910
What do you think?

253
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,560
You reminded me that night

254
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,680
to figure out

255
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,190
who to keep,

256
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,940
who to bring along,

257
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,880
and who to discard.

258
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,720
Let's start with Pan Yue.

259
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,140
What about Song Zhuowen?

260
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,170
Have you made up your mind?

261
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,170
The current situation is changing day by day.

262
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,390
You should think it over.

263
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,240
Let's delay the urgent matters.

264
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,870
Mr. Hu,

265
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,340
the Hulan County Police Station has been connected for you.

266
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,310
Feng? I'm Hu Bin.

267
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,610
I need your help.

268
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,240
Get me a few watchers.

269
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,530
That goes without saying.

270
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,340
They're no use to me if they've never been to Harbin.

271
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,340
They will be paid.

272
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,650
I'll double their attendance allowance.

273
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,970
After that, each of them will get a bonus.

274
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,060
[Harbin Street]

275
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,580
He's going out.

276
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
Let's follow him.

277
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,010
What are you doing?

278
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:53,960
Who is it?

279
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,280
Drive slowly.

280
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,470
Let him get a good look at the license plate.

281
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,930
Who is it?

282
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,750
Hello.

283
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,780
Pan Yue.

284
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,050
I really want to slap myself now.

285
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,430
You asked me to find someone for you.

286
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,030
Now he's caught by the Japanese Secret Police.

287
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,560
What do you want?

288
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,290
Who are you?

289
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,110
Harbin Japanese Secret Police.

290
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,910
It's a misunderstanding.

291
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,560
We're from the Hulan County Police Station.

292
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,900
We're here for a mission in Harbin.

293
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,500
It's work.

294
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,230
My ID is in my pocket.

295
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,910
Take them all back.

296
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,190
Let's go.

297
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,250
What are you doing?

298
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,100
Sir, let go!

299
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,300
Call them and ask them.

300
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,820
Let go of me!

301
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,680
If the mission fails,

302
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,700
Mr. Hu won't let you off, you bastards!

303
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,600
Get going.

304
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,800
Let go of me!

305
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,030
Let go of me!

306
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,130
Let go!

307
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,590
Hello.

308
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,870
All the special agents are cleared.

309
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,860
Take Qian away.

310
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,800
Yes, got it.

311
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,110
They were arrested.

312
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,360
Even if the Japanese Secret Police

313
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,300
already knows

314
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,230
they are the Hulan police,

315
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,340
it's not like they will

316
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,720
report it to Ms. Guan.

317
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,480
Even if

318
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,060
they get us involved,

319
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,480
it's obviously a set-up.

320
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,150
What are you worried about?

321
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,590
I just don't get it.

322
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,070
You asked me to keep an eye on Song Zhunwen. Why?

323
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,200
You still suspect that he's part of the Communist Party?

324
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,910
Hu,

325
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,620
how many Song Zhuowen do you think there are?

326
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,510
What?

327
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,110
Is one not enough?

328
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,050
How many more do you want?

329
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,090
What if I tell you

330
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,620
there are two?

331
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,330
Two? Twins?

332
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,700
Both of them are from the Communist Party.

333
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,600
One deals with us in the open,

334
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,940
and the other is undercover

335
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,870
doing the dirty work.

336
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,500
You haven't recovered, have you?

337
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,830
Go back to the hospital for a few more days.

338
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,000
Their cooperation was not flawless.

339
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,430
Once, while helping the communists leave the city,

340
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,230
they were exposed by Cui Anping at the checkpoint.

341
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,590
Does your man usually talk in his sleep?

342
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,150
Yes. He was always exclaiming mid-sleep.

343
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,870
I heard him here and there between sleep.

344
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,730
What did he say?

345
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,260
Twins.

346
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,230
They must be twins.

347
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,670
And that time, when things went wrong with Squirrel.

348
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,640
He took out his gun. What should I do?

349
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,500
You have to save me.

350
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,470
-Don’t move.
-Help me!

351
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,630
Don't move. He might be passing by.

352
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,170
What does he look like?

353
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,290
He looks like Pu Ke.

354
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,870
Zhuowen, you're so handsome.

355
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,960
You look like a movie star.

356
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,000
You're right.

357
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,830
Movie star, Pu Ke.

358
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,020
I'm just a street worker.

359
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,260
Quit making fun of me.

360
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,970
Even if

361
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,390
you're right,

362
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,550
where's the evidence? There's no evidence.

363
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,750
Both of them are dead.

364
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,250
One person must be able to tell.

365
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,470
Who is it?

366
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,590
Section Chief Guan.

367
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,020
They all said you're part of the Communist Party. Are you?

368
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,820
Who said that?

369
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,070
I'm not.

370
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,160
I'm afraid of death.

371
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,250
You lost your ID a long time ago.

372
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,850
How could you have not known?

373
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,140
Lieutenant Harada.

374
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,170
I'm Pan Yue.

375
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,810
I want to see Mr. Asano.

376
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,520
As soon as possible.

377
00:29:59,390 --> 00:29:59,830
Okay.

378
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,190
I'll wait for your call.

379
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,700
How is it? Can you handle it?

380
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,850
Sure.

381
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,790
No problem.

382
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,330
The organization asked us to check on 731

383
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,410
for the newest model of ceramic bombs.

384
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,170
What can the Japanese do?

385
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,200
What do they want to do,

386
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,350
and what they are doing.

387
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,880
We need to check all of them.

388
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,120
The more detailed, the better.

389
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,800
What does this main plan report mean?

390
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,720
The main plan report...

391
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,150
Livonia.

392
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,130
Coming.

393
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,710
-Livonia.
-Qian.

394
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,650
Hello.

395
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,630
It's been a while.

396
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,430
How are you?

397
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,820
Next time,

398
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,180
you should've told me to come earlier.

399
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,940
Yes.

400
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,990
I'm going to get rid of all the rotten structures.

401
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,120
Okay.

402
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,510
The wound has been infected for a long time.

403
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,710
Why didn't you call me earlier?

404
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,240
Why would I ask you here for a normal wound?

405
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,970
But you don't pay me extra for this.

406
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,070
Don't worry.

407
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,260
Alright, stop talking.

408
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Hurry up.

409
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,000
Come on.

410
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,940
Give me a moment.

411
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,040
You've been spoiled in China.

412
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,480
The main report is a fund-requesting report.

413
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,420
The report states what the funds are for.

414
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,880
I heard it'll be sent to Hsinking in two days.

415
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,070
American jets are

416
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,830
dropping bombs now and then.

417
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,250
I don't think they dare to take the plane.

418
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,840
If it's just the funding report,

419
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,900
the messenger's level won't be high.

420
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,960
He won't be able to take the special train cabin.

421
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,590
It hurts.

422
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,390
It hurts.

423
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,780
It hurts!

424
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,140
It hurts.

425
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,870
It hurts.

426
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,510
Thank you.

427
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,070
I understand.

428
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:25,719
I understand.

429
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,239
Qian.

430
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,000
I thought about it.

431
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,920
If the messenger's level is not high,

432
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,570
we should have a chance to strike on the train.

433
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,449
I'll contact our comrades on the South Manchuria Railway

434
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,449
and let you know as soon as possible.

435
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,470
Why did Asano Daigo look for you alone?

436
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,830
He asked me to find a way

437
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,630
to snoop out the communists in the Secret Service.

438
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,460
Isn't this what you want too?

439
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,950
That's not all we want.

440
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,430
I don't understand you.

441
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,970
You already left.

442
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,650
Why did you come back?

443
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,730
Initially, I left

444
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,990
because the Japanese

445
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,030
was past its prime

446
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,240
and due for defeat.

447
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,980
I didn't see a need to die for that.

448
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,450
But I'm back because things have changed.

449
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,850
Some things need to be done in advance.

450
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,710
The Soviets are coming.

451
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,790
This is already happening.

452
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,970
Are you so afraid of the Communist Party?

453
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,130
This is Manchuria.

454
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,150
Setting aside the fact that

455
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,010
the Soviets are also communists,

456
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,540
and that the two parties

457
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,430
would likely help each other,

458
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,850
apart from us,

459
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,460
Manchuria hasn't had another

460
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,630
Kuomintang's member in power

461
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,540
since the Mukden incident.

462
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,530
But the Communist Party's Counter-Japanese Army

463
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,190
has been holding on in the mountains to this day.

464
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,680
If you're from Manchuria,

465
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,520
would you prefer Yan'an or Chongqing?

466
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,750
Hurry up.

467
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,050
A name list of the underground party members in Harbin

468
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,310
in exchange for Kuomintang's Bureau Director of Shenyang police station.

469
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,630
Isn't this a fair price?

470
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,170
Aren't you afraid that I'll hand you over

471
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,240
to Asano Daigo

472
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,110
for a ticket to Japan?

473
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,680
This is also a way out for me.

474
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,970
You're right.

475
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,290
This is indeed a way out.

476
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,850
But I'm giving you

477
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,250
a way to redemption.

478
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,290
I only have three minutes.

479
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,630
Just give me a summary of

480
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,560
the Japanese messenger's habits.

481
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,120
Japanese messengers

482
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,670
usually take the express train

483
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,280
to Hsinking at 10.05.

484
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,090
We've received such people before.

485
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,580
How do they usually get on the train?

486
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,990
They always use handcuffs

487
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,550
to secure the briefcase to themselves.

488
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,300
They hide in their soft sleeper cabin once onboard

489
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,760
and stay there all the way.

490
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,270
They keep their briefcase close even when toileting.

491
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,530
They also have special guards with them.

492
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,480
How about their meals?

493
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,430
The train attendant would

494
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,890
deliver the meals directly to their cabins.

495
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,430
Who else on the train knows their identity?

496
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,760
Only the Sergeant onboard.

497
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,980
Can you get on that train?

498
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,540
There are many Japanese on the express train.

499
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,930
The crew has been specially trained.

500
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,150
They don't usually deal with us.

501
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,280
That means they don't know you.

502
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,480
Correct.

503
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,780
Okay, I got it.

504
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,050
You can go now.

505
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:42,210
[Harbin Station]

506
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,760
Excuse me. This is a top secret.

507
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,780
The hot water is ready.

508
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,850
Lunch will be delivered...

509
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,950
Close the curtains.
