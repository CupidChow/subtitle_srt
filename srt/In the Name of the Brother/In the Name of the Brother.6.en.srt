[In the Name of the Brother]

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,730
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,550
Drink more.

5
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,830
Unit Chiefs,

6
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,440
let me toast you one last time.

7
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,950
No one can leave tonight.

8
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,500
I got this bad habit from working on the railway.

9
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,830
I get sleepy when it's late.

10
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,660
Everyone at the Secret Service is a night owl.

11
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,920
Change your bad habit.

12
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,590
I'll tie up whoever leaves.

13
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,580
It doesn't count to drink standing. Sit down.

14
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,710
-Drink more, Zhuo Wen.
-Good evening.

15
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,329
Unit Chief Pan and I

16
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,440
won't fight you for the middle girl.

17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,460
You can take her away

18
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,920
when we're done drinking.

19
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,010
Can I take her away?

20
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,560
They are all local chicks.

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,290
You can take her if you want.

22
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,350
Besides, I have money and guns.

23
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,610
How dare she not leave?

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,190
Come.

25
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,090
Drink up.

26
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,810
Come.

27
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,020
Come.

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,930
You pick one.

29
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,590
Again.

30
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,830
You lost.

31
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,280
Come on. Again.

32
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,460
Again!

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,300
Unit Chief Pan.

34
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,860
No, hold on.

35
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,950
Hold on.

36
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,980
What's wrong?

37
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,510
Play a round with her for me.

38
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,140
I can't beat her.

39
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,270
I'm so drunk.

40
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,630
Play with her.

41
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,680
You can beat her.

42
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,450
Play with me.

43
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,180
I play with her.

44
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,790
Play with me.

45
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,620
Change it up.

46
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,140
-Okay, come on.
-Come.

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,700
Let's play Good Brothers.

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,579
Come on.

49
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,490
Come on. One, two, three.

50
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,950
-Two good brothers.
-Three stars shine.

51
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,550
-Six, six, six.
-Four happy fortunes.

52
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,870
-Eight horses.
-Five chiefs.

53
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,740
-Five...
-Seven horses.

54
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,870
Five, five, five...

55
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,790
-You lost again.
-Hurry,

56
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,790
-pour our Unit Chief a drink.
-Here.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Have a drink.

58
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,980
Why should I?

59
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,670
Unit Chief Hu is a good drinker.

60
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,900
Come, let's toast

61
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,360
to Mr. Hu as a couple.

62
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,390
Zhuowen is a fast leaner.

63
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,550
Let me tell you.

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,350
Here, you can be the groom every night.

65
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,460
That's right.

66
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,510
Relax.

67
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,160
-Stop fighting with me all the time.
-Let’s have another drink.

68
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,290
Even if Section Chief Guan isn't mine,

69
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,000
she won't be yours.

70
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,670
Do you know who is behind her?

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,910
Who?

72
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,530
She belongs to all the men.

73
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,370
Then you're definitely not a man.

74
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,470
You got the point immediately.

75
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,060
Section Chief Guan

76
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,070
has more of a say than you about if I'm a man.

77
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,909
Let's drink.

78
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,350
Unit Chief Pan.

79
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,430
Zhuowen, come.

80
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,580
Hu.

81
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,060
Call your boss here.

82
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,320
Forget it.

83
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,610
Don't pull me.

84
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,670
Okay.

85
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,320
Here you go. Here you go.

86
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,920
Song Zhuowen

87
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,420
would rather have things the hard way.

88
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,180
I'll beat him up for sure.

89
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,820
You always

90
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,670
dislike someone forever if you have a bad first impression.

91
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,550
You...

92
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,500
Why do you have to fight with him?

93
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,420
In the past, Section Chief only cared about you and me.

94
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,030
Now,she only cares about him.

95
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,590
We're different.

96
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,420
Don't get me involved, Unit Chief Hu.

97
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,900
Section Chief has high standards. You can't reach her,

98
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,470
but you insist on stretching your arms and standing on your toes.

99
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,150
In the end,

100
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,340
you're tired and she's annoyed.

101
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,780
You should find someone

102
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,470
who sincerely cares for you.

103
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,480
It'll be less effort and more relaxing. It's great.

104
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,790
Humans are stupid.

105
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,600
We all want the fruit at the top of the tree.

106
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,200
We don't care about the ripe ones on the ground.

107
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,590
Tell me.

108
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,060
We've been in the same class since we trained in Tokyo.

109
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,659
What is this called?

110
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,180
It should be called sharing weal and woe together.

111
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,380
Sharing weal and woe.

112
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,710
I actually know

113
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,180
it's just one-sided feelings,

114
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
but I can't get over it.

115
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,060
I can't.

116
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,710
Watch out.

117
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,850
I can't get over it.

118
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,030
Don't you know who he is?

119
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,830
He can tear down my shop

120
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,230
if he wants to.

121
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,090
Don't act like you've been wronged in front of me.

122
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,050
It's no use.

123
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,500
I can only ask you for the money I lost this time.

124
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,560
And you, Xie Yue.

125
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,280
Don’t run away.

126
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,580
You have to pay for it too.

127
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,300
Otherwise,

128
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,110
I'll go to your school with your student ID.

129
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,800
What are you waiting for? Get back to work.

130
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,140
Are you okay?

131
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,480
Does it still hurt?

132
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,060
Are you stalking me?

133
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,940
Why are you everywhere?

134
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,670
Don't work in a place like this anymore.

135
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,810
What's wrong with this place? You think it's dirty?

136
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,220
You're not clean either.

137
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,380
You broke the cup, didn't you?

138
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,220
If you guys have problems,

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
why should we have to pay?

140
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,840
I'll pay for it.

141
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,620
I'll also get your student ID back.

142
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,690
I'll bring you the money some other day.

143
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,610
Why are you helping me?

144
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,800
You helped me first.

145
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,990
You're right.

146
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,740
I broke the cup on purpose.

147
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,669
Let me put it this way.

148
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,980
If you take the money,

149
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,090
you'll keep this a secret forever

150
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,950
and I'll rest assured.

151
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,780
I won't take your money for nothing.

152
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,090
I'll write you an IOU.

153
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,900
I could endure it no matter what if Song Zhuowen didn't come.

154
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,610
Guan Xue is like the thorn on a rose.

155
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,950
She's stabbed into here.

156
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,510
Look.

157
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,370
Stabbed into here.

158
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,990
I can't live even if I pull it out.

159
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,670
Just like this,

160
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,540
Section Chief has you under her control,

161
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,470
I'm telling you.

162
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,950
But actually...

163
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,950
Tell me, actually...

164
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,980
Hurry up.

165
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,630
I feel sorry for you.

166
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,880
Here, wipe yourself.

167
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,360
Make yourself at home.

168
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,140
Section Chief Guan,

169
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,710
your office is so simple.

170
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,680
You're too polite.

171
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,030
May I smoke?

172
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,140
Of course. Suit yourself.

173
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,710
To be honest,

174
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,930
Song Zhuowen is Section Chief's sharpening stone,

175
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,680
used specially to sharpen you.

176
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,190
I hope the blade won't break

177
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,750
instead of getting sharpened.

178
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,180
Then you will

179
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,020
really get humiliated by him.

180
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,660
Please write a receipt.

181
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,920
Of course.

182
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,740
Section Chief Asano Diago told me already.

183
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
You all

184
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,330
are quite professional.

185
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,500
I'll finish the rest.

186
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,790
This is how Section Chief Asano Diago is.

187
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,670
He just removed the bullet

188
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,650
and he's already going to rush out of the hospital tomorrow morning.

189
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,990
We're used to

190
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,990
his way of work.

191
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,520
Thank you for reminding me.

192
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,590
It's getting late.

193
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,070
I'll take my leave.

194
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,920
Try to inform everyone.

195
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,590
No matter where they are

196
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,790
or what they are doing,

197
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,920
they must come to the meeting room now.

198
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,680
Right away.

199
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,710
The Army Hospital,

200
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,190
Post and Telecommunications Building,

201
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,190
and Harbin Hotel.

202
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,260
This path here

203
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,000
is the only path Section Chief Asano

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,260
can take to leave the hospital tomorrow.

205
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,830
If nothing unexpected happens...

206
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,520
Where did he go?

207
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,340
The assassin will

208
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,400
-Listen.
-lay in ambush on this road.

209
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,210
So, the whole road must be under control.

210
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,540
We'd rather catch the wrong person than miss the correct one.

211
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,540
But the assassin came from Hsinking,

212
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,590
so no one knows what he looks like.

213
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,900
I know it's hard,

214
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,310
but we must do it.

215
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,350
We only have

216
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,920
one useful clue now.

217
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,670
The assassin's nickname

218
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,780
is Manchukuo's Robin Hood.

219
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,940
Tomorrow is the first operation

220
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,590
of the Secret Service in front of Section Chief Asano.

221
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,990
I don't need to speak further about the requirements, right?

222
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,150
As for the specific operations plan,

223
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,810
Unit Chief Hu, you arrange it.

224
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,690
If Manchukuo's Robin Hood uses a sniper rifle,

225
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,450
there are two points that must be satisfied.

226
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,960
His location must allow him

227
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,930
to see the gate of the Army Hospital

228
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
and also overlook the whole street.

229
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,690
So, we can conclude

230
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,990
his activity range will be one of these three places,

231
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,860
the Post and Telecommunications Building,

232
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,660
Harbin Hotel,

233
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,070
or Bank of East Asia.

234
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,290
He'll be above the fourth floor of these three buildings.

235
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,490
When Section Chief Asano's procession passes by,

236
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,680
every window of these three buildings

237
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,170
can be an ambush point,

238
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,150
so if there is any movement,

239
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,780
the Operations Unit's sniper must fire first,

240
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,640
even if you kill the wrong person.

241
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,240
Of course, it's also possible

242
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,020
that Manchukuo's Robin Hood will do it at a close range.

243
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,950
As for the ground,

244
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,690
Unit Chief Pan... Unit Chief Pan?

245
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,980
You talk about the matters on the ground.

246
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,790
This street is 600 meters from east to west.

247
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,950
The mission of the Intelligence Unit

248
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,020
is to screen all passersby.

249
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,870
Even if they're a three-year-old child,

250
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,830
as long as they hold an item over one meter long,

251
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,600
they must be strictly checked.

252
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,260
Done?

253
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,250
To keep it a secret,

254
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,710
the gate can only be entered and not exited.

255
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,720
Without my permission,

256
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,890
no one can leave today.

257
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,260
Cut off the switchboard's external line.

258
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,990
Set up double posts at the gate.

259
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,990
Understood?

260
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,870
-Understood.
-Understood.

261
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:06,910
Get to work.

262
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,880
-Yes.
-Yes.

263
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,060
Song Zhuowen.

264
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Pan.

265
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,660
I'm this heavily injured

266
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,200
and she still didn't see it.

267
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,480
It's not obvious enough.

268
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,370
Let me help you make it bigger.

269
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:45,930
[Harbin Police Agency]

270
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,190
Even if you shoot me with a gun,

271
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,880
she won't see it

272
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,140
if she doesn't want to.

273
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,950
It's just the two of us now.

274
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,300
Tell me the truth.

275
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,060
What happened at the hospital that day?

276
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,570
Didn’t I make it clear?

277
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,670
I don’t trust Tian Xiaojiang at all.

278
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,670
Fine.

279
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,940
Let me ask you one more thing.

280
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,150
You saw a lot on the railway.

281
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,790
Have you heard of Manchukuo's Robin Hood?

282
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,820
I think everyone in Manchukuo

283
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,970
knows this name.

284
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,740
Anyone who dares to fight against the Japanese alone

285
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,540
gets called Manchukuo's Robin Hood by the people.

286
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,150
You have

287
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,480
the slick feeling of one from the streets.

288
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,740
Your words have no loopholes,

289
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,380
but if I think about it carefully, there's no substance.

290
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,220
Section Chief Guan,

291
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,440
I won't explain anymore

292
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,710
if you're going to be like this.

293
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,920
What should I call you from now on?

294
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,390
Song Zhuowen,

295
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,780
Wen,

296
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,000
or Mr. Song?

297
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,010
You can call me anything

298
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,520
as long as you're happy.

299
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,830
Okay.

300
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,310
Go back to work.

301
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,950
Will there be a scar on my arm?

302
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,610
With a scar,

303
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,410
I won't be able to wear sleeveless qipaos anymore.

304
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,910
Then wear the ones with sleeves.

305
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:28,990
Besides,

306
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,270
you're a demoness.

307
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,130
You think that someone

308
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,580
will care about your pretty arm in the future?

309
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,240
I don't like what I'm hearing.

310
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,140
Demoness,

311
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,090
do you want green onions?

312
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,710
No.

313
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,870
What has to happen to someone

314
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,390
for their temperament to turn into this?

315
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,950
Song Zhuowen?

316
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,580
You two

317
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,500
only interacted for a few days.

318
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,580
No one knows what he went through

319
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,300
these past few years.

320
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,200
Anyway, no matter how stiff a man makes his neck,

321
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,030
he'll still have to bow his head at some point.

322
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,720
If you keep your head down,

323
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,270
you won't be able to lift it up again.

324
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,360
Look at the newspaper.

325
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,980
Chongqing is celebrating the National Day,

326
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,120
[The China Democratic League issued its political views on the final stage of the resistance]

327
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,120
[Immediately end one-party rule and establish a coalition government]

328
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,930
so they published this article on the newspaper.

329
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,330
The final stage of the battle against the Japanese.

330
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,230
Do they really think Japan is going to be done for?

331
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,590
The Japanese are planning to

332
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,030
leave Manchukuo

333
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,730
and run back home if anything goes wrong.

334
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,910
If something really happens,

335
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,600
we can't count on any of them.

336
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,080
Don't look at me.

337
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,970
I'm old.

338
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,350
You can't count on me.

339
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,580
Okay, I know.

340
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,640
I can only count on myself.

341
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,130
Let's drink some baijiu.

342
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,060
Sure, but not so much.

343
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,460
There's work tomorrow morning.

344
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,260
At ease.

345
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,090
Do you remember the order tonight?

346
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,070
No one is allowed to go out.

347
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,130
We can shoot those who break the rule.

348
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,950
Have you patrolled outside the back wall?

349
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,710
Remember,

350
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,220
no one can leave.

351
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,940
Watch the gate.

352
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,030
I'll take a look.

353
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,120
Amazing.

354
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,720
It's already nighttime.

355
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,370
I arrived in Harbin at 4 p.m.

356
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,240
I waited until now like a silly wife waiting for her man.

357
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
I'm truly sorry.

358
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,720
I won't be late again.

359
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,900
Why do you have so much fire inside of you?

360
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,180
How have you been sleeping?

361
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,540
Do you still sweat at night?

362
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,870
Sometimes.

363
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
The sheets even get soaked through.

364
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,260
I always think

365
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,630
I never fell asleep.

366
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,100
It's the mental condition I mentioned

367
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,260
last time.

368
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,530
I've seen many businessmen before.

369
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,340
What business puts you under so much pressure?

370
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,070
Can you let it go for a while?

371
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,580
At least not for now.

372
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,880
I'll prescribe some Western medicine for you this time.

373
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Whatever you say.

374
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,590
I have another way.

375
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,340
Come back to Hsinking with me for a week.

376
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,390
I'll find some girls to accompany you.

377
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,250
No matter how big the business is,

378
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,210
it's not as important as your life.

379
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,870
Thank you.

380
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,240
Twenty days later,

381
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,400
the same time and place.

382
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,350
A businessman?

383
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,320
Doesn't seem like it.

384
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,970
We only have

385
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,520
one useful clue now.

386
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,370
The assassin's nickname

387
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,550
is Manchukuo's Robin Hood.

388
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,760
Manchukuo's Robin Hood.

389
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:18,940
Tian Xiaojiang,

390
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,590
let go of me.

391
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,140
Let go of me!

392
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,020
Did you have a nightmare?

393
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,260
Wu Changrong.

394
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,000
Song Zhuowen.

395
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,320
Zhu Zhiguo.

396
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,830
Li Qingyi.

397
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,780
Li Qingyi.

398
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,980
You don't know each other

399
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,670
after leaving this gate.

400
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,540
Open your eyes wide.

401
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,580
Pay close attention to the entrance of tall buildings.

402
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,390
Anyone who carries a long bag,

403
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,710
no matter their age,

404
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,020
lure them to a deserted place and pin them down.

405
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,060
Kill anyone who resists.

406
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:20,780
Hu Bin.

407
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,430
Have Song Zhuowen

408
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,740
switch clothes with the guy

409
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
in the blue suit.

410
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,670
Why?

411
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,430
You made a rough man wear a suit

412
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,650
and made a scholar pretend to be a peasant.

413
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,980
Is the Secret Service putting on a comedy?

414
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,330
-Go.
-Yes.

415
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,340
Head out.

416
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,230
-Yes.
-Yes.

417
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,490
Section Chief, Ms. Guan is here.

418
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,740
Section Chief, did you have a good rest?

419
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,540
Very good.

420
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,290
If this was our first meeting,

421
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,390
I wouldn't believe

422
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,390
you work in Secret Service.

423
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,160
Harada, don't you think so?

424
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,050
This is the map.

425
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,860
I don't doubt the people I choose.

426
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,260
You don't need to tell me the specific plan.

427
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,410
I trust your plan and arrangement.

428
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,860
I don't want to interfere.

429
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,970
You're the director today.

430
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,920
We're both actors.

431
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,340
The only thing I'm worried about now

432
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
is that the fish won't take the bait.

433
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,660
One wouldn't become an assassin

434
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,660
if they weren't paranoid.

435
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,210
He will come.

436
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:09,820
Yes.

437
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,190
You're right.

438
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,100
Have some snacks.

439
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,810
I'm so angry.

440
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,440
I have no appetite.

441
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,490
I was wondering why she insisted for Song Zhuowen

442
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,890
to change into that suit.

443
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,820
It's so he could go shopping with her.

444
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,190
It's business.

445
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,070
How can you get personal feelings out of this?

446
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,200
Don't make trouble.

447
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,950
I'm not making trouble.

448
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,150
Trouble comes to me.

449
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,990
Some food is hot.

450
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,230
The more anxious you are, the less you can eat of it.

451
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,190
I like eating hot food.

452
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,860
If it cools down,

453
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,080
I don't want to eat it.

454
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,050
You just have to be stubborn.

455
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,000
Are you really hungry?

456
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,450
If I can't eat it,

457
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,580
I won't let Song Zhuowen get a bite either.

458
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Just wait and see.

459
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,890
I'll knock his teeth out in a few days.

460
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,780
I'm going to look around.

461
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
We might have wasted our time today.

462
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,800
What do you mean?

463
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,480
Thank you.

464
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,390
The Section Chief

465
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,910
overestimated his old rival.

466
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,340
Why are you looking through my stuff?

467
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,060
What?

468
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,390
Check all the big and small cases. Don't let anything pass.

469
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:03,910
Camera.

470
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,780
Keep an eye on things.

471
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,550
Binoculars.

472
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,230
Over there.

473
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,230
Open it.

474
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,190
Hello.

475
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
The Secret Service is doing checks.

476
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,430
I'm Japanese.

477
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,150
What?

478
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,140
Lift it up.

479
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,260
Crutch.

480
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,350
What are you doing?

481
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,210
Crutch.

482
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,850
Don't touch me.

483
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,330
Crutch.

484
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,179
Why do you have a crutch

485
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,699
if you're not crippled or blind?

486
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,469
Give it to me.

487
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:11,469
Who is that?

488
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,020
Give it to me! Hurry!

489
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,679
Let go of me!

490
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,219
Gun! Gun!

491
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,760
Do you not understand?

492
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,219
Do you not understand?

493
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,080
Stop shouting.

494
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,679
What are you looking at?

495
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,500
Let go of me!

496
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,020
-Peng.
-Let go of me!

497
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,820
It's a crutch.

498
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,270
What?

499
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,270
It's a crutch.

500
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,980
Let go of me!

501
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,440
I'm Japanese!

502
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,000
Bastard!

503
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:38,840
I'm sorry.

504
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,710
Do you not understand Japanese?

505
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:41,949
With his behavior,

506
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,219
he's most likely a wounded soldier who just got off the battlefield.

507
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,060
Only they

508
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,400
dare to be so arrogant in broad daylight.

509
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,280
I'm sorry.

510
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,960
I said I'm sorry. Is it still not enough?

511
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,470
Why's he still hitting me?

512
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,150
It's best not to piss off

513
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,270
Japanese people,

514
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,560
especially this kind.

515
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,990
But we still needed to check his crutch.

516
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,260
Chinese person, stay away from me.

517
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,050
I'm sorry.

518
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,390
What are you looking at?

519
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,070
Are you nervous?

520
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,840
A little.

521
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,100
Actually, now,

522
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,920
we can't control anything.

523
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,050
What should happen will happen.

524
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,890
We just need to wait for the result.

525
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,450
The weather is nice today.

526
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,300
Is this bread good?

527
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,030
This one.

528
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,660
Is the document ready?

529
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,200
Section Chief,

530
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,460
I just found some relevant information.

531
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,490
Did you contact here and here?

532
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,630
Not yet.

533
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,390
Hurry up.

534
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,140
Got it.

535
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,120
This is a bulletproof vest. You must pack it well.

536
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,790
Yes.

537
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,700
Be especially careful here.

538
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,430
Got it.

539
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,370
Hello.

540
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,140
I see.

541
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,620
I'll call you later.

542
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,000
Section Chief.

543
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,740
This is your body double today.

544
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,960
Does he look like me?

545
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,350
Yes.

546
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,660
Why is this beard so ugly?

547
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,680
It's too long.

548
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,350
Bring me scissors.

549
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,500
It's too long.

550
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,080
Here.

551
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,480
It's long here too.

552
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,300
Here,

553
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,790
it's too long.

554
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,280
And here.

555
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,280
Here too.

556
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
What do you think?

557
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,050
Isn't this good?

558
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:53,770
Yes.

559
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,600
Does it hurt?

560
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,780
How do you feel?

561
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,750
Does it hurt here?

562
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,100
Section Chief,

563
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,390
no one will be able to tell from afar.

564
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,160
Really? Go ahead.

565
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,250
I wish I had a younger brother like him.

566
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,240
Harada.

567
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,290
Yes.

568
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,500
Did I lose weight?

569
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,790
Okay.

570
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,320
Let me put on your coat.

571
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,150
Okay.

572
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,510
Will we catch Robin Hood tonight?
