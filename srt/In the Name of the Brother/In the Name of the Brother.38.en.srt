You're really in the mood, Ms. Guan.

Look at the time now.

By the way,

Mr. Asano asked me to tell you...

8
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,590
Pan Yue,

9
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,900
no matter when,

10
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,320
it's not in your position

11
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,550
to pass messages between me and that Japanese.

12
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,610
Do you understand?

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,310
Yes.

14
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,810
Does Asano Daigo know that

15
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,820
you're now with the Kuomintang?

16
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,450
How daring of you.

17
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,990
That tattletale Hu Bin...

18
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,900
Don't blame Hu Bin.

19
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,990
He's not the one who told me about it.

22
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,000
did you break the rules by going out

23
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,920
to find that female doctor?

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,500

39

If it weren't for him,

What is Yu Hong?

134

You can't reach him with your sniper rifle.

138

It's just one shot.

140

You let him run away?

141
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,730

145
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,530

152
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,420
Is it related to what happened tonight?

168

00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,100
Yes.

194
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,430
Was Mr. Song

195
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,390
here?

196
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,370
Yes.

197
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,300
If anyone asks,

198
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,450
just say

199
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,490
you've only seen Mr. Kojima and Mr. Okazaki.

200
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,290
You've never seen Song Zhuowen.

201
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,150
Okay?

202
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,210
I'm just called her last minute to serve–

203
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,210
I'll say it again!

204
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,900
I'm telling you to say

205
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,070
that you've only seen the two of them

206
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,980
but not Song Zhuowen.

207
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,390
Go back.

208
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,670
You really are Zhuge Liang.

209
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,230
A Zhuge Liang in retrospect.

210
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,290
Investigate Okazaki.

211
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,160
You're called Zhuge Liang

212
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,420
for a good reason.

213
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,690
I thought I saw a ghost just now.

214
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,790
There were two Song Zhuowens.

215
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,100
These brothers look exactly the same.

216
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,490
I really saw them.

217
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,130
At the back door, right?

218
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,060
Just right here.

219
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,380
That's right.

220
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,140
The two of them

221
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,750
wanted to blow up the back door

222
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,030
and kidnap Kojima,

223
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,020
transporting him out with a car.

224
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,330
Who would have thought

225
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,450
Kojima would be killed

226
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,900
by that director surnamed Long.

227
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,040
So many Japanese.

228
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,370
How did you get it right that

229
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,740
they wanted to kidnap Kojima?

230
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,390
You won't understand.

231
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,200
No.

232
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,990
I don't mean it that way.

233
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,780
I mean sometimes,

234
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,980
the more you know,

235
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,510
it might not necessarily be of any good to you.

236
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,500
What do you mean then?

237
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,900
Say if

238
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,380
you kidnap Song Zhuowen now,

239
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:55,200
are you going to hand him over to the Japanese or the Kuomintang's Secret Service?

240
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,080
Even if we hand him over,

241
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,810
what can the two of us

242
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,190
benefit from it?

243
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,900
They want more than one person.

244
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,860
They want the whole Harbin underground party.

245
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,580
Do we hide it

246
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,810
from Ms. Guan too?

247
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,130
I think

248
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,330
at this critical moment,

249
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,330
she may not want to know this.

250
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,310
Ms. Guan, the Japanese,

251
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,260
now there's a Kuomintang.

252
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,840
Pan,

253
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,490
do you really think you can handle it?

254
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,010
No!

255
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,500
I must!

256
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,430
Qian.

257
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,320
This is the only way now.

258
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,830
It's very likely that

259
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,140
this Tonghua Defense Plan

260
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,540
is the main plan Japan is using to defend against Soviet attack.

261
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,500
Otherwise it wouldn't use something as huge as

262
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,960
South Manchuria Railway.

263
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,410
Why don't we take action?

264
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,970
To get this plan?

265
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,780
Did I say we are not taking action?

266
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,650
I'm just saying that you can't take part in this action.

267
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,910
Why can't I?

268
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,370
Why just not me?

269
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,980
You said it yourself!

270
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,450
Given the failure of the operation today,

271
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,500
the organization can totally assume that

272
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,700
you've been exposed.

273
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,380
Let alone going back to the Secret Service.

274
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,970
In my opinion,

275
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,250
you should leave now!

276
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,100
Again?

277
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,420
Zhuowen,

278
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,380
don't think that Guan Xue,

279
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,510
Pan Yue and Hu Bin are still on the fence about who you are.

280
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,900
If I were them,

281
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,230
what I want to do the most now is to kill you!

282
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,270
Don't you understand?

283
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,710
Qian, can you come here for a second?

284
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,020
What do you want to say?

285
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,880
Do you remember when I was infected?

286
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,620
Do you know how it felt?

287
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,890
It hurt.

288
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,790
It hurt so much I couldn't take it.

289
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,860
My intestines were about to break.

290
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,600
At that time, I had only one hope.

291
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,730
For someone to shoot me.

292
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,470
I don't want to suffer anymore.

293
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,490
Now the Japanese

294
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,890
are going to use this.

295
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,330
With this one ceramic bomb,

296
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,300
it won't be just one or two people infected,

297
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,260
but tens, hundreds, and thousands of them.

298
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,510
What if a whole bunch of bombs are thrown down?

299
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,910
Scattering everywhere.

300
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,420
How many people will die?

301
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,680
Have you thought about it?

302
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,830
100,000?

303
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,620
One million?

304
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,930
We both know it clearly.

305
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,820
We long had no choice.

306
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,630
Where are you going?

307
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,790
Home.

308
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,130
Don't go home!

309
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:03,770
Qian.

310
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,620
Are you okay?

311
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,830
I'm fine.

312
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,920
Let me go.

313
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,050
Where to?

314
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,080
Don't we have a plan?

315
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,470
I'll go if Zhuowen can't go, I'll go.

316
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,860
Who do you all think you are?

317
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,180
You own South Manchuria Railway?

318
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,660
You can go whenever you want?

319
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,130
And take whatever you want?

320
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,450
Why do you always think things

321
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,940
are so simple?

322
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,930
Qian,

323
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,170
you know it too.

324
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,770
There is no perfect plan.

325
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,780
My brother is right.

326
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,140
If one has made up their mind,

327
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,220
just do it.

328
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,000
Let me tell you something too!

329
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,070
This is a meaningless sacrifice!

330
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,490
I'd rather not investigate

331
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,350
than let Song Zhuowen die in vain!

332
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,990
We need to calm down now.

333
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,000
You're back.

334
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,140
You went a whole round?

335
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,690
I came alone.

336
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,140
I believe you.

337
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,560
Do you know him?

338
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,940
Yu Hong.

339
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,220
Pan Yue's informant.

340
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,780
He gets a salary from Intelligence Unit every month.

341
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,120
Except Pan Yue,

342
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,840
no one else in Intelligence Unit knows him.

343
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,730
He was the one who wanted to kill you

344
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,630
at Sakura Hall.

345
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,140
It's Pan Yue.

346
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,530
Pan Yue joined the Kuomintang's Secret Service.

347
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,580
He got two jobs from that end.

348
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,820
One is to get a document

349
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,020
from the Japanese.

350
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,270
The other is to capture all of you in one go.

351
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,180
All of us?

352
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,950
What are you talking about?

353
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,020
All of you.

354
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,980
The Communist Party.

355
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,620
Who told you this time?

356
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,910
Pan Yu too?

357
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,340
Or Hu Bin?

358
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,110
Cui Anping’s wife said it.

359
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,370
I didn’t believe it.

360
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,740
You don't have to believe it now too.

361
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,410
That's up to

362
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,900
the gun.

363
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,700
Why are there no bullets inside?

364
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,290
Are you afraid

365
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,340
I'll shoot you?

366
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,460
I only trust guns.

367
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,920
Because only guns can protect me.

368
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,580
If you only trust guns,

369
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,920
why did you come to capture me?

370
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Sorry about that.

371
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,070
Let's get down to business.

372
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,030
I don't want Pan Yue

373
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,020
to hand the Japanese's Tonghua Defense Plan

374
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,639
to the Kuomintang's Secret Service.

375
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,489
What do you want me to do then?

376
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,449
Please help me keep him at the bay for a few days.

377
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,949
Just for a few days.

378
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:55,850
Okay.

379
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:52,850
Second floor.

380
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,170
This is the joining gift I prepared for you.

381
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,690
Though you're investigating cases for the Japanese

382
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,150
at the Secret Service right now,

383
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,560
[Department: Investigation
Grade: Clerk
Name: Pan Yue]

384
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,020
you can't get this, right?

385
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,780
Don't underestimate me.

386
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,570
From now on, you are officially working for the Kuomintang.

387
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,680
This is

388
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,110
an official celebration?

389
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Come with me.

390
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,780
You're better than Guan Xue

391
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,340
at keeping people.

392
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,010
We agreed on this.

393
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,180
We begged him to come back today.

394
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,290
Yes, I know. I'll talk less.

395
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,700
I'll not talk, okay? I'll just listen.

396
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,630
That's not what I meant.

397
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,760
After all, you're his sister.

398
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,380
Things that should be said, you should say them.

399
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,240
And those that shouldn't, don't.

400
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,570
You can't always treat him like a child.

401
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,770
He's all grown up now.

402
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,090
I know.

403
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,510
He can do anything as long as he can go home.

404
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,900
Two Sixes. Do you want it?

405
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,430
Two Tens.

406
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,660
Two Js.

407
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,890
Two Qs.

408
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,770
Anyone?

409
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,370
Whatever.

410
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,060
Anyone?

411
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,140
Two Aces.

412
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,410
Do you want it?

413
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,700
I quit.

414
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,050
You're cheating.

415
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,580
Let's go.

416
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,420
Don't run!

417
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,010
Let’s go.

418
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,940
Kai.

419
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,270
You haven’t been home for a long time.

420
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,780
Your sister doesn't even dare to ask you why.

421
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,820
Why not?

422
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,250
Ask her.

423
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,930
She didn't go home all the time when she was in school too.

424
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,810
Yes.

425
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,290
Listen to Mr. Jin.

426
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,290
Kai.

427
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,900
Your sister and I are going to Hsinking.

428
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,330
And then Tokyo.

429
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,050
We'll be back after a while.

430
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,730
Got it.

431
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,460
It's not that we don't want to take you.

432
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,010
Things in Hsinking are messier than in Harbin.

433
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,270
Tokyo just got bombed,

434
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,330
it's even more chaotic.

435
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,730
I didn't want to go at all.

436
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,570
I'm none of your business now too.

437
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,090
I have the right to decide

438
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,790
where I go and don't go.

439
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,070
We're family.

440
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,810
Don't talk like a gangster.

441
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,310
What did you say just now?

442
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,170
Kai.

443
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,800
Why don’t you understand?

444
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,580
Your sister did this for you.

445
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,290
What did she do?

446
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,870
She did it for herself.

447
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,900
Watch your words.

448
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,000
You know the Japanese will lose.

449
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,740
Your backer is down.

450
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,480
You want to run.

451
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,270
I'm your burden.

452
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,170
I'm holding you back.

453
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,170
Kai.

454
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,810
I'm not here to argue with you today.

455
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,050
If you insist on going,

456
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,580
I can arrange it for you.

457
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,860
I insist on going?

458
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,460
You always arrange everything for me.

459
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,170
For me to be like this or like that.

460
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,220
How did our parents give birth to a son like you?

461
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,900
Why don't you ask

462
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,210
how they gave birth to a daughter like you?
