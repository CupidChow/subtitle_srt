[Fandaji]

5
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,270
Cui Anping is an anti-Japanese.

6
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,870
He… Well...

7
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,760
How should I put it?

8
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,579
He set a trap for Ms. Guan

9
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
and tried to assassinate in public.

10
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,829
He is very brave.

11
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,370
I asked you here today

12
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,829
to ask about your relationship with him.

13
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,950
He's an introvert.

14
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,510
We don't usually talk to each other.

15
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,670
We just go to work.

16
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,930
There's nothing else.

17
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,030
There's nothing much between us.

18
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,690
I'm just his superior at work.

19
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,630
You drank together two days ago.

20
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,210
You're not close anymore?

21
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,970
Wasn't that because we wanted to buy you a meal?

22
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,240
So,

23
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,750
I don't want to get involved in this too.

24
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,650
After all,

25
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,070
I'm from the Secret Service.

26
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,400
At most I will get punished.

27
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,079
But it'll be different for everyone here.

28
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,350
Once you're targeted,

29
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,280
you will be interrogated nonstop.

30
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,520
Even if you just say one wrong word,

31
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,190
the torture tools in the prison will be onto you.

32
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,329
Not many people can handle it.

33
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,829
Sir, we'll listen to you.

34
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,350
We'll listen to you.

35
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,280
Don't mention our meal.

36
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,470
No matter who asksa bout it.

37
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:45,860
Okay.

38
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,670
Cui Anping is stingy and a miser.

39
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,510
That's the truth.

40
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,240
Also,

41
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,079
don't mention me and Ms. Guan going out of town again.

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,470
Who knows if

43
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,710
Cui Anping was observing for the right time

44
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,750
before he planned his assassination.

45
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,950
It's hard to explain.

46
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,150
Yes.

47
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,920
Including this meal today.

48
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,430
We've never met.

49
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,790
We've never had this meal.

50
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,910
Nope.

51
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,390
That's it then.

52
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,630
Let's go.

53
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,200
Go.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,870
Dress right.

55
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,510
Turn right. Turn right. Run.

56
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,390
We are all Mr. Cui's

57
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,630
closest friends.

58
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,070
Don't be nervous.

59
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,410
It's just a formality.

60
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,770
Let's have a brief chat.

61
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,310
Yes.

62
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,340
Sir.

63
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,659
H-he is petty.

64
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:45,540
He refuses to use any money.

65
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,750
He likes to keep all the benefits

66
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,790
to himself.

67
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,990
But there's nothing much.

68
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,860
There's nothing else.

69
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,750
Other than when we are on duty,

70
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,750
he doesn't usually hang out with us.

71
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,030
He seldom talks when he's on duty.

72
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,030
I don't really know who he's close with.

73
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,750
Bringing us to a restaurant?

74
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,150
That's impossible.

75
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,700
Last time, Ms. Guan gave him cash rewards saying that

76
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,360
its for everyone's hard work.

77
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,040
In the end, it all went into his pocket.

78
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,830
Sir!

79
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,830
He didn't do anything himself.

80
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,750
Unless he saw that it involves

81
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,990
a rich trader,

82
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,740
only then he would go investigate it personally.

83
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,380
Okay.

84
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,110
Sir!

85
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,590
Come in.

86
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,880
Something's wrong with you today.

87
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,470
What's wrong?

88
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
Something's bothering you.

89
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,920
I didn't sleep well last night.

90
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,910
I'm fine.

91
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,990
Sir,

92
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,870
we won't talk about it.

93
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,130
But what about others?

94
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,990
Who?

95
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,630
Mr. Yang.

96
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,900
I happened to be around them.

97
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,670
I saw them talking about Cui Anping.

98
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,200
Where are you going?

99
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,280
So I ran.

100
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,630
What's his name?

101
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,780
I don't really know.

102
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,470
How's your sleep?

103
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,830
I snore the moment my head touches my pillow.

104
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,270
My parents are not great

105
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,380
but at least they gave me the ability to sleep well.

106
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,950
That's rare.

107
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,980
If there's nothing on your mind,

108
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,390
and you don't keep thinking about women,

109
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,250
you sleep well.

110
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,430
Mr. Yang.

111
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,820
Mr. Yang?

112
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,860
Mr. Yang is on duty today. He's rushing here.

113
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,059
Please wait a moment.

114
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,720
What are you talking about?

115
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,940
Every sentry commander in the defense regiment have responsibility for deaths.

116
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,740
The responsibility is on whoever's on shift.

117
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,990
Who cares about this responsibility?

118
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,230
If he doesn't come, let's go find him.

119
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,400
Where is the explosion?

120
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,610
I don't know. It doesn't sound far away.

121
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,040
Sir.

122
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,390
It's the chemical plant in the western suburbs nearby. Something happened.

123
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,230
Call the section chief.

124
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,860
I'll be right there.

125
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,220
Yes!

126
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,770
Pan Yue won't let Mr. Yang without a testimony.

127
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,200
What should I do

128
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,870
in such a short time?

129
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,870
You've said so much.

130
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,470
But I haven't understood a single thing.

131
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,360
Why don't you listen to me?

132
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,270
Listen to me.

133
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,590
We didn't see it at all.

134
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,920
It's such a big problem.

135
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,790
It has nothing to do with us.

136
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,330
You can't blame us.

137
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,510
We stayed up all night.

138
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,870
Who is Mr. Yang?

139
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,470
I didn't see it at all.

140
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,670
Such a big mess happened.

141
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,400
You can really pick the timing.

142
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,020
Look.

143
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,300
Good for you. Who are you?

144
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,430
It's not your responsibility.

145
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,510
I'll be demoted as the commander soon.

146
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,770
We want to, but it's none of our business.

147
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,790
Go. Check with me again.

148
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,920
Did anyone get hurt?

149
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,150
Go!

150
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,600
What happened?

151
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,330
When the patrol team and I were patrolling around the city,

152
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,840
we suddenly heard a loud noise from the factory.

153
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,980
As a soldier,

154
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,160
I know very well the sound comes from the explosion of strong explosives.

155
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,840
But when we rushed here,

156
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,610
there was no one here.

157
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,300
Did your men go in?

158
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,800
Not yet. We are checking around.

159
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,500
We'll go in.

160
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,270
You, wait here.

161
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,500
[Nitrate explosives]

162
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
Is anyone inside?

163
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,900
Disperse the people who came here first.

164
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,300
Search around the factory

165
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,900
for markings of an old bike's tire.

166
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,790
Mr. Hu...

167
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,870
Go look for it.

168
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,390
Yes.

169
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,990
What happened? Who did it?

170
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,210
When the explosion happened,

171
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,430
there were only two people in the factory.

172
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,920
One tall, one short,

173
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,230
The tall guy was about 1.8 m tall.

174
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,870
The short guy was about 1.6 m.

175
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,190
The short guy has been living inside for a few days,

176
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,790
making explosives.

177
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,460
The tall guy is here to deliver food to him.

178
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,950
The vehicle is an old bike.

179
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,590
The last meal delivered here was steamed buns.

180
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,270
They had a disagreement on the ingredients

181
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,590
of the explosives.

182
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,390
Both of them tried to convince each other.

183
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,790
But at that moment,

184
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,350
somehow,

185
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,610
there was an explosion of the materials they've prepared.

186
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,130
Luckily, neither of them got hurt.

187
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,620
The tall guy rode that old bike

188
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,560
and left with the short guy.

189
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,350
That sounds so complete.

190
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,910
How do you know so much?

191
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,870
Let's find the mark of the old bike first.

192
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,630
I'll explain later.

193
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,150
It's here!

194
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,370
Here!

195
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,390
Th-This is it.

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,810
This one was left on the way here.

197
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,190
It's a little shallower because only one person was on the bike.

198
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,390
This one was left when they were leaving.

199
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,830
Because he had someone behind him,

200
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,950
the tires' marks become deep and strong.

201
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,490
There were really two people?

202
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,150
You've never seen them.

203
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,990
How do you know how tall they are?

204
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,910
They are not here.

205
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,600
But they left clues.

206
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,040
You can guess it too.

207
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,600
As long as you are interested in doing it.

208
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,580
In the corner of the workshop,

209
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,430
there is a piece of wooden plank with a bunch of bed covers.

210
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,710
Obviously, someone lives here,

211
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,530
specializing in making explosives.

212
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,930
I found two sets of footprints.

213
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,290
The smaller footprint

214
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,240
are all over the workshop's floor.

215
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,630
The larger footprint

216
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,710
are obviously less.

217
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,060
What is that tall guy doing here?

218
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,880
There's a steamed bun next to the wooden bed that's still warm.

219
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,400
So, he's here to deliver food.

220
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,490
The stain Pan Yue found is a kind of lubricant.

221
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,790
It's specially used on bike chains.

222
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,350
I'm guessing the tall guy who brought food's

223
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,390
bike chain came off on the way here.

224
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,470
He fixed it in the factory

225
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,990
and wiped off the dirt on his hands with that tattered rag.

226
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,490
As for why they quarreled,

227
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,030
I think Zhuowen saw the clue before I did.

228
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,250
If we follow the tyre mark,

229
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,569
we should find something.

230
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,079
Come here!

231
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,620
Follow this tyre mark and search.

232
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,100
-Yes!
-Yes!

233
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,830
We don't know who these two

234
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,130
tall and short men are.

235
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,300
But one thing is for sure.

236
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,880
They are all risking their lives to fight against Japan.

237
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,180
I have the responsibility to protect them.

238
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,790
Stop!

239
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,990
Go on.

240
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,220
I'll call Ms. Guan and report it to her.

241
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,440
Hello?

242
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,400
Why didn't you go to school?

243
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,960
I... I'm not feeling well.

244
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,340
Can't you apply for leave if you're not feeling well?

245
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,550
You're an adult.

246
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,570
Don't break the rules.

247
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,110
Okay, I got it.

248
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,700
Bye.

249
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,260
It's me.

250
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,470
Mr. Pan. Go ahead.

251
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,130
Good.

252
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,190
Keep looking.

253
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,110
We must find them.

254
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,450
Today is the best day to move the explosives.

255
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,710
Today?

256
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,230
I...

257
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,790
I have to go to class.

258
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,990
Where can I hide?

259
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,310
Go home.

260
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,870
Just follow the method I taught you.

261
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,000
It's safe. Nothing will happen.

262
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,270
Are you crazy?

263
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,350
My sister will find out.

264
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,350
She won't.

265
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,720
Trust me. She'll be busy today.

266
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,030
She doesn't have time to go home.

267
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,130
When did you start your shift?

268
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,970
Hello, sir.

269
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,870
6 a.m.

270
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,510
Two people passed by this intersection.

271
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,570
A tall and short guy. Did you see them?

272
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,990
On a bike, right?

273
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,440
Be specific.

274
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,580
They fixed their bike chain

275
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,780
for a while over them

276
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,570
and left when it was fixed.

277
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,190
They even quarreled.

278
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,550
So it left quite an impression on me.

279
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,440
Which direction did they go in?

280
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,280
The south. They went straight.

281
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,990
The front and back doors of the warehouse are all locked up.

282
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,710
But there are windows everywhere.

283
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,350
There's a ladder, by the gate.

284
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,190
I saw it.

285
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,390
There are five or six of them that can be used.

286
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,110
No need.

287
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,750
You guard the back door.

288
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,470
I'll take someone to crash into the front door.

289
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,510
It's just one tall and one short guy.

290
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,430
They can't run away.

291
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,060
No.

292
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,870
We must catch them alive this time!

293
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,050
Time is running out.

294
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,310
Remove their weapons

295
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,110
from the four windows

296
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,590
and surprise attack them.

297
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Okay, we'll split into four groups.

298
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,790
Enter through the window in three minutes.

299
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,790
We want them alive.

300
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,390
Take one team each, go ahead.

301
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,620
Pan was afraid that you'd ruin it because you're inexperienced.

302
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,150
So he asked me to come help you.

303
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,950
Don't thank me. Thank him later.

304
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,110
You go first.

305
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,770
Is there a problem?

306
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,400
Are you scared?

307
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,520
It's useless. You have to go even if you're afraid.

308
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,150
Why should I do it?

309
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,010
Ten seconds countdown.

310
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,940
Handgun loaded.

311
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,740
Remember, catch them alive.

312
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,680
Now you're scared of death?

313
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,910
I'm telling you to go up there and you're refusing, right?

314
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,370
Look at you. How cowardly.

315
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,630
I'm going to tell Ms. Guan

316
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,310
that you're scared of death.

317
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,990
Go! Go!

318
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,140
Go!

319
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,670
Go!

320
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,110
Ms. Guan, we've been tricked.

321
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,350
Other than our men who entered,

322
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,610
there's no one inside.

323
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,270
-The number of casualties.
-You are afraid of death!

324
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,310
Two dead and five injured.

325
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,110
Song Zhuowen.

326
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,350
You've disgraced the Police Agency!

327
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,350
There are so many people out there. Why did you want me to go first?

328
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,510
I'm the Operations Unit Chief.

329
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,070
You have to go as I say!

330
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,470
I have to go even if you want me to die for no good reason?

331
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,190
Yeah, right. Stop saying stuff like that when it's already a done deed.

332
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,250
You're so capable.

333
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,060
Mr. Hu, you're a smart person.

334
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,170
Don't you think there's something wrong with this operation?

335
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,750
Why was it so coincidental

336
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,080
at the first explosion?

337
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,040
And no one got hurt!

338
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,150
That bike

339
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,480
could've screwed up anywhere.

340
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,170
But it just had to screw up in front of the Public Security station.

341
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,240
Nonsense! You get to say everything?

342
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,910
Mr. Pan.

343
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,630
Every step of induction you made is very accurate.

344
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,810
If he didn't force me to be the scapegoat,

345
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,240
you would have listened to my analysis.

346
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,590
Are you asking for a beating?

347
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,310
Enough!

348
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,150
Song Zhuowen, for withdrawing from the operation,

349
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,370
you are fined two months' salary

350
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,710
and you have to reflect for a week.

351
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,510
You won't be allowed to join any operations in this time.

352
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,110
Go to the hospital and take care of the injured. That's it.

353
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,040
How's one month?

354
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,870
Four months!

355
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,110
Your ID please.

356
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,190
Kai!

357
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,600
Why are you here?

358
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,670
M-My classmate is injured.

359
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,510
Does your sister know you are here?

360
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,310
No.

361
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,520
Okay.

362
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,720
I see.

363
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,700
I’ll call the water company

364
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,390
now.

365
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,870
I'm from the Army Hospital.

366
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,390
There's a leakage here.

367
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,730
Please come and fix it.

368
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,510
The anti-Japanese are getting more brazen.

369
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,400
The radio signal from the underground party is getting more frequent.

370
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,990
The Secret Service seems to not be able to do anything too.

371
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,790
They might have put all their efforts

372
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,190
into making money and internal feuds.

373
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,930
Section Chief.

374
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,110
Remove Guan Xue.

375
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,230
Even changing a guard dog would required feeding and training it.

376
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,510
It's a waste of time.

377
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,720
Our mission in Harbin

378
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:22,280
is not to just capture some military leaders and the underground party

379
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,100
but also make it a scabbard

380
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,120
to hide the sharpest sword in the empire.

381
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,550
I got it.

382
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,730
Come in.

383
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,620
In Chinese words,

384
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,790
this is

385
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,390
a series of traps.

386
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,990
Killing your manpower

387
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,790
is their ultimate goal.

388
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,710
How are the casualties?

389
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,210
Two dead and five injured.

390
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,890
Who is the person who commanded this operation?

391
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,470
He must be an idiot.

392
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,990
The first explosion.

393
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,630
There happened to be Military Police patrolling the area

394
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,560
but no one was injured at the scene.

395
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,680
At the entrance of the Public Security station,

396
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,990
the bike happened to screw up.

397
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,250
Is this all a coincidence?

398
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,310
It was a trap,

399
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,750
yet he... still went inside.

400
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,290
Is my analysis flawed?

401
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,990
What you said is almost the same

402
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,910
as what another person said.

403
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,470
That's why I'm surprised.

404
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,450
Who?

405
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,020
Song Zhuowen.

406
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,310
Wait here.

407
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,770
Don't touch me!

408
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,390
It hurts!

409
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,250
What kind of explosive can blow people up like this?

410
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,130
Don't touch it!

411
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Don't touch that!

412
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,690
Kai!

413
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,720
Kai!

414
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,590
Go back now.

415
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,930
Don't miss your class.

416
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,160
It hurts!

417
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,950
Why didn't he bring up his suspicions?

418
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,190
The situation was complicated.

419
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,520
He was probably afraid of the higher-ups.

420
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,550
He doesn't dare to tell his superior the truth.

421
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,270
This is your weakness.

422
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,310
Maybe

423
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,710
you didn't give him more space to work with.

424
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,190
You mean...

425
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,300
What is Song Zhuowen doing now?

426
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,820
He disobeyed the order of the superiors during the operation

427
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,820
so I punished him to go to the hospital to accompany the injured.

428
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,350
Ms. Guan, you drive.

429
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,580
I also want to see the injured

430
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,330
and...

431
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,830
Song Zhuowen.

432
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,170
Yes.

433
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,300
The main valve is down there.

434
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,350
The pipes are getting old.

435
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,280
We have to hurry.

436
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,720
We have to move the car, right?

437
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,790
Okay, I'll hold it.

438
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,630
Push it.

439
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,130
Okay.

440
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,790
Come, give me a hand.

441
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,350
Come on.

442
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,510
Mr. Ning!

443
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,610
Why are you still here?

444
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,150
I just want to confirm with you.

445
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,750
Leave now.

446
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,990
This explosive...

447
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,970
Guan Kai, listen to me.

448
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,070
It's none of your business.

449
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,060
Leave now!

450
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,620
Go!

451
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,390
What is that place?

452
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,670
This?

453
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,710
Yes.

454
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,970
Hongzhang Nightclub.

455
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,290
The place where you can see the most beautiful white Russian dancers in Harbin,

456
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,750
the sweetest chocolates,

457
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,200
and hear the most authentic Mandolin.

458
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,090
Isn't that General Staff Harada.

459
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,190
Drive into him.

460
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,870
Drive into him, this is an order.

461
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,920
Why did you step on the brake

462
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,790
when you hit him?

463
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,370
You're a soldier,

464
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,330
not an official!

465
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,670
I'm sorry, sir.

466
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,750
You should thank her.

467
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,790
If I were the driver,

468
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,320
it would've been over for you.

469
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,630
Ms. Guan,

470
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,210
please call a doctor for him.

471
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,670
Yes.

472
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,430
You can fool around.

473
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,550
But it's not fooling around if you're going around

474
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,080
going around places like this with your briefcase.

475
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,950
If our top mission is leaked,

476
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,760
everyone will die!

477
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,980
There's a spot here.

478
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,070
Yes, here.

479
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,750
Come on. There's an empty spot here. Come on.

480
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,190
Move forward. Move forward.

481
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,920
Come on, move forward. Come on.

482
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,190
Okay.

483
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,830
Ms. Guan.

484
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,860
Sister...

485
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,670
Everyone.

486
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,600
You were injured for the peace of Manchukuo.

487
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:38,430
You are all warriors.

488
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,430
Hello.

489
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,270
Xiao Li.

490
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,200
It must've been hard on you.

491
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,910
Zhao Xuebin from Ops.

492
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,030
Are you okay?

493
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,170
Jiang Wang.

494
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,230
Are you okay?

495
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,370
Are you okay?

496
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,430
What's going on?

497
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,420
Guo from Intelligence Unit.

498
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,160
Are you okay?

499
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,270
I’m fine.

500
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,070
Zhang Zhao.

501
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,230
Are you okay?
