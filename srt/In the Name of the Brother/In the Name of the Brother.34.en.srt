[Episode 34]

4
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,030
Mr. Pan, I acted on my own.

5
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,350
I haven't had time to report to Section Chief Guan.

6
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,190
We must find clues to report

7
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,270
before we go back.

8
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,430
It's fake.

9
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,589
The car is fake too.

10
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,100
The anti-smuggling squad is fake too.

11
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,750
No stalls,

12
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,570
no witness.

13
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,990
It's a problem.

14
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,570
They changed cars here.

15
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,460
And the car is old.

16
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,230
It's leaking fuel.

17
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,000
The car came from Wenjing Street.

18
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,690
There is a power plant over there.

19
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,460
There are trucks transporting coal into there every night.

20
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,770
There must be some crumbs of coals on the road.

21
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,310
We'll find that car

22
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,360
if we go towards Wenjing Street's direction.

23
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,720
It's been so long. They must've fled.

24
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,210
The communists are not as smart as you think.

25
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,150
And they'll have to stay low in Harbin.

26
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,550
They dare not drive fast.

27
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,900
Listen to me.

28
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,500
Wenjing Street, right now.

29
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,950
Zhuowen called me

30
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,780
He asked me to go to the train station

31
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,230
to pretend to be a anti-smuggling police

32
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,870
to pick you up

33
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,600
as soon as you get off the train.

34
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,990
Hello.

35
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,190
I'm from the anti-smuggling squad.

36
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,520
There is a smuggling suspect on your train

37
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,240
called Li Shutang.

38
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,590
Wang Tinggui?

39
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,630
Send out your hat now.

40
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,470
Now.

41
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,630
Move away!

42
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,850
Move away!

43
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,710
I'm was at a three-way intersection south of Wenjing Street.

44
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,310
All traces were gone.

45
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,150
I didn't know where to go.

46
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,550
Not long from the left turn of the three-way intersection

47
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,789
is the corner of Majiagou River.

48
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,909
Once you're exposed,

49
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,850
both directions are dead ends.

50
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,950
If you were a communist,

51
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,200
would you choose your lair to be somewhere like a dead end like this?

52
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,880
I see.

53
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,440
Then they will turn right

54
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,750
There's a big compound five miles to the right.

55
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,390
The roads are complex too.

56
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,670
It's easy to hide and easy to run.

57
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,710
I'm pretty sure.

58
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,310
Mr. Pan.

59
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,610
When will you be discharged?

60
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,210
I'm counting on you for my wealth.

61
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:18,860
Hello.

62
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,420
Mr. Ma. Go ahead.

63
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,680
Pan,

64
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,670
I advise you

65
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,110
to stop keeping an eye on Song Zhuowen.

66
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,950
He leaves

67
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,660
no flaws.

68
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,990
Am I that kind of person to be persuaded?

69
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,060
Have you checked the call

70
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,030

71
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,990
Yes.

72
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,080
He called Qiao Liang

73
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,310
to remind him to

74
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,240
water his flowers.

75
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,870
Okay, I got it.

76
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,110
I knew he wouldn't stay still

77

78
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,690
How shrewd.

79
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,010
What a real shrew.

80
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,270
Once you confirm that it's that car,

81
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,580
you can call Ms. Guan.

82
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,560

84
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,420

its purpose is to maintain public security

this place isn't far from Mr. Song's place?

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,410

What are you doing?

162
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,990
You sent me to study class

163
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,050

166
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,900
Yes! The house is yours.

167
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,830
-What's going on?
-You can’t just come here

168
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,660
as you wish.

169
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,380
Ms Guan?

170
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,580
You hid major operations from me

171
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,080
and sent someone to follow me.

172
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,020
Then why did you make me the

173
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,480
Intelligence Unit Chief?

174
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,570
Xie Yue lives here

175
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,850
yet she doesn't even make the bed for you.

176
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,260
Suspicion is like a flea.

177
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,070
If you can find the first one,

178
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,930
you'll feel there's another one.

179
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,880
When it starts,

180
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,450
you can't stop it anymore.

181
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,790
Let's part happily.

182
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,890
It's better than making it ugly in the future.

183
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,890
What do you think?

184
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,220
Aunt Chang has left.

185
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,110
She won't be coming back.

186
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,350
If there's anything missing at your place,

187
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,150
don't mind it.

188
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,730
She might have taken the wrong thing.

189
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,060
If you need someone to serve you,

190
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,740
I'll find you another one.

Aren't you supposed to be in class?

193
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,120
Didn't Mr. Asano make this urgent order?

194
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,090
Fro everyone to cooperate with the Secret Service's operation.

195
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,690
You lead the arrest.

196
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,330
How is it?

197
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,230
Have you found anything?

198
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,540
Not yet.

199
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,800
They are still searching the city.

200
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,390
If we can't catch them,

201
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,540
what will you tell Mr. Asano?

202
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,640
Good job, guys.

203
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,180
Here.

204
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,690
Slowly.

205
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,240
Here.

206
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,180
Can you get me a glass of water?

207
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,780
Is that girl reliable?

208
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,110
We have no other choice.

209
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,650
Here.

210
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,210
When did Aunt Chang leave?

211
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,550
I don't know.

212
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,500
She left when I came.

213
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,700
Why did you help us?

214
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,500
Who helped you?

215
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,070
Your bearded brother

216
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,190
covered my mouth with his hand

217
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,780
and held a gun against my head.

218
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,380
I just don't want to die here.

219
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,350
Qian.

220
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,590
Hang in there.

221
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,380
I don't want to live here anymore.

222
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,010
Because I know who you are.

223
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,910
Who are we?

224
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,590
You are communist.

225
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,800
Qian.

226
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,220
Think about your son.

227
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,130
Think about your son.

228
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,330
Think about your son.

229
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,440
Qian! Qian!

230
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,660
Hang in there, Qian.

231
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,630
Here.

232
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,810
I hit you too hard just now.

233
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,950
Don't take it to heart.

234
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,840
Qian! Qian!

235
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,030
Here.

236
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,620
Have some.

237
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:54,730
Have some.

238
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,950
Have some.

239
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,520
It's good.

240
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,180
Good tea.

241
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,910
Come in.

242
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:14,590
Mr. Asano.

243
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,510
Mr. Pan.

244
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,659
You've gained weight and got fairer.

245
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,719
Did I?

246
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,590
Ms. Guan.

247
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,030
Have a seat.

248
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,280
Ms. Guan,

249
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,810
I don't like being two-faced

250
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,850
about personnel matters.

251
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,420
So today,

252
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:49,800
I invited Mr. Pan here to announce

253
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,000
his appointment.

254
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,580
Of course,

255
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,330
I've already talked about this appointment

256
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,700
with the director.

257
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,100
Mr. Asano.

258
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,710
You're putting much importance on this.

259
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,710
Let me guess.

260
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,400
Is Mr. Pan

261
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,670
going to be Section Chief Pan soon?

262
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,230
Deputy Section Chief.

263
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,980
Deputy Section Chief Pan.

264
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,560
Mr. Pan is so respectful towards you, Mr. Asano.

265
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,430
I even went to the hospital personally asking you to go on a mission.

266
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,060
Looks like you could've been discharged since a while ago.

267
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,590
I accept this appointment.

268
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,190
Today,

269
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,650
let's say some honest things.

270
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,990
The Secret Service has been

271
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,270
unfair with rewards and punishments recently.

272
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,130
We aren't using the right person.

273
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,430
I've been around for quite a while.

274
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,440
Secret Service

275
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,460
can be considered half my family.

276
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,180
I'm really worried.

277
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,320
You want to be the head of this family?

278
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,460
Ms. Guan.

279
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,870
People take turns when playing mahjong.

280
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,300
Even if you are made of iron,

281
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
how many nails can be made out of you?

282
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,120
As I said,

283
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,550
we're united

284
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,480
and overcome hardships together.

285
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,270
Come on.

286
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,000
The two of you, have some tea.

287
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,150
Yes.

288
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,840
I'll listen to Mr. Asano.

289
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,140
You're all here.

290
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,190
Sit.

291
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,530
I have an announcement today.

292
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,470
From today on,

293
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,500
Pan Yue will no longer be the Unit Chief of the Intelligence Unit.

294
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,140
He has been appointed the Deputy Section Chief of the Secret Service.

295
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,970
He will be in charge of the logistics.

296
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,120
Letting Pan manage the logistics?

297
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,030
I-Isn't that nonsense?

298
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,630
Is this your idea, Ms. Guan?

299
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,340
This is Mr. Asano's idea.

300
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,560
Deputy Section Chief Pan.

301
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,000
The logistics are in a mess.

302
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,870
We can't keep up with the supplies.

303
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,170
They said they don't have enough money.

304
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,790
We can't eat on time at the canteen.

305
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,990
They said there's not enough manpower.

306
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,230
After you become the Deputy Section Chief,

307
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,100
you must get this job done well.

308
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,110
Help Jin.

309
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,220
We are all counting on you.

310
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,390
Ms. Guan.

311
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,910
That's not what we said

312
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,640
at Mr. Asano's office that day.

313
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,550
I have to obey the director's order.

314
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,500
Right?

315
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,010
Please thank him for me.

316
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,600
You should thank him in person.

317
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:04,850
Okay.

318
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,560
All right.

319
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,460
That's it.

320
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,590
Dismissed.

321
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,700
What's going on?

322
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,970
Why are you looking at me?

323
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,630
This is how it is

324
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,230
working under the Japanese.

325
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,910
When they are supporting you, they'd do anything for you.

326
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,910
But when you fall,

327
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,870
they won't even blink.

328
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,340
So you learned all these

329
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,150
from the Japanese?

330
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:50,920
Right?

331
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,200
Have you seen monkey shows?

332
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,370
Everyone is amused by the monkeys

333
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,560
and applaud for the monkeys.

334
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,190
But do you think the monkeys know it's for them?

335
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,180
I don't think so.

336
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,620
Then do you think,

337
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,630
when the monkeys see people toss money

338
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,960
into the trainer's hat,

339
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,720
would they feel upset?

340
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,920
Of course not.

341
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,030
I'm sure

342
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,470
it only cares about whether it can get more food

343
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,480
at night

344
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,510
and whether it can get whipped less.

345
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,090
So we are all monkeys.

346
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,420
You're only half right.

347
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,660
Actually, we don't need to be monkeys.
