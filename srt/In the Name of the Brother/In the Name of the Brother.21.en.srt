I'm guessing there's a girl's picture in it.

Is this your brother?

It's best for Zhuowen to tell the truth.

Isn't this a fool's errand?

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,330
newspaper stores nearby?

192
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,690
[Fengtian Station]

193
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,990
The organization contacted me

194
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,250
to cooperate with you.

195
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,200
I searched around overnight.

196
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,190
All your old neighbors have moved away,

197
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,320
except one.

198
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,620
Because of the rain,

199
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,590
he's been staying

200
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,910
in your old house.

201
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,830
Who is it?

202
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,550
His name is Sun Gui.

203
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,790
His wife and child went back to the village two days ago.

204
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,910
He's alone now.

205
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,200
Sun Gui?

206
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,910
The son of Sun,

207
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,630
who lived in our backyard?

208
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,410
The telegram didn't specify.

209
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,310
Are you sure the family photo your brother tore

210
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,170
is the only one?

211
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,390
I have one more.

212
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,070
Where did you take it?

213
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,520
At the foyer, I think.

214
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,710
I need a camera.

215
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,580
I'll keep the photo for now.

216
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,430
Peanuts and seeds, anyone?

217
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,020
Is the train schedule delayed?

218
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,300
No, it's on time.

219
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,830
Why haven't we got to Fengtian?

220
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,390
Fengtian?

221
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,600
We've past it long ago.

222
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,060
We're approaching Liaoyang, the next stop.

223
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,670
Sun Gui.

224
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,260
Who are you looking for?

225
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,470
Don't you recognize me?

226
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,550
Zhuo...

227
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,590
Is there a leak in your house?

228
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,510
Yes, it's leaking.

229
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,550
I didn't mean to occupy your house.

230
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,290
It's just that if no one's looking after this house,

231
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,630
it'll collapse someday.

232
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,670
Look, I tidied it up.

233
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,800
Nothing's changed.

234
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,360
It hasn't?

235
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,120
Whose photos are these?

236
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,710
My wife did that.

237
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,950
Are you thirsty?

238
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,430
I'll get you some water.

239
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,510
Here, son.

240
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:55,990
Okay.

241
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,150
Okay, stand here.

242
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,880
Don't move.

243
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,710
Want some water?

244
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,990
We'll leave after taking a photo.

245
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,990
You can live here.

246
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,260
What's the photo for?

247
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,870
Hurry.

248
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,710
No, we have to wait.

249
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,670
Why?

250
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,270
Judging from the light,

251
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,270
it has to be later.

252
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,030
Here, son.

253
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,540
Rickshaw!

254
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,910
Rickshaw, anyone?

255
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,230
Sir, come in.

256
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,060
Please get in.

257
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,090
Get off!

258
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,700
-Sir...
-Go!

259
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,510
Okay. Sit tight.

260
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,110
Hurry up!

261
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,270
I'm leaving.

262
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Talk to you later.

263
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,950
Zhuowu.

264
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,030
What are you doing?

265
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,690
Well...

266
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,790
Where have you brothers been these years?

267
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,480
To be honest,

268
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,510
I came back this time

269
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,920
for a matter of me and my brother.

270
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,700
You have to help me out.

271
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,550
No, I can't!

272
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,280
Listen.

273
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,510
I can never do that.

274
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,530
I'll move and vacate the house

275
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,270
if you want me to.

276
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,070
But fooling the Japanese will get me killed.

277
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,340
Get a grip.

278
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,350
I'm here. You'll be fine.

279
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,790
I can never do it.

280
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,630
I have a wife and child.

281
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,180
Even if you kill me,

282
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,240
I can't do it.

283
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,070
Sun Gui.

284
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,200
I didn't object to

285
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,530
you staying in my house.

286
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,740
Don't be shameless.

287
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,490
Wait...

288
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,480
Can you do it?

289
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,810
I really can't do it.

290
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,870
Make way!

291
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,310
Buddy,

292
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,310
can you go faster?

293
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,750
Sir.

294
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,540
Hurry up!

295
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,070
Excuse me!

296
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,350
Faster!

297
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,110
Too slow! Faster!

298
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,060
It's a matter of life and death!

299
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,170
Can you help me?

300
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,550
Your family's lives matter,

301
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
but so do mine.

302
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,830
If you insist,

303
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,540
you can take my life.

304
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,270
Can you leave my wife and child alone?

305
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,510
Sun Gui.

306
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,310
I'm begging you.

307
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,800
Do me this favor.

308
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,900
I'll never forget you.

309
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,870
Let me kowtow to you.

310
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,550
Don't!

311
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,740
I'll kowtow to you eight times.

312
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,810
I'll kowtow to you.

313
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,150
Amazing.

314
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,450
Really.

315
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,600
I can't tell it's fake at all.

316
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,350
The photo's settled.

317
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,150
What should we do with him?

318
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,880
Coming!

319
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,960
Is this the Song family?

320
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,180
I'm a friend of Zhuowen's, the eldest son of the Songs.

321
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,350
Zhuowen's friend?

322
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,190
Yes.

323
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,570
I'm actually looking for Sun Gui.

324
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,030
Me?

325
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,610
You...

326
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,540
Hello.

327
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,990
Please come in.

328
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,610
I'm Zhuowen's colleague.

329
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,270
I came to Fengtian for a business trip

330
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,350
to check out his old house.

331
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,110
Tell Zhuowen I'm taking care of his house for him.

332
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,770
I'll leave once he's back.

333
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,930
I heard from Zhuowen

334
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,100
you three grew up together.

335
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,860
Don't bring that up.

336
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,870
Zhuowen's kind.

337
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,870
But Zhuowu...

338
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,410
always beat me up when we were little.

339
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,910
What's their age difference?

340
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,410
Do they look alike?

341
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,820
Not when they were younger.

342
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,080
I don't know about now.

343
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,790
Is this Zhuowen?

344
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,040
He looked like this as a kid?

345
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,740
Is he doing well in Harbin?

346
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,850
As the saying goes,

347
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,690
the child's the father of man.

348
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,190
He's doing well.

349
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,430
Impressive.

350
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,100
Impressive, indeed.

351
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,300
Zhuowu.

352
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,820
You didn't have to do this.

353
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,060
Who do you think I am?

354
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,970
Would I make a sound

355
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,530
at this point?

356
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,460
If I do, we'll all die together.

357
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,670
Buddy.

358
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,650
You're a tough man.

359
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,500
I didn't underestimate you.

360
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,340
Good news.

361
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,670
Japan has surrounded Guilin.

362
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,420
Guangxi will soon be captured.

363
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,300
Let me tell you some bad news.

364
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,990
Germany's field marshal Rommel committed suicide.

365
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,990
Germany?

366
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,800
Not too much.

367
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,190
That's thousands of miles away.

368
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,320
How's that bad news?

369
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,000
You've never played chess, have you?

370
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,720
Even Germans are caving in.

371
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,200
It'll be the Japanese's turn sooner or later.

372
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,150
We've to pray the Japanese stay strong.

373
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,470
Prepare for it.

374
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,710
Work harder for the Japanese

375
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,150
and save up for yourself.

376
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,590
You don't care about me at all.

377
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,500
Harbin, Jiamusi,

378
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,870
Qiqihar.

379
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,010
Let alone the city,

380
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,630
they're just some buskers and salesmen.

381
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,360
There aren't so many Counter-Japanese members.

382
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,250
The conditions given by the Japanese

383
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,290
are very strange.

384
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,080
There's an arrest quota

385
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,480
for men,

386
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,590
women,

387
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,830
the old,

388
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,790
the young,

389
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,110
and even children.

390
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,190
The proportion's fixed.

391
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,270
It's not about working hard

392
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,750
but working to death.

393
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,020
It's too tough.

394
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,150
Enough.

395
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,800
Don't go off-topic.

396
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,150
Is Ma Bole's investigation

397
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,250
of Zhuowen done?

398
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,670
No.

399
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,720
Ma even asked for a car.

400
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,910
He's doing too much.

401
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,300
It's just a formality.

402
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,670
Why's he making a fuss over a superior's

403
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,640
casual remark?

404
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,040
Ma's taking his job seriously.

405
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,080
Can't be honest with me anymore?

406
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,870
Still, he can’t break the rules.

407
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,080
Ma and Pan

408
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,390
worked together in the rural pacification's Inspection Office

409
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,830
and made money together.

410
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,870
They're close.

411
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,370
It won't be easy for Zhuowen to pass this test.

412
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,770
[Harbin]

413
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,820
Did it go well?

414
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,630
Not bad. We've dealt with it.

415
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,070
How's Zhuowen?

416
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,530
He still hasn't come out

417
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,790
from the Police Agency.

418
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,580
Not yet?

419
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,590
Let's go wait at the Police Agency.

420
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,790
Qian asked us to go back first.

421
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,190
Don't waste time. Get in.

422
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,750
Come in.

423
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,710
I'm done.

424
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,110
I don't need three days.

425
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,240
Sure, let me look at your masterpiece.

426
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,810
Just by the first page,

427
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,850
it's well thought out,

428
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,950
exquisitely written,

429
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,840
and with good handwriting.

430
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,180
Well done.

431
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,870
Not bad.

432
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,640
I'll leave you to it.

433
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,010
Hello.

434
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,190
I heard you locked Zhuowen

435
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,260
in the archives to write a paper.

436
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,670
Brilliant move.

437
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,030
How is it?

438
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,040
Three days have passed.

439
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,630
Did a miracle happen?

440
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,630
Nothing's wrong with Zhuowen's brother.

441
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,980
And his paper's decent.

442
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,860
Buddy.

443
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,660
I'm afraid you've met your match.

444
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,870
Before the last move's played,

445
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,070
we won't know who'd win.

446
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,770
I heard yesterday that

447
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,610
the Americans and Russians broke into Germany.

448
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,670
Have you heard?

449
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,230
The last move determines life and death.

450
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,510
Trump cards don't count

451
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,000
when the game's not over.

452
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,910
Both trump cards didn't work.

453
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,150
What could my next move be?

454
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,910
Their process sounds too

455
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,380
seamless

456
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,740
and flawless,

457
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,400
like it's designed meticulously.

458
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,870
Don't you find it strange?

459
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,790
Pan Yue.

460
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,390
We're not so close that I'd risk it all for you.

461
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,350
For you,

462
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,340
I'll delay his appointment

463
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,550
by a day at most.

464
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,240
Any more

465
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,350
and I'd be in trouble too.

466
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,890
How about this?

467
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,350
Send the photo to the photo center of Binjiang Daily

468
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,020
and ask Mr. Morikawa to verify it.

469
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,470
He's my friend.

470
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,670
Fine, I'll listen to you.

471
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,020
The last resort.

472
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,790
The investigation's nearing its end.

473
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,580
I'll likely give you the results

474
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,780
by tomorrow morning.

475
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,910
So soon?

476
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,430
Thank you, Ma.

477
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,300
Don’t mention it.

478
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,170
I heard you were very thorough.

479
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,480
I really appreciate it.

480
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,030
Everyone in the Secret Service knows

481
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,990
that many are jealous of Zhuowen,

482
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,440
a rookie who's been performing

483
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,760
exceptionally well.

484
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,750
Yes.

485
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,949
Especially your old friend, Pan Yue.

486
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,679
The more thorough you are,

487
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,290
the more I feel at ease.

488
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,830
You flatter me, Ms. Guan.

489
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,900
If he's clean,

490
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,429
I wouldn't make up stories.

491
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,110
If there's a problem with him...

492
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,070
I understand.

493
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,440
You're clearing the mines for me.

494
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,139
You're welcome.

495
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,240
Call Zhuowen here.

496
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,690
Ms. Guan.

497
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,730
Looking for me?

498
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,510
Give it to Mr. Ma of the Inspection Section.

499
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,940
Isn't the investigation over?

500
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,390
I'm not indebted to him.

501
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,460
Why should I thank him?

502
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,660
Of course you should.

503
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,470
If you bribed him at the start,

504
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,270
it means you're guilty.

505
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,350
But after you're cleared of suspicions?

506
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,750
You'd be making a friend.

507
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,960
I see.

508
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,310
I'm really stupid.

509
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,670
Put it this way.

510
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,820
If you gave them gold bars at the start, you'd be executed.

511
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,950
Those from the Inspection Section

512
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,850
are nasty.

513
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,430
Always find out beforehand if they want money

514
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,110
or to set up a trap.

515
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,770
I still can't use your money.

516
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,290
I have savings.

517
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,670
You do?

518
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,310
How long have you been working?

519
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,640
Where will you get three gold bars?

520
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,930
I was a railway policeman.

521
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,630
I've done my fair share

522
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,700
of fleecing others

523
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,410
and have performance shares.

524
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,810
It's up to you to gift them to him or not.

525
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,470
Close the door when you leave.

526
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,740
Get an expert

527
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,330
at the photo center of Binjiang Daily

528
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,190
to check if

529
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,110
this family photo's real or not.

530
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,820
Didn't he just come back?

531
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,190
Where's he off to again?

532
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
Something's off.

533
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,230
Sir, may I help you?

534
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,470
[Binjiang Daily]

535
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,390
Gentlemen.

536
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,290
We're with him.

537
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,270
Hello, I'm looking for Mr. Morikawa.

538
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,120
Come in.

539
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,140
Please help us

540
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,270
verify if this photo

541
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,930
has been tampered with.

542
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,990
What's this supposed to mean?
