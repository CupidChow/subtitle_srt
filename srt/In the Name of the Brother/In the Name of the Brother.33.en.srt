00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,790
You must take one today.

193
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:07,980
Look at this.

194
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,630
This one, right?

195
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,430
Boss.

196
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,680
How many of this hat do you have?

197
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,790
You have good taste.

198
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,990
It's our bestseller.

199
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,420
In our warehouse...

200
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,080
Sir, how many do you want?

201
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,150
I want 100.

202
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,790
I'll have to

203
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,390
transfer from other stores.

204
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,250
Sir.

205
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,640
Sir.

206
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,490
I can mix different kinds to make 100.

207
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,730
I only want that kind.

208
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,160
Zhuowen took the girl

209
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,550
to the boutique on Central Street.

210
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,160
After sending her home,

211
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,190
he went to Kwantung Army's Staff HQ.

212
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,960
Nothing unusual except refueling once.

213
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,580
What's the boutique called?

214
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,620
[Shengxifu Hat Store]

215
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,110
Relax.

216
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,040
I'll send it to you once it's all in.

217
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,520
We have the supply.

218
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,620
Don't worry about that.

219
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,110
Answer my questions.

220
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,110
What does he mean

221
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,230
by supply?

222
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,090
Someone came this morning

223
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,750
to order 100 gray hats.

224
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,750
Who would order 100 hats at a time?

225
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,510
Well...

226
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,070
I really don't know.

227
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,780
When's he coming to pick it up?

228
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,010
He wants me to send it to him.

229
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,830
Where to?

230
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,940
The train station's duty room.

231
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,670
What's the receiver's name?

232
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't remember.

233
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,900
I need to check the delivery list.

234
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,910
Please check it

235
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,380
for me.

236
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,180
Sir, look.

237
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,320
This one's just been launched.

238
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,790
Madam, look here.

239
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,000
Look at this one. Yes.

240
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,960
Look at this one.

241
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,370
It sells very well.

242
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,670
It's the only one left.

243
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,150
Look around.

244
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,260
Look around.

245
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
Feel free to try it on.

246
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:56,610
Miss.

247
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,020
That hat's beautiful.

248
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
It suits you best.

249
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,900
Sorry to keep you waiting.

250
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,020
I'll help you with the bill.

251
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,380
This way. Here.

252
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,030
Sure, no problem. Have a seat.

253
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,990
What do you think, sir?

254
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,430
It's the only one left.

255
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,990
Only three left in this season.

256
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,790
All sold out.

257
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,950
I'll give you the best price.

258
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,550
Don't tell others.

259
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,740
50% off. Here.

260
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,140
This hat's

261
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,480
already discounted.

262
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,830
Aren't you recuperating in the hospital?

263
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,770
You still can't stop?

264
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,700
I heard you

265
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,040
bought a Shengxifu hat.

266
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,820
Which tattletale

267
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,210
informed you?

268
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,640
Are there secrets in the Secret Service?

269
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,630
I'm just afraid Zhuowen will...

270
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,750
Let me guess who you're talking to.

271
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,560
Hu Bin?

272
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,320
Hello?

273
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,950
Pan?

274
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,620
Say something! Hello?

275
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,900
Ms. Guan.

276
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,490
You're finally here.

277
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,110
Mr. Pan.

278
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,070
You're not the Zhuge Liang

279
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,270
to my Liu Bei.

280
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,200
I'll only ask you to get discharged this once.

281
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,920
I admit

282
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,030
I was hasty when I got you

283
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,720
hospitalized.

284
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,030
I apologize.

285
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,350
So I'm personally

286
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,760
here to invite you back.

287
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,750
Since you said so,

288
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,540
I have to be frank.

289
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,030
Since I moved in,

290
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,950
I've never thought of leaving.

291
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,860
Because deep down,

292
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,410
I can't get over it.

293
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,480
Some things still

294
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,110
aren't clarified.

295
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,660
Can they be?

296
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,350
As long as I'm the Secret Service's section chief,

297
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,650
none of you three can leave me.

298
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,860
Is that clear enough?

299
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,700
Yes.

300
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,940
It's a personal invitation.

301
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,230
I won't refuse it.

302
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,780
I dare not refuse it.

303
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,340
How about

304
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,380
you give me some more time?

305
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,030
It's up to you.

306
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,830
Hu Bin, that bastard.

307
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,310
He can't keep a secret.

308
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,290
When you get in the car, answer all questions.

309
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,830
I'm sure I don't have his name.

310
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,660
He called to tell me

311
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,640
to give it out to the passengers

312
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,120
who get off the nearest train.

313
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,890
He said it's a form of walking advertisement.

314
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,000
He didn't answer

315
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,360
further questions.

316
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,510
What time

317
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,820
are you giving the hats out?

318
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,220
He didn't say.

319
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
He just asked me to wait for his call.

320
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,030
That's all

321
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,870
I know.

322
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,810
Keep your mouth shut when you go back.

323
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,130
-About today...
-Tell no one.

324
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,030
Wu.

325
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,200
I’ve checked. Other than

326
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,110
taking petty advantages

327
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,530
and carrying some contraband,

328
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,790
Wang Tinggui's clean.

329
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,190
Don't go back just yet.

330
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,290
Wu, stay here and watch Wang Tinggui.

331
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,360
Wait for my news.

332
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:02,940
Yes.

333
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,350
What if the communists got wind of it

334
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
and changed routes?

335
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,720
Then they

336
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,410
wouldn't have bought 100 hats.

337
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,680
He must be in the train.

338
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,090
Here are the control points of the station and each platform.

339
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,710
Your efforts' have come in handy.

340
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,990
Right, about the classes,

341
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,610
Jin has his own ideas.

342
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,970
It should be your turn.

343
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,310
No.

344
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,210
Please spare me.

345
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,930
I can make arrests,

346
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,900
but words give me headaches.

347
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,290
Fine.

348
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,810
Keep this on the down low.

349
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,100
Take action when you've got to a quiet place.

350
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,780
Got it.

351
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,150
No one can escape.

352
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,290
Peanuts and seeds.

353
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,760
Peanuts and seeds, anyone?

354
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,110
Peanuts and seeds.

355
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,130
Your ID.

356
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,770
[From Yichun to Harbin]

357
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,920
Your name's Li Shutang?

358
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,630
Yes.

359
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,010
Take your luggage and come with us.

360
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,410
What did I do?

361
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,020
How old's your child?

362
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,260
How old?

363
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,850
How old's your child?

364
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,120
So young?

365
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,660
And you?

366
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Song Zhuowen.

367
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:30,570
Mr. Asano.

368
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,800
What brings you here?

369
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,060
Did you replace Mr. Hu?

370
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,700
I'm not sure.

371
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,790
Mr. Jin told me to come.

372
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,330
How is Mr. Hu?

373
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,350
He separates his work and personal life.

374
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,950
He's started working today.

375
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,460
Okay.

376
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,060
Wait, what did I do?

377
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,950
I did nothing.

378
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,440
Why did you arrest me?

379
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,770
For smuggling rice

380
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,000
and selling western medicine.

381
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,380
Six months' jail time at least.

Quit acting.

385
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,590

No, don't go to Harbin.

390
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,630
I really didn't do anything.

We'll take action once they come out.

398
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,310
Since humans abandoned pastoral life,

399
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,430
they found fixed places to live in.

400
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,270
After agriculture started,

401
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,960
people began accumulating property.

402
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,390
To ensure the safety of life and property,

403
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,450
they have to set up defenses.

404
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,960
Many years ago,

405
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,390
the term "police" didn't exist in this developed country,

406
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,380
but the concept had been put in place.

407
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,590
Police.

Hello, is it Qiao Liang?

410
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,560
It's me.

00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,180
Hello.

412
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,510
Is it Wang Tinggui?

413
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,030
Yes.

414
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,150
Send out the hats now.

415
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,910
Now.

416
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,770
Okay.

417
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,770
He wants me to send out the hats now.

418
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,960
Should I do it?

419
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,130
Ms. Guan, that man called.

420
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,090
He wants the hats sent out now.

421
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:14,800
Should I?

422
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,380
Of course not.

423
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,650
When the train gets in

424
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,800
and all passengers have alighted,

425
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,560
check the carriages one by one.

426

Go.

Your hat's been exposed.

438
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,700

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,750
Do you need help?

441
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,790
I've opened it.

What's wrong?

00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,950
Why did you slap me?

444
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,580
Only Zhuowen knows my identity as Li Shutang.

445
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,380
I knew I was exposed on the train.

446
