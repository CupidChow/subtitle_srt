That's what they all said.

16

They said you're a traitor.

Female student?

40
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,970

There's no follicle at the root of this hair. It's a wig.

Say it as many times as you're told.

160

One of them was tall and thin, while the other was very short.

162

-Wait.

172
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,140

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,380
Wen.

191
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,070
I know who killed Li Dongju.

192
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,390
Who?

193
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,880
It’s Mr. Ning.

194
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,260
This is a threat.

195
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,720
This time, it's Li Dongju.

196
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,350
It will be me next time.

197
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,270
I can't run away.

198
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,850
So he's also responsible for

199
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,450
the bombing at the hospital?

200
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,020
How long have you known each other?

201
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,070
Almost a year.

202
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you know where he lives?

203
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,910
No.

204
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,160
We don't see each other often.

205
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,100
He's always the one who finds me.

206
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,260
Think about it.

207
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,240
Where do you meet each other every time?

208
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,360
Every time he asked me out,

209
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,960
we would meet at the cafe near bus no. 19's stop.

210
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,250
In order to find him,

211
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,460
I even went to ride bus no. 19 previously,

212
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,950
but I didn't find anything.

213
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,810
Does he have any unique features?

214
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,150
What does he wear every time he meets you?

215
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,470
Does he have any moles or marks on his body?

216
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,870
He always wears a long tunic

217
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,730
and holds a few books in his hand,

218
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,260
just like a teacher at school.

219
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,390
So cautious.

220
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,900
We've known each other for almost a year, and he still wears the same clothes every time.

221
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,110
And...

222
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,070
He's got peeling skin on his hands.

223
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,270
It's serious.

224
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,300
His skin is patchy.

225
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,780
And...

226
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,770
And...

227
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,470
That's all I can think of.

228
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,640
What should I do?

229
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:52,810
Will he...

230
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,740
Don't be afraid.

231
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,800
The police is hunting him down.

232
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,000
He has no time for you.

233
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,500
The first clue is clear.

234
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,550
Along the route of bus no. 19.

235
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,600
The second,

236
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,850
this neighborhood that bus no. 19 passes through,

237
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,870
along with this neighborhood,

238
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,470
had a power outage on the night of the 14th.

239
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,120
The three of them smelled like wax oil

240
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,110
because the power went out and they lit candles.

241
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,910
Thirdly,

242
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,160
these streets

243
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,750
are the distribution centre for chemical shops in Harbin.

244
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,390
All three of them had severe peeling on their hands.

245
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,590
It's the result of having these chemicals

246
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,870
lying around for years.

247
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,300
Zhuowen, don't jump to conclusions.

248
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,950
I've reported this to the organization.

249
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,150
The evidence you mentioned, such as bus no. 19,

250
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,500
the blackout areas,

251
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,910
or the peeling hands,

252
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,240
is still too far-fetched

253
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,430
for us to conclude just based on

254
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,630
these independent clues.

255
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm not anxious.

256
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,830
They are the anxious ones.

257
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,490
They've threatened Guan Kai.

258
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,990
Why do you trust him so much?

259
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,670
How many words of his words are true,

260
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,870
and how many are fake?

261
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,900
What's more, don't you know how big

262
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,940
the area is if you consider

263
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,710
the route of bus no. 19

264
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,540
and the blackout areas?

265
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,100
No, Guan Kai is not a kid.

266
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,470
He has a clear judgement of his situation.

267
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,940
So, he knew clearly that he had to blow up the hospital

268
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,700
and his sister?

269
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,349
He knew!

270
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,780
From the start, the National Bureau's objective

271
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,910
was to kill Guan Xue.

272
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,030
But he regretted it.

273
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,670
Fine.

274
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,869
Let me ask you.

275
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,060
Our comrades have always questioned

276
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,329
why you saved Guan Xue.

277
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,060
Can you justify that?

278
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,829
What's the big deal?

279
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,190
Duan is gone.

280
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,230
We don't know if Dr. Shi is still alive.

281
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,820
Wei died in your arms.

282
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,390
How many comrades

283
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,190
have died on Guan Xue's hands?

284
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,270
You could have killed her through the National Bureau.

285
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,130
Why are you still protecting her?

286
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,550
Can you tell me

287
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,260
which comrade has these doubts?

288
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,860
I'll talk to him face to face.

289
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,150
Yes.

290
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,520
I had countless chances to kill Guan Xue.

291
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,340
In the face of her suspicion and doubts,

292
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,300
I've had my moments where I couldn't make things up.

293
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,560
It's not that I haven't thought about it.

294
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,720
But now's not the time.

295
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,270
You told me before

296
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,480
who Guan Xue was.

297
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,130
I didn't understand at that time.

298
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,550
But now my mind has changed.

299
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,970
I know my brother is right.

300
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,620
Our main enemy now is the Japanese.

301
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,080
But I'm not like my brother.

302
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,390
He's content with

303
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,720
having no clear winner.

304
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,190
I just hope everything we do

305
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,940
will free the Eastern provinces

306
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,340
from Japanese slavery as soon as possible.

307
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,050
Fine.

308
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,830
I'll report your thoughts

309
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,030
to the organization.

310
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,860
Speaking of which, Qian,

311
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,860
I have an even bolder idea.

312
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,010
But I don't know what to do.

313
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,590
Go ahead.

about Dongning Fortress

that Zhuowu secretly took at Mr. Asano's ball?

317
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,550
What would Mr. Asano and Guan Xue think

318
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,880
if these documents were

319
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,530
passed through the hands of the National Bureau,

320
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,790
and were shown to them?

Yes, it's made in Japan.

It's just expensive.

How expensive is it?

Even if we dispatch the garrison,

377
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,170
it's not going to be easy to reel the net in.

378
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,810
I never believed in luck.

379
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,140
What do you think?

380
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,800
There's an expert in the Secret Service.

381
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,430
He must have caught our scent,

382
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,180
and followed us all the way to the shop.

383
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,420
But why didn't they seal off the front and back streets,

384
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,350
when they are already here at our doorstep?

385
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,390
Doesn't he want to actually arrest us?

386
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,540
Tell me.

387
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,980
Sir.

388
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,470
What's wrong?

389
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,910
Look.

390
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,710
Sir.

391
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,480
[Stay away from the institute]

392
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,630
I fabricated the paper that was thrown into the fire.

393
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,950
The content on it

394
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,160
was secretly taken by Zhuowu from Asano Diago's house.

395
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,270
This is the only clue about Dongning Fortress.

396
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,890
Fortunately,

397
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,120
Xu completed the mission perfectly.

398
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,710
He stole the gun,

399
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,150
let the suspect escape in advance,

400
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,820
and left a reasonable trail

401
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,640
for Hu Bin to find.

402
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,970
I hope this

403
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,590
will make Asano Diago

404
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,720
reveal more useful information to us.

405
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,620
Come in.

406
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,550
Sorry to bother you.

407
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:28,110
[Dongning Fortress]

408
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,750
Where did you get this?

409
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,670
Song Zhuowen took it out from the charcoal pot.

410
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,270
What do the bombing suspects

411
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,610
have in their hand?

412
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,380
Do all you can to arrest the criminal.

413
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,230
Tell me.

414
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,680
What does it mean to do all you can?

415
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,850
To use all of my manpower,

416
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,380
and to devote all of my time.

417
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,220
You're wrong.

418
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,460
If you have done all you could

419
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,230
but you still don't catch him,

420
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,100
I'll take all of you as criminals instead.

421
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,860
Leave.

422
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,110
Excuse me.

423
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,300
We conquered Fuzhou.

424
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,270
We took down Guilin.

425
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,390
We took down Ba Maw Kun Thee Pin in Burma.

426
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,310
Why can't we...

427
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,910
hold our own fort?

428
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,360
The security of Dongning Fortress

429
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,410
is the key to the success of our highest mission.

430
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,820
Why?

431
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,220
Why?

432
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,170
Why can't I protect it?

433
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,310
Why?

434
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,310
Why?

435
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,780
Why?

436
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,830
Why?

437
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,710
Why?

438
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,310
Why?

439
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:27,230
How could this be?

440
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,750
Section Chief!

441
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:34,430
I also want to know.

442
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,590
What did you say?

443
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,450
What did you say?

444
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,110
I also want to know why!

445
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,030
The contents on that piece of paper are regarding

446
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,090
the confidentiality measures for Dongning Fortress.

447
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,150
Mr. Asano personally wrote it,

448
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,630
and it has been barely a week

449
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,830
since it was disseminated to each unit.

450
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,290
So what does that tell us?

451
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,130
It means there's a spy inside the fortress

452
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,790
This discovery

453
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,590
is more valuable catching those

454
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,650
bombing suspects.

455
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
You did a good job.

456
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,270
Since we discovered it,

457
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,470
it should be us Secret Service

458
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,930
who enters the fortress for investigation.

459
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,590
That way we get more credit.

460
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,910
Once the intelligence department shows up,

461
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,840
there's a chance of spooking them.

462
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,610
And the Japanese won't let us in

463
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,680
to a place like Dongning Fortress.

464
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,500
How can we catch the spy then?

465
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,260
Let me try yours.

466
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:54,980
Okay.

467
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,720
Mr. Asano is worried that

468
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,720
those hiding inside Dongning Fortress are Japanese themselves.

469
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,210
At least he suspects that they are members of the Anti-war alliance.

470
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,130
So, under the premise of the highest confidentiality,

471
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,930
he's going to check every officer's handwriting.

472
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,570
Cheer up.

473
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,390
At least regarding the serial bombing incident,

474
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,600
we as Secret Service have passed the task.

475
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,800
We always get the most thankless tasks.

476
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,710
When it comes to claiming credit,

477
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,510
it's okay to have have your fill,

478
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,230
but it's not good to strain yourself.

479
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,470
Also,

480
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,950
when the envoys and handwriting experts from Hsinking

481
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,150
arrives in Harbin,

482
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,620
the Secret Service is to escort them

483
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,860
until they get on the plane to Dongning Fortress.

484
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,170
Are you done?

485
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,330
You're not eating?

486
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,790
Mr. Asano is very satisfied with your discovery.

487
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,600
So I'm going to assign you

488
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,460
to sort out the task of escorting.

489
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,620
Wen.

490
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,950
Why are you here?

491
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,370
-Your sister… She…
-I’m here for you.

492
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,420
Mr. Ning hasn’t come to me for days now.

493
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,080
Perhaps...

494
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,540
I don't think he'll show up again.

495
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,040
What do you mean?

496
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,610
I mean...

497
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,580
At your age, apart from studying,

498
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,310
you should lead a quieter life.

499
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,860
Transfer to another school.

500
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,020
Why?

501
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,150
They blamed Li Dongju's death on me.

502
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,550
What's the point of leaving now? To escape?

503
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,870
You're not escaping.

504
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,430
You're just avoiding it.

505
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,690
What's there to avoid?

506
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,970
I'm not afraid.

507
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,040
I know you don't need to be afraid.

508
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,930
But your sister is afraid.

509
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,500
If you continue

510
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,700
to be stubborn on these things,

511
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,560
you'll hurt others and yourself.

512
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,590
If I were you,

513
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,239
I would be grateful for what your sister did for you.

514
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,900
Really.

515
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,270
Go home.

516
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,719
Kai agreed to transfer?

517
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,010
Yeah! You decide the new school.

518
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,880
I want him to go to the National University.

519
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,949
What do you think?

520
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,760
The one run by Japanese?

521
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,659
Those who go there are either rich or noble.

522
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,920
The Prime Minister's child is there too, right?

523
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,870
Is that good or not?

524
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,020
Given Kai's personality,

525
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
does he fit into that circle?

526
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,330
That circle will be of great use in the future.

527
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,290
You should discuss this with him.

528
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,180
That's how the world works.

529
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,380
Your class determines your destiny.

530
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:17,820
Here.

531
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,080
It's almost time.

532
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,010
I have to go back.

533
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,200
Madam,

534
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,810
can you help me get a transfer quota too?

535
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,000
For whom?

536
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,550
The girl who lives in your house?

537
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,920
Did she bring it up to you?

538
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,230
Sort of.

539
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,400
Her situation at school is harder than Kai's.

540
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,750
Sure.

541
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,260
Since you asked,

542
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,430
it's not that hard to do this favour

543
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,200
as long as you appreciate it.

544
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,520
Okay, thank you.

545
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,640
Pushing his luck,

546
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,170
trying to climb all over me.

547
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,680
What are you doing?

548
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,600
The war is tense.

549
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,800
All of us have to hand in some metal, including students.

550
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,620
It counts as a final grade for one course.

551
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,370
You should have told me earlier.

552
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,770
There's a couple of iron bars in the office.

553
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:24,890
Sister.

554
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,820
What should we do

555
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,870
if the Japanese are defeated?

556
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,110
Who killed Li Dongju?

557
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,310
What did she do?

558
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,150
I don't know.

559
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,190
No, you do!

560
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,070
You know everything.

561
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,450
Although I don't like her,

562
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,070
I know she's not a bad person.

563
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,190
She shouldn't have died.

564
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,620
Yes.

565
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,230
You're right.

566
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
She was innocent.

567
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,360
If... if I don't transfer to another school,

568
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,510
I'll end up like her?

569
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,110
I'll be in trouble too?

570
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,550
You think too much.

571
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,380
What if I don't transfer?

572
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,940
You should know

573
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,460
who arranged this.

574
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,300
I know.

575
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,940
Guan Kai's sister.

576
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,560
I've seen her.

577
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,350
Go to the teachers' office

578
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,190
and report your name.

579
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,210
They'll get it done.

580
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,200
If you have any problems,

581
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,800
you can contact me directly.

582
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,700
Thank you,

583
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,670
Zhuowen.

584
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,640
Go.

585
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,760
Although you know everything,

586
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,420
I still have to remind you that

587
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,330
you only have one pair of eyes.

588
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,720
There's always something you can't see.

589
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,650
There's snot on your hand.

590
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,960
Wipe it.
