[Episode 12]

4
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,740
Why isn't she coming out?

5
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,020
Kai, I'm Bin.

6
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,150
Open the door!

7
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,990
I know you're inside.

8
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,670
I picked up something at the cafe.

9
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,470
I am guessing it should be yours.

10
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,070
Bin!

11
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,470
Give it back to me!

12
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,400
Give it to me!

13
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,880
Give it to me!

14
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,390
What is it?

15
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,540
Is this it?

16
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,460
Give it to me!

17
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,860
So, this is yours?

18
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,110
Don't push me.

19
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,670
I'll shoot.

20
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,940
Don't shoot your mouth off, little brat.

21
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,430
This gun

22
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,070
is best shot at close range.

23
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,670
What are you up to?

24
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,330
What am I up to? I'm trying to help you.

25
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,900
Leave the gun with me.

26
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,360
The less you know about the rest, the better.

27
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,060
Why are you helping me?

28
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,120
Because I like your sister.

29
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,870
You have to call me brother-in-law sooner or later.

30
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,930
How can I not help my brother-in-law?

31
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,830
I don't understand what you're saying.

32
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,490
You don't understand?

33
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,530
You know nothing.

34
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,170
I can't leave the gun with you.

35
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,810
Otherwise, my sister won't let me go.

36
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,510
When you killed the Japanese

37
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,510
with this gun last night,

38
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,550
why didn't you think about whether your sister would let you go?

39
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,210
Keep this matter to yourself.

40
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,730
Why did you close the door?

41
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,430
Cut the crap.

42
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,950
Where is the test report?

43
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,920
Give it to me.

44
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,190
You should really trust Kai.

45
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,350
This old man

46
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,560
is the mentor of the current chief of the lab.

47
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,660
He said unless a professional cleaning method was used,

48
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,920
otherwise this gun must not have been fired for a long time.

49
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,670
You didn't get a hold on my weakness.

50
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,030
Are you disappointed?

51
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,560
Tell me.

52
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,640
What's your condition?

53
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,430
As I've always said,

54
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,210
let's watch a movie together.

55
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,830
Like I've also said,

56
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,040
I haven't had much time lately.

57
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,990
Fine.

58
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,350
I'll wait.

59
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,220
You gave Kai this gun.

60
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,410
At night, in front of the cafe,

61
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,390
a Japanese soldier was shot to death.

62
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,140
You and your classmates are on the suspect list,

63
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,610
but only you have a gun.

64
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,809
What do you want me to think?

65
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,750
Why did you go to the cafe?

66
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,970
My classmates and I were discussing the rehearsal of the play.

67
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,550
Look at me.

68
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,980
I really didn't do it.

69
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,530
Don't do anything stupid.

70
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,710
If anything happens,

71
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,310
I'll be doomed with you.

72
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,000
Eat.

73
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,510
Take those useless posters off.

74
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,590
And that one.

75
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,450
Who are you hanging it at home for?

76
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,590
Why don't you learn some real skills at school?

77
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,390
Got it.

78
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,670
Zhuowen.

79
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,520
You're still here.

80
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,720
I came back to get something.

81
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,400
You came back at a bad timing.

82
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,210
Mr. Asano just called

83
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,670
and asked me to sort out the files from the past two years.

84
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,780
He said he wanted it tomorrow,

85
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,230
but I'm short-handed.

86
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,710
Besides,

87
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,330
I need to find someone whom I can trust.

88
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,290
Come work overtime with me.

89
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,540
Don't worry.

90
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,310
This place is much safer than the Japanese's villa.

91
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,760
Investigations have become stricter recently.

92
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,010
We should be careful.

93
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,510
Investigate?

94
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,810
You Secret Service agents are also now in charge of this business?

95
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,770
Shut up.

96
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,780
Don't ask about anything else.

97
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,470
The opium is very strong this time.

98
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,670
I'm counting on you to take care of my business from now on.

99
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,260
Same rules, same price.

100
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,190
Don't be afraid.

101
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,140
I don't want your money or your life.

102
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,670
I'm only interested in that Mr. Ding.

103
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,120
Where are you going?

104
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,080
I'm just getting a stretch.

105
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,700
It's already two o'clock.

106
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,670
Go to bed early.

107
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,320
Leave the rest to us.

108
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,200
It's okay.

109
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,270
I think we'll probably have to work for another few hours.

110
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,470
Let's do it together.

111
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,840
Your important task

112
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,740
is to remind Madam

113
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,000
to read these first tomorrow morning.

114
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,530
Tell her that Mr. Asano is waiting for it.

115
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,910
Send it over to him as soon as she's done.

116
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,900
Hurry back.

117
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,360
The traffic line is back up.

118
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,430
Remember, at No. 72 Daoyao Road,

119
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,910
someone will pick you up from there.

120
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,110
You just have to follow him.

121
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,230
He'll get you out of here.

122
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,140
Got it.

123
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,680
Also, I have another favor to ask you.

124
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,910
Keep an eye out for someone on your way.

125
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,780
His name is Quanzi, a clerk in my shop.

126
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,110
He's been out for a long time.

127
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:57,950
But up till today,

128
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,410
he hasn't written any letters to his family.

129
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,390
How old is he?

130
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,630
He's a big boy.

131
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,950
He haven't removed the tiger lock on his neck.

132
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,540
Got it.

133
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,760
Come on, you repeat that.

134
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,620
No. 72 Daoyao Road.

135
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,670
Someone'll be waiting for me to go with him.

136
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,270
He's arranged for me to be evacuated.

137
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,150
And then, on my way,

138
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,680
I need to keep a lookout for a boy named Quanzi.

139
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
You must remember

140
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,150
the first rule of underground work.

141
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,210
Follow orders and obey commands.

142
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,120
Whether or not you can shoot,

143
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,790
who and when you can shoot,

144
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,890
you'll have to follow orders.

145
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,130
Qian,

146
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,380
let me ask you.

147
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,630
If I leave, will I ever see my brother again?

148
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,270
Why not?

149
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,750
Once we've defeated the Japanese,

150
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,070
it will be our world.

151
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,980
Pass on a message to him for me.

152
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,470
Tell him that although I'm the eldest son,

153
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,830
I've been

154
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,860
putting my life on the line everyday.

155
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,320
Ask him to find a wife soon.

156
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,330
Don't let the Song family die out.

157
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,580
Why don't you tell him yourself?

158
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,940
Didn't you say it just now?

159
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,470
As members of the organization,

160
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,160
we have to obey orders and be disciplined.

161
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,670
Just tell him it's the organization's wishes.

162
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,230
Fine.

163
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,050
Can you represent the organization?

164
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,240
Of course.

165
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,860
I have a favor to ask of you too.

166
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,470
Go ahead.

167
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,530
If something really happens,

168
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,550
ask Zhuowen to leave.

169
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,280
Don't try to be a hero.

170
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,000
Aren't we both working for the organisation?

171
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,070
If only one can survive from the Song family,

172
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,950
it must be him.

173
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,010
Do you understand what I mean?

174
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,120
Yes.

175
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,170
Take this bag with you.

176
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,540
No, you have it.

177
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,180
Take it.

178
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,160
It's enough.

179
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,070
Show me your ticket.

180
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,390
Show me your ticket.

181
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,280
Show me your ticket.

182
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,230
Sir, I really don't have tickets.

183
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,760
Just let me sell something.

184
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,790
Sir, please.

185
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,339
Leave now.

186
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,099
Sir!

187
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,990
So many?

188
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:29,870
Yes.

189
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,670
We weren't done until 2 a.m.

190
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,570
Unit Chief Pan said Mr. Asano wants to see it by today morning.

191
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,470
I'm on my way out,

192
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,560
so I'll drop it off.

193
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,000
Let me take it to your car.

194
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,600
No need.

195
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,390
I didn't expect

196
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,980
there are still remnants of the Squirrel-encoded telegram.

197
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,030
Now, I just need to find the code book

198
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,340
to decipher the intel.

199
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,500
Modern Hotel,

200
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,990
grey scarf,

201
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,850
at 1 p.m. on the 12th.

202
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,470
Modern Hotel.

203
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,190
Okay.

204
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,650
The first table on the right as you enter.

205
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,190
Hello, Sir. How many of you?

206
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,890
Two of us.

207
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,600
Can you sit over there?

208
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,400
There's no one here.

209
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,100
Sorry, Sir.

210
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,970
This seat is already taken.

211
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,200
He went to the bathroom.

212
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,260
He'll be back soon.

213
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,270
Then you get him a new table.

214
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,160
That won't be nice.

215
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,270
Go.

216
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:53,900
Okay.

217
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,660
[Yuanxing Apartments]

218
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,910
Go to Modern Hotel.

219
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,910
A man wearing a white scarf

220
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,410
will be meeting us.

221
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,070
Sir.

222
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,920
This is my seat.

223
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,430
This is a hotel.

224
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,900
Only the cashier's booth is fixed.

225
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,450
Sir, can you be reasonable?

226
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,430
If you are willing,

227
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,430
you can come back when

228
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm done eating with my friend.

229
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,680
Don't bother me while I am placing my order.

230
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,620
Okay.

231
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,510
Go in first.

232
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,340
Go find that person.

233
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,090
Stay alert.

234
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,810
I'll be right in.

235
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,070
Did you see my scarf? It's grey.

236
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,860
No.

237
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,000
Where is the scarf?

238
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,070
Sir.

239
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:51,970
My friend,

240
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,230
can you sell me your scarf?

241
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,510
My neck is cold,

242
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,080
but I lost my scarf again.

243
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,410
I need it urgently.

244
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,630
Fine.

245
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,480
-Well…
-I’ll pay you.

246
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,430
Please hold on.

247
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,240
I'll sell it to you when I no longer need it next year.

248
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,790
Okay?

249
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,890
No, I'll pay you.

250
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,880
Sir.

251
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,500
Do you have any grey scarves?

252
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,110
I don't have any grey's.

253
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,510
Take a look at the others.

254
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,880
Here. Keep the change.

255
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,390
Okay.

256
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,910
Why is Qian here?

257
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,210
Someone from the Secret Service just went in.

258
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,540
Qian is already inside.

259
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,310
We're in big trouble.

260
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,020
Wei, get in the car.

261
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,460
Why?

262
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,250
Why are we running?

263
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,510
Harbin is our territory.

264
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,410
We are not anti-Japanese either.

265
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,380
We...

266
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,930
picked up the wrong person.

267
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,990
Move.

268
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,590
How are you?

269
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,260
I'm fine.

270
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,700
You guys leave now.

271
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,420
When the police come, no one can leave then.

272
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,110
Don't worry.

273
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,880
I will get you out of here, comrade.

274
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,140
Come.

275
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:02,900
Come.

276
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,290
Come.

277
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,370
Slowly.

278
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,810
How could this happen?

279
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,200
Maybe Guan Xue went to Modern Hotel to meet her contact too.

280
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,760
They bumped into each other.

281
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,890
Could the special agent sent from the mountain

282
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,820
have fallen into Guan Xue's hands?

283
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,470
Possibly.

284
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,570
Comrade.

285
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,060
Comrade! Comrade! Comrade!

286
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,550
Comrade.

287
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,910
Comrade.

288
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,300
How did we get exposed?

289
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,290
Don't say a word.

290
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,270
We'll take you to the doctor.

291
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,180
Right now.

292
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,580
Comrade!

293
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,710
Comrade?

294
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,890
How did we get exposed?

295
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,120
Where are we going?

296
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,080
Not going back to the department?

297
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,790
Tiandi Street's safe house.

298
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,110
Move.

299
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,050
Hello?

300
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:22,930
Hello?

301
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,940
I'm Zhuowen.

302
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,880
Zhuowen.

303
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,620
I was careless.

304
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,200
We can't always go to the same restaurant.

305
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,060
I didn't think she'd be

306
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
going to Modern Hotel anytime soon.

307
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,190
It's my fault.

308
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,190
I've violated our basic principles.

309
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,790
There are always accidents.

310
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,670
She must have our liaison in her hands.

311
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,660
Any way to find out?

312
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,100
Give me the contact code.

313
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,610
It's too dangerous for you to contact him.

314
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,010
If he's really captured,

315
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,070
the enemy will definitely keep a close watch on him.

316
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,710
I know.

317
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,460
Let's play it by ear.

318
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,930
Give me the code.

319
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,780
Hello?

320
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,350
Are you from the post office?

321
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:21,730
Yes.

322
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,550
Who are you?

323
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,740
I'd like to ask

324
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,870
how much does it cost to send a registered letter

325
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,870
from Harbin to Qiqihar with stamps?

326
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,750
I don't know.

327
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,240
I'm from Yilan County Post Office.

328
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,390
I got it.

329
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,600
Don't worry.

330
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,020
You...

331
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,540
Tell me.

332
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,890
What's your mission in Harbin?

333
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,470
Hold him down.

334
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,510
Don't move.

335
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,720
Don't move!

336
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,870
Don't move.

337
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,830
Don't move!

338
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,230
I'll kill you if you move!

339
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,150
Don't move.

340
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,870
Don't move!

341
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,740
I'll kill you if you move.

342
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,880
Comrade.

343
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,840
Comrade.

344
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,450
Do you have any intel for me?

345
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,480
Come and get it.

346
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,920
Come and get it.

347
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,340
Come and get it?

348
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,600
Come and get the stuff.

349
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,870
What did the organization ask you to pick up?

350
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,710
Comrade.

351
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,140
What are you here for?

352
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:52,790
Comrade?

353
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:57,900
Take...

354
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,170
Do you have a blade?

355
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,880
I am going to take his bullet out.

356
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,530
Why didn't Guan Xue and the others come back?

357
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,480
They caught someone, but they're not bringing him back?

358
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,780
This is so strange.

359
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,050
Spirits.

360
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,719
Hold him down.

361
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,470
Sorry.

362
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,950
We're not exactly in the best of conditions here.

363
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,280
We don't have morphine.

364
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,330
This is much better...

365
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,030
than the conditions in the mountains.

366
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,920
Do you know of any other points of contact?

367
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,000
It's not safe here.

368
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,750
Comrade.

369
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:22,930
Contact...

370
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,390
Contact code.

371
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,260
The comrade who was supposed to liaise with you

372
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,400
has been sacrificed.

373
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,560
Did...

374
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,880
Did he die at Modern Hotel?

375
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,980
Hello?

376
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,960
Section Chief Guan.

377
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,620
Okay, I understand.

378
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,830
I'll do it right away.

379
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,630
Hello, I'm sorry.

380
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,840
I didn't hear you clearly just now.

381
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,380
Where are we setting up our defenses?

382
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,220
What defense?

383
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,280
Hello, I'm sorry.

384
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,530
I didn't hear you clearly. Where are we defending?

385
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,990
It's none of our business.

386
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,910
Since Guan Xue didn't bring the person back to the department,

387
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,370
she'll definitely find a place no one knows,

388
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,970
then give orders to the Operations Unit

389
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,320
and make them guard near her hideout.

390
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,530
I have to try,

391
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,270
one by one.

392
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,060
This is the only way.

393
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,540
Hello?

394
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,920
Hello, I'm sorry.

395
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,190
I didn't hear you clearly just now.

396
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,470
Where are we defending?

397
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,260
Defense?

398
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,620
What defense?

399
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,240
I asked you to call the cops.

400
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,000
What defense are you plotting?

401
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,270
Sorry.

402
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,340
Call the police?

403
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,950
Could you repeat that, please?

404
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,020
East of Trade Street,

405
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,120
and north of Tiandi Street.

406
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,320
If you can't hear me clearly, come to the office and ask me.

407
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,370
East of Trade Street,

408
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:02,980
and north of Tiandi Street.

409
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,980
I'll remember it.

410
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,280
North of Tiandi Street...

411
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,870
North of Tiandi Street.

412
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,590
Autumn pears!

413
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,880
Sweet and delicious autumn pears!

414
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,870
Autumn pears!

415
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Hey, pear seller.

416
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,720
Brother, do you want pears?

417
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,190
Do me a favor.

418
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,150
What do you mean?

419
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,590
We can't leave anymore.

420
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,720
We've been exposed.

421
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,520
Comrade!

422
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,370
Comrade!

423
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,500
We've been exposed.

424
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,230
We have to go.

425
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:49,880
Comrade.

426
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,590
You guys go first.

427
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,110
-Just leave me a gun.
-No.

428
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,070
Where is the contact point?

429
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,470
I have to inform them to evacuate.

430
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,440
Dozens of lives are at stake, comrade.

431
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,210
You...

432
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,310
Go to Sanyi Street.

433
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,910
Sanyi Street. And then?

434
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,730
Mr. Gong, please receive your registered letter from Yilan county.

435
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,780
And then?

436
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,200
Comrade!

437
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,350
Mr. Gong, please receive your registered letter from Yilan county.

438
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,960
Registered letter!

439
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,500
A registered letter from Yilan county!

440
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,030
Mr. Gong

441
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,610
please receive your registered letter from Yilan county.

442
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,550
I'm going out.

443
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,320
I'm going to get some blood,

444
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,330
and also bring a doctor over.

445
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,130
Remember,

446
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,720
no one can come in

447
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,230
except me.

448
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,010
Understood.

449
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:52,770
Absolutely no one.
