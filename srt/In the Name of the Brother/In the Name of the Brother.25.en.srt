[Episode 25]

4
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,550
Mr. Li.

5
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,470
Mr. Li!

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,490
Something bothering you?

7
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,710
Not really.

8
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,180
Just a bit disappointed.

9
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,180
I came all the way here

10
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,930
just to return in vain.

11
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,860
Mr. Li.

12
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,500
Who exactly are you?

13
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,110
With all due respect,

14
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,400
you don't know how to write the cursive script.

15
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,120
No.

16
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,280
You can't write calligraphy at all,

17
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:47,630
right?

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,690
You guessed right.

19
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,790
I'm Intelligence Unit Chief, Song Zhuowen.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,090
Mr. Li Cunliang

21
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,290
was injured in an assassination in Harbin,

22
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,720
so I had to come instead.

23
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,470
I still have a question.

24
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,230
Go ahead.

25
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,490
I'm sorry for staining your shirt.

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,010
But when I told the orderly

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,450
to wash it immediately,

28
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,790
do you recall how you reacted?

29
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,350
Stop it!

30
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,310
I'll do it myself.

31
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,079
Didn't you notice your invisible ink's missing?

32
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,740
I have it.

33
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,810
Save the explanations.

34
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,420
When we return to Harbin,

35
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,829
Mr. Asano will tell us what this is.

36
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,590
Don't move! Let him go!

37
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't move!

38
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,500
Turn around!

39
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,140
Turn around!

40
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,400
Fly to Harbin!

41
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,990
Turn around!

42
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,040
Tell me who you are!

43
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,870
Turn around!

44
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm still worth using.

45
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,530
We are all worthless.

46
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,420
No one can go back.

47
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,960
Song Zhuowen's death

48
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,910
means nothing to me!

49
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,020
It's your business to mourn him!

50
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,550
Go back to your office

51
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,230
or home!

52
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,270
Go cry and drink

53
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,200
and burn your Manchurian incense!

54
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,960
He's an outstanding person.

55
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,390
You said it yourself!

56
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,020
An outstanding person

57
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
should die for his faith.

58
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,460
That's the spirit of a warrior!

59
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,909
From the day he chose this job,

60
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,110
he'd already known

61
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,990
he could die anytime.

62
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,040
Song Zhuowen has faith.

63
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,220
Although he failed his mission

64
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,120
and didn't catch the mole!

65
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,500
Have you considered...

66
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,540
who should take up his position?

67
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580
Is it so urgent?

68
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,650
Of course!

69
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,330
The Secret Service can't go a day

70
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,860
without the Intelligence Unit Chief.

71
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,330
I'll make arrangements now.

72
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,170
Sorry to disturb you.

73
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,880
Write a report to the Army Headquarters.

74
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,980
Dongning Fortress is no longer safe.

75
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,790
Cut off all its connections with the outside world

76
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,690
as soon as possible.

77
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,480
Like a lizard cutting off its tail.

78
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,290
I have another opinion.

79
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,600
What?

80
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,360
The plane accident

81
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,340
was not due to bad weather

82
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,470
or a mechanical malfunction.

83
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Since the higher-ups think so,

84
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,380
let's not create more trouble.

85
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,179
Humans...

86
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,450
really can't defy fate.

87
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,960
Who would've thought

88
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,200
the heavens would take Song Zhuowen away?

89
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,930
It saved us a lot of trouble.

90
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:49,930
Here.

91
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,520
Put this on.

92
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,790
Put this on.

93
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,280
This feels like a special occasion.

94
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,610
So, buddy,

95
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,130
isn't it time you come back to work?

96
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,590
Only if Guan Xue comes to beg me sincerely.

97
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,130
Has she visited you once in the hospital?

98
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,370
No.

99
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,070
So I need either her or Mr. Asano

100
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,910
to come and beg me.

101
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,650
Don't be ridiculous.

102
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,240
Quit while you're ahead.

103
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,180
But I've not witnessed his death

104
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,730
myself.

105
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,420
Nobody has seen

106
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,750
Zhuowen's corpse with their own eyes.

107
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,980
What if he rises from the ashes?

108
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,110
Take that back!

109
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,250
Take that back!

110
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,610
Keep calm.

111
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,180
Wait a little more.

112
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,700
Here.

113
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,950
The latest news I got at noon

114
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,190
said the plane

115
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,380
crashed.

116
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,860
A Japanese search and rescue team

117
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,600
found it.

118
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,750
Because you're his brother

119
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,010
and his only family,

120
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,780
if there's anything you need,

121
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,760
we'll try our best to satisfy them.

122
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,180
Don't resent the organization.

123
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,940
Because back then...

124
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,620
When the organization

125
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,040
sent Zhuowen for this mission,

126
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,360
no one expected such a thing to happen.

127
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,450
I'm devastated by Zhuowen's sacrifice too!

128
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,790
There are also kids

129
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,910
younger than Zhuowen.

130
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,500
All of them, I...

131
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,950
I watched them grow up.

132
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,990
I watched them fall

133
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,870
and grow up.

134
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,750
And then they died one by one

135
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,420
in front of me.

136
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,990
Whenever I spend

137
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,630
even just

138
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,420
a few months

139
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,860
with some young kid,

140
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,510
it's as if I've known them

141
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,670
for a lifetime.

142
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,370
Enough, Qian.

143
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,140
You can't do anything.

144
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,800
I did do nothing.

145
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,580
Back then, I was the dumbest in our team.

146
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,380
Before Secretary Luo was arrested,

147
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,780
he put me in charge.

148
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,120
Many comrades questioned it.

149
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,140
How can he be in charge?

150
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,000
He says he can do anything

151
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,580
but fails at everything.

152
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,730
Who'd wanna entrust their life to him?

153
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,970
They all said that about me.

154
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,990
But I think they're right.

155
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,990
Later, Luo said this to them,

156
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,940
that as a member

157
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,400
of an underground party,

158
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,810
it's not about how strong you are,

159
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,030
but how long you can live.

160
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,070
How can one live long?

161
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,120
By abiding by the rules.

162
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,130
I disagree.

163
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,060
I think about

164
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,990
how to let the enemy die before us.

165
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,890
Yes.

166
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,150
Zhuowu, you don't know this,

167
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,830
but...

168
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,120
there are about a dozen of us old folks from Manchukuo

169
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,090
who are all considered as capable.

170
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600
But they all died.

171
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,840
I'm the only one left.

172
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,310
So, I brought young people in.

173
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,890
One batch

174
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,650
after another...

175
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,040
Now it's Zhuowen.

176
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,220
In the end, all of them died.

177
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,060
I'm the only one left again.

178
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Do you know

179
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,580
how that feels?

180
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,880
This life is worse than death.

181
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,570
But I have to persist.

182
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,340
I have to.

183
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,100
Enough.

184
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,430
Persist?

185
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,480
No wonder you live longer than them.

186
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,040
Qian, don't worry.

187
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,530
My brother won't die easily.

188
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,060
When we were young, the fortune teller said he was tough.

189
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,010
He can't be dead.

190
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,530
This is my oath.

191
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:34,900
First,

192
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,420
fight for communism for life.

193
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,310
Second,

194
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,990
put the Party's interests above all else.

195
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,570
Third,

196
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,480
abide by the Party's rules.

197
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,480
Four,

198
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,750
never fear difficulties and always work for the Party.

199
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,260
Five,

200
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,530
be a role model to everyone.

201
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,790
Six,

202
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,580
keep the Party's secrets.

203
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,590
Seven,

204
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,300
have faith in the Party.

205
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,840
Eight,

206
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,530
be undaunted

207
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,390
and forever loyal to the Party.

208
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,240
Yours sincerely,

209
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,840
Song Zhuowu.

210
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,330
Stop crying.

211
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,020
Hold it in.

212
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,570
He was just a tool.

213
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,550
Why are you crying?

214
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,710
If it weren't for Wen,

215
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,790
we would've died twice!

216
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,160
Fates are predestined!

217
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,330
It only proves I shouldn't die.

218
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,990
Xue!

219
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,700
Stop being so inhumane!

220
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:17,950
Sit down.

221
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,490
Let's eat.

222
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,200
Sit down and eat!

223
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,340
Kai.

224
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,910
Life's short.

225
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,310
Don't be swayed by emotions,

226
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,470
or you'll be controlled...

227
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,640
-Enough!
-You...

228
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,690
I, Guan Kai,

229
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,030
your brother,

230
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,190
am a stumbling block

231
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,840
who hinders your future!

232
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,780
Who is it?

233
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,610
Me!

234
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
Why are you here at this hour?

235
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,850
Something urgent!

236
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,160
The munitions warehouse was burgled?

237
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,030
We lost a lot of explosives.

238
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,710
It's enough to blow up the Police building.

239
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,380
Let Public Security take care of it.

240
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's handle Zhuowen's funeral first.

241
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,140
This is your urgent matter?

242
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,800
You're right.

243
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,030
This is my urgent matter.

244
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,660
You...

245
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,260
Hu Bin!

246
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,050
Hu Bin!

247
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,160
Hu Bin!

248
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,950
Hu Bin!

249
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,930
Don't move.

250
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,370
Don't move.

251
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,180
Why don't you point the gun at me?

252
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,000
It's fine if you insist.

253
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,290
Now you know I'm not to be messed with.

254
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,680
Touch me after I die.

255
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,410
If you kill me now,

256
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,060
you'll be in big trouble.

257
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,110
Song Zhuowen's dead.

258
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,510
Dead, you know?

259
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,660
It'll still never be your turn.

260
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,830
Hu Bin.

261
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,100
People hold grudges and forget acts of kindness.

262
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,760
I've been hard on you all these years.

263
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,230
I knew you'd do this someday.

264
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,320
I'm not a fool.

265
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,920
You're not.

266
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,980
I'm the fool.

267
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,100
How many times have I told you?

268
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,730
There's no shortcut here.

269
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,310
If you can't fly to the sky,

270
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,160
just crawl earnestly.

271
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,350
Don't worry about my situation.

272
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,250
Let's pretend this never happened.

273
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,450
You have until dawn to move on,

274
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,060
or I'll cut ties with you.

275
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,840
Prepare for Zhuowen's funeral.

276
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,150
Go.

277
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,500
You'll not realize your folly until the worst has happened.

278
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,860
I saw Hu Bin at the door.

279
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,690
Our organization in Fengtian

280
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,280
was severely destroyed by the Japanese and Manchukuo Secret Services.

281
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,560
Many comrades were arrested.

282
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,290
That line's concealed for now.

283
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,590
So we...

284
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,730
What do you mean by this?

285
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,610
Qian, leave me alone.

286
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,960
I can't be bothered about rules now.

287
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,660
As you said,

288
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,430
I've worked with you for only a few months,

289
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,430
not even a year.

290
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,980
I have to avenge Zhuowen no matter what.

291
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,500
Or it might be too late.

292
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,610
Are you the only one who wants revenge?

293
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,490
Is this your own grudge?

294
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,760
Does our grudge against the Japanese

295
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,770
and the grudge the 40 million Chinese hold

296
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,470
not count?

297
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,990
Does only your grudge count?

298
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,170
They have you.

299
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,430
Qian.

300
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,940
You're the most capable.

301
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,660
That's why you live long.

302
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,910
I'll avenge my brother,

303
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,350
and you can do so for the 40 million people.

304
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,870
What's that supposed to mean?

305
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,970
Are you determined to defy the organization

306
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,260
and do this?

307
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,920
Qian, don't pressure me with the organization!

308
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,530
I'm Zhuowu!

309
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,150
Look carefully!

310
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,550
I'm not Zhuowen!

311
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,680
I only have one brother.

312
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,710
You still have a son.

313
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,510
Imagine if I used the organization

314
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,120
to pressure you when your son's dead!

315
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,240
My son's dead.

316
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,910
Really?

317
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,120
We were on a mission.

318
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,460
It involved Zhuowen's safety.

319
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,260
They just told me.

320
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,650
I was the last to know.

321
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,120
[Desheng Gate]

322
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,870
Don't move!

323
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,910
Let go of me!

324
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,020
Let go of me!

325
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,070
Let go of me!

326
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,950
Don't move!

327
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,420
The enemy's raid this time is especially intense.

328
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,190
Be extra careful.

329
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,510
Once you get in contact

330
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,150
with comrades in Harbin,

331
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,340
get them to build a new transport line.

332
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,050
Xia.

333
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,100
Rest assured.

334
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,480
I'm not a rookie on my first mission.

335
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,860
I'll be careful.

336
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,590
Our comrades who are exposed in Fengtian

337
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,210
will evacuate through the new transport line.

338
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,550
Remember,

339
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,510
at 3 p.m. on the 12th of next month,

340
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,190
I'll wait for him at the teahouse on the west of Minfu Street

341
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,840
in Harbin.

342
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,510
I got it.

343
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,780
Three p.m. on the 12th of next month.

344
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,380
Teahouse on the west of Minfu Street in Harbin.

345
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,220
Your new identity.

[He Guoxiu]

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,370
[Harbin Station]

348
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,350
Next time, I'll ask Xia

349
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,360
to let you act as a teacher.

350
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,770
We can meet outside.

351
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,060
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

352
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,010
A teacher's boring.

353
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,270
If I get to choose, I'd like to be an opera actor.

354
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,480
I’m a die-hard opera fan.

355
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,350
I can play the role well.

356
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,590
I'm sitting on the city tower.

357
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,900
It's too flamboyant. Sit down.

358
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,840
I love it.

359
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:21,990
Yes.

360
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,340
I'll build a new transport line right away

361
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,010
so we can initiate it.

362
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,530
The streets are filled with spies these days.

363
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,680
Be careful. Don't leave the inn for no reason.

364
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,460
Harbin's just as intense as Fengtian.

365
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,710
I'll just stay in the inn.

366
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,730
Until the day of contact.

367
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,070
There are other comrades in this contact.

368
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:55,650
Here.

369
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,430
I'll ask Xia Tao to get another box of desserts

370
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,400
to facilitate the contact.

371
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,370
Everything about Dongning Fortress and Unit 731

372
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,620
has been deeply engraved in my mind.

373
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,810
What I need to do now

374
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,130
is to report everything I know

375
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,280
to the organization as soon as possible.

376
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,650
Is Xia Tao exposed?

377
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,680
We've even met?

378
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,390
No. Just in case, he's retreating to the mountains

379
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,190
with a few underground party members

380
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,260
from Fengtian

381
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,310
by following the new transport line

382
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,640
through Harbin.

383
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,620
Why must they pass through Harbin?

384
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,390
Because other roads are blocked.

385
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,920
They can only take a detour.

386
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,430
What do you need me to do?

387
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,660
Just stand by.

388
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,220
You don't have to contact them.

389
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,560
Zhuowen's still alive.

390
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:01,990
What?

391
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,150
He's sent back the longitude and latitude

392
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,570
of Unit 731's equipment depot

393
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,870
[Lost and found]

394
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,870
in Dongning Fortress.

395
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,590
It's Zhuowen?

396
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,530
He's still alive.

397
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,130
Our intel is reliable.

398
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,400
This person's arrived in Harbin

399
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,360
no more than 24 hours ago.

400
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,450
He must still be in the urban area.

401
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,090
Ms. Guan.

402
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:38,430
Harbin is bigger and more complex than Fengtian.

403
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,840
It's easy

404
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,520
to hide in the shadows like a rat.

405
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,630
Besides,

406
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,160
he'll change his identity and image.

407
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,780
It's looking for a needle in a haystack.

408
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,070
Ms. Guan.

409
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,950
What do you think?

410
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,300
Peking opera.

411
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,750
The photos you display at home

412
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,330
must be your favorite.

413
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,030
If he happens to be an opera fan,

414
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,450
this theater is not a coincidence.

415
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,270
This is a clue.

416
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,460
What else is in his home?

417
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,490
Peking opera records.

418
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,290
When we broke the door down,

419
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,970
the record player was still on.

420
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,740
Investigate it.

421
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,970
Find all the records

422
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,510
and sort out the most worn-out ones.

423
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,720
If these records

424
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,800
belong to the same person,

425
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,310
it'll be a breeze.

426
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,640
Yes.

427
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,990
Come in.

428
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,090
I said, come in.

429
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,920
Do you resent me for not visiting you

430
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,280
at the hospital?

431
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,570
The doctor said

432
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,640
you came to see me twice

433
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,490
when I was asleep after taking sleeping pills.

434
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,780
All that matters is you're alive.

435
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,420
All that matters is I'm alive.
