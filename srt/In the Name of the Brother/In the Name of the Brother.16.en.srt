Xie Yue said

379
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,740
Kai lent her money so she stopped setting up her stall.

380
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,820
Kai lent the money to Xie Yue?

381
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,360
Yes.

382
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,680
I asked her.

383
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,680
She said the day she borrowed money

384
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,580
was the night before Watanabe died.

385
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,440
So she stopped going to set the stall up the next day.

386
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,520
What did Kai say?

387
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,110
I searched everywhere.

388
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,170
He's not at school.

389
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,820
He's a student.

390
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,630
If he's not at school,

391
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,590
what is he doing?

392
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,050
I think...

393
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,700
we should recruit spies at Kai's school

394
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,380
to keep an eye on Kai.

395
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,910
I have a candidate.

396
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,590
Give me one.

397
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,570
Sister.

398
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,010
Didn't you say you would stop coming to my school?

399
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,530
Which one is Xie Yue?

400
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,370
Why are you suddenly asking for her?

401
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,650
What are you acting as?

402
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,870
King Chu.

403
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,590
King Huai of Chu?

404
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,830
Wearing this?

405
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,790
I made it myself.

406
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,900
Did she borrow money from you?

407
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,330
How did you know?

408
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,770
When did it happen?

409
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,840
It wasn't much.

410
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,510
It's was from my savings.

411
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,190
I'm asking you when it was.

412
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,700
On the 26th of last month.

413
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,350
What's wrong?

414
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,270
You like her, don't you?

415
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,670
Why are you talking about?

416
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,520
Your Majesty should come home early after dinner.

417
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,860
Is there a student here?

418
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,320
He's inside.

419
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,710
Thank you.

420
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,990
What is it?

421
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,350
Dried apricot?

422
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,960
Transfer the explosives.

423
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,440
Today is the best timing.

424
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,890
Today?

425
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,390
I...

426
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,110
I have to go to class.

427
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,230
Where can I hide it?

428
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,640
Go home.

429
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,150
Just follow the method I taught you.

430
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,130
It's safe. Nothing will happen.

431
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,580
Are you crazy?

432
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,480
My sister will find out.

433
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,610
No, she won't.

434
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,950
Trust me. She'll be busy today.

435
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,200
She would have no time to go home.

436
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,470
Put the explosives

437
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,750
in the toilet,

438
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,630
and leave as soon as possible.

439
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,830
Do you remember that?

440
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,110
Repeat that.

441
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,630
Wait.

442
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,230
What if... my sister finds out? How do I explain it?

443
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,710
Also,

444
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,350
how did you know Asano would go to the hospital?

445
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,270
Sometimes, the lesser you know,

446
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,770
the safer it is.

447
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,600
Don't worry.

448
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,650
Your sister won't know.

449
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,230
Why?

450
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
As I said,

451
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,610
there are many things going on in the Secret Service.

452
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,340
She can't take care of all of it.

453
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,100
Sister!
