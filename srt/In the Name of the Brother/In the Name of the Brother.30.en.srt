[In the Name of the Brother]

3
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,930
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,890
There's a weather station in the mountain.

5
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,990
When we were arresting fugitives,

6
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,410
we passed by it many times.

7
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,450
We met the same person every time.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,930
He seemed to be recording data.

9
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,020
Then why didn't you go in?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,830
I told you.

11
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,100
Mr. Hu said it's okay.

12
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,480
But now that I think about it,

13
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,550
he might be a lookout.

14
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,889
It's too late to say anything now.

15
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,790
If they leave the weather station,

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,970
they can get in anywhere.

17
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,690
Come here.

18
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,510
You were at the door.

19
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,360
Why didn't you search inside?

20
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,490
Mr. Hu, I...

21
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,920
Why?

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,230
Mr. Hu.

23
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,670
Forget it.

24
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,550
Get lost!

25
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,500
Mr. Asano.

26
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,070
Dr. Kojima's outside, asking to see you.

27
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:25,930
Got it.

28
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,940
Dr. Kojima.

29
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,130
Sorry to keep you waiting.

30
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,500
Asano.

31
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,110
I submitted a proposal

32
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
to increase funding

33
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,900
for the Water Department.

34
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,630
If it's discussed at today's meeting,

35
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,110
please emphasize the need for increased funding.

36
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,190
What reason should I use

37
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,070
to emphasize that?

38
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,180
With the success of the experiment.

39
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,460
Although Marutas escaped,

40
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,190
the experiment was a success.

41
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,290
The new ceramic germ bombs

42
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,980
can be mass-produced.

43
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,830
So we need to increase funds.

44
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,900
But

45
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,930
Dr. Kojima,

46
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,610
the funds you applied for

47
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,710
is enough to produce 5,000 rifles every month.

48
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,800
What's the point of 5,000 rifles?

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,400
To equip half a division?

50
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,490
Does Chief of Staff Hata Hikosaburo plan to rely on these rifles...

51
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,620
to fight against Russian tanks?

52
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,610
I understand.

53
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,940
Goodbye.

54
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,520
When did Mr. Song come here?

55
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,520
Mr. Song?

56
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,310
Mr. Song...

57
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,790
He came three days ago.

58
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,790
This is what he looked into that day.

59
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,950
Mr. Hu.

60
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,110
Excuse me.

61
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,180
I have a stomachache.

62
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
Can I go to the hospital?

63
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,710
Go ahead.

64
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,170
Mr. Song.

65
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,000
You had a stomachache recently.

66
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,760
Where did you get treated?

67
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,470
Dr. Sun at Renhe Hospital.

68
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,360
He was busy. I had to line up.

69
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,630
What medicine did he prescribe for you?

70
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,320
Did it work?

71
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,050
Gastric herbal tablets. Two at a time.

72
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,110
You'll be fine in half an hour.

73
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,640
Thank you, Mr. Song.

74
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,860
Stomachaches

75
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,770
are caused by heart problems.

76
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,880
Don't be so fickle.

77
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,640
Take your time.

78
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,750
You'll recover.

79
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,230
This smuggler

80
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,970
must know the patrol route and schedule

81
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,790
of the anti-smuggling squad.

82
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,310
Too many people know about that.

83
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,230
We can't narrow it down.

84
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,750
We still have to investigate.

85
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,550
In my opinion,

86
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,600
they're the Water Department fugitives

87
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,810
we're looking for.

88
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,580
Mr. Pan. I still can't figure out

89
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,420
why Zhuowen looked up

90
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,780
the Japanese Water Department's map.

91
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,490
And a jailbreak happened soon after.

92
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,650
A coincidence?

93
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,530
All coincidences in this world

94
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,780
are premeditated.

95
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,310
I didn't think of that.

96
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,270
Mr. Pan, can you explain?

97
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,680
Did you forget about the medicine?

98
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,150
No.

99
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,510
Before I came here,

100
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,140
I stopped by Renhe Hospital

101
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,060
and confirmed with Dr. Sun

102
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,950
that Zhuowen had been there.

103
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,750
How is it? Is it good?

104
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,230
Delicious.

105
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,730
Mr. Asano.

106
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,230
Do you remember the ramen place

107
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,929
on the streets of Hsinking?

108
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,909
Yes, I do.

109
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,750
The owner,

110
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,470
the father, passed away.

111
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,830
Yeah?

112
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,450
Yes.

113
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,670
Both of his sons went to the front line.

114
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,280
I heard his son-in-law's changed his surname

115
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,240
and took over.

116
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,710
I really miss the ramen

117
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,830
cooked by Mr. Hiroshima.

118
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,340
Mr. Asano.

119
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,810
The battle in Iwo Jima

120
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,750
is still ongoing.

121
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,980
The conscription rate's been rising.

122
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,610
If this continues,

123
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,140
I wonder...

124
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,950
The Water Department's jailbreak

125
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,870
must be suppressed.

126
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,340
It'll be troublesome if the higher-ups know about the situation.

127
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,750
Yes.

128
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,620
Mr. Asano.

129
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,820
With all due respect,

130
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,730
the ceramic bomb experiment's

131
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,080
security plan is really shabby.

132
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:47,970
Why do we

133
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,080
have to be responsible for their mistakes?

134
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,300
There's a Chinese saying,

135
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,580
"If the skin doesn't exist,

136
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,890
what could the hair adhere to?"

137
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,580
In the big picture,

138
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,990
if it's related to the Japanese Empire,

139
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,550
we're responsible for it.

140
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,510
Understand?

141
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,870
Yes.

142
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,150
Four of the fugitives

143
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,600
should still be alive.

144
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,040
One of them's a kid.

145
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,670
I'm worried the special agents

146
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,210
might ruin our big plan.

147
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,660
Mr. Asano.

148
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,620
What do you want me to do?

149
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,780
First,

150
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,680
organize a new report.

151
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,670
Yes.

152
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,910
When necessary,

153
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,680
prepare substitute corpses.

154
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,190
I understand.

155
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,710
Two glasses of water, please.

156
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,750
Today's spaghetti is delicious.

157
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,470
Yes.

158
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,430
Who is it?

159
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,510
Song Zhuowen planned the Water Department criminals' escape

160
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,220
from the blockade.

161
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,880
Tell me who you are first.

162
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,920
I'm Mr. Yinyang.

163
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,790
There's a mole

164
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,980
in your Secret Service.

165
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,830
Don't mess around with me.

166
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,380
Is he really that brave?

167
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,960
He's always on the front line.

168
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,770
That's to catch the fugitives.

169
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,100
Is there a problem?

170
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,380
Help me check a call.

171
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,390
Call me back at 32734.

172
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,610
On the day before the jailbreak,

173
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,880
Zhuowen went to the archives

174
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,610
to look up the Kwantung Army Water Department's map.

175
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,800
He was late for the meeting before the operation started.

176
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,220
He told others he had a stomachache.

177
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,080
Other than coordinating the jailbreak,

178
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,210
can you give me a more reasonable explanation?

179
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,310
It doesn't mean anything.

180
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,660
I've seen the map in the archives.

181
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,960
I also went to Huichun Pharmacy that day

182
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,680
because of my sore throat.

183
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,860
If you're a man, come forward

184
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,310
and confront us.

185
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,140
A punch here and a kick there.

186
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,360
You think it's boring too, right?

187
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,080
Am I right,

188
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,640
Mr. Pan?

189
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,310
Ms. Guan.

190
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,810
Have you found it?

191
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,860
It's a phone booth outside the Army Hospital.

192
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,410
Got it.

193
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,770
Mr. Pan.

194
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,120
Twisted doughnuts!

195
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,630
Crispy and hot twisted doughnuts!

196
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,550
Every time I hear this contact code,

197
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,170
I get very nervous.

198
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,630
Ms. Guan must have new arrangements.

199
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,270
Twisted doughnuts!

200
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,610
Crispy and hot twisted doughnuts!

201
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,550
Twisted doughnuts!

202
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,750
Crispy, hot, and fresh twisted doughnuts!

203
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,810
Crispy, hot, and fresh twisted doughnuts!

204
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,870
Twisted doughnuts!

205
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:35,020
Crispy, hot, and fresh twisted doughnuts!

206
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,860
Don't they usually sell steamed buns?

207
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,980
Today, it's twisted doughnuts?

208
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,790
Are you okay?

209
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,070
My hands slipped.

210
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Are you hurt? Let me see.

211
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,760
Aunt Chang.

212
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,110
Please get me another bowl.

213
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,220
Nothing else.

214
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,090
-I’m leaving early today.
-Okay.

215
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,700
Here.

216
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,470
Careful, it's hot.

217
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,450
Should I drive you to school today?

218
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,370
No need. The exams are over.

219
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,010
I don't have to go so early.

220
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,710
Let's start.

221
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,470
No hurry.

222
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,670
I don't know how to bring this up.

223
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,090
I don't wanna upset you.

224
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,760
Later,

225
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,950
someone else is coming.

226
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,870
What do you mean?

227
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,600
That...

228
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,020
That person who followed you for me.

229
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,020
He knew we were meeting today,

230
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,690
so he wanted to join.

231
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,320
Do you get what I mean?

232
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,830
I'll be good to you.

233
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,510
No one will know about this.

234
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,710
Guan Kai won't know

235
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,490
and your Mr. Song won't know.

236
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,950
Don't worry.

237
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,850
Besides, I'm not a greedy person.

238
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,000
Just this once.

239
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,830
Really?

240
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,290
Yes, and we'll go our separate ways.

241
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,030
You said it.

242
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,230
Just this once.

243
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,610
Just this once.

244
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,470
Can I trust you?

245
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,840
Open the door!

246
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,430
Is anyone there? Open the door!

247
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,430
Anyone out there?

248
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,950
Open the door!

249
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,020
Let alone slapping me,

250
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,140
even if we die in this bed,

251
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,150
no one will know.

252
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,100
The door is locked from outside.

253
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,630
It won't open.

254
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,850
I promise the heavens

255
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,020
I won't say a word.

256
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,350
Open the door! Anyone there?

257
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,010
-Almost time.
-Open the door!

258
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,890
He'll be here in ten minutes.

259
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,680
Soon.

260
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,500
I told you

261
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,790
the door's locked!

262
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,810
Are you dumb?

263
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,110
The door won't open!

264
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,550
Help!

265
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,910
Don't you understand?

266
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,670
Help!

267
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,870
What are you doing?

268
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,350
I like you so much.

269
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,990
I like you so much.

270
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,520
The more you avoid me, the more excited I get.

271
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,530
I don't like how you were just now,

272
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,630
like a dead fish.

273
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,820
It's unlike you.

274
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
I'll be good to you.

275
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,840
How dare you resist?

276
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,900
It's useless to resist.

277
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,950
Coming.

278
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,990
Who are you?

279
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,780
I'm asking you!

280
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,710
Who are you?

281
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,750
Who is he?

282
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,100
Who is he?

283
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,210
Why did you hit him?

284
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,350
I'm asking you!

285
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,590
I'm asking you!

286
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,610
What are you doing? Sir!

287
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,770
What are you doing?

288
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,670
What are you doing? Let go of me!

289
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,070
What are you doing?

290
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,980
What are you doing?

291
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,040
What are you doing?

292
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,250
Sir, let go of me!

293
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,290
Sir, let go of me!

294
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,890
The son of the prime minister's secretary Lu.

295
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,390
You're so easily frightened.

296
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,900
It'll make him bleed.

297
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,850
It's indiscreet.

298
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,910
I was wrong, Ms. Guan.

299
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,020
I asked you to keep watch for me

300
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,800
and you handed it over to a Highways inspector the first chance you got.

301
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,720
I asked you to watch the east,

302
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,840
and you watched everything but the east.

303
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,830
Are you greedy

304
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,710
or scheming?

305
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,180
I was wrong.

306
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,430
Remember this.

307
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,400
Don't hit his head.

308
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,660
Ms. Guan!

309
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,060
What did you just say?

310
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,980
What do you like?

311
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,480
You want me to resist?

312
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,920
Don't rely too much on you?

313
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,900
I don't rely on you!

314
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,300
You're just like the Japanese!

315
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,960
Use more strength.

316
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,040
Kid.

317
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,590
Don't worry.

318
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,670
I met your father once.

319
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,440
I won't make things difficult for you.

320
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,990
Send a message to your father.

321
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,720
The prime minister doesn't want

322
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,860
his smuggling of steel into the country to be exposed.

323
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,300
If the Japanese find out,

324
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,030
even the prime minister can't protect him.

325
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,030
Understand?

326
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,110
I...

327
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,470
I understand!

328
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,200
You hit him quite ruthlessly.

329
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,410
Thank you for saving me.

330
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,830
Thank you for letting my brother go.

331
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,060
I know.

332
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,450
How has it been?

333
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,310
I'm fine.

334
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,390
I'm asking about him.

335
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,230
He's fine too.

336
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,350
The same as usual.

337
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,090
He doesn't talk much.

338
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,320
His habits haven't changed too.

339
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,160
Has he changed

340
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,470
in the past few days?

341
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,310
Insomnia.

342
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,240
Really?

343
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,510
At night,

344
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,090
I hear him tossing and turning.

345
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,590
So you're saying...

346
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,790
you're sleeping together?

347
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,990
I heard it through the walls.

348
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,150
Mr. Song.

349
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,400
We did catch a smuggler recently

350
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,700
through a tip-off.

351
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,830
But is this the Secret Service's business?

352
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,700
No, I'm just asking.

353
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,440
I want to know

354
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,700
if you have records of the tip-off call

355
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,310
about the rice smuggler.

356
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,230
Can you find out

357
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,700
where the call's from?

358
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,660
I'm sorry.

359
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,990
We never record such things.

360
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,570
Okay, got it.

361
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:30,880
Bye.

362
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,190
Zhuowen went to the hospital days ago

363
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,360
and got some stomachache medicine.

364
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,360
Gastric herbal tablets.

365
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,750
If you see it at home,

366
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,230
check the number of pills on the bottle

367
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,830
and count how many pills there are.

368
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,380
Some suspect his stomach disease is fake.

369
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,500
Check it for me.

370
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,130
Don't you trust him?

371
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,270
You don't trust me either.

372
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,550
Lu Jianfei

373
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,160
won't bother you anymore.

374
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,860
You were so fierce just now.

375
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,390
Just like me back then.

376
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,130
Five, ten, fifteen,

377
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,590
thirty, thirty-five.

378
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,970
All involved in the operation,

379
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,390
like the Water Department,

380
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,870
Imperial Army, the garrison,

381
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,660
and even the anti-smuggling squad

382
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,380
have submitted their reports,

383
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,170
except the Secret Service!

384
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,350
Mr. Asano, I'll hurry.

385
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,740
We've collected the info

386
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,500
provided by all departments.

387
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,250
It'll take some time to write an analysis report.

388
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,210
Ms. Guan.

389
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,290
I respect you a lot!

390
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,500
Don't get cocky because I indulge you!

391
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,190
Mr. Asano.

392
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,710
We're superior and subordinate.

393
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,340
There's no indulgence.

394
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,150
Besides, no one's ever provided us such info

395
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,470
about the fugitives.

396
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,000
It's hard to find out their escape route.

397
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,940
Do their identities

398
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
have anything to do with your arrests?

399
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,550
Of course!

400
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,630
If they're farmers,

401
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,000
we'll go to the countryside.

402
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,159
If they're townsman, we'll wait in town.

403
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,139
Only communists would seek refuge

404
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,280
with the Counter-Japanese Army in the mountains.

405
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,469
There are some things...

406
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,110
I can tell you in person.

407
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,710
Mr. Song.

408
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,420
Congratulations.

409
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,000
My mom said

410
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,560
if you could do us the honor

411
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,190
to be my wedding witness,

412
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,750
our entire Qiao family will be blessed.

413
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,980
Don't say that.

414
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,990
It's my honor.

415
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,650
I'll go as long as I'm free.

416
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,670
Mr. Song.

417
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,250
From now on,

418
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,890
I'll go through fire and water for you.

419
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,310
Hu.

420
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,390
Hu...

421
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,430
Hu...

422
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,350
There are some things

423
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,750
I haven't told you.

424
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Can't you tell me over the phone?

425
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,350
Anyway,

426
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,150
where the fugitives went

427
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,160
and if they're dead or alive

428
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,840
are extremely important

429
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,760
to you, me, and even

430
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,460
the Army Headquarters.

431
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,700
Ms. Guan.

432
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,550
Let's be more

433
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,890
perceptive

434
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,830
and discerning.

435
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,470
Yes, I understand.

436
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,470
Look at this.

437
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,590
What's that smell?

438
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,040
Freshly-cooked deer tendons this morning.

439
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,180
From your favourite time-honored brand, Lumingchun.

440
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,720
You can spare a moment.

441
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,680
Come have a taste.

442
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,150
It'll get gamy when cold.

443
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,000
Did you hear me?

444
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,350
It'll get gamy when cold.

445
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,430
Then it won't taste good.

446
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,860
Hu Bin, stop messing around.

447
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,940
Can't you see I'm busy?

448
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,730
An Operations Unit Chief like you

449
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,550
strutting into my office

450
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,380
with a pot of pungent deer tendons.

451
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,450
What's your intention?

452
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,600
Am I your wife?

453
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,510
Must I eat it?

454
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,250
If it's not something important,

455
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,950
don't come to my office, okay?

456
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,840
Okay?

457
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,660
Hu.

458
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:46,950
Hu.

459
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,990
I'm getting married on the tenth.

460
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,590
If you can come in person,

461
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,980
our entire Qiao family will be blessed.

462
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,790
Hu.

463
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,230
Hu...

464
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,270
Hu...

465
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,710
Mr. Hu.

466
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,990
I'm getting married on the tenth.

467
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,790
Marriage?

468
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,620
Marriage's good.

469
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,040
At such a time?

470
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,230
The country's in crisis!

471
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,750
You don't do your job well.

472
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,550
You just eat, drink and gamble every day.

473
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,990
How dare you get married?

474
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,670
Don't you feel guilty to your wife?

475
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,790
Mr. Song, you're back.

476
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,220
Am I in time for dinner?

477
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,240
Dinner's soon.

478
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,270
I'll call you.

479
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,530
The smell on the bottle is so familiar.

480
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,260
It's the smell of soap Xie Yue usually uses.

481
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,060
Mr. Song, time to eat.

482
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,640
I have a stomachache.

483
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,680
Get me the gastric herbal tablets.

484
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,740
Let me.

485
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,390
Get me a glass of water too.

486
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,260
Thank you.

487
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,700
I prepared this bottle of medicine

488
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,230
to cover up my tracks,

489
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,790
just in case.

490
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,660
To think that

491
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,190
rather than Aunt Chang, Xue's spy,

492
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,790
I'm exposed by Xie Yue,

493
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,300
the one I brought back.

494
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,760
Don't they usually sell steamed buns?

495
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,970
Today, it's twisted doughnuts?

496
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,820
Are you okay?

497
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,200
My hands slipped.
