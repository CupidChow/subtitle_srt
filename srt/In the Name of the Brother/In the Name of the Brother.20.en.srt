[Episode 20]

4
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,450
This old trick of theirs

5
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,479
exposed a flaw.

6
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,070
They managed to

7
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,060
get grease on Guan Kai's hands

8
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,350
that he'd have to wash off in the restroom,

9
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,150
and misled us that Guan Kai

10
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,990
destroyed the water pipe valve.

11
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,190
You mean, to get others to do one's dirty work?

12
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,100
Guan Kai is just their pawn?

13
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,350
No plan's better than one that frames

14
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,750
the brother of the Secret Service's section chief

15
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,360
and then having him kill her.

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,090
If it were me,

17
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,190
I'd do the same.

18
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,829
Deputy Chief Song.

19
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,310
Did Ms. Guan send you here?

20
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,430
She...

21
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,870
was right about you.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,550
You saved Guan Kai again.

23
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,750
Not really.

24
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,670
It's a fact.

25
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,340
The facts are on the table.

26
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,110
Asano Diago's a smart guy.

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,990
He wouldn't have believed it

28
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,390
if Kai's really suspect.

29
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,329
At times,

30
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,829
I think you're more complicated than

31
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,160
the serial explosions.

32
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm not that complicated.

33
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,380
I pride myself on knowing you the best,

34
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,390
but I don't understand you at all.

35
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,910
Even I don't believe you.

36
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,570
One has to be cynical

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,510
to get into

38
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,970
the Secret Service.

39
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,870
Playing dumb and acting loyal here

40
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,150
is tough and pointless.

41
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,860
So, the simpler the person is, the more reliable he is.

42
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,650
Calculative people

43
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,680
are less trustworthy.

44
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,590
Do you mean

45
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,470
Pan Yue?

46
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,390
Look at him today.

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,730
Hemming and hawing, and all restless.

48
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,470
Instead, at the start of his report,

49
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,400
he avoided talking about Guan Kai.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,870
He's up to no good.

51
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,790
Mr. Asano.

52
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,750
Mr. Asano!

53
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,430
Someone's here for you.

54
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,470
Mr. Pan?

55
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,390
Mr. Pan.

56
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,670
Mr. Asano.

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,850
What's so important that you came before dawn...

58
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,470
You asked me to come.

59
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,620
Did you drink?

60
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,150
Yes.

61
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,950
But I'm definitely not drunk.

62
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,710
Didn't you ask me to come here

63
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,830
at 5 a.m. to await your orders?

64
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,670
I did?

65
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,909
I asked you to await orders?

66
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,710
Are you kidding me?

67
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,310
You asked Mr. Harada

68
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,909
-to call me...
-Mr. Harada went on a business trip to Mudanjiang.

69
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,310
Hello?

70
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,070
Who is it?

71
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,950
Mr. Pan.

72
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,390
Mr. Harada.

73
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,360
Come to Mr. Asano's house at 5 a.m. tomorrow to await orders.

74
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,930
Okay.

75
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,540
Okay, right away.

76
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,230
Are you crazy?

77
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,190
Hello.

78
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,630
Is the Intelligence Unit too much for him to handle?

79
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,500
Yes.

80
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,990
Yes, Mr. Asano.

81
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,900
I believe he's under a lot of pressure.

82
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,120
I understand the importance of the Intelligence Unit Chief.

83
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,350
Then hurry up and solve this.

84
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,650
Yes, I'll take care of it immediately.

85
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,750
I personally suggest he get hospitalized for treatment.

86
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:38,909
Hospitalized?

87
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,510
A sick person should get treated.

88
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,670
Do you think he's reached that point?

89
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,460
Why else would he say nonsense

90
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,800
to come sleep at my house at 5 a.m.?

91
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,780
I got it. I'll evaluate it carefully.

92
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,950
Report back soon.

93
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,790
Yes.

94
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,750
Ms. Guan.

95
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,160
What's wrong with you?

96
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,830
Nothing.

97
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,350
Just a headache.

98
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,510
It's nothing.

99
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,090
Go to the hospital if you feel unwell.

100
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
I know.

101
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,630
It's minor.

102
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,190
Ms. Guan.

103
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,360
I think something's off about what happened

104
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,430
this morning.

105
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,610
Are you referring to your drinking,

106
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,510
or about how Mr. Asano scolded you?

107
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:32,830
No.

108
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,480
Something must be wrong...

109
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,380
somewhere.

110
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,850
-Hear me out.
-Hold it.

111
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,650
Let's talk after the meeting.

112
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,110
Are you dead?

113
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,860
Why didn't you say anything?

114
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,510
Zhuowen, is the meeting today?

115
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,630
It's still about

116
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,960
the serial explosions.

117
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,560
Mr. Asano isn't satisfied with our progress.

118
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,510
Change the direction.

119
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,710
Let's put a pause on the hospital matter

120
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,790
and redirect the investigation

121
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,470
to the kidnapping of

122
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,760
the water repairman.

123
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,920
Let's try to make headway here.

124
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,690
Mr. Pan.

125
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,260
Report the situation.

126
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,440
Okay.

127
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,980
Here's the thing.

128
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,910
That morning...

129
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,030
the repair company sent...

130
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,670
three people and a repair car.

131
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,290
The hospital...

132
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,740
received a call... meant for the water company.

133
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,510
As they were... at the intersection

134
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,630
of Minyi Street,

135
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,950
-all of a sudden...
-It’s Yimin Street.

136
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,230
It's Yimin Street!

137
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,950
Thank you.

138
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,900
They met a few...

139
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,910
men in police uniforms.

140
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,910
Their traits are...

141
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,750
were they dark... their complexion...

142
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,920
Yes, they were fair.

143
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,690
They had sharp noses.

144
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,610
I'm sorry. Where was I?

145
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,110
Can you hear me out first?

146
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,670
Why are you looking at me?

147
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,380
Why are you looking at me?

148
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,310
Okay.

149
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,870
It happened at...

150
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,230
nine in the morning!

151
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,050
Take him to the hospital.

152
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,510
Yes.

153
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,380
Right away!

154
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,110
Mr. Pan, this is Section Chief's order.

155
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,870
-They...
-Let’s go to the hospital.

156
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,990
So they sent...

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,510
they sent repairmen.

158
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,830
I-I know.

159
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,440
Okay.

160
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,030
Mr. Pan.

161
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,830
Wait.

162
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,570
Is something wrong with me?

163
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,330
Mr. Pan!

164
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,040
I'm not...

165
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,480
Sit tight.

166
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,230
Let's go.

167
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,500
Is Pan Yue okay?

168
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,400
If he's ill,

169
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,670
he'll be fine after getting treated.

170
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,990
Or he'll hinder business.

171
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,370
We need Pan to receive treatment properly.

172
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,630
We can't afford his absence now.

173
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,340
Anyone can leave.

174
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,330
Especially if it's me.

175
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,130
You're the exception.

176
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,680
Really?

177
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,180
Ms. Guan, you want to see me?

178
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,930
We've decided Mr. Pan should be hospitalized for treatment.

179
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,850
He'll be on a paid sick leave.

180
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,630
Inform the Army Hospital

181
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,710
that a high-ranking

182
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,370
Intelligence special agent will be sent there.

183
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,470
Let me emphasize.

184
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,200
Mr. Asano has specified

185
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,920
to discharge him only after he's fully healed.

186
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,030
If anything goes wrong

187
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,800
and the Intelligence Unit suffers,

188
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,360
they'll be held responsible.

189
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,100
Understood.

190
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,660
Mr. Hu.

191
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,450
No one's indispensable,

192
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,760
including me...

193
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,670
and you.

194
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,590
Mr. Hu.

195
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,710
Let's go.

196
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,950
Qian.

197
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,290
Pan Yue's been sent to the hospital.

198
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,070
We're in danger.

199
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,870
Why?

200
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,520
Letting the most experienced and well-connected

201
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,460
veteran

202
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,090
lie in his bed and lick his wounds?

203
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,550
Once he's recuperated,

204
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,650
it'll be harder to deal with him.

205
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,190
I got it.

206
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,630
Now I'm in the open

207
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,980
and he's in the dark.

208
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,700
I have to be careful.

209
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,280
Be careful?

210
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,540
How?

211
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Just saying it?

212
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,310
Do you know his next move?

213
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,270
Since he has to hide

214
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,430
in the dark,

215
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,650
he'll plant many minions and spies

216
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,650
in the open.

217
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,020
Okay, I got it.

218
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,609
Has he had barbital before sleeping?

219
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,390
Yes.

220
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,910
Do you have money to spare?

221
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,640
Don't look at me.

222
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,710
I have no money.

223
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,960
I won't borrow much this time.

224
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,410
Just for two days' meals,

225
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,450
not for gambling.

226
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,110
Really.

227
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,530
Come with me to get it.

228
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,910
How many times must I tell you

229
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,190
Hongyun Casino is famous for cheating customers.

230
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,270
Why do you always go there?

231
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,150
Got it.

232
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,340
Hello.

233
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,040
Ding Peng, right?

234
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,670
Who is it?

235
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,270
I guess I was right.

236
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,000
You're on night duty today.

237
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,030
Stop playing tricks.

238
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,790
Who are you?

239
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,070
Is the girl who smokes opium your real sister?

240
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,020
It's surprising you can sleep.

241
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,950
What do you think would've happened

242
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,790
if this call was made

243
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,030
by Ms. Guan?

244
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,160
Mr. Pan?

245
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,800
Mr. Pan.

246
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,110
Relax. Don't be nervous.

247
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,990
I know you have no choice.

248
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,260
If I had

249
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,110
such a sister,

250
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,790
I'd also take the risk like you.

251
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,780
I don't want your money

252
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,510
or your life.

253
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,320
I'm only interested in that Mr. Ding.

254
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,010
I'm not familiar with him.

255
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,190
How unfamiliar?

256
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,900
He has a sister, sir.

257
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,550
He has a sister, sir.

258
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,760
How long has he been getting goods

259
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,630
from you?

260
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,000
A while.

261
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,770
It's been a while, sir.

262
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,910
And he's good at calculating.

263
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,070
He sold it very well at the beginning.

264
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,760
Then his sister started smoking it.

265
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,600
So he's selling it to supply her.

266
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,730
I'm telling the truth, sir.

267
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,630
Mr. Pan.

268
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,310
Say no more.

269
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,560
I'm sensible.

270
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,070
I know what to do.

271
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,810
And what's that?

272
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,630
From now on,

273
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,830
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

274
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm at your beck and call.

275
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,830
Then do me a favor.

276
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,910
Mr. Pan, go on.

277
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,190
Go to the Public Security Section tomorrow morning

278
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,940
to find Sheriff Feng, who has jurisdiction over Daowai District.

279
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,720
Tell him

280
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,780
it's time he returns my favor.

281
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,910
Will he know what to do?

282
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,670
Ask him to go to Hongyun Casino in his jurisdiction

283
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,000
to inform the boss

284
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,430
to let my attending physician

285
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,780
win there.

286
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,510
Until I say stop.

287
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,360
Anything else, Mr. Pan?

288
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,630
And I'll have to trouble you quite a bit from now on.

289
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,220
Does your man usually talk in his sleep?

290
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,190
Two nights ago,

291
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,670
I was in a daze

292
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,410
and heard him say something.

293
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,630
What did he say?

294
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,710
It must be twins!

295
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,310
Calm down. What's around you?

296
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,160
Houses.

297
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,020
Oh no.

298
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,190
Someone's coming towards me.

299
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,070
Don't be rash.

300
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,440
Don't be rash. He might just be passing by.

301
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,550
What does he look like?

302
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,640
He looks like Pu Ke.

303
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,070
Zhuowen, you look

304
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,500
a lot like Pu Ke.

305
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,420
Movie star, Pu Ke.

306
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,750
There's a saying in China.

307
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,870
Talents are rare.

308
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,710
I think Song Zhuowen's a talent.

309
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,310
I want him to take on more responsibilities.

310
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,250
In my years in the Secret Service,

311
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,610
I've never seen such a talented person.

312
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,470
To put someone in an important position,

313
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,220
you must know him well.

314
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,660
You are right.

315
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,820
Mr. Ma.

316
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,550
Yes.

317
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,430
I'm sending you to the Secret Service

318
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,890
to investigate Song Zhuowen's background.

319
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,130
Give me the report.

320
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,190
Yes, Mr. Asano.

321
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,160
Ms. Guan Xue

322
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,630
will fully cooperate with you.

323
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,030
I'll have to trouble you, Ms. Guan.

324
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,790
It's my duty.

325
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,230
I look forward to Zhuowen

326
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,620
passing this investigation assessment

327
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,950
to take on more important tasks.

328
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,310
Am I right,

329
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,030
Ms. Guan?

330
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:06,990
Yes.

331
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,150
What do you want for dinner?

332
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,340
We don't have to wear our uniforms tonight.

333
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,800
Let her wear that dress!

334
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,670
Xie Yue!

335
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,110
Xie Yue, we're leaving.

336
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,230
Let's take a walk.

337
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,520
Smart people are smart in every situation.

338
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,430
I asked the school.

339
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,630
You have good grades.

340
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,130
You attend classes

341
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,260
and do odd jobs to earn tuition.

342
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,840
Yet you don't fall behind.

343
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,050
It's not easy.

344
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,910
So why didn't such a smart girl

345
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,590
clean up properly after the murder?

346
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,170
I didn't kill anyone.

347
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,470
You did. It was even a Japanese sheriff.

348
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,250
Zhuowen cleaned up the crime scene for you.

349
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,710
I don't know what you're talking about.

350
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,150
You don't have to answer.

351
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,920
I already know the answer.

352
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,230
Since you don't need me to tell you,

353
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,500
you can tell yourself.

354
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,410
I have classes.

355
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:34,740
Bye.

356
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,640
A strand of your hair

357
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,490
was found at the crime scene.

358
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,070
I have it.

359
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,360
Secrets aren't like wine; they won't ferment.

360
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,800
Just bury it well.

361
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,790
You, me, and Zhuowen

362
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,220
will keep it under wraps.

363
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,510
No one will know

364
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,320
and your family won't be implicated.

365
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,910
Section Chief Guan.

366
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,030
Call me Ms. Guan.

367
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,590
Ms. Guan.

368
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,830
What do you want?

369
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,630
I want you to be his weakness.

370
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,640
Make him fall in love with you.

371
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,860
How you do it is up to you.

372
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,190
I can't do it.

373
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,960
Isn't it easier for him to fall in love with you?

374
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,450
Why beat around the bush?

375
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,680
Cut the crap!

376
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,600
Smart people don't ask why.

377
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,030
Think about who has leverage over you.

378
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,230
Right. One more thing.

379
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,190
Stay away from Guan Kai.

380
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,160
You are so funny.

381
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,990
Get closer to one

382
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,590
and stay away from the other?

383
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,560
I'll get what I want, by hook or by crook.

384
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,960
Without you,

385
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,110
there'll still be Guo Yue

386
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,700
and Lyu Yue.

387
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,790
Be grateful I chose you.

388
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,610
To find your brother,

389
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,520
I've deployed the entire Missing Persons Section.

390
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,340
Don't be anxious.

391
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,990
We'll find him eventually.

392
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,100
You're so thoughtful.

393
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,310
I'm thankful regardless.

394
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,900
I heard from Ms. Guan that you have a family photo in your wallet.

395
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,640
Can I have a look?

396
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:28,870
Here.

397
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,110
Is this your brother?

398
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,530
What's your age difference?

399
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,010
Two years.

400
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,180
Does he look like you?

401
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,230
How should I put it?

402
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,360
Somewhat.

403
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,980
You're brothers after all.

404
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,800
You should know him well.

405
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,430
Where do you think he'd go?

406
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,020
Ms. Guan must have told you

407
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,490
we went through a massacre eight years ago.

408
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,330
There was a flood of bullets

409
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,140
like heavy rain.

410
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,510
No one could escape it.

411
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,820
Besides, it's been a long time.

412
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,910
Never say never.

413
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,980
Just in case.

414
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,330
With the police stations in the suburbs of Harbin,

415
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,430
Hsinking,

416
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,510
and Fengtian,

417
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,840
we can find clues for people

418
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,310
we're looking for,

419
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,610
dead or alive.

420
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,670
What's your brother's name again?

421
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,560
Song Zhuowu.

422
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,040
Zhuowen and Zhuowu.

423
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,030
Cultured and valiant.

424
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,950
We are neither.

425
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,850
Could your brother have gone back home?

426
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,470
I asked around, but he didn't.

427
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,350
Which street was your home in Fengtian?

428
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,920
135 Taiyuan Street.

429
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,230
If you really send men to investigate,

430
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,790
take some photos for me.

431
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,960
I miss my hometown.

432
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,380
No problem. Once work is handled.

433
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,030
It's nothing.

434
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,460
It seems you slept well last night.

435
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,940
What time is it?

436
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,790
8:58.

437
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,510
In two minutes,

438
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,110
you'll receive a call

439
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,250
from the boss of Hongyun Casino.

440
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,100
Don’t worry.

441
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,240
It's not to press for payment.

442
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,700
Rather, he'll cancel your gambling debt.

443
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,540
And every week,

444
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,590
he'll invite you to his casino

445
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,710
to play for free.

446
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,620
Remember, win when you need to.

447
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,750
Don't make the banker feel bad.

448
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,710
The medicine I gave you doesn't have side effects.

449
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,800
Why are you talking nonsense?

450
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,180
Dr. He, it's a call for you.

451
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,500
Ma?

452
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,450
How are you, Mr. Ma?

453
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,880
Are you confused?

454
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,710
What's wrong?

455
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,990
Why are you calling me now?

456
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,080
Are you really sick?

457
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,280
I'll just say one thing.

458
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,790
Look into his missing brother

459
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,710
he mentioned.

460
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,500
Pan Yue, listen.

461
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,510
If someone's monitoring the call

462
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,540
or there are our call records,

463
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,910
everything we do will be moot.

464
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,710
Except for going home for lunch,

465
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,510
Zhuowen's been in the building.

466
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,080
He hasn't called or interacted

467
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,510
with anyone.

468
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,590
Where were you when he went home for lunch?

469
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,540
I was at the door.

470
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,130
Yao was behind the house.

471
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,810
We didn't see any stranger coming in or out.

472
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,820
From now on,

473
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,530
no matter day or night,

474
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,330
you two will keep an eye on him.

475
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,320
Yes, got it.

476
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,370
Remember, don't be targeted.

477
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,460
Yes, got it.

478
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,310
Ding Peng, right?

479
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,610
Yes, Mr. Ma, what can I do for you?

480
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,880
It's nothing.

481
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,790
I heard Mr. Pan treats you well.

482
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,750
Yes.

483
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,550
I need you to do something for me.

484
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,910
To make a trip.

485
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,780
To Fengtian, okay?

486
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,290
Should Ms. Guan know about this?

487
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,970
It's best she doesn't.

488
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,010
It's for her own good.

489
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,550
Got it.

490
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,860
Thank you.

491
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,820
Chinese literati

492
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,470
have always expressed their ideas through literature,

493
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,510
so dramas have never been a product of aesthetics.

494
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,470
Especially when the Chinese nation

495
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,780
is at a critical juncture of life and death.

496
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,230
Some ambitious individuals

497
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,670
are devoted to saving the people

498
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,190
and use it

499
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,550
as a weapon.

500
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,700
Who are you looking for?

501
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,350
Do you know Xie Yue?

502
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,830
No. Ask someone else.

503
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,600
Are you here for Xie Yue?

504
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,990
She's left the drama club.

505
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,430
Why did she leave?

506
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,280
We think she's problematic.

507
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,640
Many people came to her.

508
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,240
Everyone found it annoying.

509
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,990
Did anyone give her a hard time?

510
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,590
She's definitely isolated.

511
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,320
Daring to fight alone against the majority.

512
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,040
In the 1930s to 40s,

513
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,950
Tian Han, Xia Yan, and others advocated

514
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,910
proletarian dramas,

515
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,970
national defense dramas,

516
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,030
up till anti-Japanese war dramas...

517
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,550
Who will go to Mt. Fuji Restaurant?

518
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:19,990
Sir, I'll take you!

519
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,050
I'll take you!

520
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,550
Listen.

521
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,840
You must try our peach blossom wine.

522
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,400
Let me fill it up for you.

523
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,800
Fill it up.

524
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,950
Let's get drunk tonight.

525
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,230
Let's get drunk!

526
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,950
Your girls are great.

527
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,360
Enough with that.

528
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,470
Come with me.

529
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,320
Don't ask where we're going, okay?

530
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,450
I'm not here to persuade you to leave your job.

531
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,710
Then what are we doing?

532
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,190
Drink with me.

533
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,150
Let's go.

534
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,200
Did something happen to you?

535
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,720
I'm happy today.

536
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,140
I have a long-lost brother.

537
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,770
A friend said he could help me find him today.

538
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,610
Can you find him?

539
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,880
He said he could.

540
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,040
And he's going to Fengtian,

541
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,260
my hometown.

542
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,310
Just to find him for me.

543
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,040
Thank you, sir.

544
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,510
Let's go.

545
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,760
Goodbye, sir.

546
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,950
Please come again.

547
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
Where are you taking me?

548
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,030
Do me a favor.

549
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,530
While tying my shoelaces,

550
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,510
see if there's a short man

551
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,000
in a flat cap

552
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,030
behind me.

553
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,200
Yes,

554
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,850
there really is.

555
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,840
Okay.

556
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,100
You can go home now.

557
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,100
This is a gift for you.

558
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,310
I have a gift for you.

559
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,270
You killed that Japanese

560
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,150
at the end, right?

561
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,700
So you should still have it.

562
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,670
If they find out later,

563
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,360
you have to take the responsibility.

564
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,960
What if I say I didn't kill him?

565
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,070
Why did you protect me?

566
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,220
Because...

567
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,620
this is a secret between us.

00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,040
Is there a secret between us?

569
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,610
There are none.

570
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:17,990
Thanks.

571
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,860
If this medicine's at his home,

572
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,030
count the pills in it.

573
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,950
Some suspect he's faking his stomach disease.

574
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:50,870
What's wrong?

575
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,770
Don't move.
