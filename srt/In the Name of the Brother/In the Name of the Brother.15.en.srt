[Episode 15]

4
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,530
Aunt Chang, I'll get it.

5
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,470
Have you been waiting for my call?

6
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,790
You got the money?

7
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,320
You're indeed a special agent.

8
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,430
A bait with 500 yuan.

9
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,080
Clever, Mr. Song.

10
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,090
If you catch me today,

11
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,860
you'll kill me, right?

12
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,710
You've got what you want.

13
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,829
Why are you still following me?

14
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,390
You want more money?

15
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,220
Is the great Song Zhuowen

16
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,640
only worth 500 yuan?

17
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,010
That just proved your sincerity.

18
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
So now

19
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,540
we can start doing business.

20
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,020
Tell me.

21
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,280
I want ten gold bars.

22
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,600
Don't worry. This is it.

23
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,640
Once I get the money,

24
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,829
I won't contact you again.

25
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
I don't have that much money on hand.

26
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,190
I need time.

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,930
Three days

28
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,660
are the most I can allow you.

29
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,870
Hell yeah!

30
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,270
Sir, are you

31
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,980
looking to stay?

32
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,260
It's cold in the mountains.
Is the quilt thick enough?

33
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,170
Yes, it's 9 lb.

34
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,810
Freshly-spun cotton.

35
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,560
A dog skin mattress under it.

36
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,010
Is the food and accommodation expensive?

37
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,930
No.

38
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,510
Just some simple fare.

39
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,870
We built the place ourselves.

40
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,330
You can pay as you deem fit.

41
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,190
What food do you have?

42
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,420
Roe deer, wood ears, mushrooms,

43
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,120
and chickens we raise.

44
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,790
Any wine?

45
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
An eccentric one?

46
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,430
He has a weapon on his waist.

47
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,180
If he's looking for lodging at this time,

48
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,620
he mustn't be a good guy.

49
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,420
A bandit or this?

50
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,990
I don't care.

51
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,820
Let's take him down first.

52
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,750
Sir, the food's ready.

53
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,030
Wine.

54
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,030
Enjoy.

55
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,590
Wait.

56
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,630
Try it.

57
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,790
What are you waiting for? Eat up.

58
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,120
What? You don't like your cooking?

59
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,510
Or are you snubbing me?

60
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,590
No way.

61
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,300
Hurry, thank him.

62
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,159
Thank you, sir.

63
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,360
Enjoy.

64
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,310
Manager.

65
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,980
Where are you from?

66
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,740
Suihua.

67
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,490
47 miles away from here.

68
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,510
How does such a remote restaurant

69
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,510
make money?

70
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,800
Ginseng diggers, herbalists,

71
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,280
beekeepers,

72
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,520
and leatherworkers

73
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,520
enter the mountain when it's warm.

74
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,160
Sir, what do you do?

75
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,870
What do you think?

76
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,710
Looking at your outfit,

77
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,020
are you a mountain forager?

78
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,870
You have to have money to do that.

79
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,159
I use my brains to do business

80
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,320
without capital.

81
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,470
Please enjoy.

82
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,340
I still miscalculated after all.

83
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,910
Didn't you eat the food?

84
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,400
Why are you fine?

85
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,780
Let me show you.

86
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,300
Your chopsticks are modified.

87
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,440
There are small holes on it,

88
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,440
where I put the medicine

89
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,430
that's sealed with deer oil.

90
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,220
It melts with steam

91
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,190
and goes into the food.

92
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,060
How is it?

93
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,610
Didn't see it coming, did you?

94
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,670
Sir?

95
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,340
I...

96
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,920
Come on.

97
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,140
Now tell me

98
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,100
who's the sir?

99
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,190
Come on, say it!

100
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,810
Call me sir!

101
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,610
Fatty.

102
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,790
Mountain foragers have it hard indeed.

103
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,470
Tell me.

104
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,510
What do you do?

105
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,050
I've already told you.
You don't believe it?

106
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,230
A bandit?

107
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,330
You do look the part.

108
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,670
Maybe in the past.

109
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,780
But not anymore.

110
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,290
Looking for Counter-Japanese soldiers

111
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,320
in the mountains?

112
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,630
Counter-Japanese soldiers?

113
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,350
Otherwise, why's your luggage empty?

114
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,130
Make it clear.

115
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,390
Uphill or downhill,

116
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,470
let's all go

117
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
our own way.

118
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,430
If you don't make it clear...

119
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,110
I'll tell you.

120
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,550
At this point,

121
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,770
I might as well tell you.

122
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,990
But I have a condition.

123
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,000
It's simple.

124
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,220
It's nothing.

125
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,340
Say it.

126
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,460
Kneel

127
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,780
and kowtow to me.

128
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,580
Loudly.

129
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,300
How dare you...

130
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes.

131
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,030
Lower.

132
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,040
Pry it open.

133
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,870
The iron box behind the wall.

134
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,230
Take all the money.

135
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,630
Don't leave a cent.

136
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,290
I don't want the money.

137
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,400
I want the radio.

138
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,110
I run an inn.

139
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,660
There's no radio.

140
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,830
Keep lying to me

141
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,400
and I'll off you. Try me.

142
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,090
How can I have a radio here?

143
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,190
No.

144
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,720
There were three people here.

145
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,970
You sent the accountant to Harbin a few days ago

146
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,550
to contact a special agent.

147
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,040
But he didn't make it back.

148
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,380
Am I right?

149
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,270
Do you really think you're

150
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,780
the Yama of the mountains?

151
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,670
You stole these

152
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,090
from people who went up the mountain, yeah?

153
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,990
Do me another favor.

154
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,230
Keep an eye on someone for me.

155
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,900
He's Quan, a worker in my shop.

156
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,220
He's been out for a long time.

157
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,190
Until today,

158
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,250
he hasn't written back to his family.

159
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,560
How old is he?

160
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,110
He's already in puberty.

161
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,110
But he still wears his childhood necklace.

162
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,190
Where's this kid?

163
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,430
It wasn't me, but the cook.

164
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,310
That kid was too smart.

165
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,330
He caught the cook

166
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,300
swindling a mountain forager,

167
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,250
so the cook silenced him.

168
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,330
Was his name Quan?

169
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,590
How did you know?

170
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,950
I'll really kill you today.

171
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,390
Don't test me!

172
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,310
Go meet Yama.

173
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,180
I don't know. I really don't!

174
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,470
Who is the mole in the Counter-Japanese Army?

175
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,950
I'll let you meet Yama today!

176
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,240
The accountant's dead too.

177
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,480
If you don't want to live, don't say anything.

178
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,710
I'll kill you today.

179
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,590
What are you doing?

180
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,650
What are you doing?

181
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,260
I'll tell you!

182
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,670
The radio...

183
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,530
-The radio is...
-Speak up!

184
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,990
The radio's in the shabby shed in the forest.

185
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,150
But I've really never seen the mole.

186
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,410
I only go to get intel.

187
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,070
All I know is...

188
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,030
the...

189
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,970
the next transaction time.

190
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,700
Tell me!

191
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,590
Tomorrow night.

192
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
In our plan to leave the city,

193
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,090
your brother replaced the car plate.

194
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,150
Our men were watching the coal yard's entrance

195
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,880
and the gaps in the coal piles.

196
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,990
Just in case.

197
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,910
No one could've seen Zhuowu

198
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,310
replacing the car plate.

199
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,390
So that guy's lying.

200
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
He's cheating me.

201
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,710
Try to recall

202
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,349
who else saw you that day.

203
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,440
Other than the sentries guarding the bridge,

204
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,819
no one else.

205
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,150
So I'm definitely safe.

206
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,120
Don't worry.

207
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,520
We'll wait one more day.

208
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,800
If you still can't find the blackmailer,

209
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,930
leave immediately.

210
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,790
Qian.

211
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,670
Can you trust my judgment this time?

212
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,020
Give me more time.

213
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,630
No.

214
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,990
This is not a gamble.

215
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,580
You have no right to bet your life.

216
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,640
Three days.

217
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,530
No.

218
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,810
Just three days!

219
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,090
No way.

220
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,490
Evacuate if there's even a hint of exposure.

221
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,550
That's our policy.

222
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,770
Fine. One day then.

223
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,610
The tea's ready.

224
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,250
I'll pass.

225
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,090
Just two days' time.

226
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,730
Where should I go

227
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,130
to find all the sentries?

228
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,770
It might be more dangerous to go to them.

229
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,690
But there's no other way.

230
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,000
Because

231
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,450
I'm selfless,

232
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,930
I didn't keep the reward for myself.

233
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,600
I called you here

234
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,250
just to

235
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,930
remind you,

236
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,770
if you encounter a similar situation,

237
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,040
don't be a coward.

238
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,430
Just follow the rules.

239
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,960
Yes, don't be a coward.

240
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,160
Then maybe you can get a reward too.

241
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,650
Sure.

242
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,350
Let me tell you

243
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,850
what he looks like.

244
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,810
A high nose,

245
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:51,930
long eyes,

246
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,250
in a gray suit, white shirt,

247
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,970
and a purple tie.

248
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,790
Another incognito inspection?

249
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,250
Have you met me?

250
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,370
No, but I've heard of you.

251
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,050
You're from the Secret Service.

252
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,410
Ms. Guan was with you last time.

253
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,210
Do you have cigarettes?

254
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,090
Yes. Here.

255
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,540
Who said that?

256
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:19,970
Well,

257
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,070
Cui Anping.

258
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,000
Lighter.

259
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,490
I don't have it.

260
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,190
Cigs but no lighter?

261
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,010
Who said that?

262
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,340
Cui Anping.

263
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,540
That bastard.

264
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,400
I remember him,

265
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,690
the one on duty last time.

266
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,210
What did he say?

267
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,450
To think he remembers me.

268
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,650
That stingy scrooge

269
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
actually invited

270
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,500
all his peers on duty that day for drinks.

271
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,490
It's conceivable that

272
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,010
it was just to brag.

273
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,890
But explaining the details of how I look

274
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,130
and inquiring if I were

275
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,730
at other checkpoints

276
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,810
means he has an ulterior motive.

277
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,130
Above all,

278
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,380
Cui Anping did two shifts that afternoon.

279
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,010
If he saw two cars leaving the city successively,

280
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,370
we're screwed.

281
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,230
Time to change shifts.

282
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,410
Guns down.

283
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,910
On the dot.

284
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:02,700
Come on.

285
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,730
Get ready to change shifts.

286
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,570
How many dishes will your wife cook for you tonight?

287
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,430
Change shifts.

288
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,070
He came again this afternoon.

289
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,930
Who?

290
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,730
Who else?

291
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,450
You were right.

292
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,970
The Secret Service's

293
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,170
taking it seriously.

294
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,540
A routine check every few days.

295
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,190
Even re-inspections.

296
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,380
I wasn't as lucky as you.

297
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,580
No rewards this time.

298
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,350
Was it a man or a woman?

299
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,690
A man.

300
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,850
He didn't drive this time.

301
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,380
What did you two talk about?

302
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,690
I...

303
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,570
Just some small chat.

304
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,700
What can people like me talk about?

305
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,610
What we talked about over dinner

306
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,780
last time.

307
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,410
March!

308
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,100
Where are you going?

309
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,050
Where are you going?

310
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,980
Hello, who is it?

311
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,730
I’m Cui Anping.

312
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,210
What’s up?

313
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,780
Let me buy you a meal.

314
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,730
That won't do.

315
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,370
My treat.

316
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,730
When?

317
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,130
8 p.m. tonight.

318
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,070
Private Room 6, second floor, Juxian Building.

319
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,330
Will you come?

320
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,680
I won't miss it.

321
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,490
As I expected,

322
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,150
me showing up at the checkpoint

323
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,720
worked.

324
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,290
No matter what,

325
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,050
I must meet Cui Anping.

326
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,250
Stop whining

327
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,340
or I'll kill you.

328
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,230
[Investigate: Tian Xiaojiang, Yue Baocheng, Tian Geng, Song Zhuowen]

329
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,090
Who are you?

330
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,750
Sir, this way, please.

331
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,270
Sir, it's here.
This way, please.

332
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,140
Welcome, Sir!

333
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,250
Welcome, Sir!

334
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,740
We're different from you.

335
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,530
We're just soldiers.

336
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,860
But it's our blessing

337
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,950
to know Mr. Song.

338
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:07,650
Right?

339
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,650
Yes.

340
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,850
Please look after us in the future.

341
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,510
I'm not good with words.

342
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,130
Come on.

343
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,040
Cheers.

344
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,490
Sure! Cheers!

345
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,820
You flatter me, Mr. Cui.

346
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,700
I just do

347
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,140
as my superiors say,

348
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,010
just like you.

349
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,610
You're too modest.

350
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,770
Everyone in this line of work

351
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,650
knows you are

352
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,250
a hotshot secret agent.

353
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:37,930
Right?

354
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,050
Yes.

355
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,420
Mr. Cui is really thoughtful.

356
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,940
You inquired a lot about me.

357
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,200
You are my benefactor

358
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,400
and lucky star.

359
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,770
Rather,

360
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,450
I'm curious about Ms. Guan.

361
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,540
But who am I to talk to her?

362
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,770
Why don't I introduce you to her?

363
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,050
No, no, no.

364
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,810
Knowing you

365
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,370
is my greatest blessing.

366
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,690
I can't afford

367
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,700
to have too much good in my life.

368
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,340
We've never interacted in the past.

369
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,420
Mr. Cui's indeed an honest man.

370
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,610
Now, we're officially acquainted.

371
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,930
With time,

372
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,630
our friendship will surely last.

373
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,730
Yes, come on, cheers.

374
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,340
Here.

375
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,250
Sir.

376
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:59,620
Eat up.

377
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:00,770
Okay.

378
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,920
Wen.

379
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,290
I have something to ask you.

380
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,010
After you and Ms. Guan just left that day,

381
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,050
you came right back and left the city

382
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,290
urgently.

383
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,370
I was wondering

384
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,880
if something big happened.

385
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,130
I have no filter when I'm drunk.

386
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,910
I know. Military secret.

387
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,940
It's confidential.

388
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,630
I'll drink as punishment.

389
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,730
You guys too.

390
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,730
What Mr. Song and I talked about

391
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,770
is confidential.

392
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,850
Yes.

393
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,380
In one ear and out the other.

394
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,130
If word about the Secret Service's affairs gets out,

395
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,210
you'll have to die.

396
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,130
Understand?

397
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:18,970
Yes.

398
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,610
They're tight-lipped.

399
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:25,690
Yes.

400
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,490
Come on. Cheers.

401
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,170
Cui Anping's really something,

402
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,810
using this trick to let everyone know.

403
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,270
Come on.

404
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,060
If these sentries

405
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,620
get the word out,

406
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,010
the fact that I have a twin

407
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,570
will be exposed.

408
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,050
I'll propose another toast.

409
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,650
Let's wish Mr. Song peace, safety,

410
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,570
and a prosperous career!

411
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,590
A prosperous career.

412
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,590
Cheers!

413
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,250
Sir, I'm sorry.

414
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,890
I'm looking for Ms. Guan.

415
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,370
We don't...

416
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,610
She called me over.

417
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,870
My surname's Song.

418
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,760
Okay.

419
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,810
A moment, please.

420
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,700
Mr. Song.

421
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,370
This way, please.

422
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,250
I can't dance.

423
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,050
Are you stalking me?

424
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,760
I dare not.

425
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,050
I don't know

426
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,790
who else to discuss this with.

427
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,889
So I came to you.

428
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,290
It's urgent.

429
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,570
Someone called to blackmail me.

430
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,810
For what?

431
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,470
He accused me of communist ties.

432
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,130
Why?

433
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,450
I don't know.

434
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,850
I don't even know who he is.

435
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,530
Who do you think

436
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,530
he is?

437
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,860
Who do you think he is?

438
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,930
Someone called me to tip me off

439
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,060
about the Communist Party.

440
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,060
He wanted to sell the intel,

441
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,800
so he was vague about it.

442
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,670
Did you agree to pay for it?

443
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,620
You can

444
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,650
steal from me or rob me,

445
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,990
but you can't blackmail me.

446
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,430
Do you really think

447
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,350
he's just after money?

448
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,750
Anyway, as a special agent,

449
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,450
someone stealing from you,

450
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,440
robbing you,

451
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,940
or blackmailing you

452
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,130
is no big deal.

453
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,050
I'll get back to dancing.

454
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,290
You two are twins.

455
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,450
Come on!

456
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,610
You ruined the plan, you know?

457
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,110
What's wrong with getting rid of the mole?

458
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,730
We've been keeping up

459
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,850
with Qiao Er's movements.

460
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,780
We left him alone all this time

461
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,090
to get to the more dangerous mole

462
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,370
through him.

463
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,800
On the first day you came up here,

464
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,610
I emphasized on discipline

465
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,860
and obeying command.

466
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,540
Why did you act on your own?

467
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,820
Qiao Er's a mole anyway.

468
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,970
Getting rid of him

469
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,330
gives you a peace of mind.

470
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,410
If you suspect

471
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,490
he's the mole, just report it.

472
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,790
Why did you kill him?

473
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,330
Now

474
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,840
all our leads are gone.

475
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,730
I have no idea what Qian told you

476
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,080
before you came up the mountain.

477
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,930
Comrades from the city

478
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,890
just take us as fools.
