4
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:46,910
Comrade Zhuowu.

5
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,940
Welcome.

6
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,150
Are you Commissar Fang?

7
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,670
Yes.

8
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,550
It was an effort for you to carry those 5 kilos of salt up here.

9
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,600
On behalf of all the comrades on the mountain, I thank you.

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,560
Qian has told me

11
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,970
about your situation in a telegram.

12
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,900
On the whole mountain, I'm the only one

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,580
who knows your real identity.

14
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,240
It must be kept a secret,

15
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,690
including your past and background.

16
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,419
Understand?

17
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,460
Yes.

18
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,800
I won't tell anyone.

19
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,680
This gun's sights need adjusting.

20
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,500
Sit down.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,260
You and your brother look exactly alike.

22
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,120
But judging from the way you do things,

23
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,060
you're completely different from him.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,740
Working in the Secret Service, he needs to put on an act.

25
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,230
Get me a uniform

26
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,510
and I can act better than him.

27
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,579
It's not as easy as you think.

28
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,970
Luckily, we have Qian.

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,440
Qian is the most experienced operative

30
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,640
in the entire Northeast China.

31
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,829
What you need to do now

32
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,010
is cooperate with your brother.

33
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,690
Of course, I'll cooperate with him.

34
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,690
I've always been very cooperative.

35
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,390
But Qian is overly cautious.

36
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,750
I can't change his mind.

37
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,000
Qian is right.

38
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,150
You're too impulsive.

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,510
From now on,

40
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,240
you must follow my orders.

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
No problem.

42
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,630
Here. Look at this.

44
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,260
This map is so detailed.

45
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,150
What would happen if it appeared

46
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,310
on the desk of the Japanese?

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,470
I shudder to think about it.

48
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,010
Who could the mole be?

49
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,700
Let me find it out for you.

50
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,110
Now that I'm here, let me help.

51
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,790
Commissar.

52
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,570
Miao is here.

53
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,959
Okay, I got it.

54
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,870
Go wait inside.

55
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,010
I'll meet him.

56
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,110
Miao.

57
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,870
Commissar.

58
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,890
What's the matter?

59
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,420
I just came out of a meeting.

60
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,590
Captain Li asked me to send different squads'

61
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,950
night shift roasters this week

62
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,150
to the command center

63
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,390
and give a copy to you.

64
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,110
Miao.

65
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,260
You've been part of this team for a long time.

66
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,390
Haven't you noticed that the boys are a bit slack lately?

67
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,450
We can't afford to be incautious.

68
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,910
I heard Zhao is back

69
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,130
and that he was badly injured in Harbin.

70
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,410
How is he now?

71
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,360
He made it back.

72
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,790
He's fine, and the intel wasn't leaked.

73
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,990
He managed to come back by himself after being badly wounded?

74
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,790
What's wrong?

75
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,550
He's a tough boy.

76
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,190
I didn't know he had it in him.

77
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,060
Come.

78
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,150
Who's it?

79
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,810
It's me, Qiao Er.

80
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,090
You came alone?

81
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,720
Yes.

82
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,440
There's a new arrival on the mountain.

83
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,590
When will I get paid for reporting the post office last month?

84
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,050
The higher-ups said they won't welch on you.

85
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,810
Fine.

86
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,920
Do you know who the newcomer is?

87
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,350
I haven't figured it out yet.

88
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,500
He seems to be a salt merchant.

89
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,870
Nonsense.

90
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,420
High-bridged nose, elongated eyes.

91
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,510
In a grey suit and a white shirt

92
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,830
with a purple tie?

93
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,230
Who would dress like that in the mountains?

94
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,300
Wait, wait.

95
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,530
He might have changed.

96
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,350
Find a time to search his luggage.

97
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,840
You get to sleep in bed with your wife down the mountain.

98
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,880
Do you know what my life is like here?

99
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,830
What's the point of saying that?

100
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,120
It's all for money.

101
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,390
Besides, how long do you think the money we have left

102
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,539
can last us?

103
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,820
My boss is just like you.

104
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,120
He said the same thing.

105
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,710
I wonder how much that Guan woman

106
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,150
has promised him.

107
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,150
We're only one step away.

108
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,190
One big step.

109
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,100
I appreciate your work, bro.

110
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,030
Hold on here.

111
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,440
I'm counting on you.

112
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,500
Remember.

113
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,610
Look into that newcomer.

114
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,070
I'm serious.

115
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,790
You know what?

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,660
I've had a bad feeling lately.

117
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,520
My head has been pounding.

118
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,680
I have the feeling that something is going to happen.

119
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,960
Ms. Guan, are you okay?

120
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,670
Catch up with Guan Xue's car. Don't let her escape.

121
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,110
It's our men. They should be able to stall them.

122
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,990
Guan Kai.

123
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,710
Someone outside asks to see you.

124
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,710
We're having a meeting here.

125
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,470
Tell them to wait.

126
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,390
He came in a car

127
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,590
and said it's urgent.

128
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,400
I'll go check it out.

129
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,660
Xie Yue and I went to the library for research last night.

130
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,120
I'll copy the image from the material later.

131
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,860
Once you see it, you'll understand.

132
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,090
I'll be right back.

133
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,870
You guys carry on.

134
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,910
Xie Yue, do you have anything to add?

[Harbin Institute of Technology]

136
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,950
What's wrong, Mr. Ning?

137
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,910
Get in the car.

138
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,500
Okay.

139
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,880
The mission failed.

140
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,840
Who did it?

141
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,590
The Japanese.

142
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,130
Let me go to the hospital with you.

143
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,950
No.

144
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,680
Going to the hospital is like walking into a trap.

145
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,790
I'm here to ask you again.

146
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,800
Have you really made up your mind?

147
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,550
Mr. Ning.

148
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,550
I didn't say yes on a whim.

149
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,520
And I'm already working on it.

150
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,530
Do it with your classmates.

151
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,050
Not for me,

152
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,660
but for yourselves.

153
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,780
Go.

154
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,550
Dongju, do you have anything to add?

155
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,390
I have only one suggestion.

156
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,090
Change the player.

157

Who do you think should be replaced?

158
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,550
Xie Yue.

159
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,040
Revenge.

160
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,120
It must be revenge.

161
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,230
A week ago,

162
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,510
we killed a station chief from the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics.

163
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,230
I agree.

164
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,080
It does look like something they'd do.

165
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,510
Don't jump to conclusions.

166
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,640
Too many people want me dead.

167
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,110
The car the shooter was in had a fake license plate.

168
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,870
It was headed to Bafang Street.

169
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,740
That street is crowded with people and cars.

170
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,470
We can't track it immediately.

171
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,070
Change your route to work.

172
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,350
I might as well change my car too.

173
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,660
Guess I also need a new head.

174
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,930
Since I can't escape them,

175
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,380
I'll give them a warning.

176
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,130
How many of their men are detained?

177
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,310
About ten.

178
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,550
Kill all of them.

179
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,260
We should take a page from the Japanese.

180
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:09,790
Yes.

181
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,200
Yes.

182
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,240
You can leave.

183
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,710
The captives from the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics,

184
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,770
are you really going to kill them all?

185
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,270
Are you begging for mercy for them?

186
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,120
Yes.

187
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,940
But I'm doing it

188
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,820
for you.

189
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
We're not sure if the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics

190
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,710
is behind this assassination.

191
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,990
If you kill all of those captives,

192
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,110
there will be more guns aimed at you.

193
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,520
Aren't you afraid

194
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,760
that I'll misunderstand your intention?

195
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,190
Yes.

196
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,900
Of course I'm afraid.

197
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,740
But I'm more afraid that something may happen to you.

198
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,310
Why has Harbin been in such chaos over the past few months?

199
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,130
What kind of world is this?

200
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,030
Go get Hu Bin back.

201
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,130
Yes.

202
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,550
I'm neither a thief nor a robber. I earn my money through work.

203
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,569
Why does that bother you?

204
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,710
I just can't stand it.

205
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,460
I have the right to raise objections.

206
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,790
Dongju, give it a break.

207
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,030
The only thing Xie Yue did wrong

208
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,270
was keep it a secret.

209
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,839
We all go through rough patches.

210
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,060
Can't you just give her a hand?

211
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,150
She's not going through a rough patch.

212
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,599
I saw her tangling with a man

213
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,150
outside school yesterday.

214
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,310
Who was that man?

215
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,829
How is that any of your business?

216
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,160
If you can't explain it,

217
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,000
you have to quit the drama club.

218
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,590
It's not hard to explain.

219
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,790
But why should I explain it to you?

220
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,030
Stop arguing!

221
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,560
We have no time for this!

222
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,690
Open your eyes and see the world outside.

223
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,270
Stop playing house.

224
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,870
You're hiding behind scripts like this and playing dumb.

225
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,870
All you can see

226
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,270
are love affairs.

227
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,180
Are you fantasizing that all problems can be solved in your dreams?

228
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,780
Wake up, my fellow students!

229
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:05,700
Go away.

230
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,980
Go away. Stop looking.

231
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,680
Let's go.

232
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,980
Our men sent to the four exits out of the city have reported back.

233
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,120
They found nothing.

234
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,830
-Next…
-No need to continue.

235
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,990
Just tell me if you've got him.

236
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,830
Not yet.

237
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,610
How about you guys?

238
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,540
You haven't found him and have no clue how to?

239
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,130
Who's it?

240
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,010
Don't you know…

241
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,800
Mr. Hu.

242
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,710
Mr. Jin.

243
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,640
Sorry.

244
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,790
Ms. Guan, we've got visitors from the Military Police Headquarters.

245
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,230
They came with a medical team.

246
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,190
They want us to put our work aside

247
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,610
and get a check-up first.

248
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,000
This is the Secret Service, not a hospital.

249
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,850
What do they want?

250
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,230
They said there's an infectious disease outbreak in Pingfang.

251
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,460
Everyone has to get a checkup.

252
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,660
The Japanese

253
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,930
are very serious about it.

254
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,200
Are they already here?

255
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,740
They're already in the yard.

256
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,960
They know we work with a small staff,

257
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,430
so they came here first.

258
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,830
We can finish it by noon.

259
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,600
I'll be off.

260
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,280
Dismissed.

261
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,190
Pan.

262
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,030
Pan!

263
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:16,980
Pan.

264
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,590
Do you think there's something

265
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,420
between Ms. Guan and Jin?

266
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
Like what?

267
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,920
Something romantic.

268
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,270
There's something between her and everyone

269
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,260
except you.

270
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,270
That's gonna change.

271
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Just wait and see.

272
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,570
Ding Peng.

273
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,180
Mr. Pan.

274
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,670
You already had your check-up, right?

275
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,490
What? You have too much blood and want them to draw another vial of it?

276
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,880
I asked him to queue up for me.

277
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,670
You should call me when it's my turn.

278
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,820
Now it makes sense.

279
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,990
A health check is not something you'd like to do twice.

280
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,050
Do you have problems sleeping?

281
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,410
What took you so long?

282
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,860
I wanted to get you something warm to eat.

283
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,510
What are you looking at?

284
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,510
I'm in charge of security.

285
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,510
My name is Qiao Er.

286
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,670
You can call me Qiao.

287
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,760
Where is Commissar Fang?

288
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,660
I don't know.

289
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,310
Does he eat this too?

290
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,950
It's the same for everyone.

291
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,150
There ain't much food in the mountains.

292
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,590
What are you going to do?

293
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,980
Can't I go hunting outside?

294
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,780
No.

295
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,250
Commissar Fang said

296
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,510
you can't go out without his permission.

297
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
Do you have booze?

298
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,130
No. Do you think you're still living downtown?

299
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,550
You're so picky.

300
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,220
[File Bag]

301
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,950
Sorry.

302
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,110
Take care.

303
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,390
[There are signs of mental stress.]

304
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,440
[Further thorough examination is recommended.]

305
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,020
I'm Song Zhuowen. Who is this?

306
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,880
You two look very alike.

307
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,720
Exactly alike.

308
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,780
Are you the younger brother, or is he?

309
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,450
Don't look around.

310
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,700
To ensure your safety,

311
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I called the Communication Section

312
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,730
and asked them to put you on.

313
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,050
So no one cares about this phone call.

314
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,020
I specifically chose this time

315
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,260
to call you.

316
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,420
Everyone should be out for lunch now.

317
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
So don't worry.

318
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,590
No one is eavesdropping.

319
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,240
Who are you?

320
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,520
Yesterday morning, at the abandoned coal yard in the west of the city,

321
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,740
your brother, or should I say your younger brother,

322
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,710
was changing the license plate on a car.

323
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,840
He thought

324
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,350
no one knew about that deserted coal yard,

325
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,000
so he could do it without anyone noticing.

326
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,230
Unfortunately,

327
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,770
he was too careless.

328
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,310
The south wall collapsed,

329
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,390
creating a gap,

330
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,400
and as luck would have it,

331
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,820
I happened to be passing by.

332
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,960
What are you talking about?

333
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,260
If you don't understand what I'm saying,

334
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,510
you can hang up

335
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,130
and leave.

336
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,890
I

337
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,810
will call Section Chief Guan

338
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,870
and tell her that

339
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,720
after she left the checkpoint yesterday,

340
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,270
someone left the city

341
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,370
in the same car.

342
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,670
An hour later,

343
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,270
in the pavilion by the lake in Waidao Park,

344
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
I want to see 500 yuan.

345
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,210
Tape the money under the stone table.

346
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,030
I'm a gambler.

347
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,060
My wife kicked me out.

348
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,080
I haven't gone home for three days.

349
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,640
Please do me a favor.

350
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,460
Make her for me.

351
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,770
Just tell her this:

352
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,690
"Your husband won the lottery.

353
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,040
Come and get the money."

354
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,220
I'll say I'm calling from the betting shop.

355
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,630
Yes.

356
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,730
All wives love money.

357
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,610
If she knows I won the lottery,

358
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,010
she'll let me go home.

359
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,200
Did you really win the lottery?

360
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,960
But she'll find out you lied sooner or later.

361
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,920
I'll just take one step at a time.

362
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,420
I need to go home first.

363
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,500
Why do you want me to call her?

364
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,310
My wife

365
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,740
has sharp ears.

366
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,930
She can recognize a familiar voice.

367
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,460
So it's gotta be a stranger.

368
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,630
Can you help me?

369
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,350
You won't do it for nothing.

370
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,270
I can pay you.

371
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,630
I'll help you.

372
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,920
There's a phone booth 200 meters east.

373
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,250
I'll go call her now.

374
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:29,850
Thanks.

375
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,870
Bro,

376
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,880
do you want me to order something for you?

377
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,610
Who are you?

378
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,840
I don't think we know each other.

379
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,900
It doesn't matter.

380
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,180
I wonder if you can do me a favor.

381
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,490
I don't think there's anything I can do for you.

382
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,510
I was so close to catching him.

383
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,030
He's got skills at avoiding detection,

384
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,980
but not enough.

385
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,790
Otherwise, he wouldn't have

386
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,920
walked into that simple trap of yours.

387
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,870
Second, he didn't do it for political purposes.

388
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,270
It was simply blackmail.

389
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,530
Yes. He just wanted money.

390
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,360
Since he didn't get the money,

391
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,560
he won't make a big move anytime soon.

392
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,740
He should be

393
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,350
from the law enforcement departments.

394
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,940
The 500 yuan is just a test.

395
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,230
He'll contact you again.

396
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,120
I have to lead him on,

397
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,020
making him think he can actually get the money.

398
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,650
I'll try gathering the comrades involved in the operation

399
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,310
to go over what happened again

400
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,470
and see if we can find any more clues.

401
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,590
Once we find something on him,

402
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,710
we can catch him.

403
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,790
Get ready to pull out.

404
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,150
Why do I need to get ready to pull out again?

405
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,630
We should fight back.

406
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,040
Before we take any measures,

407
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,710
we have to

408
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,780
ensure you're completely safe.

409
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,880
There's no such thing as complete safety.

410
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,590
Listen.

411
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,550
Your analysis just now was right.

412
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,550
He's after money.

413
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,990
He'll ask me for more money in the future.

414
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,820
He's greedy.

415
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,750
Greed is his biggest flaw.

416
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Having no fear is your biggest flaw.

417
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,820
Qian, sometimes I think

418
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,420
you're overly cautious.

419
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,199
When things come up, just sort them out and take action.

420
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,230
On this point,

421
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,409
Guan Xue is better than you.

422
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,130
The enemy is stronger than us.

423
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,159
The burden on our shoulders

424
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,590
is heavier than hers.

425
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,920
Stay safe.

426
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,440
What's wrong with you?

427
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,290
What do you mean?

428
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,840
It's been two days.

429
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,010
You keep tossing and turning.

430
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,890
Do you think you're a pancake?

431
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,560
Is something bugging you?

432
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,340
Or are you pining over some woman?

433
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,780
What's wrong with you?

434
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:34,990
Listen carefully.

435
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,200
If you dare cheat on me,

436
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,640
I'll beat you to a pulp.

437
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,020
You want a beating?

438
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,070
Shut up!

439
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,470
You're being ridiculous.

440
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,280
I'm just thinking about

441
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,630
where we should spend the rest of our lives.

442
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,110
What do you mean?

443
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,390
You said you like Dalian, right?

444
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,430
It's near the sea

445
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,440
and warmer than Harbin.

446
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,230
How about

447
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,730
we move to Dalian?

448
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,720
How much did you drink tonight?

449
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,830
Will it kill you not to brag?

450
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,610
You know what?

451
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,650
You're so full of crap.

452
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,330
Gosh.

453
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,450
Have you got promoted or won the lottery?

454
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,040
You're inept

455
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,470
and spend all your time doing useless things.

456
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,930
Life with you is pathetic.

457
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,340
If I'm still alive by the end of the year,

458
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,940
it must be by the grace of God.

459
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,970
If I become rich one day,

460
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,500
the first thing I'll do is get a new wife.

461
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,620
Cui.

462
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,350
Say that again

463
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,480
if you're a real man.

464
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,190
Honey, I'm kidding.

465
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,020
Don't be so serious.

466
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,920
Kai will stay at school for a few days.

467
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,250
Nothing unusual has been noticed around your house.

468
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,350
I'll also get your car bulletproof windows,

469
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,790
but it'll take a few days.

470
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,740
Stay here for now.

471
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,850
Hiding like this won't solve the problem.

472
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,030
When you're exposed in the light and your enemy is in the shadows,

473
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,470
hiding is the only and best choice.

474
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,350
Pour me a drink.

475
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,790
Is it Ms. Guan?

476
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,240
Who is this?

477
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,260
There is a communist spy

478
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,910
in the Secret Service Building of Harbin Police Agency.

479
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,680
You can go.

480
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,540
Leave it to me.

481
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,090
Yes.

482
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,600
Why should I trust you?

483
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,630
Because I have evidence.

484
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,310
I can come to you now.

485
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,870
What do you want?

486
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,400
The reward for reporting a key communist is 30,000 yuan.

487
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,700
I want 40,000 yuan in cash.

488
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,100
I can give you 50,000 yuan

489
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,900
as long as what you said is true.

490
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,430
I'll call you in three days.

491
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,430
What's wrong?

492
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,600
Nothing.

493
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,160
Let me tell you something about me.

494
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,420
You can steal from me or even rob me,

495
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,070
but you can't lie to me.

496
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,740
Do it!
