Yes.

131
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,230
You were very thin

132
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,470
and didn't talk much.

133
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,370
Liang was still young too.

134
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,600
And naughty too.

135
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,630
He's your brother, Guan Kai's classmate now too.

136
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,430
All these years,

137
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,110

150
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,140
All right, Mr. Long, calm down.

151

-Calm down.

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,840
Do I look for the Japanese

160
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,030
if I don't look for her?

161
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,830
Let's go to their Department Director Yan!

162
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,470

-Help me.

Help me.

I really can't find him, Xue.

173
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,360
Xue, help me!

174
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,110
Enough, Madam Long.

175
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,590
Enough.

176
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,110
Save Xinliang.

177
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,790
Help me, Xue.

178
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,380
Let's go find Department Director Yan.

179
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,990
Bring it over.

180

181
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,610
Any news?

182
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,470
Zhuowen.

183
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,020
We've checked everything we can.

184
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,910
We haven't figured out

185
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,420
what this Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department is.

186
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,900
But it's highly guarded.

187
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,230
It doesn't look like an ordinary military institution.

188
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,440
The Japanese painter you mentioned,

189
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,640
don't meet him again.

190
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,900
Why?

191
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,170
This is the only clue.

192
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,620
How can you trust a Japanese?

193
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,920
You can't say anything now.

194
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,590
Qian.

195
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,640
Tell the organization that this is what I do out of my own accord.

196
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,300
I'll take responsibility if anything happens.

197
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,930
I'm not talking about discipline now.

198
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,560
Nor am I talking about work principles.

199
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,190
I just can't watch you die.

200
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,830
My brother is inside.

201
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,510
My own brother.

202
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,590
He's my only family.

203
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,630
If I can't even protect him,

204
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,820
what can we protect?

205
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,630
Qian, don't worry.

206
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,470
I'll find him.

207
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,030
I've walked Mr. Long to his car.

208
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,670
He’s calm now.

209
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,500
His son and Kai are in the same school.

210
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,750
Shall we bring Kai back?

211
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,560
Okay.

212
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,710
Don't move.

213
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,710
Don't move! I can't lift you.

214
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,470
Let go of me!

215
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,520
Don't move.

216
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,880
Is this kidnapping?

217
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,670
Xie Yue, that's not what you said at the beginning.

218
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,560
What if my sister finds out?

219
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,120
Say something.

220
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,750
Behave yourself!

221
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,310
I...

222
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,990
Answer

223
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,160
what I ask you.

224
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,420
Do you understand?

225
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,710
Where is Long Xinliang?

226
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,990
I don't know.

227
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,510
You don't know?

228
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,510
Long Xinliang is my boyfriend.

229
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,050
Why are you the ones who's anxious.

230
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,840
Because he's Chinese.

231
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,430
Why?

232
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,360
Why are only the Chinese going missing?

233
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,640
Your father is a soldier.

234
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,600
He must know something.

235
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,260
My father has never fought a war.

236
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,950
He has never killed Chinese too.

237
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,950
He is just an ordinary officer

238
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,350
at the Water Department.

239
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,950
What kind of place is the Water Department?

240
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,120
It's to prevent plague and purify the water source.

241
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,800
Xie Yue.

242
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,830
I know it's you.

243
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,310
I recognize your voice.

244
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,950
You...

245
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,440
Who is the man next to you?

246
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,070
I can tell too!

247
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,790
Who?

248
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,980
Come here.

249
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,790
Who is it!

250
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,920
What are you doing?

251
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,190
Xie Yue.

252
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,370
Where are you?

253
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,830
I don't think we will be able to get anything from her.

254
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,490
She won't be easy to deal with.

255
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
What should we do?

256
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,360
Get her some food and drinks.

257
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,420
-Xie Yue!
-Go. Go!

258
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,870
Xie Yue!

259
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,110
Xie Yue!

260
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,510
Dad!

261
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,320
Dad!

262
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,240
Xie Yue.

263
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,030
Don't let me go if you dare.

264
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,110
If you let me die here!

265
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,300
My dad will find me!

266
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,880
All of you will die!

267
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,430
No.

268
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,430
Everyone must die!

269
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,400
No! Stop shouting!

270
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,600
Stop shouting! No!

271
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,630
You can't leave!

272
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,260
How dare you bite me?

273
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,480
Why didn't you show up earlier?

274
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,410
The war is almost over.

275
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,540
I didn't expect to meet a Chinese like you

276
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,040
in Harbin.

277
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,270
I've only seen

278
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,060
the fearful, numb,

279
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,060
psychotic Maruta.

280
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,030
Maruta? What's what?

281
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,190
Forget it.

282
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,510
Everything is going to end.

283
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,120
Because I'm going home.

284
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,030
Do you really want to know?

285
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,030
What Maruta is?

286
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,520
That's Maruta that has been experimented on.

287
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,630
Tomorrow morning,

288
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,150
your friends

289
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,950
will go through that too.

290
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,870
Mr. Nakamura!

291
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,870
Mr. Nakamura!

292
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,070
Monitor!

293
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,660
606!

294
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,270
It's useless to play such tricks.

295
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,910
You'll all be dealt with tomorrow morning.

296
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,710
According to the rules, there will be an extra meal tonight.

297
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,720
Just wait quietly.

298
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,550
Child...

299
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,150
You have a child too...

300
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,510
Hello?

301
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,410
You haven't found him yet?

302
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,550
He's not home either.

303
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,050
Maybe he doesn't know I'm home early.

304
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,720
Let me know if there's any news.

305
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,950
Who are you?

306
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,350
Who are you?

307
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,050
Don't move!

308
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,740
Give me the gun.

309
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,060
Take out your gun!

310
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,670
Where is Guan Kai?

311
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,550
Take out your gun!

312
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,550
Where is Guan Kai?

313
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,340
Xie Yue!

314
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,230
Xie Yue, what are you doing?

315
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,670
She's Japanese. She deserves to die.

316
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,840
Kill her!

317
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,750
-What are you doing? Are you crazy?
-Kill her!

318
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,550
-Kill her!
-We can't kill her!

319
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,870
If we do we will all die!

320
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,560
If you let her go,

321
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,950
we all have to die.

322
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,590
Are you crazy?

323
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,760
She is Japanese.

324
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,230
She is Japanese!

325
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,750
If you don't kill her, I'll kill you.

326
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,000
Calm down!

327
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,180
I can't calm down!

328
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,590
Xie Yue!

329
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,090
Can't you calm down?

330
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,400
Xie Yue! Xie Yue! Xie Yue!

331
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,750
Xie Yue!

332
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,510
Sister!

333
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,150
Xie Yue... Xie Yue...

334
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,000
Put down your gun.

335
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,950
You can't kill the Japanese.

336
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,280
You can't kill the Japanese... Xie Yue...

337
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,190
-Sister.
-I only have one brother.

338
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,350
Don't get Guan Kai involved.

339
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:34,990
Please.

340
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,190
Go!

341
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,990
-Sister.
-Go! Go!

342
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,430
Sister!

343
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,560
Get as far as you can!

344
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,670
Xie Yue!

345
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,260
You can't kill her.

346
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,390
If I let her go, who will let me go?

347
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,230
Tell me!

348
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,350
If I let her go, who will let me go?

349
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Who let me go?

350
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,180
Did you let me go?

351
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,150
Okay. Okay...

352
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,200
Listen to me.

353
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,230
Kill her.

354
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:11,640
Come on.

355
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,680
Kill her.

356
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,470
Shoot her

357
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,270
in front of me.

358
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,230
Kill her!

359
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,350
Shoot!

360
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,160
Don't push me.

361
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,160
Don't push me.

362
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,560
Don't push me!

363
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
-Shoot!
-Don’t push me!

364
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,230
From the first day we met,

365
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,200
I told you

366
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,190
to stay away from my brother.

367
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,870
Did I tell you?

368
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,640
Go. Go as far as you can.

369
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,940
Never speak about this.

370
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,180
This is not something you can solve.

371
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,840
What should we do?

372
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,310
What should we do?

373
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,160
Do we just wait for our death?

374
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,760
My wife is waiting for me at home.

375
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,180
Our child is less than three years old.

376
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,980
What should we do?

377
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,330
You have an way.

378
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,740
Right?

379
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
You must have a way

380
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,990
to escape.

381
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:43,610
Right?

382
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,160
If you stay in this pit,

383
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,420
there won't be any way.

384
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,590
Let go of 606!

385
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,840
You suddenly moved to our room and talked nonsense.

386
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,200
Who are you?

387
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,960
Don't you know who I am?

388
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,240
I'm Maruta.

389
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,310
You're also Maruta.

390
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,070
We're all damned Marutas.

391
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,880
We are wood.

392
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,880
We are rats waiting to be experimented on.

393
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,390
They're going to kill us.

394
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,890
Did you see those tubes?

395
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,010
It's a poisonous gas tank.

396
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,630
As long as they open the valve,

397
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,020
without having to use a knife nor a sword,

398
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,830
no one needs to come in,

399
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,920
in five minutes,

400
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,790
just five minutes,

401
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,750
everyone in the room will die.

402
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,210
You are my benefactor.

403
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,389
I entrusted my wife and children to you.

404
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,920
Have you forgotten?

405
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,330
You don't have to tell me

406
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,199
where they are.

407
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,310
I only want one word from you.

408
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,870
Are they still alive?

409
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,310
I really don't know.

410
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,630
How could you not know?

411
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,230
I'm not Zhuowen.

412
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,600
I'm his brother.

413
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,710
We're twins.

414
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,630
Twins?

415
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,800
Twins...

416
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,630
I really don't know

417
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,490
where your wife and children are.

418
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,030
I don't know if they are still alive.

419
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,510
But I know my brother.

420
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,400
If he is really your friend,

421
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,690
he would definitely help you.

422
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,470
You are

423
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,390
twins?

424
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,090
My name is Song Zhuowu.

425
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,680
You're also a communist?

426
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,910
You can't win.

427
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,330
You both are not afraid of death.

428
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,590
You keep fighting

429
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,450
but in the end, the Japanese  will just kill us all.

430
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,600
Is it worth it?

431
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,510
If my brother

432
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,630
did anything wrong to you,

433
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,870
I apologize to you as his brother today.

434
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,480
We're all in the same grave. No need to bow.

435
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,640
Do you think someone will make a monument for us?

436
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,230
What will it say?

437
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,000
What do you want them to write?

438
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,410
The anti-Japanese warriors.

439
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,990
606.

440
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,240
Are we anti-Japanese warriors?

441
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,760
We are anti-Japanese warriors!

442
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,560
We are anti-Japanese warriors!

443
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,390
We are anti-Japanese warriors!

444
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,990
We are anti-Japanese warriors!

445
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,700
How shameless...
