00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,890
You need a new business permit

197
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,870
to run a stall long-term.

198
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,800
How can I get it?

199
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,490
Where?

200
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,740
How much?

201
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,820
I'll do it for you.

202
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,780
At the station office.

203
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,020
Deposit of 100.

204
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,670
So expensive.

205
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,070
Hurry!

206
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,390
Don't you see the chief's here?

207
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,390
How about you

208
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,540
come to the warehouse after I get off work?

209
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,370
We can think of a way

210
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,300
together.

211
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,960
Where is it?

212
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,290
-Hurry.
-Right there.

213
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,010
At the end.

214
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,740
Thank you.

215
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,270
Come on.

216
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,530
Miss.

217
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,870
If the deposit is reduced or waived,

218
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,030
get it done quickly.

219
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,340
It'll save you lots of trouble.

220
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,700
Mind your own business.

221
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,550
Hello.

222
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,150
Welcome.

223
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,880
A pack of Concord cigarettes.

224
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,350
Okay.

225
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,570
Here.

226
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,500
I'll pay.

227
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,050
Why'd you pay for my cigarettes?

228
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,590
I forgot my pen.

229
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,810
Let me borrow this.

230
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,440
I'll write an IOU.

231
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,140
If I don't come back to pay,

232
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,340
bring it to me.

233
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,730
Yes.

234
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,310
Thank you.

235
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,370
If I'm not mistaken,

236
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,040
this is a limited-edition

237
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,770
Parker 1922 pen.

238
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,140
It's rare in the market.

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,330
Have you been to Europe?

240
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,310
No.

241
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,470
A senior of mine

242
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,330
gave it to me as a souvenir.

243
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,950
I love this pen.

244
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,340
My pen…

245
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,470
I'll return it to you after

246
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,750
I write a report.

247
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,180
Swindler.

248
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,720
Ms. Guan.

249
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,560
You've searched all the railbeds?

250
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,520
It must've been taken away.

251
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,900
You're so thoughtful.

252
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,130
Is that

253
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,040
a compliment?

254
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,530
What do you think?

255
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,270
While you searched him,

256
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,500
he kept his arms up.

257
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,490
Everything riled him up

258
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,110
back then.

259
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,990
Yet

260
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,490
he's a meek employee now?

261
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,900
Cultured?

262
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,400
Did you look for me?

263
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,540
People have to change

264
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,450
in troubled times.

265
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,860
Ultimately, you have to bow down

266
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,390
to those in power.

267
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,950
Talking about yourself?

268
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,750
As your underling,

269
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,390
my head's always down.

270
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,440
I mean, Song Zhuowen

271
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,820
is brave for being tolerant.

272
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,730
It eliminates weaknesses.

273
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,820
Ms. Guan, you have no weakness

274
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,780
and don't have to be tolerant.

275
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,830
That's scary.

276
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,829
How am I scary?

277
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,849
Even in changing times,

278
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,860
some things don't change.

279
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,140
The superiors didn't agree?

280
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,400
Are you anxious?

281
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,010
Well.

282
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,160
It's a rare opportunity.

283
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,850
Guan Xue holds sway in the Secret Service.

284
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,990
If she agrees,

285
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,590
it'll work...

286
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,550
The problem's not Guan Xue

287
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,470
but you,

288
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,110
you know?

289
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,390
Are you ready?

290
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,540
Yes.

291
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,150
Who is Guan Xue?

292
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,060
The ruthless one of Harbin's Secret Service,

293
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,420
in control of finances and personnel.

294
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,800
I can join them

295
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,180
with her consent…

296
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,430
Who is Guan Xue?

297
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,840
Is her family name Guan?

298
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,310
Suwan Guwalgiya.

299
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,340
A centuries-old Manchu surname

300
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,220
and clan

301
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,250
under the Bordered Yellow Banner,

302
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,820
existing since the five founding ministers

303
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,790
of Qing dynasty.

304
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,950
About her and your brother,

305
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,880
what do you know?

306
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,720
Not much.

307
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,910
My brother saved her.

308
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,520
But it doesn't matter.

309
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,080
They couldn't have been together

310
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,930
for long.

311
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,240
She didn't even know his name.

312
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,950
I doubt

313
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,480
she knows much more about him.

314
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,650
When did he save her?

315
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,500
Where?

316
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,350
How?

317
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,320
And where's he now?

318
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,070
He's probably dead.

319
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,200
Probably?

320
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,920
That's the most unreliable word

321
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,710
for underground members.

322
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,190
It's taboo.

323
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,910
Always bear in mind

324
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,870
the "what ifs".

325
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,310
The Secret Service

326
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,950
is impenetrable.

327
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,090
This is a rare golden opportunity.

328
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,230
If it works out,

329
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,550
it's worth the risk.

330
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,550
Risks can't be eliminated,

331
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,730
but they have to be minimized.

332
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,090
This is the principle

333
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,820
of work and the organization.

334
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,720
Yes.

335
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,210
The superiors approved it.

336
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,270
If the superiors approve it,

337
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,110
that means we can do it,

338
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,310
but we need to know when

339
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,980
and how to do it.

340
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,700
[Harbin Train Station Shipping Warehouse]

341
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,640
Anyone here?

342
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,550
Anyone here?

343
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,440
Section Chief.

344
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,710
Unit Chief Pan.

345
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,510
Section Chief.

346
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,850
Is there anyone good among the new recruits this year?

347
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,050
With all due respect,

348
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,670
there aren't many

349
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,710
good talents who are willing to work in our field

350
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,350
nowadays.

351
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,010
They're all not smart enough.

352
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,020
Let me cut the queue.

353
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,900
Tian Xiaojiang?

354
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,050
Why isn't your blood type filled in?

355
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,510
The doctor forgot to fill it in. I have type O.

356
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,190
You can't put type O just because you say so.

357
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,300
I do have type O.

358
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,260
Let's take a blood test.

359
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,410
No, doctor. No need.

360
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,510
My father is type O.

361
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,170
My mother is type O.

362
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,430
I'm definitely type O.

363
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,790
If you're a man, then do a blood test.

364
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,670
Let's do it again.

365
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,080
Just grit your teeth and it'll be over.

366
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,420
What does this have to do with you?

367
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,280
What does this have to do with you?

368
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,070
Everyone is waiting.

369
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,830
I know.

370
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,470
I get dizzy from needles, doctor.

371
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,560
I'll be quick. Just a moment.

372
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,550
-I really get dizzy.
-You’re a man.

373
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,480
I'm telling you for the last time that I'll get dizzy.

374
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,200
What about Song Zhuowen?

375
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,310
Do you think he's smart enough?

376
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,030
That's a good question.

377
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,860
Aren't we having dinner together tonight?

378
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,830
Take a look at him for me.

379
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,350
You...

380
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,180
I said my father has type O.

381
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,110
My mother has type O.

382
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,710
Of course I'm type O.

383
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,820
We can't work with you like this.

384
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,200
What are you

385
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,130
yelling about?

386
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,750
The blood type is not filled out,

387
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,610
but he won't let me draw his blood.

388
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,210
What's your blood type?

389
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:29,730
O.

390
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,800
Fill it in for him. O.

391
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,570
Thank you, Official.

392
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,130
Why are you always so excited?

393
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,300
Anyone here?

394
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,630
Anyone here?

395
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,190
Open the door!

396
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,140
Open the door!

397
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,530
Open the door!

398
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,990
Open the door!

399
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,950
Before, you walked behind me to block the bullets for me.

400
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,960
Now, you have a gun.

401
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,280
You don't need my help.

402
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,060
Those who survive disasters will have a good fortune later.

403
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,220
Other than me,

404
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,860
there's someone else dreaming to meet you today.

405
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,740
Who?

406
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,200
They're here.

407
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,240
Let me introduce him.

408
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,800
This is my savior, Zhuowen.

409
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,030
Zhuowen, here.

410
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,500
Jin.

411
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,760
Can you introduce everyone?

412
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,740
Have a seat.

413
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,400
Chief of the Intelligence Unit, Pan Yue.

414
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,250
You met him before.

415
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,760
Yes.

416
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,610
Liu Fei from the Chief of the Monitoring Unit,

417
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,640
Li from the Firearms Department,

418
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,720
and I'm Jin Qingyuan

419
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,880
from the General Affairs Section.

420
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,390
Zhuowen looks so handsome.

421
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,610
He looks like a movie star.

422
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,490
Seriously.

423
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,610
Like the movie star

424
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,430
Pu Ke.

425
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,630
I'm just a laborer who patrols the streets.

426
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,760
Don't make fun of me.

427
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,360
Section Chief Guan.

428
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,190
Section Chief Guan.

429
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,100
Why don't you propose a toast?

430
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,780
Where is Hu Bin?

431
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,040
Forcing Shi to testify.

432
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:57,860
Come.

433
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,420
Section Chief...

434
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,500
Do the toast in Hu Bin's place.

435
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,260
No.

436
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,140
No matter what, you should do the first toast.

437
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,400
It doesn't matter.

438
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,020
Hurry up. Fill up her cup.

439
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,520
You all eat first.

440
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,980
I'll clean this up.

441
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,200
Here, Zhuowen.

442
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,120
Fill it up.

443
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,860
Thank you.

444
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,780
There.

445
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,370
Why didn't you wait for me for the first cup?

446
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,740
Don't give us a pre-emptive strike.

447
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,540
Everyone knew you were interrogating Shi.

448
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,620
How was it? It took you all day.

449
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,630
Did you get anything out of him?

450
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,230
Mr. Shi is tight-lipped.

451
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,170
I have to deal with him when I get back later.

452
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,440
Come on. What are you waiting for? I'm here.

453
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,040
Pour it up.

454
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,230
Unit Chief Hu,

455
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,460
today is Section Chief Guan's party.

456
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,340
We should know

457
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,830
what to do.

458
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,930
Yes.

459
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,220
What's the topic today?

460
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,070
Yes.

461
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,800
You are Section Chief Guan's savior.

462
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,980
Hurry up.

463
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,770
Since she's not here,

464
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,510
we're all men here. Tell us.

465
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,950
Tell you what?

466
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,300
How did you save her?

467
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,190
What did you do afterward?

468
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,450
What do you mean? I don't understand.

469
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,390
You're so pretentious.

470
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,430
You're even more tight-lipped than Shi.

471
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,550
Just tell us the truth.

472
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,190
Did you two...

473
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,180
Bin.

474
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,490
Kai.

475
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,610
Mr. Jin.

476
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,260
Wen!

477
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,760
Wen.

478
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,840
Let me take a look.

479
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,000
You've grown up.

480
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,590
I almost couldn't recognize you.

481
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,520
Here.

482
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,800
Kai, you’re a man.

483
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,230
Why are you crying?

484
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,820
Kai.

485
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,130
I told you I'll give you a surprise today.

486
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,400
Wen, where have you been these years?

487
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,140
Why didn't you come find us?

488
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,820
Kai,

489
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,220
he's not leaving anymore.

490
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,650
You'll have plenty of time to talk.

491
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,520
Let's drink and eat happily today.

492
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,870
Let’s eat up.

493
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:42,930
-Come on.
-Kai,

494
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,170
your sister is right.

495
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,070
We have a table full of good dishes and wine.

496
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,600
Don't flavor it with tears.

497
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,150
Zhuowen,

498
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,560
you should propose a toast first.

499
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,030
Okay.

500
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,050
Then I'll toast Unit Chief Hu first.

501
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,690
Sorry,

502
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,210
I hurt my hand.

503
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,590
I can't hold a cup.

504
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,710
Unit Chief Hu's hand

505
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,170
was injured when he went on a mission with me.

506
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,280
Then I'll drink it. You don't have to.

507
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,450
Okay.

508
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,480
I have a favor to ask.

509
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,670
Everyone in the Secret Service

510
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,310
knows that you're skilled.

511
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,750
Am I right, Section Chief Guan?

512
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,660
I was young back then

513
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,200
and didn't know the limit.

514
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,110
There's a lot of empty space in the back.

515
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,190
I'm not afraid of embarrassing myself.

516
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,920
I can be your training partner.

517
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,560
Zhuowen,

518
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,530
show us how it's done.

519
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,200
Come on. It's better to be beaten to death

520
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,380
than be scared to death.

521
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,020
Hu Bin.

522
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,740
This is a family banquet.

523
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,180
Everyone's here to drink happily.

524
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,130
Don't make a scene.

525
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,500
I've never seen Section Chief

526
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,450
be so protective of someone before.

527
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,770
You've seen it today.

528
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,450
Okay, Section Chief Guan,

529
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,150
everyone, take your time.

530
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,030
Unit Chief Pan.

531
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,830
I'll go back and keep Shi company.

532
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,620
Make way.

533
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,870
It's clear.

534
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,630
Someone came in to steal things.

535
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,090
He came in from here first.

536
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,890
When he jumped out,

537
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,340
Watanabe discovered him,

538
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,070
so he could only kill Watanabe.

539
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,620
If I'm not mistaken,

540
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,080
his wallet was stolen too.

541
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,260
Section Chief Guan,

542
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,990
this kind of case should be handled by the Public Security Section.

543
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,260
The Japanese are precious.

544
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,910
Even the Military Police

545
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,530
have deployed everyone, let alone the Police Agency.

546
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,420
Was he crazy?

547
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,250
You can steal,

548
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,310
but don't kill a Japanese man.

549
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,130
This is trouble.

550
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,870
Xi Shi.

551
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,740
What?

552
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,880
Cotton swab.

553
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,540
Pan Yue.

554
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,750
Look what this is.

555
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,400
Blood clots?

556
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,910
It's ink.

557
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,310
Guan Xue was in Japan for four years.

558
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,030
The comrade in charge of background checks

559
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,770
only got to the East Asia Common Culture Society

560
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,300
before the trail went cold.

561
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,230
You can keep in touch with her

562
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,480
and try to figure out her true stance.

563
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,489
Have you checked here?

564
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,020
Yes, a bag of rice was lost.

565
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,429
For a bag of rice,

566
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,909
the murderer dared to kill a Japanese man?

567
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,540
I don't think he killed him

568
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,469
in order to steal.

569
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,830
It was to save someone.

570
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,980
Save a woman?

571
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,110
Where did this woman come from?

572
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,350
As far as I know,

573
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,139
Sheriff Watanabe

574
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,750
didn't interact much with all the Chinese people

575
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,830
of this warehouse,

576
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,870
but he volunteered to take this shift.

577
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,670
It's obvious that he wanted to get the worker away.

578
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,280
Ms. Guan,

579
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,990
what you just smelled

580
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,870
was Xi Shi vanishing cream.

581
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,190
That's the cheapest

582
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,990
vanishing cream sold in Harbin.

583
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,870
Watanabe

584
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,520
was probably waiting

585
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
for the woman who used the vanishing cream.

586
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,630
Sorry to keep you waiting.

587
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,390
You're here.

588
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,640
Please come in.

589
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,370
You just need to fill out a form.

590
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,720
Please come in.

591
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,070
I've prepared it for you.

592
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,440
Just fill out the form.

593
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,930
Come on, baby.

594
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,750
I see you.

595
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,200
Stop hiding.

596
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,520
You won't escape.

597
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,450
Watanabe was killed by her?

598
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,810
There was more than one person who killed Watanabe.

599
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,940
Watanabe's wound is covered with ink,

600
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,570
but it wasn't a one-time injury.

601
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
The first attack

602
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,290
damaged part of his tracheotomy,

603
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,740
but it was not fatal.

604
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,980
At most, it made it hard for Watanabe to breathe

605
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,220
and immobilized him.

606
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,570
The man who was locked in this room

607
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,290
was not ordinary.

608
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:54,970
It was him.

609
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,580
He stabbed the pen deeper

610
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,440
into Watanabe's neck.

611
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,550
I'm guessing he knew Watanabe.

612
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,310
Why?

613
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,000
There are a few strands

614
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,150
of the woman's hair in Watanabe's fingers,

615
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,510
but there are

616
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,450
no clear markings

617
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,730
caused by resistance.

618
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,870
This means he was completely unprepared

619
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,950
when he was attacked the second time.

620
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,670
So I think the murderer was...

621
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,290
It's hard to confirm if it was a badger game, like you said,

622
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,110
because we don't know if the man and woman

623
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,580
left together.

624
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,750
He was a smart man.

625
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,290
He covered the scene with flour

626
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,760
to cover up all the traces.

627
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,150
Then he moved Watanabe's body

628
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,830
to another warehouse

629
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,550
and made it look like a thief killed him.

630
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,120
In the end, he even took a bag of rice

631
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,760
and left through the door.

632
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,290
Did Sheriff Watanabe usually carry a pen?

633
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,650
I've never seen it.

634
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,440
If he didn't carry a pen,

635
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,750
then where did he get this one?

636
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,140
It's the murderer's.

637
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,840
Is it fun to patrol the railway?

638
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,690
It's just to make a living.

639
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,800
Come to the Secret Service.

640
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,240
I'm in charge here.

641
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,580
Of course,

642
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,440
you have to pass the entry exam.

643
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,530
Sure. I'll give it a try if you say so.

644
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,870
Mr. Song.

645
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,030
You're pretty skilled.

646
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,570
Most women

647
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,940
are defenseless against your eyes.

648
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,670
It's all thanks to Ms. Guan.

649
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,900
Watanabe's body isn't completely cold yet.

650
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,430
Where were you

651
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,070
before dinner?

652
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,240
Mr. Hu, what do you mean?

653
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,370
Why are you nervous?

654
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,010
Can't I ask?

655
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,670
You've been aggressive

656
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,760
since we met today.

657
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,440
You are right.

658
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,700
Making things up

659
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,690
and using lies and threats

660
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,750
is what I'm best at.

661
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,580
I've been classmates with Section Chief Guan

662
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,120
since we got trained in Japan.

663
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,310
You'll never be able to catch up

664
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,870
to what I've done for her.

665
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,650
So, you have to be more careful in the future.

666
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,380
It's not up to you whether I get into the Secret Service or not.

667
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,060
Go say all this dirty nonsense

668
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,490
in front Ms. Guan.
