00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,090
Please have it.

5
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,190
Thank you.

6
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,370
I'm a Secret Service Operations agent,

7
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,620
-Song Zhuowen.
-The gift is in the car.

8
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,630
Go get it.

9
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,860
How did you deduce

10
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,240
Manchukuo's Robin Hood's hideout?

11
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,030
I put myself in his shoes.

12
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,630
If I were him,

13
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,690
what would I do?

14
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,680
Making good use of your heart.

15
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,220
Well done.

16
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,820
Keep it up.

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,740
I have a request.

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,270
Go on.

19
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,030
I want to transfer

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,840
to the Intelligence Unit.

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,530
I think I'm a better fit there.

22
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,970
I'm not the person to ask.

23
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:32,460
Ms. Guan's in charge of this.

24
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,710
Ms. Guan.

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,450
Where did you find this young man?

26
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,430
My mentor in Japan told me

27
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,990
it's not about how you manage or use your men

28
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,470
but finding the right men.

29
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,350
You've found a talent.

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,380
I'm sure you'll use him well.

31
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,940
Can you

32
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,120
arrange flowers?

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,490
If it's an order,

34
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,590
I'll learn it.

35
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,310
Learn by doing it. Go on.

36
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,220
Yes.

37
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,020
Ms. Guan.

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,890
Let's go upstairs.

39
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,910
Ms. Guan.

40
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,250
Where is this?

41
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,480
Manchukuo's secret military fortress

42
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,790
on the Manchukuo-USSR border.

43
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,840
To defend against Soviet attacks?

44
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,490
Their attack is just a matter of time.

45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,230
The key is when

46
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,830
and how much time we'll have.

47
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,380
These photos

48
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,480
will help them locate the key breakthrough points.

49
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,650
Of course they'll try to pinpoint our weakness

50
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,510
through such intel.

51
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,820
But it's not that simple.

52
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,700
No one knows if

53
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,530
these are the only photos.

54
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,270
I believe there are spies everywhere

55
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,230
in the vast land of Manchukuo.

56
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,900
This film roll you intercepted

57
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,930
is valuable,

58
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,230
as it exposed the flaws

59
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,670
in our security.

60
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,700
I've reported it to the headquarters

61
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,590
to eliminate any channels that may leak intel.

[Construction Plan]

63
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,430
Asano's arrived.

64
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,650
The former chief hasn't been transferred

65
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,120
or handed over his work.

66
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,560
He's working in an official residence.

67
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,090
The intel should be there.

68
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,140
The house was built in 1935,

69
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,170
ten years ago.

70
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,470
Okada Co., Ltd. designed it.

71
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,620
The Construction Bureau built it.

72
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,730
Two restrooms on the first floor.

73
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,260
More people use the one near the living room

74
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,200
than the one near the backyard.

75
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,780
All sorts of people will be at the ball.

76
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,340
It's impossible

77
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,950
to divert everyone's attention.

78
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,950
Asano's office and bedroom are on the second floor.

79
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,490
They'll be guarded.

80
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,470
I have to

81
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,870
design a second plan.

82
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,570
The cocktail party in two days

83
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,850
should be held in the first-floor lobby.

84
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,740
This is the only stairway

85
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,120
to the second floor.

86
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,370
This semicircle's the second-floor platform,

87
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,950
with hallways on both ends.

88
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,780
Asano's study

89
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,300
should be here.

90
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,110
Are you sure the film roll is on this floor?

91
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,980
Yes.

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,170
Is his study usually locked?

93
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,760
We need to

94
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,490
assume all rooms are locked.

95
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,260
Tiger lock.

96
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,800
It's easy to pick.

97
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,500
Are you confident

98
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,610
about the safe?

99
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,420
Same logic.

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,750
Don't trust me?

101
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,340
How do you think

102
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,510
I escaped from the Japanese prison?

103
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,470
How long will it take

104
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,620
to open the safe?

105
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,390
One or two minutes.

106
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,670
Be exact.

107
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,630
1.5 minutes, okay?

108
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,140
1.5 minutes for picking the lock.

109
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,510
Then taking photos.

110
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,670
Zhuowu's been approved for this operation.

The mission must be cleared

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,560
in five minutes,

113
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,290
so you can leave safely.

114
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,280
I still have to get you a tooth.

115
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,590
You two are identical.

116
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,510
In the same clothes and behavior,

117
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,280
only gods can tell you apart.

118
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,790
I...

119
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,460
I can't.

120
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,320
Xue, I'm back.

121
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,030
Come help me.

122
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,240
How does this look?

123
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,110
Hurry.

124
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,700
Look.

125
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,230
It's so improper.

126
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,860
Really?

127
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,690
You know this word?

128
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,340
Fine.

129
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,630
A ball?

130
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,320
Zhuowen's going too?

131
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,110
Yes.

132
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,750
At his age...

133
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,870
Do men always like

134
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,780
young girls?

135
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,220
What do you mean?

136
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,190
Keeping something from me?

137
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,690
First, I've nothing.

138
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,880
Second, I won't tell you anyway.

139
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,550
This one?

140
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,690
You have no taste.

141
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,820
You should

142
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,070
find him a proper partner.

143
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,070
Proper?

144
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,410
Has he been improper?

145
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,180
Not really.

146
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,860
But he's getting old.

147
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,260
Me too.

148
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,600
Why don't you care about me?

149
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,530
Can I interfere with you?

150
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,970
Fine. Care for me now.

151
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,180
Do you think

152
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,270
Zhuowen and I are a good match?

153
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,310
Well...

154
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,780
I...

155
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,660
See?

156
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,590
You stutter

157
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,150
when it comes me.

158
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,260
Be honest.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,820
What are you keeping from me?

160
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,030
He came to my school.

161
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,430
For what?

162
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,580
Looking for a girl.

163
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,540
Who?

164
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,800
I don't know her.

165
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,590
Look how jealous you are.

166
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,410
If you don't know her,

167
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,930
why are you beating around the bush

168
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,200
and making a fuss?

169
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,630
Is she pretty?

170
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,190
What's her major?

171
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,300
Xue.

172
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,850
Don't interrogate me!

173
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,480
From your department?

174
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,440
How old is she?

175
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,390
What's improper?

176
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,750
Ms. Guan, you're here.

177
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Where's Mr. Song?

178
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,270
Changing inside.

179
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,470
Nice.

180
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,710
You sure?

181
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,560
Men have to be confident.

182
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,290
Who bought you the clothes?

183
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,710
I bought it myself,

184
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,710
of course.

185
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,460
Do you want the truth?

186
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,990
Be frank.

187
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,430
Your grey suit is

188
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,210
a bit tacky.

189
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,870
Like the nouveau riche from Mukden.

190
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,020
Really?

191
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,340
It's decent.

192
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,270
Here, try it.

193
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,830
I bought it.

194
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,430
Is there time?

195
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,220
Yes.

196
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,140
I came early. We're fine.

197
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,270
It's not the clothes.

198
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,270
I'm tacky.

199
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,470
Forget it.

200
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,530
Listen to me.

201
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,110
You have to dress well

202
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,330
as you represent the Secret Service.

203
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,290
You two are identical.

204
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,490
In the same clothes and behavior,

205
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,100
only gods can tell you apart.

206
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,570
I can't.

207
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,290
It's the same.

208
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,460
Wait.

209
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,460
Raise your arms.

210
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,010
What's wrong?

211
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,640
Change back.

212
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,090
Harbin's best clothing store

213
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,780
sells ripped clothes.

214
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,380
I'll go complain tomorrow.

215
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,710
In troubled times,

216
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,390
everyone's distracted at work.

217
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,350
-We must be an exception.
-Mr. Song.

218
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,900
You forgot your wallet.

219
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,630
Let me guess

220
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,190
what's in his wallet.

221
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,180
Curious how much I have?

222
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,450
I guess there's a girl's photo in it.

223
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,860
I bet it's a girl.

224
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,630
My parents.

225
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,180
Is this your brother?

226
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,500
Why did you tear it?

227
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,430
Out of anger.

228
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,610
I hated him so much.

229
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,900
What made you so angry?

230
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,270
Can I not say?

231
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
So you don't keep girls' photos?

232
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,670
I am

233
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,500
a loner.

234
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,080
All my relationships are brief

235
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,550
and transactional.

236
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,580
Special agents share one weakness:

237
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,310
We're bound to make enemies.

238
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,950
Friends are useful.

239
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,250
But don't fool around too much.

240
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,300
Treatment

241
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,200
for diseases are costly.

242
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,430
You know that too?

243
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,290
All's hard-earned.

244
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,460
Never go all the way in a path.

245
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,580
Yes, Ms. Guan.

246
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,280
Squirrel Hunt Operation.

247
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,600
You may begin.

248
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,819
Section Chief!

249
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,880
Long time no see.

250
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,420
Unit Chief Pan, Zhuowen.

251
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,510
Nice.

252
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,380
Hello.

253
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,210
Hello.

254
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,530
Department Director.

255
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,349
-Ms. Guan, long time no see.
-Long time no see.

256
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,190
Ms. Guan!

257
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,300
It's my honor.

258
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,350
Look.

259
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,910
To be successful,

260
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,430
networking is just as important

261
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,210
as doing your job well.

262
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,870
I really don't know anyone.

263
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,090
Unless you'd help me pull strings.

264
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,700
That's easy.

265
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,880
What's hard is learning to bow down

266
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,930
and fawn on others

267
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,130
to make them like you.

268
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,810
I'll practice on you first

269
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,360
and make you like me.

270
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,790
I didn't expect

271
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,590
you

272
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,260
to even know how to flirt.

273
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,420
You dance well too.

274
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,120
The older men get,

275
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,670
the less prideful they are.

276
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,300
I already kinda look down on myself.

277
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,540
Kneeling to survive.

278
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,110
Using flattery to climb the ranks.

279
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,760
It's not disgraceful.

280
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,380
I can only

281
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,430
bow down to you.

282
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,460
The two men I care about the most

283
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
is you

284
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,920
and Guan Kai.

285
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,130
As long as you don't lie to me,

286
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,660
I can even give you my house key.

287
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,700
You stepped on my foot.

288
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,000
What's wrong?

289
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,020
Hand it over.

290
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,710
What?

291
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,490
The gun.

292
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,990
Relax.

293
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,310
I won't shoot.

294
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,070
Don't be rash.

295
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,060
In three minutes,

296
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,820
we must retreat even if we fail.

297
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,140
It's enough time.

298
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
Don't worry.

299
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,260
Let's go.

300
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,280
Start!

301
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,070
Let's go.

302
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,550
What an eye-opener.

303
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,660
What an eye-opener.

304
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,200
What an eye-opener.

305
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,520
What do you mean?

306
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,330
Good at fighting,

307
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,740
writing,

308
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,660
and dancing.

309
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,150
Cultured and valiant.

310
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,300
No wonder Ms. Guan's fond of you.

311
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,730
I can't dance.

312
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,160
I was flailing about.

313
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,770
You mustn't have noticed

314
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,570
that the Japanese girls

315
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,960
staring at you

316
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,860
were starry-eyed.

317
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,130
Don't tease me.

318
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,000
Everyone in Harbin knows

319
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,890
you're the Secret Service's homme fatale.

320
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,250
Is that so?

321
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,970
Ladies and gentlemen,

322
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,980
please settle down.

323
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,300
Next,

324
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,150
Mr. Asano Diago

325
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,470
will say a few words.

326
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,390
Tonight,

327
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,790
I'm honored

328
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,580
to have so many distinguished guests

329
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,100
at

330
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,150
my place.

331
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,160
Thank you very much.

332
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,830
As you know,

333
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,360
the security and espionage situation isn't optimistic.

334
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,860
Not just in Harbin but the entire Manchukuo.

335
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,970
I come to Harbin

336
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,950
with heavy shoulders.

337
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,170
But please trust that

338
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,120
the military and political worlds

339
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,500
are united with unprecedented sincerity

340
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,700
to solve this problem together.

341
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,510
In the near future,

342
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,870
we will bring

343
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,220
peace and prosperity

344
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,260
to this beautiful city!

345
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,640
Please look forward to it.

346
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,830
Cheers!

347
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,470
Cheers!

348
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,620
Cheers!

349
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,190
Cheers!

350
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,600
What's wrong?

351
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,660
I heard something.

352
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,540
-Nothing.
-A shadow!

353
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,030
A shadow.

354
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,390
Where?

355
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,370
Ms. Guan, thanks for your concern.

356
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,640
I haven't visited in a long time.

357
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,810
Greet her for me.

358
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,260
Okay.

359
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,800
Excuse me.

360
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,840
I'll leave you to it.

361
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,340
Ms. Guan.

362
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,370
I've drafted a report.

363
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,220
Please give me some advice.

364
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,920
Follow me

365
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,870
up to the study.

366
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,510
Sure.

369
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,350
A power outage?

Harada!

371
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,310
Harada!

372
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,280
Yes!

373
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,490
I'm sorry, Mr. Asano.

374
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,850
What happened?

375
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,110
Mr. Asano, someone's checking the electrical room.

376
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,180
Don't panic.

377
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,150
Something's wrong with the circuit.

378
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,290
It'll be fixed soon.

379
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,220
Someone was in here.

380
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,140
Mr. Pan! Pan Yue!

381
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,240
Ms. Guan!

382
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,950
Guard all exits of the mansion.

383

384
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,050
Yes.

Hu Bin.

386
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,810
The rest, split into two teams.

387
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,100
I'll lead a team to search the second floor.

388
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,300
You, lead them on the first floor.

389
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,010
Understand?

390
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,480
Yes.

391
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,450
Operations agents, follow me.

392
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,250
What's going on?

393
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:46,720
Yeah.

394
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,480
Trapping us in a blackout?

395
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,260
What are they looking for?

396
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,530
What's going on?

397
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,500
Guard the door.

398
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,870
What's wrong with you?

399
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,650
That way!

400
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,000
Song Zhuowen!

401
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,180
Search inside! Where are you going?

402
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,250
Come with me.

403
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,020
Hurry! Come on!

404
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,320
Search up there.

405
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,820
Ms. Guan.

406
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,630
No persons or cars can leave.

407
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,380
Register all identities.

408
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,710
Yes.

409
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,160
Where's Song Zhuowen?

410
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,190
Zhuowen!

411
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,630
Zhuowen, go in and check.

412
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,270
I think he went down with Ms. Guan.

413
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,060
Zhuowen!

414
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,870
Here.

415
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,340
Get in.

416
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,460
Ms. Guan!

417
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,480
How do I investigate?

418
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,400
Don't embarrass yourself.

419
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,720
We're all prestigious people.

420
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,890
Just register them.

421
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,860
Check the cars carefully.

422
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:38,980
Yes.

423
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,600
Mr. Asano.

424
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,940
Nothing was stolen.

425
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,550
We've searched every corner.

426
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,430
There's no suspicious person.

427
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:35,980
I see.

428
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,480
I'll take my leave.

429
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,380
Nobody move.

430
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,940
Turn right onto Jiao's graveyard.

431
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:28,910
Buddy.

432
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,720
Can we talk?

433
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,360
Then let's die together.

434
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,070
Calm down.

435
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,260
You'll be worse off if you kill us.

436
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,530
The city will declare martial law.
How will you escape?

437
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,760
Let's make a deal.

438
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,180
Stop the car.

439
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,690
Listen to him!

440
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,000
Stop the car!

441
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,340
Get off.

442
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,460
Don't look back!

443
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,100
Keep going!

444
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,909
I'll shoot whoever turns around!

445
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,870
Come in and rest.

446
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,610
-I’ll get a car for you.
-Can I stay for the night?

447
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,310
Forget it.

448
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,750
It's your house.

449
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,830
It's not inconvenient.

450
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,800
You think too much.

451
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,310
I wanna stay here

452
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,510
to avoid my phone calls.

453
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,630
♫Silent night sky♫

454
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,320
♫Entangling wind; melting again♫

455
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,050
♫I can't find your traces♫

456
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,080
♫One second♫

457
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,420
♫Stars engulf the sky♫

458
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,220
♫Sleepwalking after a nap♫

459
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,900
♫In the fog♫

460
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,180
♫Your face♫

461
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,720
♫Silent undercurrent♫

462
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:46,390
♫Over countless mountains♫

463
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,500
♫Your lone courage to traverse the turbid waves♫

464
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,270
♫I understand♫

465
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,700
♫More touching hugs♫

466
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,390
Where are you going?

467
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,480
To get Ms. Guan some undergarment.

468
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,910
Do you want some food?

469
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,230
Whatever's at home.

470
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,100
I have Ms. Guan's favorites.

471
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,130
Up to you.

472
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:35,690
Aunt Chang.

473
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,310
How did you know Ms. Guan?

474
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,270
We were introduced

475
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,430
by Mr. Jin of the Secret Service.

476
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,910
Why didn't you

477
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,310
stay in Ms. Guan's house?

478
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,420
Actually,

479
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,970
Ms. Guan doesn't like strangers.

480
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,300
Ms. Guan.

481
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:04,650
Ms. Guan.

482
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,020
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,730
I'm sorry.

484
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,670
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,370
I'm sorry.

486
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,650
I'm sorry.

487
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,070
If your daughter's in trouble,

488
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,520
just come to me.

489
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,260
No, no.

490
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,550
No.

491
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,460
Don't take Mr. Song's stuff.

492
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,950
I'm sorry.

493
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,710
I'm sorry.

494
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,250
I won't do it again.

495
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,220
I wish I had a mom like you.

496
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,380
Have something warm.

497
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,660
My first time seeing her

498
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,200
in such a mess.

499
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,180
She's just a girl after all.

500
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,320
She lost her parents at the age of ten

501
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,430
and even has a younger brother.

502
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,020
Just a lost soul in troubled times.
