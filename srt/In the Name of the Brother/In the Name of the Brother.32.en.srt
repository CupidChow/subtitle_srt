[Episode 32]

4
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,310
Squirrel.

5
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,530
If anyone brings a child to the mountain lately,

6
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,900
find out immediately

7
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,400
who helped them escape

8
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,230
from the Water Department.

9
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,210
Are you here to collect wild wood ear?

10
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,430
No.

11
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,810
We only deal with leather.

12
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,610
Mountain goods are dealed quickly!

13
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,890
It's more profitable than leather goods!

14
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,240
My leather shop's passed down from my ancestors.

15
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,500
I can't change trades.

16
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,310
I repeat.

17
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,450
Tell no one about how

18
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,390
we broke out of the encirclement

19
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,300
and escaped

20
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,600
to the mountains.

21
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,710
Okay.

22
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,590
Hello.

23
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,990
Thank you for your hard work.

24
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,710
Let's go.

25
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,810
Let's go.

26
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,460
Buddy.

27
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,390
I've something to ask you.

28
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,910
When did Mr. Hu come back two days ago?

29
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,220
It was late. I'm sure it was dark.

30
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,180
I want the exact time.

31
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,710
The residents in my building

32
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,150
come and go a lot.

33
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,420
How can I remember exactly?

34
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,880
Think again.

35
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,850
Did anything happen

36
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,320
or did anyone say anything?

37
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,910
Or did you see anyone

38
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,590
in the building

39
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,820
who comes and goes at a fixed time?

40
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,590
What were you doing then?

41
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,860
R-R-Right.

42
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,190
When Mr. Hu entered the gate,

43
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,120
I was listening to the radio.

44
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,590
Ganlu Temple just started playing.

45
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,420
Is this the daily radio program?

46
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,230
I want to ask

47
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,120
what time

48
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,350
Ganlu Temple was aired two days ago.

49
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,980
Hu Bin left home at 8:20 p.m.

50
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,270
The radio aired Ganlu Temple

51
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,270
at 9 p.m.

52
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,460
There were 40 minutes in between.

53
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,720
Ten minutes to hide the gun.

54
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,760
Besides waiting at the traffic light,

55
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,280
it's within a range of 20 km at most.

56
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,200
When Wu gets

57
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,850
the list of names and addresses

58
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,800
of his acquaintances,

59
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,400
we can start investigating.

60
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,590
When it involves Kai,

61
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,220
I can't think straight.

62
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,550
Isn't he your brother?

63
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,540
It's the same for anyone.

64
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,280
You can't be objective when you're emotionally invested.

65
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,020
It's normal.

66
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,310
Since the last letter from down the mountain,

67
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,290
we've checked several times.

68
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,690
But apart from

69
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,910
Qiao Er who Zhuowu killed,

70
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,730
no one else was a mole.

71
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,860
Looks like we've to start investigating again.

72
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,450
Where's the comrade from down the mountain?

73
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,570
Commissar Fang.

74
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,310
Qian.

75
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,680
Are you Broomstick?

76
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,020
Bro Qian?

77
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,159
You're the comrade from down the mountain?

78
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,740
I didn't expect to see you here.

79
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,300
He was a Counter-Japanese soldier!

80
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,940
I thought you were long gone.

81
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,860
I'm lucky.

82
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,900
Come on, sit!

83
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,990
You sit.

84
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,630
You came all the way here.

85
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,730
Sit now! Hurry!

86
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,590
Sit!

87
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,940
Don’t you know him?

88
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,460
After the Mukden incident,

89
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,100
the Japanese seized Manchuria.

90
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,830
Deng Tiemei and Miao Kexiu had been martyred.

91
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,080
Even someone like Cheng Bin defected.

92
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,140
He's a Counter-Japanese hero.

93
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,910
It's all in the past. Don't mention it.

94
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,980
You're so lucky.

95
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,540
Hurry, fly over here!

96
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,480
Wait for me!

97
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,100
Let me catch you!

98
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,590
Fly!

99
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,300
Fly!

100
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,550
You too.

101
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,940
Fly!

102
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,030
Come here.

103
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,530
The wind's direction has changed.

104
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,550
Almost.

105
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,550
Let me catch it.

106
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,490
Look above!

107
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,330
Comrades.

108
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,610
I'm infected by the plague spread by the Japanese.

109
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,220
So I'm leaving you.

110
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,100
Remember,

111
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,820
don't look for me

112
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,990
or touch anything I used.

113
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,930
Let me reiterate.

114
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,310
Qian Chongli and I were each other's only contact.

115
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,900
He risked his life to come up the mountain.

116
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,350
He's not idle.

117
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,070
It's time to find the mole.

118
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,830
We can't delay it any longer.

119
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,590
Fang, we have seven teams.

120
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,080
We still have to check them one by one.

121
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,980
Let's start with the four of us.

122
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,970
Bro Qian.

123
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,180
Let me ask you.

124
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,230
Some time ago,

125
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,580
a Song Zhuowu came from down the mountain.

126
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,700
Do you know?

127
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,060
If he hadn't violated the organization's rules,

128
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,960
we might have found the mole.

129
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,840
I was in charge of this.

130
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,090
I have nothing to explain.

131
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,460
Since I joined the organization,

132
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,120
I've been with the commissar.

133
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,690
There is a rule in intel work.

134
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,980
After ruling everyone out,

135
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,980
believe it or not,

136
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,250
the last one remaining...

137
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,780
is the traitor.

138
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,710
I see, Qian.

139
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,000
Commissar.

140
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,590
Let’s arrange to check the next team.

141
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,450
Why are you looking at me?

142
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,280
Are you suspecting me?

143
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,450
Ma Fumin, fellow townsman, No. 85 Tiandi Street.

144
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,850
Chen Dazhi, a friend before joining the police,

145
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,760
No. 152 Songjiang Street.

146
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,210
Wu Zi'ang, elementary school classmate,

147
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,950
No. 115 Liudao Street.

148
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,180
Fang Hongwen, fellow townsman,

149
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,190
Tonghe Pharmacy on Nanping Street.

150
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,190
Dong Xu,

151
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,110
No. 14 Guomin Street.

152
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,100
With the locations of Hu Bin's apartment

153
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,050
and your house,

154
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,870
I'm guessing the gun's hiding place

155
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,440
is about three km away from Hu Bin's home.

156
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,430
Exclude the farthest and closest places

157
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,400
for now.

158
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,710
The rest are all probable.

159
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,100
Among them,

160
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,410
find the person closest with Hu Bin.

161
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,210
Okay.

162
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,500
Who is it?

163
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,560
Me.

164
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,870
Take a look.

165
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,460
Do you like it?

166
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,950
Just say you like it.

167
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,330
I'm talking to my future wife.

168
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,970
You should leave now.

169
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,070
Try it on.

170
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,390
I'll change it if you don't like it.

171
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,780
Change it as many times

172
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,620
as you like.

173
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,790
Nice.

174
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,050
On December 26, 1931,

175
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,440
General Deng Tiemei led the Self-Defense Army

176
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,950
to split into four groups

177
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,010
and counter-attacked Fengcheng.

178
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,150
You were right in the front line.

179
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,850
Yes.

180
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,680
Later, the Self-Defense Army joined the Counter-Japanese Army.

181
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,820
You followed Commander Yang Jingyu

182
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,630
to fight in Sanyuanpu

183
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,870
and Liangshuihezi.

184
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,690
You even earned merits.

185
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,380
Yes.

186
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,870
Later, Cheng Bin defected

187
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,470
and took so many people away,

188
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,190
but you didn't follow them.

189
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,170
The Japanese have occupied Manchuria for 14 years.

190
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,580
You've been working with them for 14 years.

191
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,250
This is who you are.

192
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,740
How could you be a Han traitor?

193
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,220
I'm not a Han traitor.

194
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,430
I'm not even a Han.

195
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,910
How am I a Han traitor?

196
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,450
Manchuria's my hometown.

197
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,910
First Zhang Zuolin,

198
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,869
then the Japanese

199
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,250
and you communists;

200
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,829
all of you

201
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,099
want to occupy my hometown!

202
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:12,720
Shut up!

203
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,839
Was Deng Tiemei a Manchu?

204
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,180
Was Advisor Miao a Manchu?

205
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:21,670
Yes!

206
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,950
Unfortunately, they forgot they were.

207
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,310
I'm different.

208
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,140
I work for His Majesty.

209
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,470
If the Japanese trouble His Majesty,

210
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,570
I'll kill them.

211
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,860
If you trouble His Majesty...

212
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,670
I'll kill you.

213
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,510
Fang and I are from

214
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,140
the Second Division of the Fifth Counter-Japanese Army.

215
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,890
Under

216
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,940
Commander Chen Hanzhang.

217
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,220
In December, 1940,

218
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,870
Commander Chen

219
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,990
was surrounded by the Japanese

220
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,230
by Jingpo Lake.

221
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,480
When he was still alive,

222
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,710
they dugged his eyes out

223
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,850
and cut his tongue.

224
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,510
But he stayed silent.

225
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,320
He'd just turned 28 years old.

226
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,030
Commander Chen never ate dog meat

227
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,510
or wore dog-skin hats.

228
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,310
He said that's the Manchu rule.

229
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,590
Right?

230
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,600
Be it Commander Chen,

231
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,230
General Deng,

232
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,470
or Advisor Miao,

233
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,950
when they fought the Japanese,

234
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,800
they never differentiated Manchus and Hans.

235
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,890
They only knew they were...

236
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,500
Chinese.

237
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,620
Tell me. Are you Chinese?

238
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,480
Are you?

239
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,910
I am.

240
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,780
If you're not a Han traitor,

241
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,600
what are you?

242
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,490
Just because the Japanese troubled you?

243
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,150
Do you still have a hometown?

244
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,580
Where is it?

245
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,950
Tell me where your hometown is.

246
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,400
The Japanese seized your land.

247
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,300
They killed all your townsmen,

248
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,220
raped the women,

249
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,950
and didn't even spare the kids!

250
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,720
Just because they troubled you?

251
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,850
You bastard!

252
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,050
Let me ask you one thing.

253
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,510
Are you Chinese?

254
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,030
Speak up!

255
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,430
I am.

256
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,870
Then you are a national traitor!

257
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,780
Han traitor!

258
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,630
You lied to me.

259
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,320
You've been lying to me!

260
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,590
Commissar.

261
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,010
I was wrong.

262
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,110
Keep him alive?

263
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,410
I used to be in the Manchukuo Army.

264
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,130
What did you do before joining the Counter-Japanese Army?

265
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,600
What are you looking at?

266
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,110
Stop pretending.

267
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,570
Others don't know my background,

268
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,410
but you do.

269
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,470
I used to be a robber.

270
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,640
But I only robbed the rich and helped the poor.

271
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,920
I never burgled.

272
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,420
Yes, an old ex-warlord

273
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,510
and an ex-robber

274
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,630
both became communists.

275
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,550
Stop flattering yourself.

276
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,480
A warlord?

277
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,140
You were just a soldier.

278
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,630
Yes, a soldier.

279
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,270
A soldier.

280
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,230
Do you remember

281
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,240
what Commander Chen told us?

282
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,870
No matter who you are,

283
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,680
if you join the revolution,

284
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,660
follow the rules, fight the Japanese,

285
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,480
and change your past habits,

286
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,230
you're a comrade.

287
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,570
But Miao Changshou's different.

288
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,010
He's a Han traitor.

289
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,860
Is he really a Han traitor?

290
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,030
He did betray us.

291
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,360
But he also used to fight the Japanese.

292
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,350
All these years,

293
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,660
there have been diehard Counter-Japanese fighters

294
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,100
and hardcore traitors,

295
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,340
but most of them were in between.

296
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,870
The point is, Miao's not alone.

297
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,630
He's backed by Harbin's Secret Service

298
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,910
and Guan Xue.

299
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,920
That's our most dangerous enemy.

300
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,790
You're right.

301
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,890
All the more can't we kill him.

302
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,270
Germany and Italy surrendered.

303
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,510
Japan and Manchukuo should be

304
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,000
on their last legs too.

305
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,260
And then?

306
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,270
We have to think about the future.

307
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,150
Miao Changshou has a vast intel network.

308
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,190
Instead of waiting for the day of victory

309
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,210
to investigate

310
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,270
and arrest them,

311
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,660
you might as well make him

312
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,250
spill the beans now.

313
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,700
Dong Xu is Hu Bin's closest cousin.

314
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,240
It's most likely Hu Bin hid the gun in his house.

315
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,600
Who is it?

316
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,340
Who is it?

317
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,630
Dong Xu?

318
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,380
Yes I am. Who are you?

319
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,470
Did I offend you?

320
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,430
Did you forget

321
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,260
what you did?

322
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,020
Listen.

323
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,390
Don't touch me.

324
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,940
My cousin works for Harbin's police.

325
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,790
Have you heard of Hu Bin?

326
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,540
Hu Bin!

327
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,900
We came because of him.

328
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,950
Where did you hide it?

329
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,760
Hide w-what?

330
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,390
Sir!

331
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,270
One segment for one question.

332
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,960
Keep staying silent and you'll be fingerless.

333
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,910
Let me speak!

334
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,810
Where is it?

335
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,830
What is it? Please explain.

336
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,510
What do I have?

337
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,460
What do I have?

338
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,500
Wu.

339
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,100
Don’t waste time on him.

340
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,000
Where's the gun Hu Bin gave you?

341
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,640
What gun?

342
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,790
When did it happen?

343
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,070
Two nights ago.

344
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,090
Two...

345
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,150
Two nights ago,

346
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,300
I was on the train back to Harbin.

347
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,970
Really, sir.

348
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,750
I've been away for more than half a year. I just came back.

349
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,430
Ask around the business world.

350
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,510
I'm telling the truth!

351
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,740
I promise!

352
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,750
Wu.

353
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,630
Come here.

354
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,350
Search him.

355
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:14,940
Yes.

356
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,680
We've got the wrong person.

357
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,810
It's not him.

358
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,960
If he's involved,

359
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,630
he wouldn't have named Hu Bin from the get-go.

360
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,530
The train ticket he has on him.

361
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,560
[From Hsinking to Harbin]

362
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,190
Retreat.

363
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,700
Yes.

364
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,830
Let's go.

365
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,630
Hello.

366
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,330
Did you find it?

367
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,090
We got the wrong person.

368
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,240
What do you mean?

369
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,180
Don't worry. Tonight,

370
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,000
we'll check all the surrounding people

371
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,940
on the map again.

372
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,700
I'll let you and Xue know if there's any progress.

373
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,390
How can she sleep now?

374
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,160
Does Xue really want to get married?

375
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,500
Regardless,

376
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,700
we have to find the gun and bullet first.

377
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,390
Hello.

378
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,330
Hello.

379
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,060
I'm looking for Ms. Guan.

380
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,700
You must be her brother.

381
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,540
Hello.

382
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,220
You must apologize to me.

383
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,790
It’s such a big deal.

384
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,690
Why did I just receive Hu Bin's invitation?

385
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,670
Where's your invitation?

386
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,300
Sorry.

387
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,380
I cleared tomorrow's schedule

388
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,390
to attend your wedding.

389
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,730
Thank you, Mr. Asano.

390
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,110
Yes.

391
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,980
Xue.

392
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,470
Don't talk.

393
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,230
-Let me go!
-Behave!

394
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,070
Don't move or I'll kill you!

395
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,910
Officer, what's wrong?

396
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,380
I didn't do anything wrong.

397
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,460
-Move!
-I didn't do...

398
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,760
Where's the gun?

399
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,690
What gun? I really don't know.

400
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,590
Think again! Where's the gun?

401
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,550
I really don't know about a gun.

402
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,110
Officer, I really don't.

403
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,220
I really don't know!

404
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,860
I didn't do anything wrong.

405
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,270
I didn't.

406
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,140
Nothing.

407
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,760
Confessions come out of torture, you know?

408
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,530
It doesn't matter where the gun is,

409
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,470
or if he has the gun.

410
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,590
As long as he confesses,

411
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,190
our job's done.

412
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,960
We really don't have any guns.

413
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,540
We really don't know what you are

414
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,520
talking about.

415
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,270
No!

416
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,670
Please let us go.

417
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,060
We really don't.

418
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,800
Everyone's afraid of pain and death.

419
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,710
Go.

420
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,770
Do it.

421
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,460
-Guys, come on.
-We really don’t know.

422
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,560
We really don't know about the gun.

423
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,140
-What are you doing?
-We really don't know!

424
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,580
Move!

425
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,700
-We really don't!
-Let her go!

426
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,560
Let her go!

427
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,380
Lian!

428
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,910
Lian!

429
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,150
Hello.

430
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,510
Hello?

431
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,290
Say something.

432
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,690
You have to sleep no matter how happy you are.

433
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,790
Your throat's all hoarse.

434
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,120
Have some breakfast.

435
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,790
There's still time.

436
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,430
I'll pick you up later.

437
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,710
Once you're in your wedding gown,

438
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,450
we'll go straight to the church.

439
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,350
I'll just see you at the church.

440
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,550
Wait for me at the church.

441
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,510
Congratulations on the wedding, Ms. Guan.

442
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,630
-Happy wedding day!
-Congratulations!

443
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,540
Congratulations.

444
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,420
You look so beautiful.

445
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,710
So beautiful, Ms. Guan.

446
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,230
Happy wedding!

447
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,710
Asano Daigo's inside.

448
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,870
She's so pretty today.

449
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,470
Ms. Guan.

450
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,690
Very beautiful.

451
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,190
Beautiful!

452
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,640
You look great.

453
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,550
Congratulations.

454
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,600
Thank you.

455
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,620
Where's Hu Bin?

456
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,620
Not with the bride?

457
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,350
According to the time,

458
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,590
this is the farthest he could've come.

459
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,290
We've searched all of Hu Bin's acquaintances.

460
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,659
I see.

461
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,650
We're going in the wrong direction.

462
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,310
Where's the safest place in Harbin?

463
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,670
The safest?

464
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,060
Where the Japanese are at?

465
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,880
Let's check Japanese-owned hotels and inns.

466
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,670
Thank you.

467
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,890
The priest said we can start.

468
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,250
What's the rush? Hang on.

469
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:25,870
Okay.

470
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,920
Ten more minutes at most.

471
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,850
I've calculated.

472
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,630
It's inauspicious after this hour.

473
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,020
Welcome.

474
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,790
I can't.

475
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,390
We're obligated to protect our clients' confidentiality.

476
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,150
Listen.

477
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,610
We're from the police.

478
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,990
I can't.

479
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,350
This is a business owned by

480
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,660
Mr. Yamazaki, the South Manchuria Railway's president.

481
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,630
Can you speak Chinese?

482
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,510
If you need,

483
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,790
please ask the Police's Deputy Director Liu...

484
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,350
Stop.

485
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,990
Can you speak Chinese? I don't understand.

486
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,470
I can't...

487
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,180
I don't understand!

488
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,290
Please ask the Police's Deputy Director Liu

489
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,280
to call Mr. Yamazaki directly!

490
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,950
Leave now.

491
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,700
Why don't we play hardball?

492
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,160
We're running out of time.

493
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,710
It's a Japanese territory

494
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,860
owned by someone from South Manchuria Railway.

495
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,320
We can't meddle with that.

496
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,730
Mr. Hu Bin.

497
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,140
Are you willing to marry Ms. Guan Xue

498
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,900
as your wife?

499
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,840
I do.

500
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,030
Ms. Guan Xue.

501
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,750
Are you willing to marry Mr. Hu Bin

502
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,210
and be his wife?

503
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,280
Wait!

504
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,610
Found it.

505
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,990
In Yamato Inn.

506
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,100
Hu Bin.

507
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,660
I won't marry anyone.

508
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,670
So don't feel wronged.

509
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,020
There are many women in Harbin.

510
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,760
Find a good one and bring her to me.

511
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,350
No man can marry me.
