It's okay. He doesn't know Zhuowen.

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,720
Go and see your brother.

197
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,830
Look at you.

198
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,310
Did you have to get this hurt?

199
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,770
What medicine do you use?

200
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,110
I'll steal it for you.

201
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,430
I'm fine.

202
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,710
You don't

203
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,440
even know where it is.

204
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,430
Tell me and I'll know where to go!

205
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,200
Alright, don't we have it now?

206
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,510
Cheer up.

207
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,990
You've made a contribution.

208
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,070
That angers me more.

209
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,830
Even so,

210
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,010
Qian wouldn't let me stay to help you!

211
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,890
He's even shooing me to the mountains!

212
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,830
You old fogey.

213
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,510
What does this have to do with him?

214
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,840
The organization's rules must be obeyed.

215
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,780
Besides,

216
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,980
who asked you to have the same face as me?

217
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,030
Do you think I want that?

218
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,690
Does it still hurt?

219
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,370
Don't be silly again.

220
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,030
Very accurate.

221
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,490
This is the layout of our unit.

222
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,130
There's a mole in the mountain.

223
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,430
Guan Xue's informant

224
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,480
has been sending intel to her.

225
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,190
Commissar Fang needs to get this layout now

226
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,440
to find the traitor.

227
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,730
I...

228
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,640
I took the train with him here.

229
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,830
We met on the train.

230
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,620
I'm sure he's not one of us.

231
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,950
He should be an accountant

232
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,230
working in a restaurant.

233
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,280
Likely a restaurant made of wood.

234
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,710
Likely pine wood.

235
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,610
A place with poor ventilation.

236
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,350
The counter's about 1 m tall.

237
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,790
He's always standing behind it.

238
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,190
How do you know so much?

239
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,750
There are thick calluses

240
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,690
around his right middle finger

241
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,820
and left thumb.

242
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,440
It's due to writing accounts

243
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,440
with his right hand and using the abacus with his left.

244
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,090
Only his calves

245
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,590
are muscular.

246
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,330
This means

247
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,130
he didn't do manual labor,

248
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,900
but he's always standing.

249
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,190
Also,

250
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,780
he has calluses

251
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,310
on both elbows.

252
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,910
It means

253
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,000
he used to put his elbows on the table.

254
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
Judging from his height,

255
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,070
that table's 1 m tall.

256
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,510
I think he's an accountant.

257
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,990
Remember all these

258
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,900
and relay it to Commissar Fang

259
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,260
verbatim.

260
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,030
Don't worry. I'll go now.

261
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,230
Where are you going? Sit down.

262
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,400
Can you go out

263
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,310
injured?

264
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,960
Guan Xue suffered a huge loss.

265
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,160
All city exits are strictly monitored.

266
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,330
They said there's a freight factory

267
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,080
in the city specializing in

268
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,100
dirty work.

269
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
They can take people out of the city.

270
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,390
We can give it a try.

271
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,410
How long have they been at it?

272
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,440
They said, a long time.

273
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,620
Then it must be

274
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,230
a scam.

275
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,690
Without names, it's hard to

276
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,350
start investigating.

277
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,030
This doesn't look like the girl who sells feather dusters.

278
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,470
It's not easy to find her,

279
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,260
but if there's time...

280
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,500
We spend over 300 days a year

281
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,980
arresting communists.

282
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,790
Do you have time?

283
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,800
How are you going to find her?

284
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,470
To find someone, you don't have to be smart.

285
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,710
Find some big scrap dealers

286
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,640
in Harbin,

287
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,070
make a list,

288
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,790
and ask door by door.

289
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,060
Check if a girl

290
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,100
collected chicken feathers a month ago.

291
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,990
Is it hard?

292
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,310
Is it?

293
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,230
Do I annoy you?

294
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,430
Don't look at me.

295
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,720
I'll forget I said that once I'm out the door.

296
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,940
We've been busy

297
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,200
and you're in a bad mood.

298
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,230
No problem.

299
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,940
Vent your anger on me.

300
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,230
I'm not as good as others.

301
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,790
I have nothing to offer.

302
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,080
But I can be your sandbag.

303
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,100
Who is it? Speak up!

304
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,550
Sorry, Captain Sun.

305
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,510
I was anxious.

306
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,560
It's about the communists.

307
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,430
They wanna send out an important document

308
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,090
within two days.

309
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,320
They'll be impatient.

310
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,490
Anyone would risk it to leave the city.

311
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,190
You need to guard the city strictly.

312
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,890
Got it.

313
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,550
Angry again?

314
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,370
It's been a week,

315
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,270
but nothing happened.

316
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,190
I'm just as anxious as the communists.

317
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,070
Still, don't take it out on your underlings.

318
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,940
No one dares to enter this room now.

319
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,910
I have to be everyone's messenger.

320
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,590
You can't go on like this.

321
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,070
How about we go out for a bit?

322
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,430
Where to?

323
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,220
To see if the communists have left the city.

324
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,030
What do you mean?

325
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,930
When I was a patrolman,

326
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,380
I've heard that

327
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,190
those garrison bastards

328
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,640
can't be trusted.

329
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,520
They can even make holes

330
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,910
in an iron board.

331
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,430
Let's test them.

332
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,760
What do you have in mind?

333
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,500
[Prepare to leave the city]

334
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,860
[Drive slowly] [Do not enter]

335
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,510
Hello, Officer.

336
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,890
Clear the road.

337
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,760
I'm in a rush.

338
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,230
Sorry.

339
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,460
I need the ID of the one at the back too.

340
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,110
Just look at mine.

341
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,380
She left in a hurry and didn't bring hers.

342
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,430
Please cooperate.

343
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,960
The higher-ups have ordered

344
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,230
to check all IDs of people leaving the city.

345
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,470
She didn't bring it.

346
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,910
What should we do?

347
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,610
Then go back and get it.

348
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,130
Come here.

349
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,400
Are you trying to catch a man

350
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,260
or a woman?

351
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,160
A man.

352
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,870
Look.

353
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,240
Is it a man or a woman?

354
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,470
She has to remove her veil

355
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,480
for me to see.

356
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,330
Who do you think you are?

357
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,450
Who are you to see

358
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,900
my section chief's face?

359
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,780
Clear the road.

360
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,010
You can take it up to the Secret Service.

361
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,060
Officer, I'll repeat.

362
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,360
A strict order was issued.

363
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,790
If I let you two pass,

364
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,430
I'll be beheaded.

365
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,130
Clear the road

366
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,960
or I'll smash your shabby

367
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
wooden frames.

368
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,350
Clear it!

369
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,030
If you insist,

370
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,670
pardon me!

371
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,390
Ms. Guan.

372
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,230
What’s your name?

373
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,390
I-I’m Cui Anping.

374
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,850
I didn’t know it was you.

375
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,430
Don't be sorry.

376
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,470
If I were to nitpick,

377
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,930
you didn't draw your gun fast enough.

378
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,020
Well done, Sentry Commander Cui.

379
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,540
Take it.

380
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,390
It's for

381
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,140
drinks after work for everyone.

382
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,000
Come on.

383
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,140
Mr. Cui, where will we go for dinner tonight?

384
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,230
What dinner?

385
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,600
Two packs of Hatamen cigarettes each.

386
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,310
[Everything went smoothly]

387
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,810
Will this work?

388
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,430
Hurry up.

389
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,110
Careful.

390
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,750
Let's go.

391
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,790
Ms. Guan, let's go.

392
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,830
Mr. Cui, they're back!

393
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,680
Clear the road.

394
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,300
Clear it.

395
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,880
This is Bridge Sentry, Cui Anping.

396
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
Everything's normal.

397
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,500
Yes, got it.

398
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,790
Okay.

399
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,070
Yang.

400
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,750
I’m Cui Anping.

401
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,710
Why'd I call at this time?

402
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,600
Let's drink.

403
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,140
By the way,

404
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,510
call all the sentry commanders on duty

405
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,630
this afternoon.

406
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,860
Of course I'm buying.

407
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,890
How is this unbelievable?

408
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,510
Just think the sun's rising from the west.

409
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,750
Dumplings and wine, come on.

410
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,470
Okay.

411
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,540
Let's eat.

412
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,870
Am I stupid?

413
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,270
If I'd let them pass,

414
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,310
I'd be skinned alive.

415
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,670
I'd lose my job

416
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,080
and be confined.

417
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,610
What did I do?

418
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,590
I drew my gun.

419
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,000
Listen.

420
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,120
If they dared to break through my checkpoint,

421
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:17,909
I would...

422
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,670
I'd have killed them!

423
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,429
People

424
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,030
are all cowards.

425
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,699
No matter the rank,

426
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:31,639
in face of the gun's muzzle,

427
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,239
they wouldn't dare move.

428
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,270
Right.

429
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,270
So?

430
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,150
He froze.

431
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,830
Then the one in the back got off.

432
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,630
She actually had her ID.

433
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,670
What was it for?

434
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,550
To test my checkpoint!

435
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,610
Aren't they nasty?

436
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,960
-Totally!
-Here.

437
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,840
A test!

438
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,620
Here.

439
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,630
Guess who it was.

440
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,190
Who?

441
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,870
No idea.

442
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,510
Secret Service's Section Chief Guan Xue.

443
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,460
Special agents can't be messed with.

444
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,910
To be honest,

445
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,830
I was afraid too.

446
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,060
I didn't dare offend them.

447
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,430
But she...

448
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,230
gave me a 100-yuan bill.

449
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,700
Visit from the plain-clothes police!

450
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,390
Because

451
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,830
I'm selfless,

452
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,020
I didn't keep it for myself.

453
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,020
I called you here

454
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,670
just to

455
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,310
remind you,

456
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,270
if you encounter such a thing again,

457
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,420
don't be a coward.

458
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,910
Just follow the rules.

459
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,380
Yes, don't be a coward.

460
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,590
Maybe you'll be rewarded too.

461
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:55,830
Sure.

462
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,790
Cui has our best interests at heart.

463
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,150
Here, to Cui!

464
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,740
Here. Thank you, Cui.

465
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,360
Cheers.

466
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,790
By the way,

467
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,610
let me tell you

468
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,820
what he looks like.

469
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,070
A high nose,

470
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,190
long eyes,

471
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,470
in a gray suit, white shirt,

472
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,620
and a purple tie.

473
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,990
Eat up.

474
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,020
Have some soup.

475
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,710
Eat up.

476
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,910
Eat.

477
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,550
Eat.

478
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,550
Did you see him when you were on duty?

479
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,780
-No.
-So generous?

480
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,510
No?

481
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,460
When I was on duty,

482
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,150
I didn't see him.

483
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,190
Me neither.

484
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,990
Me neither.

485
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,070
I didn't see him.

486
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,800
Come on. Everyone gets a share.

487
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,290
Thank you, Cui.

488
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,440
Here, cheers.

489
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,420
Bottoms up.

490
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,030
You're drinking too slowly!

491
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,480
I can't drink anymore.

492
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,190
Bottoms up.

493
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,330
I'm drunk.

494
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
Pour me some wine.

495
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,830
Both cars

496
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,790
came from the same direction.

497
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,510
They were only a few minutes apart.

498
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,750
The second car must've been hiding nearby.

499
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,310
Such deep track marks...

500
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,630
It means the second car

501
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,670
had been waiting for a while.

502
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,910
The screw is

503
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,390
further proof.

504
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,070
They chose this West checkpoint

505
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,370
because of this abandoned coal yard.

506
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,210
Everything was planned beforehand.

507
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,110
Switch cars to take them out of the city.

508
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,910
Twins?

509
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,670
Twins.

510
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,030
What's wrong?

511
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,990
Honey.

512
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,090
Twins.

513
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,230
What twins?

514
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,430
We can't even

515
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,620
make one baby!

516
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,000
Twins.

517
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,790
Are you crazy?

518
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,250
If you keep making a fuss,

519
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,230
sleep outside!

520
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,470
What do you know?

521
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:27,950
Crazy.

522
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:32,480
We've really hit the jackpot this time!

523
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,790
We'll be rich!
