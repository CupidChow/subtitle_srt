can't fight with fate.

192
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,540
When you lose and die, you'll be nothing.

193
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,870
Be it in the old world,

194
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,710
or a new world.

195
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,540
Only those who win are qualified to talk about their dreams.

196
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,550
Only the living can have faith.

197
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,540
If you die in my hands,

198
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,510
your ideal faith is but a gust of wind,

199
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,030
a plate of sand.

200
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,820
What remains is my dream,

201
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,790
and my faith.

202
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,650
But you won.

203
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,830
You're alive.

204
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,920
That's why you have the right to talk about dreams

205
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,830
and faith.

206
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,310
I lost. I don't have them.

207
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,100
Actually,

208
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,590
you've already killed me.

209
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,670
I'm afraid you've forgotten.

210
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,860
Five years ago,

211
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,210
you ordered Wu Changrong.

212
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,080
We followed your order.

213
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,830
He was born a little earlier than me.

214
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,170
So he's the elder brother.

215
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,580
I'm the younger brother.

216
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,040
He always gave in to me.

217
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,050
I thought it's as

218
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,920
it should be.

219
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,340
But he saved you.

220
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,570
Yet he died in your hands.

221
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,630
Was that because he was unlucky?

222
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,500
That was his dream.

223
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,130
His faith

224
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,670
was also a gust of wind

225
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,160
and a plate of sand like you said?

226
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,670
You...

227
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,430
Are you here today to...

228
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,990
Are you here today to tell me this?

229
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,200
Yes.

230
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,550
I'm here today

231
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,610
to tell you this.

232
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,350
I also want to tell you

233
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,520
to believe this new world like Zhuowu did.

234
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,150
He can.

235
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,910
You can too.

236
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,350
I should go back.

237
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,520
I'll cover it up. Eat later.

238
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,830
I...

239
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,790
Let me walk you out.

240
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,100
Let's stop here.

241
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,240
Zhuowen.

242
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,220
Tell me.

243
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,320
If two people have the same face

244
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,780
printed on this photo,

245
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,880
he is who I think

246
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,590
he is.

247
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,510
He is Zhuowu.

248
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,990
I'm leaving.

249
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:17,860
♫The wind melts through your fingertips unconsciously♫

250
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,750
♫It's silent but♫

251
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:24,660
♫It brought news of you♫

252
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,540
Sorry.

253
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,810
Sorry, miss.

254
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,330
Are you okay?

255
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,890
You don't look well.

256
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,060
♫I dare not breathe♫

257
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,190
Where are you going?

258
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,410
Should I give you a ride?

259
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:43,060
♫I'm afraid of revealing the sound of my heartbeat♫

260
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,700
♫As we wait for the sun to shine through the clouds♫

261
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,030
Get lost.

262
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:56,650
♫And through your eyes♫

263
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,790
♫In this endless night♫

264
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:07,650
♫We stubbornly look forward to the next dawn♫

265
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,160
♫Amidst the lies and disguises♫

266
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:22,360
♫I tried to look for traces of you♫

267
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,170
♫In this endless night♫

268
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:06,360
♫We stubbornly look forward to the next dawn♫

269
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,080
♫Piercing my eyes♫

270
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,700
♫Amidst the lies and disguises♫

271
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:19,690
♫I tried to look for traces of you♫

272
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,210
♫I tried to look for traces of you♫

273
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,820
♫In this endless night♫

274
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:30,310
♫We stubbornly look forward to the next dawn♫

275
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,520
♫Piercing my eyes♫

276
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,180
♫Amidst the lies and disguises♫

277
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:44,230
♫I tried to look for traces of you♫

278
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:51,650
♫Anticipating a miracle♫

279
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:57,150
[The End]
