Here.

9
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,620
I would like a copy.

10
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,750
Here.

11
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,150
Sir, I don't have enough change.

12
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,400
Keep the change.

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,410
Do something for me.

14
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,660
Go to Minyi Street

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,300
at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

16
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,910
Be early rather than late.

17
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,150
Shout a couple of lines for me.

18
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,810
Shout what?

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,920
Whatever the twisted doughnut seller shouts, you shout too.

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,510
Okay.

The new Songjiang Evening Times.

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,870
Two more dishes and we're all set.

24
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,910
Don't wait for Aunt Chang and I.

25
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,690
You eat first.

26
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,290
Otherwise, it'll smell fishy once it's stale.

27
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,930
Take a cup and drink with me.

28
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,750
I haven't seen you drink at home.

29
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,460
Is there something good?

30
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,590
I can't say what's up,

31
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,490
but it's no doubt good.

32
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,579
I caught the person I wanted,

33
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,380
does that count?

34
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,300
Of course.

35
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,150
Can you drink when you have gastric issues?

36
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,590
Whether it hurts or not

37
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,040
depends on my mood.

38
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,670
Does that gastric medicine work?

39
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,290
When did you buy that medicine?

40
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,550
I've never heard you say you have stomach problems before.

41
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,370
Last Tuesday.

42
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,370
So you were in a bad mood since last Tuesday?

43
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,510
Then you should come back and rest after you've bought the medicine.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,020
I came back early that day.

45
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,079
You see, if you came back, I could still take care of you.

46
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,920
Where have you been all day with your stomachache?

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,780
Why are you talking so much today?

48
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,480
And you're fast.

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,630
I haven't heard the first sentence clearly,

50
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,490
and then the second line follows.

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Don't just drink.

52
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,950
Eat.

53
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,670
It's all because of the wine.

54
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,630
It's... It's also my first time

55
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,080
drinking this.

56
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,070
I didn't hold back

57
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,190
and scolded you.

58
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,090
I won't drink anymore.

59
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,870
Here's the soup.

60
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,760
Sir, drink it while it's hot.

61
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,110
You are done?

62
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,620
I'm full.

63
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,130
What did I say?

64
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,780
What I did the other day

65
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,660
was inappropriate.

66
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,290
Hu Bin, I've told you.

67
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,170
We'll talk about business back in the department.

68
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,570
We'll talk about everything else outside.

69
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,570
Anything else?

70
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,710
Is there anything to eat?

71
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,170
-I haven’t eaten yet.
-No.

72
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,780
I'm just cheap.

73
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,790
Regardless of how you treat me,

74
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,280
I have to apologize to you.

75
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,450
I know last time...

76
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,940
Forget about last time.

77
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,780
It's in the past.

78
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,580
Let's move on.

79
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,280
Even if you don't like me,

80
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,010
can we not hold grudges?

81
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,030
Just like how we were before,

82
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,960
-let's keep up the banter.
-Hu Bin.

83
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,690
I've got a lawsuit on my hands now.

84
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,870
Even a dog should know how to judge people.

85
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,070
Do you think I'm in the mood

86
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,360
to listen to you whine?

87
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,610
Move.

88
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,500
Don't talk.

89
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:58,840
Don't follow me.

90
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,100
Twisted doughnuts!

91
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,790
It's crispy and hot!

92
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,830
Freshly twisted doughnuts!

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,250
Twisted doughnuts!

94
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,460
It's crispy and hot!

95
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,120
Freshly twisted doughnuts!

96
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,390
Twisted doughnuts!

97
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,200
It's crispy and hot!

98
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,130
Freshly twisted doughnuts!

99
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,470
Twisted doughnuts!

100
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,110
It's crispy and hot!

101
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,020
Freshly twisted doughnuts!

102
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,950
Section Chief Guan.

103
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,120
Mr. Song?

104
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,920
Let's have lunch together.

105
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,340
No.

106
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,980
I'll pick you up later.

107
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,070
I said no.

108
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,350
Xie Yue.

109
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,800
Nothing on at school today?

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,870
I'm meeting a classmate here for lunch.

111
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,940
He's not here yet.

112
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,310
What can I say?

113
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,260
Sit here and wait.

114
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,540
Okay. Come and eat with us.

115
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,550
You come when Section Chief Guan asks you to.

116
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,980
Have you applied for leave of absence?

117
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,180
I don't hope to receive a call from the school,

118
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,510
asking me where you are.

119
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,190
They're doing this for your safety.

120
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,370
I'm not here for a parent-teacher conference.

121
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,340
Let's eat first.

122
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,230
You can leave if you don't want to eat.

123
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,660
Xie Yue.

124
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,410
I know you don't like her.

125
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,470
I can understand.

126
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,530
Do I still have the freedom to decide

127
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,350
who I like or dislike?

128
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,140
Of course.

129
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,900
Just like Hu Bin.

130
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,050
Even if you hold a gun against him and force him,

131
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,310
he still won't like me.

132
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,000
And then?

133
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,290
We're all on the same boat, trying to make it through.

134
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,850
We meet each other often.

135
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,740
It's not like we can't be friends.

136
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,960
In the Secret Service, what we don't need the most are friends.

137
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
Do you need them?

138
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,040
Xie Yue.

139
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,430
Get me some noodles from across the street.

140
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,830
My stomach is still weak.

141
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,300
I need to eat something easy to digest.

142
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,030
This western food is too tough.

143
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,990
I'll go then.

144
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,480
You asked me out for lunch.

145
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,670
So, tell me what's this all about?

146
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,840
Feast at Swan Goose Gate?

147
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,990
Did Xie Yue tell you

148
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,520
what she found out about me?

149
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,920
I know you feel uncomfortable.

150
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,030
I was investigated before too.

151
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,010
Guess who did it.

152
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,730
Just guess.

153
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,570
You'd get it wrong for sure.

154
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,400
It was Jin.

155
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,940
Section Chief Jin.

156
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,510
We got along very well afterwards,

157
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,690
just like siblings.

158
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,320
As long as you join my Secret Service,

159
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,800
no matter who it is, I'll investigate.

160
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,200
Only then, I can feel safe.

161
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,430
I see.

162
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,510
It's for your sense of security.

163
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,130
Go ahead, check all you want.

164
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,990
I won't resist.

165
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,850
Don’t be sarcastic.

166
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,050
If you feel uncomfortable with Xie Yue around,

167
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,420
I can remove her.

168
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,370
No, no, no.

169
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,150
It's for your sense of security.

170
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,530
I think she's pretty nice too.

171
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,150
Here's your noodles.

172
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,960
Thank you.

173
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,170
-It's hot.
-Okay.

174
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,970
Ms. Guan, Mr. Song.

175
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,470
My classmate is here.

176
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,820
You go ahead.

177
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,250
I'm leaving.

178
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,520
Follow me.

179
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,890
Look into my eyes.

180
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,630
Tell me.

181
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,110
What's up?

182
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,220
Something I don't know?

183
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,110
I've told you everything I know.

184
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,280
Do you know that Song Zhuowen has seen through you?

185
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,590
I just knew.

186
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,140
I can't see through you anymore.

187
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,620
But if you dare to play tricks with me,

188
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,200
I won't forgive you.

189
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,110
Here, cheers.

190
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,830
After this glass of wine,

191
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,960
we shall let bygones

192
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,950
be bygones.

193
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,750
Don't let yourself die in disgrace.

194
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,580
Kai!

195
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,740
Sister, what are you doing?

196
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,010
What are you doing?

197
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,840
Aren't you going to study at night?

198
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,490
Did you hide my stuff away?

199
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,750
What?

200
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,390
My gun.

201
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,780
Did you lose anything at home?

202
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,820
Get out!

203
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,530
Close the door.

204
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,680
That's how some things are.

205
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,500
The more you look, the more you can't find it.

206
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,470
When you finally give up,

207
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,520
that's when it will appear.

208
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,750
It's such an important matter.

209
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,790
Shouldn't we speak in person?

210
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,950
You're finally willing to meet me.

211
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,960
See you in the office.

212
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,480
You misunderstood.

213
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,750
Lu Jianfei works for Guan Xue.

214
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,890
I don't know him.

215
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,970
Guan Xue arranged all of this.

216
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,230
There's nothing between us.

217
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,270
Really.

218
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,120
I wish you'd say something else.

219
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,580
For example, about Section Chief Guan.

220
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,030
No matter what I do,

221
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,130
she won't like me.

222
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,470
That's right.

223
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,970
Because you're younger than her.

224
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,110
That's why I can't be on her side.

225
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,080
What else?

226
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,060
I've said everything I can.

227
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
So the rest is left unspoken.

228
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,620
Remember.

229
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,540
It takes a hundred lies to cover for a single one.

230
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,260
Zhuowen, I've never lied to you.

231
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,250
Really.

232
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,020
Tell me.

233
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,460
Tell you about what?

234
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,270
Say something.

235
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,020
When I used to come here every day,

236
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,380
I would always have

237
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,980
a lot to say.

238
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,730
You're busy.

239
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,180
You're not even interested to hear a full sentence.

240
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,900
I'm not used to you waiting

241
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,900
for me to speak today.

242
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,230
Get out if you have nothing to say.

243
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:20,970
Yes, I do.

244
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,460
You know me best.

245
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,140
I've always been so tactless.

246
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,980
Logically speaking,

247
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,610
in a situation like this, any man should

248
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,340
be able to stand their ground.

249
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,910
But not me.

250
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,150
I didn't drink.

251
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,750
I mean every word I said.

252
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,810
I know you don't think much of me,

253
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,410
but I can be as loyal as a dog.

254
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,520
Song Zhouwen can't.

255
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,610
He ran away as soon as someone gave him a bone.

256
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,290
Don't you understand?

257
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,930
He's not like me.

258
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,110
Gun.

259
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,340
Give me back my gun.

260
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,870
Then... get out of here.

261
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,650
He's different from me.

262
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,520
You need me if you want a peaceful life.

263
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,520
Besides the mundanity of life,

264
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,280
I can take care of Kai for you.

265
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,530
I'll say it again.

266
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,630
I'll say it again.

267
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,860
Give me back my gun.

268
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,400
Kai's not young, is he?

269
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,780
He's at the most complex age.

270
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,390
He's not as simple as you think.

271
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,100
Sooner or later, he'll destroy your world.

272
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,220
A while ago,

273
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,550
in front of the cafe near Harbin Institute of Technology,

274
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,410
a Japanese soldier was shot dead.

275
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,810
He died of a penetrating wound from the back of his head.

276
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,370
Do you remember, Madam?

277
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,330
Kai did that.

278
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,120
Hu Bin!

279
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,170
If you keep talking nonsense,

280
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
I'll kill you!

281
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,120
You'll have to ask Kai if it's nonsense.

282
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,280
Anyway, as evidence,

283
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,320
I have both the gun and bullet

284
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,360
with me.

285
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
What happened?

286
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,350
Answer me now.

287
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,860
Tell me only the truth.

288
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,360
If you lie to me,

289
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,350
both of us will die.

290
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,830
What happened?

291
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,500
Did you kill the Japanese who died

292
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,300
in front of the cafe?

293
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,390
Who... who told you that?

294
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,270
Was it you?

295
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,510
Was it you?

296
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,260
Listen.

297
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,900
There is a technique called forensic ballistics.

298
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,260
Even between pistols of the same model,

299
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,330
even though the rifling within each barrel is the same,

300
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,270
there will always be subtle differences.

301
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,270
This difference

302
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,750
shows up on every round that gets fired.

303
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,340
Now, the gun and bullet is in the hands of others.

304
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,710
Did you kill him?

305
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,030
I'll go up and kill Hu Bin!

306
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,160
Kill him?

307
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,180
Really?

308
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,120
Can you even beat him?

309
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,270
Fine.

310
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,390
Go.

311
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,110
Go kill him.

312
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,100
In turn, his people will kill you,

313
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,330
and the Japanese will kill me.

314
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,780
This is the best ending, isn't it?

315
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,190
Wu.

316
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,310
Madam.

317
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,580
I told you to find the gun.

318
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,550
Today is her birthday.

319
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,950
She doesn't like celebrating her birthday.

320
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,950
She snaps at anyone who mentions it.

321
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,730
I invited our colleagues to dinner on her behalf.

322
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,330
I ordered her favorite fried pork.

323
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,600
I wished she would come.

324
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,140
She's officially promoted to Section Chief today.

325
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,260
People will call her Section Chief Guan.

326
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,590
Only a man of my caliber

327
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,270
would be good enough for her.

328
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,700
I'm a beast.

329
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,880
She might as well shoot me dead today.

330
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,670
Watching her point a gun at herself,

331
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,560
I felt like I was doomed.

332
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,060
I can never get her in my life.

333
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,900
Do I have anything left to lose?

334
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,700
Where are my things?

335
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,910
Let them all out first.

336
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:31,820
Let's go.

337
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,310
Give me back my diary.

338
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,860
Where's the Walther PPK pistol?

339
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,030
Trust me.

340
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,480
I won't give it to the Japanese.

341
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,330
Kai is also my brother.

342
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,110
Then why are you holding onto the gun?

343
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,590
I...

344
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,220
Yes.

345
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,430
I was being impulsive when I found that bullet.

346
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,160
I just wanted to protect him.

347
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,590
I just want your respect.

348
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,320
Respect, do you understand?

349
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,750
I want to be a man in front of you.

350
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,330
I'm too despicable.

351
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,020
Trust me, really.

352
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,830
I won't do anything

353
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,150
to hurt you and Kai.

354
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,110
Please.

355
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,900
Give me back my diary.

356
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,860
It's useless to you,

357
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,940
but that's my last shred of pride.

358
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,900
Please.

359
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,160
Let's organize the wedding.

360
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,850
I'm not kidding.

361
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,320
I know what you wrote in your book is true.

362
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,270
How about tomorrow?

363
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,860
It's too late for tomorrow.

364
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,460
The day after tomorrow then.

365
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,930
You can arrange everything.

366
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,909
Come here.

367
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,030
Mr. Hu.

368
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,750
Morning, Sir.

369
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,550
This...

370
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,010
An invitation? You are getting married?

371
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,190
Section Chief Guan?

372
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,060
You'll all have to come, alright?

373
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,030
Yes.

374
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,040
We're brothers if you turn up.

375
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,370
If you don't...

376
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,640
-We'll go.
-Yes, we will.

377
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,370
Zhuowen.

378
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,430
What a coincidence.

379
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,560
We are destined to meet.

380
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,900
I don't even need to go to your room.

381
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,070
We met here instead.

382
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,810
We're getting married tomorrow.

383
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,940
You must be present.

384
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,410
Of course. I'll bring my gift money.

385
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,460
My sister can't marry him.

386
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,470
I'll turn myself in to the Japanese.

387
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,260
I'll turn myself in.

388
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,580
I...

389
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,740
The gun is not in Hu Bin's house.

390
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,160
He must have a backup plan.

391
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,690
He must be planning for the worst.

392
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,080
Once he dies,

393
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,850
someone will hand the gun to the Japanese.

394
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,870
What's the exact time Hu Bin left here?

395
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:55,930
7 p.m.

396
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,020
7:20 p.m.

397
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,250
7:20 p.m.

398
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,460
Although Hu Bin has many friends,

399
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,460
his circle was always limited.

400
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,920
Let's find out all his connections in Harbin

401
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,120
and their addresses.

402
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,590
We still have half a day.

403
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,090
Half a day is enough.

404
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,650
These old Counter-Japanese soldiers

405
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,050
are not easy to deal with.

406
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,190
Commissar Fang has been watching me for the past few days.

407
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,150
Based on my instinct,

408
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,590
Qiao Er's death alone

409
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,160
wasn't enough to dispel his suspicions.

410
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,830
It's only going to get harder

411
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,830
from now on.

412
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,650
Why haven't you gone for your shift?

413
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,370
Soon.

414
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,820
Where were you on our night watch?

415
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,950
When? I was always there.

416
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,710
Who are you trying to fool?

417
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,260
You went down the mountains for your feast, didn't you?

418
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,310
Are you blind?

419
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,730
Section Chief Guan is going crazy.

420
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,600
Recently, the Communist Party have been able to

421
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,260
get away with things somehow.

422
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,830
That woman is getting suspicious.

423
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,030
She believes nobody.

424
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,250
Wasn't there a telegram

425
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,450
asking us for help?

426
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,700
Let's go.
