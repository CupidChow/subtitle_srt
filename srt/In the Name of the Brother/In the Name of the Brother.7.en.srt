[Episode 7]

4
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,470
Sir.

5
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,350
In an hour,

6
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,280
how many people entered the hotel?

7
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,750
41 people.

8
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,250
What kind?

9
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,610
Seven couples,

10
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,350
four with their child.

11
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,710
Three men

12
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,750
dressed in

13
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,550
what looked like stage clothes.

14
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,630
Six Japanese military

15
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,430
officers.

16
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,880
An officer with an injured leg

17
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,900
used a crutch.

18
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,829
A crutch?

19
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,350
Over there.

20
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,630
His leg's broken.

21
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,100
He was pale and sweating.

22
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,240
I doubt he can lift a stone.

23
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,830
Who are you

24
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,870
to assume?

25
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,620
No, we've checked.

26
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,500
Shut up and come!

27
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,070
Let's go!

28
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,600
Let's go!

29
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,000
Go in.

30
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,180
Zhuowen, get in the car with me.

31
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,030
Move!

32
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:32,860
Move!

33
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,670
Hurry!

34
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,730
-Move!
-Hurry!

35
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,110
Move!

36
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,930
The elevator's broken!

37
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,630
Ahead!

38
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,400
Qiao Liang!

39
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,910
Mr. Pan.

40
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,650
The main stairway's locked.

41
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,180
The fire elevator's lock has been melted too.

42
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,550
But Mr. Hu's surrounded the area

43
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,390
downstairs.

44
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,070
He can't escape.

45
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,510
Isn't he alone?

46
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,220
What are you afraid of?

47
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,990
Go!

48
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,710
You!

49
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,240
Next! Quick!

50
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,290
I don't need everyone dead.

51
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,330
Let's go.

52
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,550
Mr. Pan!

53
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,990
Mr. Pan!

54
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,430
Go!

55
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,670
Isn't he one of us?

56
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,740
How many of our men confronted him?

57
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,100
Six.

58
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,900
Four lying there.

59
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,950
Another was Robin Hood's substitute.

60
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,750
Where's one more?

61
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,540
Move!

62
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,830
Backup!

63
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,860
Backup!

64
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,490
Backup!

65
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,430
You!

66
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,250
Stop there!

67
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,950
Stop there!

68
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,590
Stop there!

69
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,470
Ms. Guan.

70
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,270
I changed my mind.

71
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,520
I want revenge.

72
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,730
I'll make those who hate me

73
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,950
pay a huge price.

74
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,870
Please trust me.

75
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,420
I know what to do.

76
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,170
Raise your arms.

77
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,780
Turn around slowly.

78
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,590
Turn around!

79
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,370
Let me see

80
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,020
Manchukuo's Robin Hood.

81
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,700
Come on!

82
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,650
I'm sorry, Section Chief.

83
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,080
We failed to catch the assassin.

84
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,650
Please punish us.

85
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,550
But did you

86
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,750
find any clues?

87
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,870
Our men

88
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,760
only saw his side and back.

89
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,970
There were blood-stained glass fragments

90
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,440
under the window he hid at.

91
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,060
According to the height,

92
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,370
his left cheek or neck

93
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,720
should be hurt.

94
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,510
I made the same mistake four times.

95
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
It's your first time.

96
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,610
Have a seat.

97
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,260
We'll keep investigating

98
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,590
with this clue.

99
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,440
Our top priority

100
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,430
is not only Manchukuo's Robin Hood,

101
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,730
but also to use all our manpower

102
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,590
to arrest more people.

103
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,790
It's easy

104
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,030
to make more arrests.

105
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,550
But how can we convict them?

106
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,990
It's up to you.

107
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,950
I'm only in charge of punishment.

108
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,310
When enough people are punished,

109
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,830
we'll see

110
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,690
the effects.

111
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,650
Got it.

112
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,450
Have some tea.

113
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,870
We'll work with the Japanese Military Police

114
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,080
to block all exits of the city

115
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,090
and conduct a dragnet search.

116
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,150
The target's a man

117
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,910
about 180 cm tall.

118
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,630
He has fresh wounds on his neck or face.

119
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,950
Remember.

120
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,950
It's fine to arrest the wrong person,

121
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,010
but if you miss him,

122
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,470
you'll face the music.

123
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,110
-Help!
-Squat!

124
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,390
Don't move! Get up!

125
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,550
Squat! Behave!

126
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:09,930
Don't move!

127
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,660
Let go of me!

128
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,950
Let go of me!

129
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,480
Why are you arresting me?

130
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,470
Let go of me!

131
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:17,910
Don't move!

132
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,310
Why are you arresting me?

133
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,870
Let go! Why are you arresting me?

134
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,100
Let go of me!

135
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,600
We combed

136
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,840
the entire Harbin,

137
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,370
except mouse holes.

138
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,660
It's tough if someone's hiding the assassin

139
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
in their home.

140
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,310
We've to search door to door.

141
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,110
A stupid solution's pointless.

142
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,870
We spent a fortune recruiting informants.

143
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,270
Where are they when we

144
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,660
need them?

145
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,600
Finding an assassin

146
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,870
in such a huge city

147
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,650
is like finding a needle

148
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,910
in a haystack.

149
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Where are our men?

150
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,110
Waiting downstairs.

151
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,640
Retreat.

152
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,190
It's been a busy day.

153
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,020
Rest up.

154
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,230
Retreat?

155
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,339
[115 Huayuan Street, Nangang District]

156
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,190
Zhuowu!

157
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,910
Help me up.

158
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,630
Help me up.

159
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,630
Alright.

160
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,350
It's almost time.

161
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,110
A few more questions.

162
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,260
After we got separated,

163
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,720
you escaped with Guan Xue and Guan Kai.

164
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,820
How long were you with them?

165
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,370
How'd I remember that?

166
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,660
About ten days.

167
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,240
How did you get separated?

168
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,670
They went to

169
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,070
their uncle,

170
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,390
who's probably

171
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,880
an official in Harbin.

172
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,130
Did you tell her

173
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,500
you have a twin?

174
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,670
I don't think so.

175
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,550
Yes or no?

176
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,470
I was focused on escaping

177
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,710
and staying alive.

178
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,750
I couldn't have said all that.

179
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,170
Come on.

180
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,470
Sit.

181
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,040
Let's have a drink.

182
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,080
There's no time.

183
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,350
I'll be candid.

184
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,870
Have you slept with her?

185
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,470
Zhuowen, have you slept with a woman?

186
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,880
At that time,

187
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,150
why'd I have the mood...

188
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,710
Just answer me.

189
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,750
Yes or no?

190
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Why do you ask?

191
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,170
It's important to me.

192
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,240
Swear to say the truth.

193
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,630
I won't.

194
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,790
Why should I?

195
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,330
Drink it or not.

196
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,330
Believe it or not.

390
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,580
And here.

391
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,700
Got scratched by another girl?

392
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,690
You got the wrong person.

393
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,110
Nonsense!

394
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,190
Song Zhuowen.

395
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,660
Going back on your promise?

396
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,120
Don't play dumb.

397
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,820
Fine, I won't.

398
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,570
What is it?

399
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,830
You asked me to get money from you.

400
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
I didn't beg you for it!

401
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
I forgot to pay?

402
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,580
You should've said so.

403
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,790
Sorry.

404
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:47,950
How much?

405
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,510
32.7 yuan in total.

406
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,170
Including the tables, chairs,

407
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,680
and the two girls.

408
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,710
Two more girls?

409
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,150
Forget about my share then.

410
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,680
I can't owe you for this.

411
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,560
40 yuan. Keep the change.

412
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,580
Miss, I have to say this.

413
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,790
Change your profession

414
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,220
to a clean one.

415
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,990
Who are you calling dirty?

416
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,750
I've said many times.

417
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,660
I'm clean.

418
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,250
You're the dirty ones.

419
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,910
From the inside out.

420
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,160
Utterly!

421
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,880
I'll pay you back.

422
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,140
That brat's quite a womanizer.

423
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,620
Three girls.

424
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,990
Since you're twins,

425
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,930
[Xing'an Inn]

426
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,190
the organization

427
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,270
made an exception

428
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,350
to protect Zhuowen.

429
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,210
Zhuowu can live in this underground meeting point.

430
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,810
Zhuowen, you're impressive.

431
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,770
How'd you get a place like this?

432
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,570
Rest assured here.

433
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,740
No one knows this place.

434
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,020
Only I do.

435
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,510
Have some water.

436
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,840
I'll leave you to it.

437
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,710
How can one

438
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,520
live well here?

439
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,990
Live well?

440
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,670
This is temporary.

441
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,290
Leave Harbin

442
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,780
once things blow over.

443
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,720
I won't leave under I've killed that bastard

444
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,660
Asano Diago.

445
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Do you think that's fighting imperialism?

446
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,380
Then tell me,

447
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,930
why do I kill the Japanese?

448
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,620
A barbarian.

449
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,400
I still get the job done.

450
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,430
Better than your bragging.

451
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,710
You must be hungry.

452
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,600
Have a bite.

453
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,870
The restaurant's packed.

454
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,870
I'll go upstairs.

455
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,590
You used to

456
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,600
follow me around.

457
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,100
You cried when you saw me fight.

458
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,510
To think you're now a cop.

459
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,930
When I heard "Manchukuo's Robin Hood",

460
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,630
I knew it's you.

461
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,680
On the day

462
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,200
of the mission,

463
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,270
I dared not even blink.

464
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,090
Though I hoped it wasn't you,

465
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,190
I didn't wanna miss you.

466
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,870
Then I heard

467
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,280
you looked pale and sweaty.

468
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,390
That must be you.

469
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,020
You swallowed gunpowder

470
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,290
many times as a kid.

471
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,470
Wipe your hands.

472
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,540
To skip school,

473
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,390
I'd swallow poison,

474
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,770
let alone

475
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,140
gunpowder.

476
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,550
You knew it was me then?

477
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,430
No.

478
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,120
When I guessed you were in Kozuka's villa.

479
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,550
How did you know?

480
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,470
That time when Dad beat you up

481
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,820
for skipping school,

482
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,750
you took me to run away.

483
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,580
In the day,

484
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,590
you smeared mud on the front door

485
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,520
of a rich person's villa.

486
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,260
If the mud's still there at night,

487
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,000
it means it's empty.

488
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,690
Then you took me to stay there.

489
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,670
Their Simmons bed

490
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,280
was much nicer than ours.

491
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,140
Did I take you there?

492
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,810
You remember everything.

493
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,090
Do you want anything else?

494
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,860
Some fried pork and I'd be good.

495
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,590
When did you like fried pork?

496
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,550
During the escape from famine,

497
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,110
I remember telling Xue and Kai

498
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,900
that once there's world peace,

499
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,430
we'll stuff ourselves with

500
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,080
fried pork.

501
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,190
I always thought humans are fickle,

502
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,300
but eating habits don't change.

503
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,550
I guess not.

504
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,440
Haven't I been eating?

505
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,330
What's wrong, Zhuowen?

506
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,920
Nothing.

507
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,740
I'll order fried pork for you.

508
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,920
Get my watch fixed along the way.

509
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,400
The watch hand has fallen off.

510
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
It can't be fixed.

511
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:51,930
When I get my pay,

512
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,130
I'll buy you a new one.

513
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,150
I want this one.

514
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
It can't be fixed.

515
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,480
Dad left it to me.

516
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,120
When did it break down?

517
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,490
Long ago.

518
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,830
How did you live

519
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,480
without knowing the time?

520
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,670
Kozuka's villa

521
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,130
is filled with clocks.

522
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,410
Hasn't his house

523
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,710
been empty all this time?

524
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,210
They would've stopped by now.

525
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,620
I know how to wind a clock.

526
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,910
Which clock?

527
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,250
The one I kicked and shattered.

528
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,120
What's wrong, Zhuowen?
