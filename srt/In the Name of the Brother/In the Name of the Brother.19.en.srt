[Episode 19]

4
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,110
Why aren't you saying anything?

5
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,060
We found the suspect.

6
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,520
He stayed briefly in the bathroom

7
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,140
before the water pipe leaked.

8
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,460
He was even seen

9
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,229
talking to a fake repairman.

10
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,390
Who?

11
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,480
It was Kai.

12
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,210
Another troubling thing was that

13
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,230
Kai brought some food

14
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,479
when he visited those casualties.

15
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,780
Among which, was a box of dried apricots.

16
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,040
The taste of dried apricots

17
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,230
can cover

18
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,550
the bitter taste of picric acid.

19
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,990
Of course, I think...

20
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,570
this could simply be

21
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,350
an annoying coincidence.

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,380
You're saying it's a coincidence

23
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,670
without even asking.

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,060
Unit Chief Pan.

25
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll recuse myself from this case.

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,150
You'll interrogate him.

27
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,840
We'll of course follow through with the due process.

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,380
How about this?

29
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,870
Deputy Chief Song will interrogate.

30
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,070
I'll record instead.

31
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,070
What do you think?

32
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,170
It's the Intelligence Unit matters.

33
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,670
You decide.

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
The Japanese is asking everyone

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
to leave a statement regarding the explosion yesterday.

36
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,190
You can go back to school after answering the questions.

37
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,190
You went to the Army Hospital yesterday morning.

38
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,850
Where else did you go before you went to the ward?

39
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,470
Nowhere else.

40
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,250
Did you go to the bathroom?

41
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,829
Yes, I just remembered.

42
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:54,960
What were you doing?

43
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,579
What else can I do in the toilet?

44
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,610
Poop or pee?

45
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,380
I washed my hands.

46
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,510
It took you that long to wash your hands?

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,110
I got some sludge on my hands.

48
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,950
It won't come off no matter how hard I rubbed.

49
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,710
There was no soap at the hospital's toilet,

50
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,790
so I spent more time rubbing it.

51
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,070
-I…
-What sludge?

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,280
Sludge from where?

53
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,920
When we were about to get to the hospital,

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,029
there was someone by the side of the road

55
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,430
whose bicycle chain came off.

56
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,710
He had a backache and couldn't squat,

57
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,830
so I helped him,

58
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,430
and that's how...

59
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,870
Did you meet anyone else

60
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,470
before you met the casualty?

61
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,490
Does a stranger count?

62
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,470
Tell me.

63
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,270
After my sister and Mr. Asano

64
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,690
went to the ward,

65
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,230
I was feeling bored.

66
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,490
So, I went downstairs for some fresh air.

67
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,390
Downstairs around the corner,

68
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,590
there was a worker who seemed to know me.

69
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,330
He asked me if I forgot him.

70
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,190
He said half a year ago,

71
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,990
he fixed a water pipe at my house.

72
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,130
He left when I said I didn't know him.

73
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,130
What did you give to the casualties?

74
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,070
Pastries,

75
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,270
fruits, and a pack of dried apricots.

76
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,420
Where did you buy them?

77
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,450
The pastries were bought from the cake shop

78
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,250
at the corner of Guogeli Avenue.

79
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,150
I got the fruits from home.

80
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,840
What about the dried apricots?

81
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,270
Think carefully.

82
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,440
We'll check out every place

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,950
you mentioned.

84
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,950
[Chen Ji]

85
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,230
Chen Ji Dried Goods. It's very close to my house.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
Okay, that's all.

87
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,460
Where is my sister?

88
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,350
I think it's true.

89
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,830
We have to investigate whether it's true or not.

90
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,360
Let's investigate as you said.

91
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,030
There's really no better way.

92
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,200
So, how to investigate?

93
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,270
No, you're the Unit Chief.

94
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,530
I have to listen to you.

95
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,300
We'll have to work this out between us.

96
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,680
How about this?

97
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,980
We'll send two teams.

98
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,930
The first team goes to Chen Ji Dried Goods

99
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,310
to verify the time, location,

100
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,670
and if it was indeed Kai.

101
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,630
The other team... goes to the hospital ward again.

102
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,000
The ward?

103
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,550
If what Kai said was true,

104
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,350
and he got sludge before he got to the hospital,

105
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,160
then...

106
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,150
the food basket he was carrying

107
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,200
would have gotten traces of it.

108
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,310
What do you think?

109
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,810
Do you really think

110
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,350
Kai has the guts

111
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,390
to break the water pipe,

112
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,650
and bring the bomb into the hospital all on his own?

113
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,510
There must be someone behind it.

114
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,550
So I'm worried he might be in danger.

115
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,080
The Japanese, the Bureau, and the Secret Service

116
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,240
are all looking for him.

117
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,800
Whoever finds the slightest loophole,

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,840
Kai will be dead.

119
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,610
Have you seen this man?

120
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,500
Yes!

121
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,180
Yes!

122
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,630
Yes, I have.

123
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,950
Except for the two cases

124
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,810
which were solved with the Japanese Secret Police,

125
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,750
the rest were resolved independently by ourselves.

126
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,700
The investigation into the firearms incident at Mr. Asano's house

127
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,960
has also come to a head.

128
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,180
I've gone through the testimony of

129
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,310
every single person who was there at the time of the shooting.

130
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,970
I am already at the last batch.

131
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,380
I can close the case in a week at most.

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,410
Thank you for your hard work.

133
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,750
I can tell you the truth now.

134
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,549
If these cases

135
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,200
were not supervised personally by Mr. Asano,

136
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,360
I would've already assigned them out.

137
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,930
I can't thank you enough

138
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,980
for your support.

139
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,240
Don't thank me just yet.

140
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,750
No one in this building could have

141
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,650
done a better job than you did

142
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,310
in the serial explosion case.

143
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,830
Do you know?

144
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,940
The Japanese don't think like I do.

145
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,540
They don't even give you a chance to make a mistake.

146
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,940
Well, I really don't care.

147
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,010
I'm just thinking,

148
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,150
if Mr. Asano

149
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,110
could think like you do,

150
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,060
then all our efforts here in Secret Service

151
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,950
would not be in vain, right?

152
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,440
What do you have in mind?

153
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,110
I've got information on some anti-Japanese activists.

154
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,350
Among them are people from the Central and National Bureau, the Soviets,

155
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,680
and the Communist Party's guerilla team.

156
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,870
I've kept them in incubation previously.

157
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,620
Now,

158
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,440
it's time to reap the rewards.

159
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,330
And about the bomb incident at the hospital yesterday,

160
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,630
I have a bold idea too.

161
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,670
If you can bring

162
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,870
these additional touches to the table,

163
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,190
Mr. Asano will surely appreciate them.

164
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,670
Then I'll stay up all night tonight

165
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,850
and write a report on my ideas for investigation.

166
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,680
You'll definitely see it by tomorrow.

167
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,660
I'd like to see those

168
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,710
fake repairmen more than Mr. Asano.

169
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,470
If you're confident,

170
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,160
we'll go straight to Mr. Asano tomorrow.

171
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,370
Do you remember?

172
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,550
He was very impressed with your writing

173
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,950
the last time he was here at Secret Service.

174
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,260
I won't let you down.

175
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,130
I'll go back and write now.

176
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,410
By the way,

177
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,200
one more thing.

178
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,950
It’s about Cui Anping’s case.

179
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,740
I missed out on one testimony.

180
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,040
Whose?

181
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,590
I'll have all the materials

182
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,670
ready for you in the morning.

183
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,870
Mr. Pan.

184
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,430
I'm going to pick Kai up.

185
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,710
Anything else?

186
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,570
Don't tell him anything on the way.

187
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,470
Just go home.

188
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,490
Got it.

189
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,230
Wen,

190
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,790
besides my sister,

191
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,230
do you have a lot of other friends in Harbin?

192
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,960
I heard they're all pretty good

193
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,230
and capable.

194
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,150
What are friends?

195
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,520
Firstly, you have to be like-minded.

196
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,940
What if this friend of yours is not on the right path,

197
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,340
but the wrong path?

198
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,160
Being anti-Japanese is not walking a wrong path.

199
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,590
When making friends,

200
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,530
don't only listen to what he says,

201
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,370
but also observe what he does.

202
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,030
Sometimes, no matter how nice he is,

203
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,100
he may do things with no regard for others.

204
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,900
You shouldn't make friends with people like that.

205
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,110
Wen.

206
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,310
There's a secret that even my sister doesn't know.

207
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,540
I don't like to pry into people's secrets.

208
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,400
What if I'm willing to tell you?

209
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,340
There are two kinds of secrets.

210
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,950
The first is the kind you can share with others.

211
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,520
The other kind is better to keep it in your heart.

212
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,350
Mr. Ning,

213
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,230
what should I do?

214
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,350
Say something.

215
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,590
[Declaration]

216
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,350
I just want to ask you.

217
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,150
If you have to hurt

218
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,870
the people around you to achieve your dreams,

219
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,870
what would you do?

220
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,580
I don't understand.

221
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,630
No, you do.

222
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,630
To achieve your dreams,

223
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,510
would you hurt me,

224
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,510
or my sister?

225
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,630
I won't hurt anyone innocent.

226
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,030
Fine.

227
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,930
Continue to beat around the bush.

228
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,820
Guan Kai.

229
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,110
Are you my real brother?

230
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,430
What's wrong?

231
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,950
Answer me first.

232
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,010
Yes.

233
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,470
What did I do wrong

234
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,670
that you want me dead?

235
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,390
No, I don't.

236
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,110
Just tell me if you do.

237
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,520
You can have my life.

238
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,670
Sister.

239
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,550
Why would I want to hurt you?

240
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,790
That day in the car,

241
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,370
you knew we were going to die.

242
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,450
We were going to die together.

243
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,900
Right?

244
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,080
Mr. Jin.

245
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,090
Have you told Kai about sending him to Japan?

246
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,670
Mr. Jin, I'm not going anywhere.

247
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,310
Kai.

248
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,089
You're not a kid anymore.

249
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,560
We'll be frank with you.

250
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,069
You're in grave danger.

251
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,980
We can't help you much.

252
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,230
And you know very well that

253
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,349
you single-handedly

254
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,410
caused this situation for yourself.

255
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,870
I won't leave.

256
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,270
I won't leave Harbin.

257
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,490
Who told you to go to the hospital?

258
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,480
Who is the repairman

259
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,810
from the water company?

260
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,670
No matter who they are,

261
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,640
have they looked for you

262
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,910
since your accident?

263
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,870
Have they ever cared whether

264
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,960
you're dead or alive?

265
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,040
It's okay if you don't want to go to Japan.

266
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,560
I'll tell your sister.

267
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,910
But you must listen to me,

268
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,260
and do as I say.

269
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,970
No matter who asks you from now on,

270
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,280
just say that your sister sent you to the hospital

271
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,690
to visit the casualties.

272
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,800
Understand?

273
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,500
If you say anything else,

274
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,400
both of you will die.

275
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,650
Do you understand?

276
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,870
You were right.

277
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,320
The ones who instigated Kai was National Bureau.

278
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Those bastards!

279
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,620
Such bastards

280
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,870
to be hiding behind

281
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,950
a teenager,

282
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,840
and getting him to take the bullet.

283
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,930
What a jackass!

284
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,800
Go back and sleep.

285
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,420
I'll save my words of thanks.

286
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,830
What about Kai?

287
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,450
I'll keep a closer eye on him.

288
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,180
I'll be worried too if I send him to Japan for real.

289
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,180
[Pan Yue]

290
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,090
The lock's broken?

291
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,470
Call Mr. Jin.

292
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,500
It'll be open in a few minutes.

293
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,030
Are you okay?

294
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,280
I'm fine.

295
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,410
Go and tidy up in the bathroom.

296
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,480
Mr. Asano is waiting for us.

297
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,500
Okay.

298
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,090
I'll wait for you downstairs.

299
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,880
Just now...

300
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,640
I'm sorry. I lost self-control.

301
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,450
It's not about the lock.

302
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,660
What happened?

303
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,630
Nothing.

304
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,230
It's just some trivial matters.

305
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,900
It's not worth mentioning.

306
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,500
It's still mainly due to my lack of discipline.

307
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Think carefully.

308
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,250
If you don't feel well today,

309
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,940
I suggest to not meet Mr. Asano.

310
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,580
It's okay, really.

311
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,790
I'm fine.

312
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,580
I can handle it.

313
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,810
I have a lot to do today, so I'll skip the pleasantries.

314
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,820
Ms. Guan, let's get started.

315
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,390
Sir.

316
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,790
This is a very complicated case.

317
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,260
We believe that they must have connections inside,

318
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,620
and things are not just mere coincidence.

319
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,690
Unit Chief Pan stayed up all night

320
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,430
just to get this investigation proposal out by this morning.

321
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,790
I haven't read it yet.

322
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,890
Unit Chief Pan.

323
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:18,710
Yes.

324
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,790
Sir, it's hard to put it simply in a few words,

325
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,080
so I wrote a report.

326
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
It's impossible.

327
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,840
Impossible.

328
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,380
I specifically checked

329
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,380
before I left the house.

330
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,110
How...

331
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,550
If it's convenient,

332
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,630
tell us what you think.

333
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,260
Unit Chief Pan's eloquence

334
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,090
is as good as his writing.

335
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,480
Yes.

336
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,580
We still haven't found

337
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,020
the fake repairmen.

338
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,840
The clues from the hospital

339
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,150
has come to a naught.

340
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,510
The investigation process

341
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,710
was just like what I said.

342
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,190
Following which,

343
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,150
I think...

344
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:47,590
investigations should start from the repairmen.

345
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,630
Wait.

346
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,850
If the suspected young man

347
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,840
was not Section Chief Guan's brother,

348
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,630
but an ordinary citizen,

349
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,310
would you have let go of this clue?

350
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,330
You wouldn't, right?

351
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,350
Pan Yue.

352
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,020
Your investigation results

353
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,930
can only prove that

354
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,940
he washed his hands in the bathroom for a long time,

355
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,630
and bought dried apricots when visiting the casualties.

356
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,550
But what if

357
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,300
he did all this on purpose?

358
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,430
You still...

359
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,480
can't rule out this person's suspicion, right?

360
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,790
But of course.

361
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,670
As Ms. Guan's own brother,

362
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,760
how could he plot against his sister?

363
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,350
Carry on.

364
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,000
What was that?

365
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,020
Get lost!

366
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,770
What are you doing?

367
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,070
Okay, thank you.

368
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,020
You're welcome.

369
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,430
Take care.

370
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,100
Okay.

371
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,130
Is everything not going well today?

372
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,970
It's all on my face, isn't it?

373
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,750
You were able to stay calm no matter what happened before.

374
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,840
Is it very serious?

375
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,090
Something to do with Kai?

376
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,160
Pan Yue went to report the investigation results

377
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,870
and direction of investigation today.

378
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,660
He was in very poor condition.

379
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,340
He even ratted Kai out.

380
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,650
He got it all wrong.

381
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,260
That's terrible.

382
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,250
Asano Diago has started to suspect Guan Kai.

383
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,910
Pan Yue is such a betrayer.

384
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,590
How did Pan Yue reported it?

385
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,080
Tell me every word what he said.

386
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,170
Mr. Jin.

387
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
Where's Ms. Guan?

388
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,980
Over there.

389
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,060
Girl, everyone is looking for you.

390
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,550
I know.

391
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,080
How long are you going to hide here?

392
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,340
For a while.

393
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,750
Okay, I'll wait for you.

394
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,990
I really don't know how to choose this time.

395
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,950
Should I give up on Pan Yue

396
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,990
or Zhuowen?

397
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,680
Protect yourself.

398
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,790
What's bothering me right now is...

399
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,520
who can I give up to protect Kai?

400
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,890
Protecting Kai means protecting yourself.

401
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,710
What difference does it make

402
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,790
if you give up both of them?

403
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,650
I told them...

404
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,630
I was the one who sent Kai to visit the casualties.

405
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,290
That's right.

406
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,219
I'm off.

407
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,199
I have to get back to the department before the day ends.

408
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,870
You got it?

409
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:46,860
No.

410
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:48,510
No.

411
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,550
I agree with you.

412
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,310
I'm not questioning your order.

413
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,520
I'll be sure to finish our mission as soon as possible

414
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,350
However,

415
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,040
please understand.

416
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:10,220
The problems we deal with every day in Harbin

417
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,660
take up a lot of time and energy.

418
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,020
This conflicts with our mission.

419
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,790
I understand.

420
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,010
Please.

421
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,550
Come in.

422
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,950
Yes.

423
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:39,910
Excuse me.

424
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,410
What is it?

425
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,970
Section Chief.

426
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,340
There's trouble again.

427
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,750
What's wrong?

428
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,910
There's a riot over the missing people in Daowai.

429
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,910
The families of the missing people have surrounded the police station.

430
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,060
Speak of the devil.

431
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,060
How many people have gone missing in Daowai?

432
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,700
36 people.

433
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,270
Tell Bai Hualiao

434
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,880
not to pick only fruit from one tree.

435
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,310
Yes.

436
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,540
Sir.

437
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,450
I'd like to suggest

438
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,030
to the police department

439
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,010
to suppress the missing persons case.

440
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:30,980
After all,

441
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,860
this is a nuisance for them too.

442
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,890
You need to know what we are here for.

443
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,350
Yes.

444
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,550
Let them clean their own mess.

445
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,910
They'll be the ones to suffer

446
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,540
if they don't clean up well enough.

447
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,580
I understand.

448
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,100
You don't understand the officials here.

449
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,150
They will only accept your advice on the surface.

450
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,570
For the sake of their career,

451
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,700
they will only listen to their superiors.

452
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,360
Other than that,

453
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,440
they have no bottom line.

454
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:21,910
So,

455
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,160
they'd have the guts to squash even the biggest case.

456
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,510
Of course,

457
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,440
we have to do something too.

458
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,950
Yes.

459
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,930
Let's award their Department Director

460
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,640
with a medal.

461
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,300
Yes.

462
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,290
Go.

463
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,120
It is no wonder Madam is a veteran.

464
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,840
Previously, she...

465
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,980
She kept persuading me, saying that

466
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,950
if I am not ready,

467
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,550
I shouldn't meet Mr. Asano.

468
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,530
I didn't listen.

469
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,640
Maybe... she did it on purpose?

470
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
On purpose?

471
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,550
Impossible.

472
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,550
If you say she did it on purpose,

473
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,400
she wouldn't have gone with me.

474
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,430
That was a slap in her own face.

475
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,460
She knows men too well.

476
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,470
She knows men love to act tough.

477
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
Act tough?

478
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,310
Do you know

479
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,790
how long I've been preparing for this?

480
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,590
Step by step.

481
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,410
How'd it go in the end?

482
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,950
I have nothing.

483
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,910
That's fine.

484
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,950
You didn't get it,

485
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,550
and neither did anyone else.

486
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,310
You mean Song Zhuowen?

487
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,210
Comparison is the thief of joy.

488
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,660
Can Song even compare to Pan？

489
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,300
How?

490
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,890
Why should I compare myself to him?

491
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,000
N-now that you say so,

492
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,060
I don't know

493
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,230
if you seriously understand Madam

494
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,750
or not?

495
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,390
Excuse me.

496
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,670
Mr. Song.

497
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,590
What is it

498
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,030
you want to say

499
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,730
that cannot wait overnight?

500
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,770
Unit Chief Pan asked me to come.

501
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,090
He said he felt out of sorts earlier today,

502
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,560
so he asked me to explain.

503
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,070
But Mr. Pan is right.

504
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,550
If it weren't for his judgment,

505
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,670
we wouldn't have realized

506
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,640
that we've got one foot already in the trenches.

507
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,190
You tell me.

508
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,720
This is a transcript of Guan Kai's interrogation,

509
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,450
as per Mr. Pan's instructions.

510
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,950
Guan Kai said

511
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,310
he went to the hospital with food that day.

512
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,020
He was stopped by someone

513
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,850
right at the hospital entrance.

514
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,110
Someone's bicycle chain had come off,

515
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,510
and had asked him to help,

516
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,320
and so he went.

517
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,410
It's exactly this same trick

518
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,500
which they have used over and over again,

519
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,460
that exposed themselves.
