[Episode 9]

4
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,430
You don't have to pick me up tomorrow morning.

5
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,039
Got it.

6
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,050
Are you interrogating me?

7
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,510
It doesn't matter who you meet.

8
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,370
The problem is you made up lies

9
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,640
saying he's a scalper.

10
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,650
Who is he?

11
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,270
You followed me?

12
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,590
I want you to know

13
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,230
my purpose is to protect you.

14
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,200
And your sister.

15
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,150
Then you swear.

16
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,540
That you will never tell my sister about this.

17
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,620
Why should I swear?

18
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,790
Never tell your sister what?

19
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,460
Never tell her that you lie

20
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,860
and don't tell the truth?

21
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,190
Or to never tell her that

22
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,390
you met someone you shouldn't have met?

23
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,390
All of them.

24
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,470
If you don't tell my sister,

25
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,800
all of us will be safe.

26
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,840
If you tell my sister...

27
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,550
all of us are doomed.

28
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,540
Are you crazy? Can you use your brain?

29
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,670
If Guan Xue dies,

30
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,730
everything I've done will be in vain.

31
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,560
What's wrong with killing a spy?

32
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,750
What's wrong with killing a Japanese?

33
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,750
I'm your brother!

34
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,150
Not your son!

35
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,400
Why do you lock me up?

36
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,990
Did you call my house?

37
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,230
I called 10 minutes ago, but no one answered.

38
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,630
I don't think Kai's home.

39
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,990
Give me a drink.

40
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,870
I've been learning about Japanese wine recently.

41
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,990
The water in the Hyogo is hard.

42
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,230
The wine made from it

43
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,310
is strong

44
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,770
and thrilling.

45
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,159
The water Fushimi Ward is soft.

46
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,230
The wine made from it

47
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,390
is sweet...

48
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,790
The last time I was attacked...

49
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,450
And smooth.

50
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,070
Was many years ago.

51
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,670
You were on a business trip.

52
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,420
Because you heard that I was dead...

53
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,360
You stopped what you were doing

54
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,950
and came back overnight.

55
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,600
You were severely punished too.

56
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,550
Which one do you want?

57
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,870
I have a hunch the person who tried to kill me was Manchukuo's Robin Hood.

58
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,990
Did you find him?

59
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,550
Not yet.

60
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,110
But someone saw a truck parked at the intersection.

61
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,640
We are basically sure that it's a sniper spot.

62
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,830
The sniper spot is on a truck.

63
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,470
A scrapped truck.

64
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,880
There was no trace at the scene.

65
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,070
They found the bullet hole

66
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,470
but the ballistics is high.

67
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,600
What does that mean?

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,460
That they're not skilled?

69
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,430
The driver Xiaochuan was shot to death.

70
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,870
I’m going to your home to pick Kai up.

71
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,590
No need!

72
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,550
If I'm right,

73
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,640
this person must have let me go on purpose.

74
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,040
If they did,

75
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,810
it means they have other intentions.

76
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,150
If there are any still alive, just kill them.

77
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,270
Yes!

78
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,650
Check over there.

79
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,070
Over there. Do you see it?

80
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,310
Not yet.

81
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,070
Go.

82
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,580
Zhuowen.

83
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,630
Zhuowen!

84
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,830
Zhuowen!

85
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,620
Here's one!

86
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,630
There's one over there too!

87
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,910
Brother.

88
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,910
Brother.

89
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,670
I'll kill you!

90
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,790
Don't let him escape!

91
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,030
Let him go!

92
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,310
Let go!

93
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,550
Brother, Brother!

94
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:57,950
Brother!

95
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,590
Miss.

96
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,550
Miss!

97
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,380
Please save my brother.

98
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,230
Let's go.

99
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,070
Salute!

100
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,390
Too formal.

101
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,470
At ease.

102
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,590
Harada.

103
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,590
Yes.

104
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,760
Didn't you make it clear to them?

105
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,900
Sorry, it slipped my mind.

106
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,500
You should have informed me.

107
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,450
Section Chief.

108
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,270
It's because

109
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,250
I heard that Section Chief Guan Xue

110
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,330
came over on the way last night.

111
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,750
Thank you for your concern, Section Chief.

112
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,990
On the surface,

113
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,190
you don't seem to be affected by the assassination.

114
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,590
You told me you've been through it four times.

115
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,790
This is just the beginning.

116
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,110
This is...

117
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,910
Pan Yue.

118
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,110
Unit Chief of the Secret Service Intelligence Unit.

119
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,070
Nice to meet you.

120
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,670
Very well.

121
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,630
Let's go in.

122
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,390
Who wrote this report?

123
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,860
Mr. Pan.

124
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,130
You?

125
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,560
It's well written.

126
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,950
But you wrote it better than it was executed.

127
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,750
Because Operation Anzipian

128
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,990
and Robin Hood's capture have not been completed yet.

129
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,920
We're incompetent.

130
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,630
But all our operations are going on.

131
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,110
Who identified the hiding are

132
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,640
of Manchukuo's Robin Hood?

133
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,950
It was a new police officer.

134
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,910
He has...

135
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,430
an extraordinary brain.

136
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,330
Two bites.

137
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,190
Yes.

138
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,950
Just one moment. Don't control it.

139
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,790
Crunch.

140
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,520
You still can't open it?

141
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,960
You...

142
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,910
Wait a minute.

143
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,950
Here.

144
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,170
Here.

145
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,290
I'll hold it for you.

146
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,820
Exert some strength.

147
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,230
More.

148
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,160
M...

149
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,310
No, I really can't sip it.

150
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,700
Go lower. I'll go higher.

151
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,980
You try it.

152
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,220
Let's go.

153
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,590
Look.

154
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,720
Yes.

155
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,650
Take a smaller sip.

156
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,940
Come on. Do it yourself.

157
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,320
Control the amount.

158
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,360
Much better.

159
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,470
See?

160
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,270
This sip is really

161
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,250
effective.

162
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,270
How about I get you something to relieve the pain?

163
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,590
Don't.

164
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,360
Guan Xue won't let me off

165
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,590
if I touch any of that.

166
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,960
You didn't fight back on purpose, right?

167
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,560
You're trying to gain her pity.

168
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,530
Has she come to see you?

169
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,830
To be honest, Mr. Pan,

170
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,540
I can't accept it.

171
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,069
I've been with Guan Xue for almost six years.

172
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,740
I think we know each other well.

173
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,710
No...

174
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,310
No matter what happens in the future,

175
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,430
we can take care of each other.

176
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,780
How many times have I told you?

177
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,190
What she wants is bigger than the sky.

178
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,030
The future she wants

179
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,150
is not something you can take care of.

180
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,590
But she told me herself

181
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,830
that I'm her man.

182
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,540
What if I say she said the same thing to me?

183
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,550
I believe

184
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,110
she said the same thing to Song Zhuowen too.

185
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,350
Are you here to comfort me or to anger me?

186
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,750
What can be said

187
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,870
are all not sincere.

188
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,190
Brother, be more careful.

189
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,340
Why are you sowing discord at this hour?

190
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:32,800
Brother.

191
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,010
Brother!

192
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,430
Brother!

193
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,520
Brother!

194
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,840
Brother!

195
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,310
Brother.

196
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,670
I just want to ask you.

197
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,230
If you miss a puff one day,

198
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,990
will you die before me?

199
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,780
Brother.

200
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,140
We agreed to sell it without smoking it.

201
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,990
Look at you now.

202
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,830
Brother.

203
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,180
Fine.

204
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,980
I owe you from my previous life.

205
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,560
Mr. Pan!

206
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,910
Mr. Pan!

207
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,300
Mr. Pan, Mr. Pan.

208
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,510
The Watanabe case–

209
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,120
Close the door first.

210
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:46,950
Okay.

211
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,210
I found the woman who disappeared

212
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,230
from the train station square.

213
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,510
She's a scalper.

214
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,360
She said her man got injured while working

215
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,690
and needs her care

216
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,560
so she never went out again.

217
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,020
Her husband

218
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,510
broke his leg at the construction site.

219
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,750
Many people saw it.

220
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,470
This is her hair.

221
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,420
I also asked someone to get it.

222
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,090
Hair that comes from the same person,

223
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,970
has the same color and shine.

224
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,110
When they are submerged into water at the same time,

225
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,310
the speed they float up are the same too.

226
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,570
Same goes with the speed they burn.

227
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,510
With these three points,

228
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,580
we can conclude that

229
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
the hair belongs to the same person.

230
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,590
But under the microscope,

231
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,990
the fracture patterns and surface scale differences

232
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,630
of the cross-sections of hair are inconsistent.

233
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,790
How do you know

234
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,190
something this obscure?

235
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,100
Where did you learn it?

236
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,400
If you're interested in learning,

237
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,770
you can learn it anywhere.

238
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,570
It depends on where you put yourself.

239
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,110
Understood.

240
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,100
I understand, Mr. Pan.

241
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,430
So...

242
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,640
the girl Watanabe wanted to hurt

243
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,080
is probably not this scalper.

244
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Then I'll continue to investigate?

245
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,950
Put this case aside for now.

246
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,990
Is there something more important?

247
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,970
If we put in a lot of effort to crack this case,

248
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,630
we might not necessarily

249
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,090
get anything good out of Asano Diago from it.

250
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,960
Let's put it off for now.

251
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,430
Why?

252
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,630
I think the Japanese

253
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,040
are not entirely interested on this case.

254
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,340
Even if we solve it,

255
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,350
we won't be able to take the credit.

256
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,310
What's the rush?

257
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,630
Hello.

258
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,480
Hello.

259
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,430
Mr. Ning.

260
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,280
You’re here.

261
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,190
A few days ago, after those students

262
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,950
from the University of Finance and Economics were arrested

263
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,190
and beaten up,

264
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,810
how did your classmates react?

265
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,520
How else can they react?

266
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,390
They're angry.

267
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,510
Wh about other than anger?

268
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,840
They're all students attending college.

269
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,830
Every weekend, their family send cars to get them ferried home.

270
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,030
What else can they do?

271
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,790
And those who can afford to go to universities now come from good families.

272
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,110
It's not easy for them to be angry.

273
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,640
I'm not talking about them.

274
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,250
I'm talking about you.

275
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,190
Guan Kai.

276
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,270
If that's what you think,

277
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,230
what should I talk to you about?

278
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,430
Yes, Mr. Ning.

279
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,800
I’m different from them.

280
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,510
But my sister always keeps an eye on me.

281
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,910
I have no choice.

282
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,590
Those arrested students

283
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,720
just wanted to express their patriotism.

284
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,930
Yet, they were treated like this.

285
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,770
This is an embarrassment to all of us.

286
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,540
You are not sleeping.

287
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,910
You are pretending to be asleep!

288
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,990
I've read your script.

289
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,830
Learning how ancient people speak

290
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,390
and shouting into the sky.

291
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,260
[Qu Yuan]

292
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,430
This is how anger is expressed?

293
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,300
We still want to keep some of the

294
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,060
artistic factors in dramas.

295
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,830
This just looks like

296
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,430
a petit-bourgeois whining!

297
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,710
I understand now.

298
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,240
We'll go change the script.

299
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,770
To jump into the river like Qu Yuan did.

300
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,700
Guan Kai,

301
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,630
you have organizational ability

302
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,030
and leadership.

303
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,470
The stage

304
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,230
is not your battlefield.

305
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,190
Me?

306
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,710
Can I?

307
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,910
I can.

308
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,140
I can.

309
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,750
Waiter.

310
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,710
Another cup of coffee, please.

311
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,840
Okay, wait a moment.

312
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,640
I brought him here.

313
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,630
To confine or fire him

314
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,390
is up to you.

315
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,370
You're willing to do that?

316
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,030
I knew you'd say this.

317
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,910
In this society,

318
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,930
my face can be punched

319
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,400
but it can't be ridiculed.

320
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,660
I've made a deal with Zhuowen to fight one on one.

321
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,270
To regret it after the fight

322
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,280
is not manly.

323
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,230
Mr. Hu, you work for Ms. Guan.

324
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,700
I'm also someone Ms. Guan needs.

325
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,510
We can't be enemies.

326
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,820
I'll accept any punishment.

327
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,430
As long as you feel comfortable,

328
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,960
it will be easier for me too.

329
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,330
That's all for this then.

330
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,670
Section Chief Asano will hold a ball in three days.

331
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,800
You two should come.

332
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,350
You're better with your words than before.

333
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,210
I know Mr. Hu is doing this out of his respect for you.

334
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,130
But he's definitely not speaking

335
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,180
his mind.

336
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,870
Let me go to the intelligence team.

337
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,070
Hu Bin has a sharp tongue.

338
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,560
Pan Yue has sharp eyes.

339
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,230
Think carefully.

340
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,710
I only have a piece of white paper.

341
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,780
There's nothing wrong on me.

342
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,220
What can he pick out on me?

343
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,270
Do you have a suit?

344
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,260
Yes.

345
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,380
He saw through

346
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,310
your lie so easily.

347
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,430
He is familiar with Loulan Theater.

348
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,070
It was too blatant to him.

349
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,070
He asked so many specifics.

350
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,620
It means he's has many suspicions.

351
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,820
You can't handle him.

352
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,960
He definitely didn't see you clearly.

353
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,630
And he won't tell my sister.

354
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,750
Why are you so sure?

355
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,730
He is a man of his word?

356
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,910
Unless he's dead.

357
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,710
What do you mean?

358
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,910
Nothing.

359
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,910
What's his name?

360
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,750
I don't want to tell you.

361
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,240
Okay.

362
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,820
1st Brigade, check the identity at the gate.

363
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,550
2nd Brigade,

364
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,830
dress up as customers and observe in the lobby on the first floor.

365
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,750
3rd Brigade, keep a close watch

366
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,280
over every corner outside.

367
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,850
Mr. Asano suddenly came today.

368
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,940
We all know what he wants.

369
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,750
Prepare all the information about the assassin.

370
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,350
Get it together.

371
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,900
I'll leave the safety of the ball to you.

372
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,200
If there are no further questions,

373
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,240
this is all. Go get ready.

374
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,840
Yes.

375
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,870
Mr. Hu.

376
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,270
I apologize.

377
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,230
I went overboard

378
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,690
when we fought.

379
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,970
Don't take it to heart.

380
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,140
I picked at you first.

381
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,000
I should face my loss.

382
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,850
If you didn't do your best,

383
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,380
I'd have looked down on you.

384
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,240
Mr. Hu, that's amazing.

385
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,830
I'm impressed.

386
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,680
Ms. Guan, Zhuowen is so skilled.

387
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,410
He's a talent.

388
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,360
Give him to me.

389
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,340
I'll mentor him myself.

390
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,600
I can guarantee he'll be a master in less than three months.

391
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,610
I wanted him to join the Intelligence Unit.

392
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,110
That's not showing me respect.

393
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,310
You think I'm petty and narrow-minded?

394
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,990
Why did I fight him?

395
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,550
It's to see if he has potention

396
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,870
and whether he's worth cultivating.

397
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,350
If you send him to the Intelligence Unit,

398
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,550
my fight would be in vain.

399
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,430
Mr. Hu,

400
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,970
I want to do intelligence work too.

401
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,430
I've been working outside all these years,

402
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,170
I also want to sit in the office too.

403
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,430
Who told you

404
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,790
going to the Intelligence Unit would mean you'd be sitting in the office?

405
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,230
Hey.

406
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,540
If you don't use your talents,

407
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,810
I find it a pity.

408
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,690
Ms. Guan.

409
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,800
You must pass Zhuowen to me.

410
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,550
I have things to say to you.

411
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,030
Just say it.

412
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,690
I've given you enough face.

413
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,680
But that's not what I want to say.

414
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,640
It's hard for you to act like this.

415
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,610
I'm not that generous.

416
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,070
There will be no next time.

417
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,160
A man should be generous.

418
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,820
Why?

419
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,180

[Harbin Institute of Technology]

421
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,230
Excuse me.

422
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,900
Do you know a student named Xie Yue?

423
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,070
She is my classmate. Who are you?

424
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,340
I'm her friend.

425
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,500
I'm looking for her.

426
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,150
What for?

427
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,510
Can you tell me.

428
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,530
You came to ask me for money?

429
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,030
No.

430
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,910
I'm here for the IOU.

431
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,830
I wanted to give it to you that day

432
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,960
but you ran too fast.

433
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,950
I do owe you money,

434
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,630
but you're not qualified to act superior.

435
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,510
I didn't fail.

436
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,230
You don't need to become a good man.

437
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,690
That's your own business.

438
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,450
Who was that?

439
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,060
A friend.

440
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,780
We had a misunderstanding.

441
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,380
It's fine.

if you need help.

445
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,910
Don't make things difficult for yourself

00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,989
Xie Yue, do you want to join the drama club?

454
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,690
Ridiculous.

455
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,790
He's crazy.

I don't have time.

457
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,489
Can't you live a normal college life?

458
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,429
I'll say it again.

459
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,159
In the Secret Service,

460
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,480
ability is always after loyalty and discipline.

461
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,920
Don't put me on the spot

462
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,199
for such a basic thing.

463
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,230
Yes.

464
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,070
1862.

465
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,190
This is...

Mr. Asano's staff.

467
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,870
There are some English alphabets on it

468
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,130
that I don't remember.

469
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,190
But these numbers must be correct.

470
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,040
It's something from the last century.

471
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,890
What are you trying to say by showing me this?

472
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,590
Everyone has at least two sides.

473
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,270
One is a self created for outsiders,

474
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,030
and the other is their true self.

475
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,780
As a commander,

476
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,880
he holds an antique in his hand.

477
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,210
What is his true side?

478
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,550
It's not that complicated.

479
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,600
Some people just like to act cool.

480
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,110
It doesn't actually mean anything.

481
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,170
Don't stray from what we're talking.

482
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,930
I mean we have to prepare a good gift

483
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,460

484
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,350
Yes, of course.

486
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,410
Rather than picking another day,

487
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,380
let's do it now.

488
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,450
Sometimes unexpected happiness

489
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,140
can make a gift more valuable.

490
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,130
There's no need to rush.

491
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,700
In my hometown, we call people like Asano

00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,480
a big tail wolf.

493
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,430

Didn't you say you'd give him something special?

500
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,130
Mr. Jin prepared all of these.
