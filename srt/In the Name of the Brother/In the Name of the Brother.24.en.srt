[Dongning Fortress]

5
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,660
The safety of Dongning Fortress

6
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,410
depends on the success of our highest mission.

7
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,330
We must know

8
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,500
how the intel was leaked.

9
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,160
and how we can let our men

10
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,990
enter Dongning Fortress.

11
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,330
What happened?

12
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,630
I just got news

13
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,310
our comrades in Hsinking

14
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,160
have liaised with Li Cunliang.

15
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,390
Li Cunliang?

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,370
He's the prime minister's secretary.

17
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,530
He used to work for Ma Zhanshan.

18
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,290
He was forced to surrender to the Japanese.

19
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,390
He's the special envoy for this fortress visit.

20
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,530
What do you need me to do?

21
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,990
This is the invisible ink.

22
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,300
This is the timer.

23
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,570
I don't have time to send them to Hsinking.

24
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,150
Since the Secret Service is in charge of reception,

25
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,740
your mission is to give them to him.

26
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,860
I'm not sure if

27
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,680
Guan Xue will send me there.

28
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,650
Do whatever it takes to get her permission to go.

29
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,390
This mission's too important.

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,890
What's the contact code?

31
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,720
Find time to buy a dark green jade pendant.

32
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,460
When you see him, say,

33
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,270
"Mr. Li, those are some sleek beads you have.

34
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,040
Are they Fujian jade?"

35
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,790
Excuse me.

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Do you know which classroom Xie Yue's in?

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,570
Over there.

38
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,690
Okay, thank you.

39
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,950
What if I don't leave?

40
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,050
If you don't leave,

41
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,790
how can I know if you are

42
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,260
in Zhuowen's heart?

43
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,270
Aren't you afraid I'd tell him

44
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,530
your evil scheme?

45
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,890
We'll just perish together.

46
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,660
Ms. Xie.

47
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,740
It's perishing together if we're equals.

48
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,540
You'd just be

49
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,290
causing your own destruction.

50
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,030
Do you know what I hate the most about you?

51
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,640
Those fake young and ignorant eyes

52
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,890
that make men want to protect you.

53
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,470
So annoying.

54
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,740
I told Zhuowen

55
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,350
you can stay here to study,

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,790
but there's no way you're living in his house.

57
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,540
What are you suspicious of?

58
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,850
Do you not trust me

59
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,510
or him?

60
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,240
Are you sure you want to know so much?

61
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,750
What if Zhuowen insists on

62
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,970
keeping me here?

63
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,510
Then always bear in mind

64
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,920
that your lifeless eyes

65
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,800
are for watching him

66
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,820
and his actions.

67
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,630
Why did my sister look for you?

68
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,250
Did she give you a hard time?

69
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,710
She asked me to stay away from you.

70
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,500
What do you mean?

71
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,690
You have to ask her.

72
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,310
Listen to your sister. Don't be nice to me.

73
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,390
Don't waste your time on me.

74
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,110
You don't know me.

75
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,720
I...

76
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,880
Your sister knows me better.

77
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,820
She's not a good person,

78
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,530
but she's a good sister.

79
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,980
Do you want me to give you a ride?

80
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,810
We're not going the same way.

81
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,250
Unit Chief Song.

82
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,480
Hello.

83
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,230
Is this Mr. Song?

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,570
Aunt Chang?

85
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,550
It's me.

86
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,910
Sir.

87
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,590
Ms. Xie just came back

88
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,350
to pack her things and left.

89
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,110
She wouldn't tell me where she's going.

90
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,880
Did you know about this?

91
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,430
No.

92
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,220
She asked you not to look for her,

93
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,700
that she won't return.

94
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,090
How did you know my office phone number?

95
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,430
Ms. Xie gave it to me.

96
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,490
Okay, got it.

97
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,390
Zhuowen.

98
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,270
Take my car.

99
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,550
Hang on.

100
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,370
Get off. I'll drive.

101
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,030
Okay.

102
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,000
Kai's transferred to the national university.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,370
It's far away from home.

104
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,030
He sets off before dawn.

105
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,840
You should add a stripe to your epaulet.

106
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,020
By the way,

107
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,610
did Jin pay you

108
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,310
your job allowance for this month

109
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,190
or last month?

110
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,130
For the special envoy,

111
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,070
the Kwantung Army has arranged a flight

112
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,130
to the fortress for tomorrow at dawn.

113
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,310
We'll just have to send them

114
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,670
to the airport.

115
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,450
And then?

116
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,910
Go home, of course.

117
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,910
I thought you couldn't talk.

118
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,980
That's all we're doing

119
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,670
for such a big event?

120
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,730
The Secret Service isn't involved?

121
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,820
No, absolutely not.

122
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,360
So?

123
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,810
I'm sure you've figured it out too.

124
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,280
Asano Diago's been treating us

125
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,250
as errand runners since the beginning.

126
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,450
We're just his puppets.

127
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,190
We've to break free.

128
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,410
How?

129
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,630
Li Cunliang is the prime minister's secretary.

130
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,660
For such a major event,

131
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,020
his security must be impenetrable.

132
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,790
We'll have to find

133
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,620
a way in.

134
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,150
What do you mean?

135
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,910
You're ambitious.

136
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,290
I just...

137
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,470
I just said what you thought.

138
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,710
The Dongning Fortress operation is top-secret.

139
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,690
Asano Diago won't allow us to participate.

140
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,620
We special agents

141
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,250
can't just do dirty and tiring work.

142
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,810
What's wrong with that?

143
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,350
If something goes wrong,

144
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,540
Asano Diago will take the responsibility alone.

145
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,110
Do you really think

146
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,890
you're a monk who's renounced the world?

147
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,800
You're not.

148
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,340
The Japanese have never changed their rules.

149
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,400
When there's a will, there's a way.

150
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,600
We'll make him change his mind.

151
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,950
Tell me.

152
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,500
What do you want me to do?

153
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,780
What's your plan?

154
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,500
The old agreement between the Secret Service and Asano Diago

155
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,510
should've been voided long ago.

156
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,220
It's time to build a new ledger.

157
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,920
What's wrong?

158
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,460
Look at you.

159
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,420
All that theatrics.

160
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,580
Welcome, Mr. Li.

161
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,350
Mr. Li.

162
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,350
Ms. Guan and I

163
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,750
will pick up some friends from Japan at the airport.

164
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,790
Everyone, please accompany Mr. Li.

165
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,700
Excuse us.

166
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,820
Okay, please go ahead.

167
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,960
Mr. Asano, for safety's sake,

168
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,790
we should arrange a guard

169
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,020
for Mr. Li.

170
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,460
Ms. Guan, you'll arrange it.

171
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,270
Yes.

172
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,230
Mr. Song.

173
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,510
You'll stay.

174
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,550
Yes.

175
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,910
What an honor to have you all today.

176
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,630
Thank you.

177
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,750
Mr. Li, those are some sleek beads you have.

178
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Are they Fujian jade?

179
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,190
No.

180
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,110
I got it last year while hiking with Qinghai's mountain people.

181
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,240
It's Kunlun jade.

182
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,520
You know your jade.

183
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,690
What do you think of my pendant?

184
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,790
Hello, Mr. Li.

185
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,320
I'm Song Zhuowen.

186
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,280
-Please.
-I'm coming.

187
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,450
How is it?

[Kwantung Army, General Staff Department]

189
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,990
Mr. Asano.

190

Does Mr. Li work in the prime minister's office?

191
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,070
Mr. Ogura, do you know him?

192
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,040
No, but I've heard about him.

193
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,790
I heard Mr. Li

194
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,570
is an excellent calligrapher

195
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,140
who's best at the cursive script.

196
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,530
Ogura's obsessed with Chinese calligraphy lately.

197
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,180
It so happens

198
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,480
his favorite's the cursive script too.

199
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,500
Please have a seat.

200
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,820
Excuse me.

201
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,630
[Dongning Fortress]

202
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,280
This operation's top-secret.

203
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,540
Don't let the fortress' men suspect us.

204
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,730
Understood.

205
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,790
Understood.

206
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,550
I'm counting on you.

207
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,070
I'm not good with such technical stuff.

208
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,950
Find someone else.

209
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,360
-Just do as I say.
-No!

210
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,970
I'll guarantee your safety.

211
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,110
What's going on?

212
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,160
Find one who's a good shooter

213
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,840
and trustworthy.

214
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,710
What are you planning?

215
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,260
My schedule must've been exposed.

216
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,770
This gunshot must've been fired by your suspect.

217
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,770
Dongning Fortress is a place where

218
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,280
even if the sky falls, it's the Kwantung Army's business.

219
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,430
For a piece

220
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,710
of burnt paper with only a few words left?

221
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,480
I'm the prime minister's secretary!

222
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,640
Why would I risk my life?

223
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,890
How was

224
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,510
such secret intel leaked?

225
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,910
Arrange one of our men

226
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,700
to enter Dongning Fortress

227
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,380
to figure out

228
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,490
who the mole is.

229
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,740
Since we're going to investigate,

230
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,070
you don't have to go to the fortress, Mr. Li.

231
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,140
We'll send you back to Hsinking to recuperate.

232
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,780
Harada!

233
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,750
Arrange a place for Mr. Li to rest.

234
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,080
Yes.

235
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,300
Get it done right!

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Can we be sure

237
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,300
Ogura and the fortress' men don't know

238
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,270
what Li Cunliang looks like?

239
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,120
Do you think he can do it?

240
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,590
Mr. Asano, I can't.

241
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,670
No way.

242
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,230
This is out of the question.

243
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,780
This is inappropriate.

244
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,339
Mr. Song.

245
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,660
Go to the fortress as Li Cunliang.

246
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,099
Neither he nor the Secret Service can bear the responsibility

247
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,069
if he fails to find the mole.

248
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,010
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

249
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll take...

250
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,440
full responsibility.

251
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,420
Ms. Guan's saying

252
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,130
it's foolish to make an uncertain promise.

253
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,090
It's decided.

254
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,060
Ms. Guan.

255
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,710
Make new ID documents

256
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,140
for Mr. Song right away.

257
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,070
Song Zhuowen.

258
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,840
Can you do it?

259
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
If it's an order,

260
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,400
I'll have to make it work.

261
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,550
This is an order.

262
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,660
What's your plan?

263
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,420
The old agreement between the Secret Service and Asano Diago

264
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,010
should've been voided long ago.

265
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,010
It's time to build a new ledger.

266
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,420
What's wrong?

267
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,470
Look at you.

268
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,030
Do whatever it takes to get her permission to go.

269
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,760
This mission's too important.

270
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,070
Nice to meet you.

271
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,050
Nice to meet you.

272
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,700
Nice to meet you. I'm Ogura Masaya.

273
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,130
Hello, Mr. Ogura Masaya.

274
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,630
I've long heard of your name.

275
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,720
But I didn't expect

276
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,540
someone adept at cursive calligraphy

277
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,440
to be so young.

278
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,150
Please come in.

279
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,880
Allow me to introduce

280
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,210
the special envoy with us for the first time,

281
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,200
Mr. Li Cunliang.

282
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,460
Nice to meet you.

283
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,770
Nice to meet you.

284
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,860
Everyone, let's begin.

285
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,570
Please sit.

286
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,960
You flatter me, Mr. Ogura.

287
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,940
I look forward to your guidance.

288
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,450
I'm the one who needs your guidance.

289
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,790
It's an honor to meet you.

290
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,210
Everyone, welcome to Harbin.

291
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,690
A toast to all of you.

292
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,780
It must be

293
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,900
the first visit for many of you.

294
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,520
You must want to know what's fun here.

295
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,770
Section Chief Guan Xue will answer this question.

296
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,320
Nice to meet you.

297
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,520
Please take a seat.

298
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,850
Mr. Asano, we're at the lift.

299
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,030
Mr. Asano.

300
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,420
Aren't we setting off too early tomorrow?

301
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,480
Headquarters' worried about leaks.

302
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,880
These experts

303
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,430
must have acquaintances in Harbin.

304
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,270
If they meet,

305
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,880
the purpose of this trip might be exposed.

306
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,480
Besides,

307
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,540
about Zhuowen impersonating Li Cunliang,

308
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,870
the less people know it, the better.

309
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,100
Got it.

310
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,580
Ms. Guan.

311
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,790
I never take the lift.

312
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,040
Because

313
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,550
you dislike being in small spaces?

314
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,040
The lift is the prime spot...

315
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,460
for assassination.

316
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,270
Zhuowen suddenly took a leave.

317
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,860
No one in the department knows where he went.

318
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,440
Doesn't Ms. Guan know?

319
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,610
I heard Mr. Asano was looking for him.

320
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,890
Let's pause the investigation,

321
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,440
lest we alert them.

322
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,990
I must cherish

323
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,140
this chance I obtained by accident.

324
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,640
After all, it's an important place

325
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,040
beyond even the Secret Service's purview.

326
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,900
Recording time will help determine

327
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,190
the relative positions of things.

328
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,490
Try to combine all the data

329
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,930
and record them

330
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,270
on my white shirt with the invisible ink.

331
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,600
As long as I keep a low profile,

332
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,950
I doubt I'd be exposed.

333
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,800
[Dongning Fortress]

334
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,710
It's a remote location

335
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,900
and the conditions are a bit rough.

336
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,620
So sorry about that, Mr. Li.

337
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,620
It's no problem.

338
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,870
It’s my duty to convey

339
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,330
the emperor and government's condolences

340
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,400
to the warriors in the fortress.

341
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,910
I dare not be picky.

342
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,700
What time does the event start?

343
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,280
You must be tired. Please take a rest.

344
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,570
The condolence ceremony will be held at 2 p.m.

345
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,740
What do you think?

346
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,680
That's great.

347
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:25,900
[A warm welcome to the special envoy for the condolence ceremony]

348
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,220
We've collected a written pledge.

349
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,010
Next, every soldier will receive orders

350
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,750
that they must

351
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,360
copy the pledge

352
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,240
in the same format.

353
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,970
The sensitive words are

354
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,860
subtly scattered throughout the pledge.

355
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,990
A handwriting analyst

356
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,100
will analyze every trace

357
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,050
to find out who leaked the intel.

358
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,130
Next, we'll arrange for the visit

359
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,840
to the fortress as soon as possible.

360
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,060
-Okay.
-Please.

361
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,650
What is it?

362
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,920
I can't contain

363
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,430
my excitement.

364
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,470
Don't you need to go back and rest?

365
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,780
Im so excited at the thought of spending day and night

366
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,660
with a master

367
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,400
of cursive calligrapher.

368
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,230
You flatter me.

369
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,910
Anyway,

370
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,160
please leave me some calligraphy treasure

371
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,810
so my trip won't be wasted.

372
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,440
If you don't mind,

373
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,470
please allow me to grind ink for you.

374
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,650
I have a habit of writing

375
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,830
only when

376
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,840
I'm energetic.

377
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,740
Otherwise, my hands won't be steady

378
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,340
and the writing will suffer.

379
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,830
I got up too early today

380
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,230
and was on a few-hour flight.

381
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,860
I'm really sorry.

382
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,450
Ogura.

383
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,830
Please pardon my bluntness.

384
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,150
As expected of a master.

385
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,670
Words are like life.

386
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,710
Your words contain deep philosophy.

387
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,850
I've learned a lot.

388
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,670
Have a rest.

389
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,200
I'll come again.

390
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,890
Did Zhuowen find anything?

391
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,870
I think he'll need

392
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,540
more time to investigate.

393
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,760
What the empire lacks the most is time.

394
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,830
Send more men over.

395
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,520
Do you doubt his loyalty?

396
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,310
No.

397
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,390
There's no absolute loyalty in this world.

398
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,930
It's the same for the country

399
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,210
and the family.

400
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,060
Are you saying

401
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,700
Zhuowen's not loyal to me

402
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,090
and you're not loyal to the empire?

403
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,130
Ms. Guan, deep down,

404
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,710
do you think

405
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,230
the empire's worthy of loyalty?

406
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,100
Which empire?

407
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,260
You know it very well.

408
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,860
Manchukuo?

409
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,550
No.

410
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,640
The Qing empire.

411
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,020
But that's my life.

412
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,760
I admire your persistence...

413
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,750
even though I beg to differ.

414
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,150
Luckily,

415
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,330
we have a common enemy.

416
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,290
Mr. Li, please.

417
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,840
Mr. Li.

418
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,220
This is a natural fortress

419
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,810
with a lot of ammunition.

420
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,520
[Army rations]

421
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,520
They're trained every day.

422
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,050
Shocking, right?

423
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,630
The soldiers here

424
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,530
barely sleep.

425
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,420
They're our fortress' elites.

426
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,780
Mr. Li, I'm sorry.

427
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,720
This room is for authorized personnel only.

428
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,570
Please.

429
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,290
This is usually a restricted area.

430
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,910
Mr. Li, this way please.

431
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:42,920
Okay.

432
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,790
The most important thing now

433
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,260
is to record the info I just collected

434
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,880
and report to the organization as soon as possible.

435
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,240
I wonder how many

436
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,910
unspeakable things are hidden in this eerie place.

437
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,910
Excuse me. Please give me some advice.

438
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,110
[A reputable and moral artist]

439
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,880
Come on in.

440
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,110
These are the words I just wrote.

441
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,140
What do you think?

442
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,410
Could you sign it for me?

443
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,470
I'm sorry!

444
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,740
I'm sorry.

445
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,070
It's okay.

446
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,900
I'll get changed.

447
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,010
I'm so sorry, Mr. Li.

448
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,390
It's okay.

449
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,220
Luckily my wife packed a few spare shirts.

450
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,680
Don't mind me asking,

451
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,190
but when will the handwriting analysis be over?

452
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,500
We're trying our best.

453
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,980
But handwriting analysis

454
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,950
can't be done by working overtime.

455
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,200
Staring at words for a long time

456
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,260
is straining to the eyes.

457
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,550
Come in.

458
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,990
Mr. Li.

459
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,170
The train delivering conciliatory gifts has arrived.

460
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,159
The transport officer insists on seeing you.

461
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,830
Got it.

462
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,290
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,150
I have to go check.

464
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,960
Okay.

465
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,000
Mr. Li.

466
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,900
I must remind you

467
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,850
the entire east side of this platform is a restricted area.

468
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,100
It's not within my jurisdiction

469
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,450
and no one has the right to ask about it.

470
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,100
Anyone who trespasses

471
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,010
will be shot to death.

472
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,480
Sorry.

473
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,400
Thank you, Mr. Xing.

474
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,240
Who are you?

475
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,160
Where's Mr. Li Cunliang?

476
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,400
You know him?

477
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:29,850
Of course.

478
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:30,850
We're old pals.

479
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,770
Where is he?

480
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,780
Do you see the car behind me?

481
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,330
What's with it?

482
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,540
Go around this car

483
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,730
through the railway.

484
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,730
He's waiting for you at the other side of the platform.

485
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,710
Mr. Li, are you close to the transport officer?

486
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,430
Yes.

487
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,460
He complained about the hard journey.

488
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,620
Let's look at the conciliatory gifts.

489
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,390
I heard

490
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,260
the Prime Minster's office had the Munitions Department

491
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,070
use the best batch of beef in Hsinking

492
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,400
to make these canned...

493
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,930
Mr. Li!

494
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,700
Mr. Li, don't go over there!

495
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,940
Don't shoot!

496
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,140
Don't shoot!

497
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Can't you hear me?

498
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,130
Don't shoot! Put the guns down!

499
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,690
[Supplies 731]

500
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,060
Mr. Xing was just looking for the restroom

501
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,870
and accidentally went there.

502
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,740
A soldier could've warned him!

503
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,270
Why did they shoot him?

504
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,460
Mr. Li, in a restricted military area,

505
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,260
shooting is just the soldiers' duty.

506
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,350
He did nothing wrong.

507
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,360
I'll report to the prime minister

508
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,560
in opposition of such behavior!

509
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,870
As I said before,

510
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,660
this is a restricted area.

511
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,330
Anyone who enters will be shot to death.

512
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,560
There are many warning signs on site.

513
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,830
You can

514
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,930
contact my superiors at any time.

515
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,080
I can only say

516
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,510
that if the three of us

517
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,420
take a step into the restricted area,

518
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,330
we'll be dead

519
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,570
like the transport officer too.

520
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,910
Mr. Li, how did this happen?

521
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,450
How did Mr. Sato handle it?

522
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,170
He just doubled the pension.

523
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,890
Why did he

524
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,940
suddenly go there to use the restroom?

525
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,390
Mr. Li, the conciliatory gifts have been unloaded.

526
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,070
We've done

527
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,010
an inventory check and all's good.

528
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,090
Got it.

529
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,880
Mr. Li, the calligraphy you promised me...

530
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,550
What's wrong?

531
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,330
Someone came into my room.

532
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,820
Yes, it was an orderly.

533
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,250
I asked him to wash your dirty shirt.

534
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,770
Mr. Li!

535
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,380
Stop it!

536
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,650
I'll do it myself.

537
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,870
Sorry.

538
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,940
My wife

539
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
is paranoid.

540
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,830
I have to give her the clothes I've worn outside

541
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,900
as they are.

542
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,170
I'm sorry.

543
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,040
Sorry for the trouble I've caused.

544
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,520
The person we're looking for

545
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,720
might have noticed something amiss.

546
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,540
So when he was writing the pledge,

547
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,470
he deliberately used a different handwriting.

548
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,330
Or maybe even his left hand.

549
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,890
But if a person who has never been trained

550
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,440
writes with his left hand,

551
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,490
we can see that.

552
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,920
There's another possibility.

553
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,750
Mr. Sato doesn't want us to find out

554
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,520
there's a traitor in his team.

555
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,920
You're right.

556
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,110
He wouldn't dare take such a big risk.

557
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,650
He'd keep investigating with his own men.

558
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,550
So we can't be sure we've seen

559
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,100
the handwriting of all soldiers.

560
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,030
I see.

561
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,480
Gentlemen.

562
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,500
We're experiencing some turbulence

563
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,470
on this flight.

564
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,130
Please check that your seatbelts are fastened.

565
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,920
Mr. Li.

566
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,840
Mr. Li!

567
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,830
Something bothering you?

568
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,070
Not really.

569
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,950
Just a bit disappointed.

570
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,580
I came all the way here

571
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,340
just to return in vain.

572
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,250
Mr. Li.

573
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,810
Who exactly are you?
