Yes.

Right, it's him.

22
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,590
He was severely injured.

23
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,340
His ankle was so swollen

24
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,150
that the socks wouldn't come off.

25
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,950
Like this bad!

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
I was wondering how to treat him.

27
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,790
Then I decided

28
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,360
to use the tiger bone tincture and musk ointment

29
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,680
on him.

30
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,770
Even so,

31
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,579
it would still take some time for him to recover.

32
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,070
So now he has to stay home?

33
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Sure thing.

That man

41
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,310
seemed rich.

42
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,510
His leather shoes were made by an English brand,

Crockett.

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
His socks and pants

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,290
were all foreign goods.

46
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,920
However,

47
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,300
he had poor personal hygiene.

48
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,190

I could tell

51
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,500
that he hadn't showered for days.

52
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,130
Was his injury really bad?

53
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,630
Yes. To be honest,

54
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,430
his bones

55
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,730
might have fractured.

56
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,190
He was in a hurry to leave,

57
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,070
so I wrote him a prescription.

58
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,240
I can't recall

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,630
what happened after that.

60
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,360

has delivered food

to a single man in his 30s.

193
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,910
Also, once you spot

194
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,350
the man wearing a grey coat

195
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,150
and glasses,

196
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,230
arrest him immediately.

197

-Yes.
-Yes.

198
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,400
Sir.

199
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,870
A table for how many?

200
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,750
Has a man with difficulty walking

201
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,120
ordered dumplings here?

202
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,830
Can't take more orders today.

203
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,630
Place one for tomorrow, alright?

204
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,470
Look at me,

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,990
The man with a limp

209
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,750
in the No. 15 Anning Street has ordered dumplings again.

210
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,040
Who is going to make the delivery?

Come on.

[Anning Street]

221
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,320
I made an inquiry.

An employee said the man in a suit

223
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,430
living in No. 15 Anning Street had a sprained ankle.

224
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,760
That must be our target.

225
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,830
I'll shoot twice later.

226
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,350
You two follow me to the left.

227
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,390
You guys go to the right.

228
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,710
Cover the two alleys and encircle him.

229
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,640
We'll meet up there.

230
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,170
Remember, catch him alive.

231
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,950
Yes.

232
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,270
Go!

233
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,880
Yes.

234

Block every gateway!

235

We must catch him alive.

236
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,190

He's not here.

Who are you?

241
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,550
Do you work for Duan

242
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,910
or the Secret Service?

243
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm on your side.

244
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,120
I thought

245
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,510
those from the Police Agency would arrive first.

246
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,990
You have the intel but you wouldn't contact the organization.

247
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,850
You wouldn't show up where and when you agreed upon.

249
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,630
It's not about what I want.

I've realized the truth.

What does it mean?

We'll arrange your withdrawal.

You'll receive proper medical treatment.

Are you bargaining with the organization?

If you get any closer,

272
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,510

Get out if you can't afford the price.

Are you hearing yourself?

291
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,440
Was I supposed to hold the fire,

292
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,940
and let him shoot me dead?

293
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,710
Ms. Guan said

294
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,750
if there was danger,

295
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,250
I could fire my gun before the enemy did.

296
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,910
Ms. Guan was right.

297
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,040

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,910

00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,430

307

Why can't I be here?

308
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,270
Ms. Guan must've also granted you

309
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,050
the right to take action alone, right?

310
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,900

00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,130

Then that newcomer shot the target dead.

It's easy to kill a man, isn't it?

318
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,710
Didn't he know it's necessary to keep the target alive under those circumstances?

319
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,150
The failure resulted from your incompetence.

320
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,280
I don't want to hear you whine about it.

Or we would have to take the fall together.

337
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,270

Now that we have the intel,

354
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,000
whether that man could live to give a testimony wouldn't matter anymore.

Don't be so paranoid.

356
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,110
I'm not paranoid.

357
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,520
The fact is, whatever I do,

358
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,260
people would gossip about it.

359
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,440
Gossip can't kill you.

360
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,230
I'm not afraid of getting in danger.

361
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,330
I just fear that I might drag you down.

Don't worry about me.

363
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,460
It'll be helpful to me if you can earn your own place.

Stop biting your nails.

365
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,490
Use my nail clipper.

Okay.

But Mr. Hu

371
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,590
always gives me a weird look.

372
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,130
You know what?

373
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,030
This clipper does work better than my teeth.

374
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,390

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,080
Ms. Guan,

378
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,180
about the matter you asked me to investigate...

379
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,840
Which do you prefer, a woman with long hair or short hair?

380
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,490
Long hair.

381
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,380
When I was receiving training in Japan,

382
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,960
I had short hair.

383
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,680
I did some research.

384
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,670
Mr. Pan and Mr. Hu

385
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,190
are just two playboys who enjoy drinking alcohol.

386
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,300
There's nothing special about them.

387
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,410
It seems like you still don't understand.

388
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,670
Wherever you are,

389
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,800
there is only one ladder you can climb up on.

390
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,470
How are you supposed to reach a higher place

391
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,930
if you don't push your rivals off the ladder?

392
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,070
Got it.

393
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,830
Hello.

394
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,840
Ms. Guan, a call for you.

395
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,930
What could be so urgent that someone would call the salon to reach me?

396
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,620
But don't you dare

397
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
push me off the ladder.

398
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,610
I won't.

399
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,310
Hello?

400
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,860
[Police Agency]

401
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,050
What are you waiting for?

402
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,980
Get back to work!

403
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,550
Yes.

404
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,200
The Spring Festival is far away.

405
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,400
Why are we doing this?

406
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,530
Has no one told you?

407
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,630
There will be a new superior.

408
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,630
A new superior?

409
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,610
Are we gonna have a new director?

410
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,530
Can't you understand?

411
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
There are two different things.

412
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,400
The Police Agency writes paychecks.

413
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,560
The Secret Service actually reports to

414
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,700
the second section of Kwantung Army's General Staff Department.

415
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,470
The section is now being led by a new chief,

416
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,310
who would set out from Hsinking this morning.

417
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,240
Maybe our office is the first place

418
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,770
he'll drop by upon his arrival in Harbin.

419
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,230
You can't do this to yourself.

420
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,520
You're an extreme perfectionist.

421
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,310
That's not a healthy lifestyle, is it?

422
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,990
Ms. Guan,

423
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,270
sorry for the intrusion.

424
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,800
Please sign this document.

425
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,800
The department is urging for it.

426
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,590
It's either perfection or destruction.

427
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,670
That's not true. In the Police Agency,

428
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,800
the Secret Service is irreplaceable.

429
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,760
Hu Bin, can't you just shut up?

430
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,300
By this age,

431
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,830
you should've learned to read the room.

432
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,630
It's true that Duan has escaped,

433
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,490
but we still have Shi in our hands.

434
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,430
The key is we have gotten the intel.

435
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,490
I think the new superior

436
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,020
will see our achievements.

437
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,010
He was attacked the moment he arrived.

438
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,670
And you want me to tell him what we've achieved?

439
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,710
It's said that the bullet went through the driver's neck,

440
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,890
and got into the chief's shoulder.

441
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,440
How far was he when the shooting happened?

442
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,770
What type of gun was used

443
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,290
by the assassin?

444
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:58,270
Guan Xue, section chief of the Secret Service of Harbin Police Agency.

445
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,470
Is Ms. Guan here?

446
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,230
This way, please.

447
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,870
I'm Guan Xue, section chief of the Secret Service of Harbin Police Agency.

448
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,660
Greetings, sir.

449
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,440
I'm sorry for not being able to protect you from the attack.

450
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,320
Harbin is a big city.

451
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,710
How are you supposed to protect everyone?

452
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,370
Take a seat.

453
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,700
It is actually not your fault that I got shot.

454
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,470
This incident happened right after you arrived in Harbin.

455
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,000
We should be held to blame.

456
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,710
You are not at fault whatsoever.

457
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,760
The assassin stalked me all the way from Hsinking.

458
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,470
Besides,

459
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,240
beating yourself up isn't exactly a good habit.

460
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,510
Do you know him?

461
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,660
He and I go way back.

462
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,240
In Hsinking, his job

463
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,440
was to attack Japanese military officers with special social backgrounds.

464
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,230
I tried to set him up four times,

465
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,300
and all his accomplices fell for my traps.

466
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,560
But now,

467
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,590
I still don't know what he looks like.

468
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,640
All I know is his nickname,

469
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,950
Manchukuo's Robin Hood.

470
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,790
He followed you all the way to Harbin.

471
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,790
He is as stubborn as me.

472
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,720
But it's a good thing.

473
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,580
Otherwise,

474
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,560
I would feel very lonely.

475
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,750
Mr. Asano, you are humorous.

476
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,270
Alright.

477
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,450
Let's change the subject.

478
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,630
I have heard

479
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,010
that recently the Secret Service

480
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,600
has solved a case about spies involving communists.

481
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,659
Can you

482
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,929
tell me the details?

483
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,120
Yes.

484
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,790
You must drink it.

485
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,330
This is the last time I'm saying it.

486
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,310
Then I'll say this for one last time too.

487
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,239
I can't drink it.

488
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,560
Enjoy the drinks, guys.

489
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,710
I'm going to talk to the hostess.

490
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,949
Take it.

491
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,630
What is it for?

492
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,740
Your medical bills.

493
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,870
I'll hit you in the face next week on the training field.

494
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,130
If I beat you too hard, please forgive me.

495
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,950
Hitting my face

496
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,080
is no different from slapping Ms. Guan in the face, is it?

497
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,570
You think you can speak for her?

498
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,770
Aren't you cheeky?

499
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,560
You mean nothing to her at all.

500
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,980
Ms. Guan said

501
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,840
if you could be more stable and reliable,

502
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,310
she would leave you in charge of the Secret Service.

503
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,430
Shut up!

504
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,430
You keep talking about Ms. Guan.

505
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,630
Don't you know you're just an outsider?

506
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,570
Aren't we a family?

507
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,110
I mean,

508
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,240
we're like in-laws.

509
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,920
You have such a glib tongue.

510
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,830
I'm definitely going to beat you up.

511
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,230
Do you know why?

512
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,670
Ms. Guan has given you too much help.

513
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,240
If I don't outperform you in the arena,

514
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,040
I won't be able to keep my authority as a unit chief.

515
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,410
Do you have to resort to violence?

516
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,590
Of course.

517
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:18,950
Come on.

518
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,330
Take it.

519
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,870
If I beat you too hard,

520
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,460
please forgive me.

521
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,470
A film roll is hidden in a tobacco pipe.

522
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,750
Interesting, huh?

523
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,010
What does the film record?

524
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,240
According to the rules,

525
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,190
if there is any intel that's possibly relevant

526
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,650
to the Japanese military,

527
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,910
we are denied the right to process it in any way.

528
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,240
So now we don't know what the film records.

529
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,600
I'll have my deputy go with you to fetch it.

530
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,950
The film must be developed tonight.

531
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,850
I need to see the content within immediately.

532
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,760
Yes.

533
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,070
By the way,

534
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,500
you did offer a great suggestion,

535
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,400
though somewhat the trap could be easily

536
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,490
seen through.

537
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,710
If

538
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,790
we make it a real thing,

539
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,430
then maybe

540
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,000
that old friend of mine from Hsinking

541
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,670
will truly fall for it.

542
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,170
Tomorrow,

543
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,180
I'll be discharged from the hospital for real.

544
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,910
Take as much time as you need.

545
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
I'll be waiting to see the film roll.

546
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,110
Yes.

547
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,080
Go.

548
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,990
Hello.

549
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,270
Mr. Qian,

550
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,130
it sounds like you're with a crowd.

551
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,340
Keep an eye on the card players later.

552
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,380
Is there going to be a cheater?

553
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,010
Yes.

554
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,270
Don't you remember the previous tragic failure?

555
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,670
Thanks for the heads-up.

556
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,960
Autumn is approaching.

557
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,550
Time to harvest what you've raised in the mountain, right?

558
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,010
I'll make an arrangement.

559
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,100
Have some more.

560
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,420
Chiefs,

561
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,100
this is my last toast to you tonight.

562
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
None of us are leaving here tonight.

563
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,080
I formed a bad habit when I was a railway police officer.

564
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,390
I get sleepy at a certain hour of the day.

565
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,230
Everyone in the Secret Service always stays up late at night.

566
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,670
Try to get rid of that bad habit of yours.

567
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,820
I'll tie up whoever wants to leave tonight.

568
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,420
Don't just stand there. Sit.

569
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,880
-Have a few more drinks, Zhuowen.
-Good evening.

570
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,200
Is this your pen?

571
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,870
Did Sheriff Watanabe usually take a pen with him?

572
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,990
I never saw him with one.
