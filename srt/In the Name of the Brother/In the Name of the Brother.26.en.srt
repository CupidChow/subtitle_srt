Sorry.

This is unfair.

I'll deal with Pan Yue's men one by one

Get me evidence that he's embezzled money.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,670
He's very cautious.

33
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,520
It's too hard.

34
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,430
Don't you know how to plant evidence?

35
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,890
Do you need me to teach you?

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,230
No, no.

37
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,190
I understand.

38
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,340
Mr. Song didn't meet you again?

39

No.

40
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,640
Luckily, he made it back alive.

If he had died,

What do you mean?

46
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,570
I asked you to come back to keep an eye on him.

47
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,870
I'm not smart enough.

48
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,070
I can't do what you taught me.

49
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,600

Go get me a glass of water.

I'll interrogate him again.

153
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,640
It's morphine.

Mr. Hu, you're killing him.

162

A dead man can't tell you anything.

163

As long as you tell me what you know,

165

Ms. Guan, it's too soon for that.

173

176
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,390

He's one of us too.

181

Has the electrocution made you delirious?

182
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,590
He just gave me morphine.

183
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,730
He told me to hang in there. He…

184
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,090
He said he'd get me out of here.

185
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,130
It's pointless for me to lie now.

186
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,770

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,350
I can't.

190
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,850
My children are still in Fengtian.

191
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,100
Don't move!

192
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,250
Take him down!

193
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
Let me out.

194
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,870
Let…

195
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,510
Let me out.

196
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,910
Release me!

197
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,500
Release…

198
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,320
Hello, who is it?

199
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,950
He's sent me a telegram.

200
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,480
Don't worry. He's fine.

201
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,270
I can rest assured when you're around.

202
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,820
Aren't you eating? I bought a lot of them.

203
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,680
I don't eat this. Did you forget?

204
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,740
Take what's left with you.

205
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,800
Song Zhuowen and Xie Yue know I don't eat this.

206
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,920
And this.

207
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,120
Keep it for me.

208
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,580
If someone sees it and asks me,

209
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,550
I don't know what to say.

210
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,170
[Chang Yuming, Female, Chief of the Communication Unit]

211
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,880
It was just a day and a night, but it felt longer than a lifetime.

212
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,980
It was too much.

213
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,920
I couldn't take it anymore.

214
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,300
They tortured you as well?

215
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,080
It was intolerable, right?

216
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,310
So,

217
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,410
we might as well tell them everything.

218
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,470
There's no telling if we can survive,

219
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,720
but at least we can suffer less.

220
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,430
That depends on

221
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,920
whether they can find my handler.

222
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,870
What if they can't?

223
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,710
If they can't,

224
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,620
they'll think we lied

225
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,580
and torture us even harder.

226
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,770
They won't let you die.

227
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,620
Ridiculous!

228
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,300
Everything I said is true.

229
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,350
It's their fault if they can't catch anyone.

230
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,010
What does it have to do with me?

231
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,370
Everything I said is true.

232
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,860
At three o'clock this afternoon,

233
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,510
in the teahouse on the west side of Minfu Street.

234
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:22,040
One person from either side. It shouldn't be hard to catch them.

235
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,070
There are three teahouses on that street, right?

236
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,470
I'm not a local.

237
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't know there are three teahouses there.

238
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,200
I hope they can be careful.

239
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,700
Please be careful and catch them.

240
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,010
It's useless to say anything now.

241
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,580
Just wait.

242
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,220
No.

243
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,590
When they meet, Xia Tao will have

244
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,920
a pastry box in his hand.

245
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,940
It's an obvious sign.

246
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,210
It can't be hard to catch them.

247
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,150
Open the door.

248
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,400
Comrade.

249
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,500
Despicable!

250
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,260
Did you hear that?

251
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,320
Your act was so convincing.

252
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,470
In the future,

253
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,360
ask Mr. Hu to do things like this.

254
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,020
It'll take me two weeks to recover from the wound I got from the act.

255
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,730
He looks too fierce.

256
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,030
He can't act.

257
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,760
You have to do it.

258
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Even now,

259
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,300
we still can't completely trust

260
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,860
what that guy said.

261
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,000
We have to assume he didn't lie.

262
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,380
You have five minutes

263
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,990
to treat your wound.

264
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,370
Then wash your face

265
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,990
and get changed.

266
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,890
The meeting is at three.

267
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,820
We don't have much time left.

268
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,940
Here. Unlock the shackles.

269
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,110
Okay.

270
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,130
I can do it myself.

271
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,340
Hello?

272
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,630
Is it Mr. Song?

273
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,520
Yes, Mr. Asano.

274
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,740
I've heard about what happened in Qiqihar.

275
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,280
How should I put it?

276
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,910
Technically,

277
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,420
they've done everything by the book,

278
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,620
but you need to understand that

279
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,670
no matter how complex

280
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,590
the relationships between various intelligence agencies are,

281
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,590
when it comes to Dongning Fortress,

282
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,860
the Secret Service has the final say.

283
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,630
That's the principle.

284
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,630
Do you understand what I mean?

285
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,430
Yes.

286
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,850
Now that you've said that,

287
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,640
I'll handle it appropriately.

288
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,460
Okay.

289
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,010
Who was it?

290
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,600
Mr. Asano called.

291
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,180
It was still about Qiqihar.

292
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
He thinks we're being a bit too soft.

293
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,420
Since we've already given the higher-ups the impression of being soft on the inside,

294
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,420
we should be tougher on the outside.

295
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,310
Let's go.

296
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,350
In an hour,

297
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,020
on Minfu Street, the head of Harbin's underground party

298
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,050
will meet the guy

299
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,590
who escaped the crackdown in Fengtian.

300
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,220
He'll be holding a pastry box

301
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,960
as the contact sign.

302
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,060
They'll meet

303
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
in the biggest teahouse in the west.

304
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,150
The roads there are narrow and crowded.

305
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,310
They'll definitely have accomplices nearby.

306
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,210
We don't know how many they are,

307
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,940
where they are, or what kind of weapons they have.

308
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,460
The Japanese are taking this operation very seriously.

309
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,760
Mr. Asano is worried that we're short-handed,

310
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,560
so the Military Police will send men to assist us.

311
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,330
They'll set up another trap around Minfu Street.

312
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Once we engage with the communists,

313
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,360
they'll close the trap immediately.

314
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,960
Understand?

315
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

316
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,560
Oh no.

317
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,480
I left Ms. Guan's work notebook

318
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,520
in the meeting room.

319
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,250
Is that okay?

320
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,090
Not at all! The notes in it are very important.

321
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,270
It should be kept safe.

322
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,800
I'll go get it. Give me a sec.

323
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,700
Are you out of your mind?

324
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,950
Hong Fan is out.

325
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,800
Let me go with you.

326
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,960
I can go alone.

327
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,780
You stay here.

328
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,550

329
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,760
You haven't.

330
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,400
Fine.

331
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,440
Okay.

332
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,320
If anything happens,

333
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,440
come back immediately

334
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
and inform Hong Fan.

335
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,400
You must be kidding.

336
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,560
If something happens, I'll deal with it.

337
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,520
No way.

338
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,880
If something happens to me,

339
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,000
someone needs to come back with the news.

340
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,640
It's the rule set for the bigger picture.

341
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,300
Fine, fine.

342
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,570
Don't jinx it. Let's go.

343
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
I'll say it again.

344
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,680
Remember.

345
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,760
If something happens to me, don't try to save me.

346
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,530
Go back and report it.

347
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,240
Got it. Let's go.

[Xing'an Inn]

349
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,760
Stay sharp.

350
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,800
The more communists you identify,

351
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,860
the closer you are to a bright future.

352
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,630
Don't just stare straight ahead.

353
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,800
Look around at other places too.

354
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,040

It's 20 minutes to three.

357
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,130
I'll go there first.

358

If nothing happens after ten minutes, come over.

Try to meet him before 3.

360
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,710
Be careful.

361
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,500
Have you seen any communists?

Why is he talking with that kid?

365
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,040
Sometimes, you can't blame one for being kind.

366
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,800
He just doesn't want that boy to be hurt

367
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,860
in the chaos later.

368
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,600
Let me ask you.

How many skewers of candied haws can I buy with this money?

Two.

371
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,510
Okay. Go buy two skewers of candied haws for me.

Do you see the painter over there?

Yes.

00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,940
I'll wait for you there.

375
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,400
If I change my clothes and put on a beard,

376
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,330
can you still recognize me?

377
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,210
Yes.

378
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,760
I doubt that.

379
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,740
How about this?

380
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,380
My name is Zhuowen.

381
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,330
Do you remember?

382
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,150
Yes.

383
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:10,890
The more I look at him, the more he looks like a communist involved in student movements.

384
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,110
You're right.

385
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,800
He is a communist.

386
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,250
That's not funny at all.

387
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,900
Have you seen anyone?

388
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,330
How much longer until the meeting?

389
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,100
Ten minutes.

390
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,130
What do you want?

391
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,570
Mr. Zhuowen.

392
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,990
What's it, kid?

393
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,400
Didn't you ask me to buy two skewers of candied haws?

394
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,160
One for each of us.

395
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,640
If I'm right,

396
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,890
I can have both of them.

397
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,120
Okay.

398
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,920
You can have both of them.

399
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
Kid, go home now.

400
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,800
Thank you, sir.

401
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,780
Where did that shot come from?

402
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,250
Who pulled the trigger?

403
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,560
It seems to be from behind.

404
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,520
Stop!

405
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,960
Stop!

406
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,530
Stop. Turn around. Go back.

407
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,160
Move! Go back!

408
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,160
Go back. Back off!

409
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,950
Don't panic!

410
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,670
Don't move!

411
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Stop running!

412
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,380
Go!

413
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,040
Move!

414
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,600
Stop!

415
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,040
Move!

416
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,720
Go back!

417
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,570
Go. Move!

418
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,330
Keep moving.

419
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,680
Go back.

420
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,880
Get down!

421
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,120
Go!

422
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,320
Stay down. Stay down.

423
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,090
Out of the car!

424
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,470
Hurry, hurry!

425
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,710
Surround them.

426
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,200
Don't move!

427
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,720
Don't move!

428
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,520
Keep moving.

429
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,760
Xia Tao is there! Somebody!

430
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,930
Xia Tao is there!

431
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,800
Catch Xia Tao!

432
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,960
Stop!

433
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,720
Stop!

434
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,420
It's a dead end.

435
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,240
Come on.

436
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,520
Don't let them escape!
