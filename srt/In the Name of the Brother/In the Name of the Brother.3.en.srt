[Episode 3]

4
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,550
Why are you back so late?

5
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,310
Sister.

6
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,740
I think Wen has changed.

7
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,790
Has he changed for the better or worse?

8
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,670
You can't simply classify people into good and bad.

9
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,330
Human nature is complicated.

10
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,510
It's just like others may say that you're bad,

11
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,310
but in my heart, you are the best.

12
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,480

[One week later]

25
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,320
These have all been signed,

26
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,590
and have them indicate the purpose for these documents.

27
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,150
Okay.

28
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,860
Tian Xiaojiang?

29
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,350
Tian Xiaojiang.

30
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,970
I served in the 1st Brigade Reconnaissance Company,

31
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,870
participated in three battles against the Japanese,

32
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,390
and was selected to be a sergeant of Hsinking due to my meritorious service.

33
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,480
Were you assigned to Secret Service,

34
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,150
or was it voluntary?

35
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,790
I volunteered.

36
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,190
Secret Service's work is more dangerous than the battlefield, you know?

37
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,760
I wouldn't have come if it wasn't dangerous.

38
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,390
Why?

39
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,430
The Secret Service is a steel knife to counter espionage and communism.

40
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,159
I want to be the tip of the blade.

41
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,080
My name is Ding Peng.

42
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,030
In 1918...

43
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,010
Did you come to Secret Service voluntarily?

44
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,690
Yes...

45
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,480
and also no.

46
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,350
Why?

47
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,350
Over here,

48
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,550
you need to speak as fast as when you draw a gun.

49
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,240
Because...

50
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,750
Over here, I get paid more.

51
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,400
Where are you comparing to?

52
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
How much more?

53
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,200
17.52 yuan more than Highways Department,

54
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,790
9.7 yuan more than Inspection Office,

55
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,300
11.6 yuan more than Law Department,

56
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,790
and...

57
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,510
Mr. Song.

58
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,690
It's your turn.

59
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,280
My name is Song Zhuowen.

60
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
I was transferred from the railway.

61
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,630
This is the weapons room. Before any operation,

62
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,400
come here and get your gun.

63
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,390
Up ahead

64
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,120
is the conference room.

65
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,420
What's down there?

66
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,570
There?

67
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,790
It's the interrogation room.

68
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:54,760
Section Chief Jin.

69
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,420
It's a phone call from our Department Director.

70
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,860
You guys look around first.

71
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,570
I'll find you guys later.

72
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes.

73
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,040
Would you be interested in taking a look

74
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
at what's down there?

75
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,080
The interrogation room?

76
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,270
That's against the rules, right?

77
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,110
What rules?

78
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,080
Tell me, what rules?

79
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,230
Sir asked us to take a look around.

80
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,790
He didn't say we can't go anywhere.

81
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,630
Right, Wen?

82
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,070
I'm telling you, in this whole building,

83
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,590
the floors above are just a disguise.

84
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,850
The real Secret Service is underground.

85
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,920
Are you coming or not?

86
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,830
I'll go with you.

87
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,210
With you here, I'm not afraid of punishment.

88
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,820
Let's go.

89
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,670
What do you think

90
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,510
of the three newbies?

91
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,610
Ding Peng must be quite well-connected, right?

92
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,170
All he thinks about is money.

93
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,830
Let's see how we would use him.

94
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,110
What about the other one?

95
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,380
Tian Xiaojiang speaks so extravagantly,

96
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,490
but he indeed has a good foundation.

97
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,670
He has fought against the Japanese for real.

98
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,670
Mr. Hu, did you witness it yourself,

99
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,390
or did he tell you himself?

100
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,289
Secret Service is a steel knife,

101
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,270
and he wants to be the blade.

102
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,660
Does that mean everyone else is just a knife handle?

103
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,790
They're just pretending to be smart.

104
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,620
What do you think of Song Zhuowen?

105
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
What do you think?

106
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,770
That Song Zhuowen is just a newbie,

107
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,160
yet he dares to challenge Unit Chief Hu.

108
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,930
He'll definitely be somebody

109
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,200
in the future.

110
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,870
You were also at the warehouse that day, right?

111
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,550
Do you also feel that

112
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,410
Song Zhuowen stole the limelight

113
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,030
of Unit Chief Hu?

114
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,460
That day...

115
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,830
Let's give them a try.

116
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,590
We wouldn't know if we don't try.

117
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,300
Got it.

118
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,490
I will say this once again.

119
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,290
This is the Police Agency's Secret Service.

120
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,660
Try to use different people

121
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,180
for our common goals.

122
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,790
Got it?

123
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,420
Yes.

124
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,060
Yes.

125
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,010
You're interested?

126
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,490
Unit Chief Pan.

127
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,870
We just got here.

128
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,130
We would of course want to learn from you.

129
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,530
Here at Secret Service,

130
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,240
saying such words is just a load of nonsense.

131
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,310
Don’t you want to be the tip of the blade?

132
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,370
Go in and interrogate him yourself.

133
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,660
How?

134
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,470
It doesn't matter as long as you can get a testimony out of him.

135
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,230
Yes.

136
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,050
You're tough, aren't you?

137
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,640
He may be a tough one, but Mr. Pan didn't mention the rotting flesh.

138
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,070
If there isn't a good piece of flesh,

139
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,800
there's not much that we can do.

140
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,840
What are you looking at?

141
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,010
Go get a bowl of water.

142
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,370
What are you doing?

143
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,040
Why are you giving him water?

144
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,440
He's so badly beaten that

145
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,340
he can't even catch a breather.

146
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,670
If you don't give him some water,

147
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,140
he won't be able to say anything even if he wanted to.

148
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,140
How are we going to interrogate him?

149
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,240
You can't give him water.

150
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,350
Otherwise, he would think that we are weak.

151
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,610
One move.

152
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,890
I'll make him talk with just one move.

153
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,670
They have already tried piercing his fingernails

154
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,800
with steel needles.

155
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,210
But I'm different.

156
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,620
I am going to stick the needle in the groove

157
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,390
between his middle and index fingers.

158
00:11:59,390 --> 00:11:59,990
I have checked medical books.

159
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,830
That spot is the softest,

160
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,360
and has many nerve endings.

161
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,530
Then, we tie a copper wire on the end of the steel needle.

162
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,100
Think about it. Getting poked by a needle with electricity running through?

163
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,960
You would confess no matter what.

164
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,210
Have you ever tried this before though?

165
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,700
Don't kill him,

166
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,170
or we'll be in big trouble.

167
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,690
As long as we scare him, that's enough.

168
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,580
Are you interrogating a kid, Wen?

169
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,040
How is scaring him enough?

170
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,970
Whatever.

171
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,790
We'll each use our own tricks.

172
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,390
I don't care what you do,

173
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,050
so don't you care about me too.

174
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,420
You heard that?

175
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,570
If this goes on,

176
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,640
it'll be steel needles with electricity.

177
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,030
Go away. Let me do it.

178
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,690
I'll give you one last chance.

179
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,750
If you don't confess,

180
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,880
you won't even have a life left.

181
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,840
For the rest of your life...

182
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,470
Let me do it.

183
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,270
Tian Xiaojiang, I'll screw you!

184
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,900
Leave your words behind now.

185
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,780
If you want to be crazy, do it alone.

186
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,040
Don't get us involved.

187
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,910
He wants us to interrogate him,

188
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,150
not to kill him.

189
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,990
If you two are afraid,

190
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,270
you can get out now.

191
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,880
I'll do it myself, okay?

192
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,230
Don't you dare!

193
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,550
Who let you in?

194
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,890
You've got a lot of nerve.

195
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,520
It's only been a few days.

196
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,200
In a few months,

197
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,420
you guys will be raiding the safe deposit box in the Section Chief's office, right?

198
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,180
Do you know the interrogation procedure?

199
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,710
Do you know anything about confidentiality?

200
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,850
It's not too much for me to pull out my gun and shoot all three of you.

201
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,910
Why are you still standing there?

202
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,240
Need me to carry you out?

203
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,190
Start.

204
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,080
You've never touched a gun,

205
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,630
have you?

206
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,070
I don't get many chances to handle a gun at the police academy.

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,130
He might not be good with guns,

208
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,820
but he can fight. For people like you,

209
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,150
he can easily handle seven or eight of you by himself.

210
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,110
If you don't believe me,

211
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,370
come out and fight him.

212
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,790
Let us see how good he is.

213
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,450
Here, bro.

214
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,020
Come on.

215
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,740
Pick a few folks and test your skills.

216
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,720
Sorry, I can't do it.

217
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,550
Why?

218
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,470
I'm a newbie.

219
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,060
If I hurt any of you seniors,

220
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
what will happen to you in the future?

221
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,210
Did you hear that?

222
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,090
He's afraid of hurting all of you.

223
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,380
Don't come forward if you're afraid of getting hurt.

224
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,460
That's right. That's our men in the Operations Unit for you.

225
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,030
Don't be afraid.

226
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,270
If you get injured,

227
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,230
I'll pay for the medical expenses.

228
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,270
Brother Song.

229
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,350
I'm Erbao.

230
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,630
Unit Chief said you're a one-man show.

231
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,120
I won't stand on courtesy then.

232
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,040
Three more men.

233
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,590
Okay.

234
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,210
The four of us will fight against Brother Song.

235
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,470
Mr. Hu is trying to give us a hard time.

236
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,300
Unit Chief Hu.

237
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,250
Ask your men to stand down.

238
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,210
I'm not going to fight.

239
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,090
Song Zhuowen.

240
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,320
This is an internal training session for our Operations Unit.

241
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,250
This is an order.

242
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,820
I'll go first.

243
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,230
Song Zhuowen, you're not going to fight back, are you?

244
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,740
Stop!

245
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,050
I just wanted them to learn from each other.

246
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,030
I saw it all.

247
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,230
You newbies

248
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,080
have nothing better to do?

249
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,020
Keep the guns away.

250
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,380
Guan Xue.

251
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,160
Don't tug on my clothes.

252
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,570
Call me Section Chief Guan.

253
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,590
Yes, Section Chief Guan. I'll remember.

254
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,390
I just wanted to test his skills.

255
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,870
I didn't say I wouldn't let you try.

256
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
Every newbie has to be screened.

257
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,150
But you are not to abuse your power for personal grievances,

258
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,080
and beat him up publicly as a group.

259
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,430
Hu Bin, you're...

260
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,330
too ambitious,

261
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
but also too narrow-minded.

262
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,440
You can't hide your grievances well,

263
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,820
and it's written all over your face instead.

264
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,100
You look like crap.

265
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,610
Unit Chief Hu is exactly

266
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,320
that sort of person. He hides a knife within his teeth.

267
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,310
Just ignore him.

268
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,200
Of course not.

269
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,950
I'm a newbie.

270
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,160
You are all seniors.

271
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,760
A newbie deserves to be respected too.

272
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,770
There's no need to be polite with me.

273
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,990
From now on,

274
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,540
the Secret Service is your home.

275
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,390
I'm counting on you for more advice.

276
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,060
[Dormitory 2]

277
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,300
I'm new here.

278
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,330
I don't know much.

279
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,830
If there's anything you don't understand, just ask me.

280
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,780
You always go to the Section Chief.

281
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,580
It's easy for the rest to gossip,

282
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,080
even if I don't mind.

283
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,040
Here.

284
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,870
Let me have it.

285
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,230
Go straight ahead, and your dormitory is the very last room.

286
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,730
Okay, see you tomorrow at the department.

287
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,190
See you at the department.

288
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,130
Come in.

289
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,440
This is information on Song Zhuowen.

290
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,500
Anything wrong?

291
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,870
No.

292
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,960
He's just slightly despicable.

293
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,300
He resold train tickets previously,

294
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,160
and received favors from a thief.

295
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,790
He had also earned a share of travellers' lost property.

296
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,490
The amount of letters of apology that he has written,

297
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,390
is probably more than the bills he have in his pocket.

298
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,390
It's good to be a little despicable.

299
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,230
This kid is extraordinary.

300
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,260
He doesn't panic when he's held at gunpoint.

301
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,920
He's definitely not a bad guy.

302
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,550
Working in a place like the railway station

303
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,580
is indeed a good place to build up one's courage.

304
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,840
His courage was honed?

305
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,480
It doesn't seem like it.

306
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,330
I think his courage was drilled within him.

307
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,950
Wen, you're still up?

308
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,430
Here.

309
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,680
Wen, are you okay?

310
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,190
I'm fine.

311
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,900
Those guys were brutal,

312
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,560
but you really withstood it.

313
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,220
In the future if you have any more cases,

314
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,310
just let me know.

315
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,860
I'll give you a hand,

316
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,250
but you'll get the credit.

317
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,850
I just want some of your luck.

318
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,820
He's sleeping.

319
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,830
He fell asleep long ago.

320
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,760
He's tough and egoistic.

321
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,850
Afterall, he has been through real battles with live bullets.

322
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,240
Ding Peng.

323
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,650
Tell me the truth.

324
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,450
Are you really here at Secret Service just for the money?

325
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,900
Yes...

326
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,850
but also no.

327
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,320
These days, you're only as tough as your backers.

328
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,960
Everything else is useless.

329
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,310
Fine.

330
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,020
Go to bed early.

331
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,740
We don't know how they will torture us tomorrow.

332
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,320
Pan.

333
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,460
I really don't understand

334
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,570
why is Section Chief Guan so fierce.

335
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,490
He's the Deputy Commissioner.

336
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,650
So what?

337
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,800
She don't even know if she'll still be alive by then.

338
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,200
She was able to take off the cheongsam

339
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,540
from that almost dead girl

340
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
and put it on,

341
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,900
and then drew half a tube of her own blood to smear it on herself.

342
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,150
Just based on this point alone,

343
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,380
we are already not on par with her.

344
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,210
Not really.

345
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,620
Have you noticed the way

346
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,820
she looked at Song?

347
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,070
Yes.

348
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,700
It's not that we're not outstanding.

349
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,430
It's just that we have been

350
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,400
appearing in front of her for too long.

351
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
There's no novelty anymore.

352
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,550
At this time, as long as there are a few decent ones,

353
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,950
we'll both end up on the sidelines.

354
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,400
Look carefully.

355
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,670
In order to save our Section Chief,

356
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,360
Mr. Hu almost lost his fingers.

357
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,410
You're still eating?

358
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,350
You're still eating?

359
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,140
Still eating?

360
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,000
Unit Chief Pan.

361
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,070
We would want to protect

362
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,190
Section Chief Guan too.

363
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,620
But Mr. Hu didn't let us.

364
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,880
I am late because I went to the infirmary.

365
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,780
Don't be courteous with them.

366
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,390
In a place like this, it's the fist that matters.

367
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,350
If we suppress those old men,

368
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,510
they'll be the ones moving bricks now.

369
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,810
It's not right to make enemies on our first day here.

370
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,930
It's obvious that Mr. Hu doesn't like you.

371
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,790
I don't understand.

372
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,410
Everyone knows you're protected by Section Chief Guan.

373
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,670
Why would he humiliate you immediately?

374
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,890
Well, our Wen is truly

375
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,240
no ordinary person.

376
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,070
He embodies the idiom, "the man burning with indignation is bound to win."

377
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,870
Right, Wen?

378
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,630
I've figured it out.

379
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,970
We've joined the Secret Service.

380
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,970
In this field,

381
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,700
we should be prepared to suffer.

382
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,900
Madam?

383
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,280
Madam?

384
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,260
I asked you to put together an interrogation transcript,

385
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,630
and this is what you end up with?

386
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,430
Keep writing.

387
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
Can't you see?

388
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,660
-Madam.
-Can't you...

389
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,220
Shut up!

390
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,160
We found this

391
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,010
at Dr. Shi's house.

392

[Prescription]

393
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,630
He's a doctor.

394
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,930
Why is it strange that he has a prescription at home?

395
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,530
Yes.

396
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,900
I was just being careful,

397
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,030
so I asked a pharmacy.

398
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,970
These herbs, together with mutton soup as a guiding drug,

399
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,270
helps with replenishing blood and qi.

400
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,000
It's specially used for postpartum supplement.

401
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,070
What if this prescription is meant for others?

402
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,380
We found the pharmacy he bought the herbs from.

403
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,770
The staff said he remembered him.

404
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,160
He was buying it for himself.

405
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,100
I've only heard about

406
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,670
doctors writing prescriptions for their patients.

407
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,430
Who has heard of

408
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,630
doctors personally buying medicine for their patients?

409
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,590
Unless...

410
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,540
-Could it be...
-The patient is either his wife or his accomplice.

411
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,340

412
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,310

I am going to catch communists.

421
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,120
This pregnant woman

422
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,390
is most likely a communist,

423
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,590
or at the very least, a family member of a communist.

424
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,280
All pharmacies and maternity units must be strictly checked.

425
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,750
There's a shortage of medicine where the Counter-Japanese Army is at.

427

428
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,280
I'll check the pharmacies with my Operations Unit.

her husband isn't always around.

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,650
Secondly, she just gave birth.

490
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,100
Just based on these two points, it's enough.

How do you know she just gave birth?

No, it's just me.

He's an accountant.

-I'll check right away.

557
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,470
Don't cry.

558
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,850
Don't cry.

559
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,150
Why are you sweating so much?

560
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,850
Section Chief Guan.

561
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,340
[Nurses' Station]

562
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,480
Why are you here?

563
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,390
I just punished Tian Xiaojiang.

564
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,400
Go guard the door.

565
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,850
I'm here for him.

566
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,340
Madam,

567
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,990
you should really listen to his idea.

568
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,610
How come you're speaking on his behalf?

569
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,280
His trick might be a little cheap,

570
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,880
but what if it works?

571
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,760
I find

572
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,710
Tian Xiaojiang pretty smart.

573
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,870
Tell me.

574
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,670
Jiang said

575
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,270
to separate all the pregnant women from their children,

576
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,790
and let their families come to pick them up one by one.

577
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,990
If they can match up, they're free to go.

578
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,000
When a mother is separated from her child,

579
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,390
she'd of course be worried.

580
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,120
When the time comes, she won't care less anymore.

581
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,490
Thank you.

582
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,420
This pregnant woman

583
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,430
is most likely a communist.

584
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,360
Understand?

585
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,250
-Yes.
-Yes.

586
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,890
Move!

587
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,600
-Yes.
-Yes.
