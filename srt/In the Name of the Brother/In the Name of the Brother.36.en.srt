[Episode 36]

4
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,110
Come in.

5
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,240
May I borrow a light?

6
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,460
Japanese?

7
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,950
Yes.

8
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,320
You too?

9
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,010
I was born here. Sapporo's my hometown.

10
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,590
After the Russo-Japanese War,

11
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,790
I moved to Manchukuo.

12
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,170
I do business.

13
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,150
It's chaotic lately.

14
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Last month, a Japanese businessman

15
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,640
was robbed by bandits on a train

16
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,090
to Manchukuo.

17
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,780
He lost both his goods and life.

18
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,930
But that route's quite remote.

19
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,600
A route from Harbin to Hsinking

20
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,710
is safe.

21
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,110
If you don't mind,

22
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,310
let's drink together

23
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,630
at the dining car.

24
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
No thanks.

25
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,620
Okay.

26
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,150
Listen.

27
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,510
The gentlemen in that room don't wanna

28
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,510
be disturbed.

29
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,220
Ask the attendants not to come.

30
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,500
I'll ask them to come when they take meal orders.

31
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,269
No, they don't have to come then.

32
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,130
Are you not having lunch?

33
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,510
We'll take care of it.

34
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,650
Remember, let no one come over.

35
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,160
Okay.

36
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,870
Take action.

37
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,810
The market in the west of the city is far away,

38
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,150
but the stuff's cheap.

39
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,620
Based on my calculations,

40
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,900
subtracting the gas expense of the extra miles the car has to make,

41
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,140
we can save more than 200 yuan

42
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,740
for the cafeteria per month.

43
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,360
Ms. Guan.

44
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,150
Ms. Guan?

45
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,230
I'm listening.

46
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,710
Don't underestimate the 200 yuan.

47
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,540
Everyone can have

48
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,800
stewed beef once a week.

49
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,020
Besides,

50
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,150
our cafeteria's breakfast

51
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,830
is too plain.

52
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,630
Pan.

53
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,850
You came here this morning

54
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,550
to nag about such trivial stuff?

55
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,750
What's your point?

56
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,830
Ms. Guan.

57
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,830
Things are different.

58
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,590
The market prices are fluctuating

59
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,750
a lot.

60
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,980
The prices I noted

61
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,150
are already that of the yesteryear.

62
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,610
I'm thinking about

63
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,590
going to that market again to negotiate

64
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,630
long-term cooperations

65
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,490

-Go ahead.

66
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,260
Okay.

67

Come back early.

68
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,150
Yes.

69
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,870

72
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,290
What do you have?

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,530
Japanese food

74
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,030
and Chinese food.

75
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,290
What Japanese food do you have?

76
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,490
There's udon,

77
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,180
kabayaki, eel rice,

78
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
and beef rice.

79
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,580
I'll have udon. What about you?

80
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,830
I'll have eel rice.

81
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,990
And you?

82
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,730
Kabayaki.

83
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,110
Okay, please wait a moment.

84
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,170
Thank you.

85
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,760
Is it sweet?

86
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,390
Yes.

87
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,850
Can we order now?

88
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,490
Yes, but you need to pay more.

89
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,470
No problem.

90
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,470
What would you like?

91
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,390
One eel rice,

92
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,950
one seaweed udon,

93
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,299
and one kabayaki.

94
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,330
Okay.

95
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,309
That's enough for three.

96
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,110
I'm ordering, not eating.

97
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,860
Do they need to all come?

98
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,750
Amazing.

Why's Pan Yue looking for Asano?

101

Let him.

102
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,280
He went above and beyond

103
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,200
to beat around the bush.

104
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,510
It means they don't want others to know

105
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,060
they have a private relationship.

106
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,530
What I don't understand most now is this.

107
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,150
Asano has the Japanese Secret Police,

108
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,410

What does he need Pan Yue for?

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,030
I usually

112
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,230
don't let them smoke.

113
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,830
They must be hiding from me.

114

Thank you.

I haven't had eel rice in a while.

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,700
have it again.

124

The man I sent to watch Zhuowen yesterday

142
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,060
was suddenly arrested by them.

143
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,860
So I want to ask...

144
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,430
Why are you spying on Zhuowen?

145
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,580
You suspect

146
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,230
he's a communist?

00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,040
Yes.

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,850
Where's Zhuowen now?

149
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,950
He's still in the Secret Service.

150
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,310

151
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,270

Just wait outside.

156
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,450
Call them.

159
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,560
to the Japanese Secret Police.

160
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,630
The Japanese Secret Police said

161
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,500
they arrested two people

162
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,600
near Zhuowen's house.

163
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,470
Did you come here for this?

164
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,590
No.

165
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,760
Then for what?

166
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,130
You haven't answered my question.

167
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,670
Are you

169
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,490
Yes.

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,350
Zhuowen's sly and experienced.

171
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,320
He must know someone's watching him.

172
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,600
For now, we can't find out what clues were the basis

173
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,060
for the Japanese Secret Police's arrests.

174
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,150
But I think

175
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,210
it shouldn't be an independent case.

176
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,240
I see.

177
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,220
Mr. Pan.

178
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,690
Anyway,

179
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,310
what you brought today is good news.

00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,830
Yes.

182
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,970
Can you contact Mr. Togo right away?

183
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,680
Yes.

184
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,950
We can only send telegrams to the next station in advance

185
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,030
and send men to meet them

186
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,430
when the train gets in.

187
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,770

188
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,349

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,579
How long will it take?

191
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,430
20 minutes.

192
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,030
Send a telegram to Dehui Station.

193
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,470
Now!

194
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,990

take down both Zhuowen and Zhuowu...

308
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,580
to earn favor with the Japanese.

309
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,000
At this time,

310
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,510
if Song Zhuowen died for no reason,

311
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,750

315
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,510
A Belgian Browning. Why?

316
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,660
Is he familiar with guns?

How can we figure it out?

00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,170
No one

387
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,360
delivered food to room 7, right?

388
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,210
Yes.

389
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,550
Hold on.

390
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,590
Think carefully

391
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,920
if anyone's been there.

392
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,350
I wasn’t in the dining car that day.

393
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:24,990
Mr. Togo.

394
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Please take a look

395
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,060
if this was the train attendant.

396
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,140
Could it be the woman who ordered three meals?

397
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,900
Stay here.

398
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,640
Excuse me.

399
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,660
Open it.

400
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,650
The next door is...

401
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,600
The boiler room.

402
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,100
Do you have a screw knife?

403
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,080
Yes.

404
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:11,120
[Harbin Station]

405
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,480
What's this?

406
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,550
Mr. Togo was in a carriage

407
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,710
beside the train's boiler room.

408
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,750
These are the screws

409
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,280
on the bulkhead in between.

410
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,710
The train staff

411
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,680
said the bulkhead screws were changed

412
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,350
just four months ago.

413
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,970
So the anti-rust paint

414
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,700
on all bulkhead screws

415
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,070
should be undamaged.

416
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,190
How do you prove

417
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,430
the paint didn't peel off when you pulled them out?

418
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,340
If it were you,

419
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,300
would you take credit

420
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,650
with such a petty thing at this point?

421
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,470
Enough.

422
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,830
Mr. Pan is right.

423
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,270
Our intel's been leaked.

424
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,740
Then...

425
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,550
Mr. Asano.

426
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,450
What is the specific content of the leaked intel

427
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,160
this time?

428
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,610
Have our enemies

429
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,990
got what they want now...

430
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,660
Mr. Pan!

431
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,340
You're asking too much.

432
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,380
I get what you mean.

433
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,030
We should think about

434
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,710
what our enemies

435
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,200
will do next.

436
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,570
Yes.
