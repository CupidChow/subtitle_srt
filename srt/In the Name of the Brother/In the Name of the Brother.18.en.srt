[Episode 18]

4
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:40,950
Why are you still here?

5
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,670
Are you going to stay here?

6
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,509
That's my sister's car,

7
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,470
not Asano Diago's.

8
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,550
You're mistaken!

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,770
The one…

10
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,910
The one you want to blow up is Asano Diago,

11
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,110
not my sister, right?

12
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,580
Ask them to remove the bomb!

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,440
Shut up, or we'll both die here!

14
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,620
Guan Kai.

15
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,170
You have two options now.

16
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,310
First,

17
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,830
hand me over to the Japanese

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,110
and save your sister.

19
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,150
Second,

20
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,100
forget that you came here today.

21
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,790
Turn around and leave the hospital.

22
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,190
Where is Kai?

23
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,910
Xue, I'll ride with you.

24
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,320
Why have you come to the hospital?

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,920
I came to visit my classmate.

26
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,920
What's wrong?

27
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,700
I'm tired.

28
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,750
Get up.

29
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,560
Sit up straight.

30
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,650
Has something happened?

31
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,270
N-Nothing.

32
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,790
Move! Back off!

33
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,890
There's a bomb in the car.

34
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,680
Get out. Get your sister out of here!

35
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,470
-Move!
-Bomb?

36
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,190
Xue, let's go!

37
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,120
What's going on?

38
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,070
Let's go!

39
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,270
Keep running!

40
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,790
Excuse me.

41
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,260
Mr. Asano said

42
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,960
he wants to meet Ms. Guan and Mr. Song first.

43
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,310
Mr. Song.

44
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,270
Please.

45
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,870
Mr. Pan.

46
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Please wait over there for a moment.

47
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,870
A malfunction in the water supply system is normal.

48
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,910
Workers providing on-site service is also normal.

49
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,060
The maintenance worker climbing down

50
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,990
into the manhole in the parking lot

51
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
to repair the pipe is normal as well.

52
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,390
But that particular manhole

53
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
happened to be exactly

54
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,480
where Ms. Guan's car was parked.

55
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,770
That coincidence is abnormal.

56
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm not very clear

57
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,860
on the normal procedures for pipeline maintenance,

58
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,429
but I think that someone should be arranged

59
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,799
to guard the manhole that is being worked on

60
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,850
to prevent vehicles from parking on top of it.

61
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,670
But, there wasn't anyone there.

62
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,190
That's the only thing I found unusual.

63
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,550
After connecting all the coincidences from before,

64
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,980
anyone would realize

65
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,550
that these coincidences were all deliberate.

66
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,420
When I realized this and rushed out of the hospital,

67
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,630
that maintenance worker was nowhere to be found.

68
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,820
But honestly,

69
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,910
even if I had seen him,

70
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,740
I wouldn't have had time to catch him.

71
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,470
Because the clock was ticking,

72
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,570
and the bomb under Ms. Guan's car

73
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,090
could go off at any moment.

74
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,990
How did you know

75
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,830
what was under her car was a bomb?

76
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,470
Mr. Song.

77
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,500
I want to hear your answer.

78
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,580
The two explosions yesterday indicate that

79
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,800
our enemies are experts in making explosives.

80
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,130
Everyone thought

81
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,250
yesterday's second explosion

82
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,110
was part of their operation.

83
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,370
Actually, the third explosion today

84
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,910
is the end of their series of actions.

85
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,140
To look at it from their position,

86
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,580
if I were the enemy,

87
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,550
I'd also have chosen to make the first move

88
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,270
of the operation yesterday,

89
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,400
which was Saturday.

90
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,610
Because if the first two explosions succeed,

91
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,150
there will definitely be a lot of casualties.

92
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
The next day, Mr. Asano and Ms. Guan

93
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,130
will definitely go to the hospital to visit the victims.

94
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,110
The Army Hospital,

95
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,570
what kind of place is that?

96
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,940
In Harbin,

97
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,570
it's the first choice for all political figures when they're ill.

98
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,570
Every Sunday,

99
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,620
its parking lot is crowded

100
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,010
with visitors' cars.

101
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,780
They could easily use

102
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,240
the pipe repair as a cover

103
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,980
to occupy the area above the manhole.

104
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,720
By then,

105
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,110
they could easily decide which car to let in.

106
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,220
Actually, their ultimate target

107
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,590
was Ms. Guan.

108
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,810
Ms. Guan.

109
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,450
I remember you told me that

110
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,780
Song Zhuowen saved you eight years ago, right?

111
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,510
Yes.

112
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,650
He saved you again today.

113
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,350
It's rare.

114
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,920
What do you think about it?

115
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,090
I was too close to him

116
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,770
to see things clearly.

117
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,580
I think

118
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,540
Mr. Song

119
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,240
possesses all the qualities

120
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,730
required of a senior intelligence officer.

121
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,280
The only problem now is the constraints placed on him

122
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,540
by his current status.

123
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,790
He hesitates to argue with his superiors

124
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,500
about certain things.

125
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,510
This is

126
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,990
Song Zhuowen's problem.

127
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,010
It's also your problem, Ms. Guan.

128
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,310
Just now,

129
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,510
because you weren't sure about my stance,

130
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,290
you didn't dare

131
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,700
agree with Song Zhuowen's analysis.

132
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,990
Song Zhuowen

133
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,110
is totally qualified

134
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,730
to be the Deputy Chief of the Intelligence Unit.

135
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
What do you think?

136
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,950
Mr. Asano, given my current level of experience,

137
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,850
I'm not good enough…

138
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,110
When planning the Manchurian Incident,

139
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,890
Mr. Kanji Ishiwara was merely a lieutenant colonel,

140
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,520
but that

141
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,710
didn't prevent him from making contributions to his country.

142
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,550
Of course,

143
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,260
this is just my personal advice.

144
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,300
Ms. Guan

145
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,690
has the final say.

146
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,390
Yes.

147
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,950
Sorry.

148
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,950
Mr. Asano is tired.

149
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,850
He can't see you.

150
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,390
Please leave.

151
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,190
Mr. Pan.

152
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,790
Ms. Guan.

153
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,600
It's Mr. Asano who wants to give Song Zhuowen a promotion.

154
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,890
I'm surprised too.

155
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,410
Is Mr. Asano not satisfied with my work?

156
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,850
He didn't say that.

157
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,550
Zhuowen got promoted. I understand.

158
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,630
You deserve it.

159
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,280
Don't overthink it.

160
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,930
Those bombings were carefully designed.

161
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,910
Not just you,

162
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,550
no one saw it coming.

163
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,360
If I were you,

164
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,560
I'd hurry up

165
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,850
to find those fake maintenance workers.

166
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,750
Yes.

167
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,040
Then, I'll leave this case to you two.

168
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,350
Mr. Pan.

169
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm at your service.

170
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,850
Congratulations, madam.

171
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,900
One more player.

172
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,420
Okay.

173
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,180
From tomorrow on, you'll be the Chief of the Intelligence Unit.

174
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,380
It's all because of you that Mr. Asano thinks highly of me.

175
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,910
I'll call.

176
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,360
There's no one else here, so tell me the truth.

177
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,270
You almost lost your life.

178
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,790
It couldn't be just for a promotion, right?

179
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,890
Then what do you think I did it for?

180
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,230
I know. Everyone wants

181
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,720
to have status and be rich.

182
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,070
Be careful of Pan Yue.

183
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
The more Asano Diago appreciates you,

184
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,400
the more he hates you.

185
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,290
I know. He's narrow-minded.

186
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,610
I'm afraid he's also black-hearted.

187
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,780
Don't you know

188
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,980
why he plays dirty tricks?

189
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,510
If he and I were on the same page,

190
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,110
the position wouldn't matter.

191
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,570
I could just give it to him.

192
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,960
But we are not.

193
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,570
He wishes nothing more than to shoot me dead,

194
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,970
just because I'm in his way of making money.

195
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,340
You have a gun too.

196
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,270
You shouldn't call that bet.

197
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,589
If this happens again,

198
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,950
don't worry about anything

199
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,260
or think about anything.

200
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,140
Just run.

201
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,390
Forget your responsibilities.

202
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,420
Don't worry about disgrace

203
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,819
or other people's lives.

204
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,630
Okay?

205
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,960
If this happens again,

206
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,050
don't think about anything

207
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,450
or worry about anything.

208
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,070
Just run.

209
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,220
Don't look back.

210
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,870
Don't care about other people's lives.

211
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,910
Okay? Do you understand?

212
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,810
Do you understand?

213
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,230
Can you read my mind?

214
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,370
That's what I want to tell you.

215
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,870
Can you read my mind?

216
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,020
You're not afraid of anything now.

217
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,070
You have a gun.

218
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,050
But a gun may not be enough to protect you.

219
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,200
I even doubt

220
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,700
you're the Wen who saved me back then.

221
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,270
I suddenly thought of the child who swallowed the letter.

222
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,930
He was not much older than Kai.

223
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,470
Would someone really risk their own life

224
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,670
for people they don't even know?

225
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,230
The communists indeed do that.

226
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,540
So I've thought it through.

227
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,660
We can't beat them.

228
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,340
They all say you're a communist.

229
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,790
Are you?

230
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,260
Who said that?

231
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,960
No.

232
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,510
Because I'm afraid of death.

233
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,990
If you're really a communist

234
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,430
and you guys win in the end,

235
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,260
will you spare me?

236
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,430
I will.

237
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,990
Thank you for sparing me.

238
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,300
Give me a hug.

239
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,110
I'll spare you.

240
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,410
[Song Zhuowen, the Deputy Chief of the Intelligence Unit]

241
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,420
You took so many classes during training.

242
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,220
If you haven't learned anything, go back and take the courses again!

243
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,900
Who can tell me

244
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,010
what you were doing

245
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,090
when the second explosion happened?

246
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,790
It's all over now.

247
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,740
It's all over now, yet you start gossiping about it.

248
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,780
At that moment,

249
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,580
were you deaf, blind, or mute?

250
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,460
I curse you all!

251
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,310
Wu! Wu!

252
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,620
Stop! Stop! Stop!

253
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,250
Song, why are you beating me?

254
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,510
If it weren't for him,

255
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,230
you guys would've been blown up in the chemical plant!

256
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,910
Wu, don't you get it?

257
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,520
He's just good at sucking up to Ms. Guan!

258
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,280
Get lost!

259
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,160
You bastards!

260
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,000
How dare you speak ill of Ms. Guan behind her back?

261
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,120
Enough!

262
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,900
[Missing]

263
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,610
[My son, Chen Su, came to visit his family.]

264
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,040
[We]

265
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,420
[Need]

266
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,880
[Meet]

267
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,870
Zhuowen.

268
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,240
There are visitors inside.

269
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,840
Zhuowen is here.

270
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,660
Walk them out.

271
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,910
Who are they?

272
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,880
My friends who do business.

273
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,240
How's it going?

274
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,290
Guan Xue asked me directly

275
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,420
if I was a communist.

276
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,590
Why did she ask that?

277
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,670
I think she's been doubting me

278
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,510
for quite a while.

279
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,780
How did you reply?

280
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,020
I said, "Of course I am

281
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,490
because I'm not afraid of death."

282
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,150
Qian.

283
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,740
I think we should turn Guan Xue.

284
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,600
You're out of your mind.

285
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,230
No.

286
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,350
I've been around her for long enough

287
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,720
to tell which of her words

288
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,700
are true

289
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,690
and which aren't.

290
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,220
You don't need to tell that.

291
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,910
Zhuowen.

292
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,550
You can't trust a word Guan Xue says.

293
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,740
Why can't I give it a try?

294
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,380
Zhuowen.

295
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,210
When I agreed to let you join the Secret Service,

296
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,220
I made it clear to you

297
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,270
on behalf of the Party

298
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,870
that Guan Xue would forever be our enemy,

299
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,670
didn't I?

300
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,590
So,

301
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,700
don't try to change your enemy.

302
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,590
Understand?

303
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,150
Let me tell you why she's become like this.

304
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,420
In her eyes,

305
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,590
her world was shattered.

306
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,880
That's the source of all her sufferings.

307
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,540
She's filled with hatred,

308
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,670
not just towards the Kuomintang

309
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,000
or the Communist Party.

310
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,390
What she hates

311
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,630
is this new world

312
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,080
that's risen from the decaying remnants

313
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,810
of feudal imperial power and the banner system.

314
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,910
You want to change her?

315
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,210
Is that even possible?

316
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,540
We put our necks on the line

317
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,030
and are ready to sacrifice our lives at any time

318
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,270
because they

319
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,670
are our sworn enemies.

320
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,920
Sir, here we are.

321
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,090
What's wrong with you?

322
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,160
I should be the one asking you that.

323
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,910
Do I look so unwell?

324
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,590
This medicine

325
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,600
can't be found in Harbin now,

326
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,750
probably because more and more people

327
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,680
have trouble sleeping these days.

328
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,630
What do you mean?

329
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,370
Everyone in Harbin is doing business now?

330
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,450
I upped my dose.

331
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,750
I can get some sleep at night now,

332
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,080
but I end up feeling groggy during the day.

333
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,520
I brought you two bottles from Hsinking.

334
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,740
I'll mail you the rest after I get back.

335
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,390
But I've got to say this again:

336
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,410
Your issue is psychological.

337
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,670
These medicines

338
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,640
can only provide temporary relief.

339
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,770
They can't cure you.

340
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,900
Mr. Wu.

341
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,810
-You should…
-An hour from now,

342
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,630
a train will leave for Hsinking.

343
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,560
You have plenty of time today.

344
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,820
You can go home earlier to spend some time with your family.

345
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,590
Qiao Er.

346
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,930
It seems to make sense logically.

347
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,330
But it's a military map.

348
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,010
A low-ranking soldier was not supposed to have it.

349
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,800
Commissar Fang also said

350
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,860
there must be someone behind Qiao Er.

351
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,430
You didn't eat anything on your way here?

352
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,760
Did you have a good trip?

353
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,790
Good?

354
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,230
Not at all.

355
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,070
I almost died halfway.

356
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,230
Here.

357
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,710
How have you been lately?

358
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,410
Still fretting over Cui Anping.

359
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,840
There's this troublesome sentry commander called Yang.

360
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,910
If Pan Yue finds him

361
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,340
and he rats me out,

362
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,400
I'll be in a tight spot.

363
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,970
What should you do?

364
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,870
What can I do for you?

365
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,750
Just take care of yourself.

366
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,750
An hour ago,

367
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,600
Pan Yue went to see

368
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,510
the doctor from Hsinking.

369
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,710
We can be sure

370
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,150
that Pan Yue has been seeing that doctor

371
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,380
for a long time.

372
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,290
That's inconvenient.

373
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,360
Something's wrong.

374
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,600
Not long ago,

375
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,380
he tried to avoid the physical examination of the Japanese.

376
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,680
Does he have some illness he doesn't want others to know about?

377
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
He has tension headaches

378
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,210
and severe insomnia.

379
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,830
Because of his mistake,

380
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,540
the explosions this time

381
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,580
caused the Secret Service to lose a lot of its members.

382
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,310
Asano Diago is very displeased.

383
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,630
I was worried that

384
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,990
he'd go to that sentry commander immediately.

385
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,990
Now, it seems that

386
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,200
he's focused all his attention

387
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,630
on this case.

388
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,950
We have at least one more day.

389
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,920
Brother, let me ask you.

390
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,980
A while ago, you ran into Guan Kai

391
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,390
with a stranger on the street.

392
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,990
Was that man in his thirties,

393
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,010
thin, and with a high-bridged nose?

394
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,620
What's wrong?

395
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,150
I know it's hard to choose.

396
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,840
I'd feel the same if I were you.

397
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,190
You have to choose between your family

398
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,190
and the greater good of the country.

399
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,180
But you've taken an oath.

400
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,590
Have you forgotten that?

401
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,830
No.

402
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,590
I haven't.

403
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Judging from their ruthless style,

404
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,720
I'm inclined to think

405
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,470
they're from Chongqing.

406
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,710
The Bureau of Investigation and Statistics?

407
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,260
What are you worried about?

408
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,920
I'm not worried about myself.

409
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm worried about Guan Kai.

410
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,950
I'm worried that he may be in danger.

411
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,630
Kai is just a student.

412
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,210
How would he dare

413
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,240
tamper with the water pipe

414
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,350
and bring a bomb into the hospital?

415
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,190
There must be someone behind it.

416
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,320
So I'm worried that he may be in danger.

417
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:42,510
The Japanese, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, and the Secret Service

418
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,910
are all looking for him.

419
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,290
No matter who finds a flaw,

420
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,820
Kai will be dead.

421
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,700
[Tickets]

422
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,190
Ning?

423
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,610
You came to Harbin too.

424
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,110
I didn't come here.

425
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,510
I've never left.

426
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:51,950
By the way,

427
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,190
what does Pan Yue do?

428
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,850
You came all the way from Hsinking

429
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,750
just to see him?

430
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,080
He said he's a businessman.

431
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,310
But I don't think so.

432
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,350
I've already had someone look into him.

433
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:14,989
Why?

434
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,929
What do you think you can get from him?

435
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,949
Ning, just drop it.

436
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,889
I've been laying the trap for half a year.

437
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,429
We're co-workers after all.

438
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,550
You've gotta tell me something.

439
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,429
He's sick.

440
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,110
Very sick.

441
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,620
[Case Report]

442
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,130
Here's what happened.

443
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,150
Yesterday morning at nine o'clock,

444
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,150
the hospital discovered a leak

445
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,150
at the valve of the water pipe in this bathroom

446
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,950
and called

447
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,730
the water company's maintenance department.

448
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,160
Half an hour later,

449
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,370
the car coming for repair was hijacked midway.

450
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,030
The maintenance workers were tied up

451
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,590
and left in an open-air dump.

452
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,990
Some people used their IDs and uniforms

453
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,710
to get into the hospital.

454
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,950
There's a security checkpoint at the entrance.

455
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,520
Fake workers couldn't have brought the bomb in.

456
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,590
We think

457
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,830
it's the same person

458
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,460
who sabotaged the pipe and brought the bomb

459
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,630
into the hospital beforehand.

460
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,020
So if we can catch him,

461
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,140
this case will be half solved.

462
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,180
Here's the analysis report for the bomb.

463
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,230
The main component is trinitrophenol,

464
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,030
which smells like dried apricots.

465
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,230
This explosive is very destructive.

466
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,390
Mr. Pan.

467
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,350
Mr. Song.

468
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,150
Split your people into four groups

469
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,150
and start searching based on the clues

470
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,540
you just mentioned.

471
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,510
Look for the accomplice

472
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,380
or anyone related to the fake workers.

473
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,350
Don't come to me

474
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,790
until you find new clues.

475
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,540
Yes.

476
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,990
This is the leaking valve.

477
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,040
A doctor at the clinic found it.

478
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,080
He called the logistics department. I answered it.

479
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,500
After that,

480
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,390
I called the water company.

481
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,920
What time was that exactly?

482
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Around 9, I guess.

483
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,390
Are there many patients on this floor?

484
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,990
Yes.

485
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,500
They just had breakfast before nine,

486
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,070
so a lot of people would need to use the bathroom.

487
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,350
I don't believe that no one was around

488
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,880
when that saboteur came in.

489
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,170
If you were him, what would you have done?

490
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,750
If I were him, I would've hidden in the bathroom

491
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,480
and sabotaged the pipe

492
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,710
after everyone left.

493
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,510
Split up.

494
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,230
Ask everyone in the hospital

495
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,010
and find out

496
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,190
who came to this bathroom

497
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,420
at 9 o'clock yesterday.

498
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
-Yes.
-Yes.

499
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,590
The victims from our section are also on this floor.

500
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,290
Is this a coincidence?

501
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,250
Who brought the dried apricots here?

502
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,050
Ms. Guan's brother, Guan Kai.

503
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,390
Why did he come here?

504
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,810
I thought Ms. Guan asked him to come.

505
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,630
I also saw Guan Kai here yesterday.

506
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,000
Right in the corridor.

507
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,880
Before we could talk,

508
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,210
the incident happened.

509
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,080
This should be just a coincidence.

510
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,790
What an annoying coincidence.

511
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,400
Mr. Pan.

512
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,810
A patient in the hospital said

513
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,790
he saw someone in the bathroom.

514
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,390
Yesterday morning, around 8:30,

515
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,580
I spent a long time in the bathroom because of diarrhea.

516
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,200
I kept hearing the water running at the sink outside

517
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,040
and thought someone had forgotten to turn it off.

518
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,280
When I came out,

519
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,610
I saw a young man washing his hands there.

520
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,310
Washing hands shouldn't take a long time.

521
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,510
What did he look like?

522
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,950
I just took a glance in the mirror.

523
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,310
He appeared to be under twenty, fair-skinned,

524
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,850
with big eyes, a high nose bridge,

525
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,180
and a rather sharp chin.

526
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,360
What was he wearing?

527
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,990
I forgot what his pants were like,

528
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,950
but he seemed to be wearing a grey woolen suit jacket.

529
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,350
Mr. Pan.

530
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,430
We found another witness.

531
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,230
He's a doctor.

532
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,150
I went to the inpatient building to deliver a report yesterday.

533
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,900
On my way back,

534
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,980
around the corner of the building,

535
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,690
I saw a plumber

536
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,120
talking with a young man.

537
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,150
Did you hear what they were talking about?

538
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,790
No.

539
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,390
What did he look like?

540
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,660
I didn't see his face.

541
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,460
From the back,

542
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,860
he was wearing a gray woolen suit jacket

543
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,110
and black pants.

544
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,190
Kai was so careless.

545
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,750
So many people saw him.

546
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,710
No matter what,

547
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,810
he can't get away with it this time.

548
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,950
Why are you so quiet?

549
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,340
Have you found out about someone

550
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,890
or something related to me?

551
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,310
Tell me.

552
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,790
We've found the suspect.

553
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,510
He was in the bathroom before the pipe leaked

554
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,200
and was seen

555
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,910
talking to a fake maintenance worker.

556
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,070
Who's it?

557
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,150
Kai.
