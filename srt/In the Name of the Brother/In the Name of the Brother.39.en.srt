Mr. Ning.

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,110
Mr. Ning.

6
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,520
What can I do for you?

7
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,620
Actually, I've looked for you several times.

8
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,579
You look handsome.

9
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,390
There shouldn't be any unresolved

10
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,540
matters between us.

11
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,930
Go back.

12
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,050
I've transferred to another school.

13
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Guan Kai,

14
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,800
if there's nothing important,

15
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,540
we can talk about it next time.

16
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,430
Off you go.

17
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,310
I just want to say one more thing.

18
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,730
I don't want to hear it.

19
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,270
Have you seen a girl

20
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,430
around this height? Long hair,

21
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,270
big eyes. Where is she sitting?

22
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:52,010
I thought you wouldn't come.

23
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,370
Take care of yourself after you leave the city.

24
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,770
Don't come back to Harbin

25
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,590
or inquire about me.

26
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,940
I don't want to hear this.

27
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,090
I only want one reply from you.

28
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,870
Do you want me to stay with you

29
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,750
or leave you?

30
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,670
I want you to leave.

31
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,210
Why?

32
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,740
Because I can't promise you anything.

33
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,650
It's not that I don't want to.

34
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,290
It's just that I don't know

35
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,300
if I'll still be alive tomorrow.

36
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,830
But I believe you can go further.

37
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,560
Why can I go further?

38
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,160
Sometimes,

39
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,260
you just need a little faith

40
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,010
to walk a long way.

41
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,770
I don't want to listen to your preaching.

42
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,090
I know where to go.

43
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,970
One last thing,

44
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,670
I promise it's not preaching.

45
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,580
Go ahead.

46
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,670
Thank you.

47
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,040

Sir.

55
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,210
Go ahead.

56
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,620
The investigation found that

57
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,240
Dr. Kojima's death

58
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,730
was an accident.

59
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,400
An accident?

60
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,280
Yes.

61
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,420
Good.

62
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,400
It all happened because

63
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,070
Long Jixuan found out

64
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,740
his son was arrested and executed by the Epidemic

66
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,420
As a father,

67
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,610
he took revenge on Dr. Kojima

68
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,610
at the Sakura Hall.

69
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,490
Why was Kojima at the gathering?

70
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,130
I've never heard of any relations

71
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,710
between him and the University of Tokyo.

72
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,230
According to the Secret Service,

73
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
throughout the entire gathering,

74
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,810
he only talked to Mr. Okazaki.

75
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,550
Okazaki Hideo from the South Manchuria Railway Transportation Department?

76
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,030
Yes.

77
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,660
That means it's related to

78
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,040
the transportation mentioned in the Tonghua Defense Plan.

79
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,970
For personal reasons, Dr. Kojima

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,220

About Dr. Kojima,

85
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,840
I...

86
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,480
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,150
There's no time to regret or apologize.

88
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,160
He has done his duty.

89
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,460
How is the plan to retreat to Hsinking?

90
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,260

The Harbin government and Secret Service will be in charge.

92

What? Those Manchukuo citizens?

93
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,410
Yes.

94
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,270
The Manchukuo Ministry of Palace Affairs ordered it.

95
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,690
I see.

96
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,940
As the captain of Unit 731,

97
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,420
I must be the last to leave.

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,350
When I get on the train,

99
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,510
I want you to be with me.

100
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,790
Yes.

101
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,840
We did it.

102
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,250
Congratulations, Sir!

103
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
Ishii wants to escape

104

from Manchukuo quicker than anyone else.

105
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,550
It seems

106
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,730
Dr. Kojima was more loyal to the empire than he was.

107
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,400
You have to understand that

108
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,920
to the empire,

109
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,360
people with no worth

110
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,550
will be abandoned immediately.

111
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,540
The same goes for us.

112
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,790
So,

113
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,840
work hard.

114
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,230
Pan,

115
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,750
you ungrateful bastard!

116
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,420
Section Chief Guan treated you well, didn't she?

117
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,080
Was anyone in the section disrespectful to you?

118
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,820
The team is in a mess because of you

119
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,560
and you want to be the Section Chief?

120
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,600
You're crazy!

121
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,640
Crazy! Crazy!

122
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,150
You're crazy!

123
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,050
How dare you!

124
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,620
I was wrong!

125
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,330
No, no, no.

126
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,570
I admit defeat.

127
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,230
How dare they?

128
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,140
Trying to agitate me?

129
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,570
Don't underestimate me.

130
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,360
Come in.

131
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,930
Ms. Guan.

132
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,700
Well, what's with Pan?

133
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,920
Get ready.

134
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,250
Next week, you'll join me in

135
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,350
escorting members of the Water Department to Hsinking.

136
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,990
Hsinking?

137
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,570
Yes.

138
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,250
We won't be coming back after that.

139
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,680
We won't?

140
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,950
Where will we go, then?

141
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,530
Japan.

142
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,710
I've already talked to the Ministry of Palace Affairs.

143
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,890
Once I arrive,

144
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,510
they'll transfer you and me.

145
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,930
We'll find a chance to go to Japan.

146
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,180
Who else will go with us?

147
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,780
Just you.

148
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,200
And me.

149
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,790
Well...

150
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,500
Pan, Jin,

151
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,550
and the members of the Secret Service

152
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,480
who went through so much with us...

153
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,590
We're leaving all of them behind?

154
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,830
What does it have to do with us?

155
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,330
Are you coming with me?

156
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,550
I saw Song Zhuowen and his twin

157
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,460
at the Sakura Hall.

158
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,340
They really looked alike.

159
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,370
Except you, I think no one else could

160
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,060
tell them apart at a glance.

161
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,230
So?

162
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,510
Song Zhuowen and his twin

163
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,310
have nothing to do with you anymore either?

164
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,340
Hu Bin.

165
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,580
Everything begins with aspiration

166
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,110
and ends with results.

167
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,310
In other words,

168
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,330
only the result matters when the result is good.

169
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,470
When the result is not good,

170
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,160
we fall back on aspiration.

171
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,100
Your words are too complicated.

172
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,520
I don't understand.

173
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,990
Listen to me.

174
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,109
Come with me.

175
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,760
Go to Japan

176
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,490
and start over.

177
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,790
Guan Xue.

178
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,780
In Harbin,

179
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,980
when I followed you,

180
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,070
I felt confident and supported.

181
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,470
I felt like I was

182
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,570
a useful person.

183
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,030
But if we really go to Japan,

184
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,740
over at your place,

185
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,390
I'm afraid I'd be worth less than a dog.

186
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,620
Zhuowen.

187
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,640
When did you turn Qiao Liang

188
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,680
into your ally?

189
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,660
You always think that everyone

190
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,390
should be working for Ms. Guan.

191
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
What do you think?

192
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,650
