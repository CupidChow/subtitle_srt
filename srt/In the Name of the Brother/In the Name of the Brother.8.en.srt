00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,440
Section Chief Guan.

5
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,350
Where's Unit Chief Pan?

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,150
He's inside.

7
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,470
You may leave.

8
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:49,950
Yes.

9
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,530
Ms. Guan.

10
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,930
Where were you yesterday?

11
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,590
I couldn't find you anywhere.

12
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,870
Superintendent Zhang from the Inspector Department's house was robbed.

13
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,910
He asked me to investigate the scene.

14
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,440
It took me the entire night.

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,750
What does he take our Secret Service agents for?

16
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,190
The thing he lost is too valuable.

17
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,050
He didn't dare to call the police.

18
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,470
He's a greedy man.

19
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,680
Even if someone steals from him,

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,740
he's still the biggest thief around.

21
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,180
But we cannot refuse him.

22
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,620
Otherwise, the Inspector Department

23
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,420
may speak ill of us in the future.

24
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,400
From now on, you can leave any

25
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,070
communication with the Inspector Department

26
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,020
to me.

27
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,940
This is nothing.

28
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,200
Our priority is catching the Robin Hood.

29
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,340
Yes.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,680
I've heard about

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,870
what happened last night.

32
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,990
I asked the household registration officer on duty.

33
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,829
Last night,

34
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,650
Song Zhuowen did check the household register.

35
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,270
Pan,

36
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,320
you really don't trust anyone.

37
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,190
In our line of work,

38
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,550
that's the right thing to do.

39
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,290
He was there at 1 a.m. last night

40
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,850
and left half an hour later.

41
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,690
Hu Bin called me at three.

42
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,070
Is there any problem with this hour and a half?

43
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,590
It's not that simple.

44
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,510
I always feel that someone

45
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,170
is always one step ahead of us.

46
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,000
He's also very familiar with us

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,380
and is always accurate in his calculations.

48
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,070
I'm not suspecting Song Zhuowen.

49
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,680
We're just sorting through the facts.

50
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,140
According to the investigation,

51
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,870
Song Zhuowen went to arrest the assassin.

52
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,590
His statement was flawless.

53
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,550
But it's a one-sided statement from him.

54
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,730
There is no physical evidence

55
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,680
or any other supporting evidence.

56
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,320
This report is for Section Chief Asano.

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,710
There can't be any mistake inside.

58
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,970
I understand.

59
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,150
So I think,

60
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,830
for now,

61
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,909
it's pointless to look into the time of events.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,909
We can just find an excuse to cover it up.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,480
Let's look for evidence.

64
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,150
Ding Peng, you know how good

65
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,750
Song Zhuowen is at fighting.

66
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,470
If we assume

67
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,390
the opponent is not weaker than him,

68
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,030
how much damage will

69
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,660
30 to 40 minutes of brawling cause?

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,430
Close combat...

71
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,270
The assassin was armed.

72
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,950
The whole building will be implicated.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,790
Come here.

74
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,310
What is this?

75
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,550
Looks like an overturned clock.

76
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,540
It was broken.

77
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,500
I remember it.

78
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,490
Do you remember the time on the clock?

79
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,300
Two o'clock, I think.

80
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,630
Maybe a few minutes past two.

81
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,570
If you can confirm that

82
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,670
the clock stopped at two o'clock,

83
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,630
and he called you at three o'clock,

84
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,260
then there is indeed an hour unaccounted for.

85
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,350
Logically, Colonel Kozuka's family

86
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,350
has left Harbin for a long time.

87
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,390
The clock should have stopped long ago.

88
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,110
Well, let's check the

89
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,560
spring on the back of the clock.

90
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,990
If someone was still using it,

91
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,950
there should be no dust on the spring handle.

92
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,720
Otherwise...

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,800
There might be fingerprints on the handle.

94
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,380
I'll go to Huayuan Road right now.

95
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,900
Go.

96
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,800
Wait.

97
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,510
Check all the seals

98
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,930
for any traces of being moved.

99
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,970
The seals at the front and back doors are untouched.

100
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,480
Go over there.

101
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,430
It's indeed two o'clock.

102
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,590
Yes.

103
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,340
And there's dust on the handle.

104
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,030
I think no one touched it.

105
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,620
I was overthinking.

106
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,270
I would also like to know

107
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,210
where Song Zhuowen lives.

108
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,380
I don't mean anything else.

109
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,730
I just want to ask him again

110
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,910
if the Manchukuo's Robin Hood

111
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,440
had any noticeable traits.

112
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,810
Okay.

113
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,950
Boss.

114
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,360
You need to check out the basement.

115
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,790
Zhuowen.

116
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,750
Zhuowen?

117
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,170
Zhuowen.

118
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,320
Zhuowen.

119
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,440
Who are you looking for?

120
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,580
Hello.

121
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,410
I'm Zhuowen's colleague. My surname is Pan.

122
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,110
Is he home?

123
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,760
He went out last night.

124
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,050
I think he's still out.

125
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,970
What time did he go out last night?

126
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,110
It was quite late.

127
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,440
As for exactly when...

128
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,240
Don't rush. Take your time.

129
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,730
Mr. Pan, what happened?

130
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,500
You're home?

131
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,840
Sorry, I was sleeping soundly.

132
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,910
Aren't you going to invite me in?

133
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,860
Come in.

134
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,320
I'm still a little dazed.

135
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,110
Aunt Chang, you're so careless.

136
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,170
You don't even know when he came back.

137
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,450
Good for you.

138
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,750
You slept like this in the middle of the day.

139
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,080
How long have you slept?

140
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,470
About an hour at most.

141
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,280
It's time for lunch.

142
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,990
Is there any good restaurant nearby?

143
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,750
It's on me.

144
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,470
Mr. Pan.

145
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,750
If you just wanted to buy me a meal,

146
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,500
you could have simply called me.

147
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,700
You didn't have to come all the way here.

148
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,660
Besides,

149
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,960
why are you suddenly treating me to a meal?

150
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,510
Fine, I'll be honest with you.

151
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,230
Ms. Guan

152
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,280
asked me to make a report

153
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,870
of what happened last night.

154
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,860
But I am unsure about

155
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,230
some details of the event.

156
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,430
So I thought we could talk while eating.

157
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,070
No need to bother.

158
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,330
Ask me if you have any questions.

159
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,230
Your dumplings are all here.

160
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,100
Sorry.

161
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,250
I'll get someone to buy you a new pair.

162
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,570
It's fine, shoes are meant to be dirtied.

163
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,970
Sorry, I wasn't looking.

164
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,310
Please have a seat.

165
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,570
I'll go get your money.

166
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,790
What's the rush?

167
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,470
We've known each other for so many years.

168
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,430
Have you ever seen me handle money?

169
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,360
I understand. I'll send it to your house tonight.

170
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,550
My restaurant is small

171
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,150
and mainly sells dumplings.

172
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,360
How about I treat you to Qingfeng Restaurant?

173
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,420
Look at you. I'll leave after a word.

174
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,810
Why are you panicking?

175
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,440
I'll charge you triple the interest.

176
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,430
I'll forgo what you owe me last month.

177
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,440
You don't have to pay the interest this month either.

178
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,100
On the first day of next month,

179
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,280
I'll ask someone to get the deed

180
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,620
and take over your restaurant.

181
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,280
Master San.

182
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,440
We grew up together.

183
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,620
Please have mercy

184
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,020
on me and my family.

185
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,460
I didn't owe you last month.

186
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,590
I'll pay you tonight for this month's portion.

187
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,050
I've been paying the interest for two years.

188
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,310
If you take my house and business too,

189
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,170
I won't be able to live.

190
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,890
No one raised the interest.

191
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,720
The extra money is for my shoes.

192
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,780
Aren't you extorting me?

193
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,020
So what if I am?

194
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,830
Since the day your daughter fell sick

195
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,020
and you signed the borrowing slip,

196
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,790
this restaurant has belonged to me.

197
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,160
Master San,

198
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,570
please have mercy.

199
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,370
This restaurant is closed from now on.

200
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,520
Whether you're done eating or not, get out.

201
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,950
Do you hear me?

202
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,490
Didn't you hear me?

203
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,890
Is this your daughter?

204
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,070
We'll leave now.

205
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,000
So cute!

206
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,350
You are really cute!

207
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,570
Get lost!

208
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,920
Eat.

209
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,510
Go on.

210
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,230
Eat.

211
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,630
Get lost!

212
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,150
Are you deaf

213
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,550
or a fool?

214
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,790
I told you to leave.

215
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,020
Do you hear me?

216
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,869
How dare you glare at me? Get out.

217
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,710
I'll kill your whole family when I get back.

218
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,310
Move!

219
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,380
Move!

220
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,710
Out of the way!

221
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,350
Move!

222
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,440
[Police ID]

223
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,950
Murder!

224
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,070
Murder!

225
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,390
Murder!

226
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,050
There was no movement at first.

227
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,160
I searched the rooms one by one.

228
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,030
Then,

229
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,170
in the second room,

230
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,350
I saw some

231
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,790
half-finished wine and meat on the table.

232
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,250
-Slow down.
-Back then...

233
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,950
Section Chief Guan.

234
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,550
Ms. Guan.

235
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,870
Where is your ID?

236
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,270
ID?

237
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,000
The Public Security Section called.

238
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,630
A murder happened in Nanshi Street just now.

239
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,960
They found a Secret Service ID

240
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
from the Police Agency at the scene.

241
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:51,980
It was yours.

242
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,390
I think I might have lost it at Paramount.

243
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,550
Mr. Pan, I left with that lady after that.

244
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,750
You remember, right?

245
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,020
Yes,

246
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,390
I was drunk that day.

247
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,630
No one was around.

248
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,940
It was just the two of us.

249
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,350
We were clinging to each other, hugging and all that.

250
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,450
I'm a man, I couldn't help it.

251
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,400
As for the details...

252
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
I don't quite remember them.

253
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,750
Zhuowen.

254
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,860
If I were you,

255
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,230
I wouldn't mention the details in front of Ms. Guan.

256
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,430
Don't interrupt him. Go on.

257
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,310
I promise you one thing.

258
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,910
There's nothing between me and that woman.

259
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,330
You can promise that.

260
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,050
But can she promise that?

261
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,340
She...

262
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,910
What could she have?

263
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,560
A screw loose in her head.

264
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,630
Why are you so happy?

265
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,020
I'm talking about you.

266
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,510
There's another possibility.

267
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,960
I could have lost it at Colonel Kozuka's villa

268
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,540
when I was fighting with Manchukuo's Robin Hood.

269
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,470
It's hard to say.

270
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,110
No matter what,

271
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,230
this is a problem.

272
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,580
As long as the victim is alive,

273
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,710
we might know something from him.

274
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,720
Ms. Guan, what might that something be?

275
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,710
According to my instinct,

276
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,390
I think the one who stabbed him

277
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,490
was Manchukuo's Robin Hood.

278
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,710
Where is Zheng San?

279
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,840
He's in the car.

280
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,260
Can he still speak?

281
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,750
The stab injured his spleen.

282
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,150
The doctor said he probably can't survive.

283
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,990
Sorry. He's gone.

284
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,210
There are so many people here.

285
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,390
Except for that dead man,

286
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,280
has no one else seen the murderer?

287
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,750
There must be other witnesses.

288
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,350
But he was wearing a thick hat

289
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,300
with his face covered by a scarf.

290
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,560
No one saw him clearly.

291
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,300
Have you asked everyone at the scene?

292
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,830
To be honest, Ms. Guan,

293
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,100
on Nanshi Street,

294
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,150
no one dares breathe a word

295
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,820
about things related to Zheng San.

296
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,190
Wen.

297
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,220
I'm going to my teacher's place to get some books.

298
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,070
Zhuowen, don't stand back there.

299
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,730
You're the only person who has met the murderer.

300
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,620
Come here. Listen to what the manager has to say.

301
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,170
He was wearing an old fedora

302
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,220
and a gray scarf,

303
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,480
sitting by that table.

304
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,930
Give me some facial features.

305
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,660
The more detailed, the better.

306
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,080
Thick brows.

307
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,390
His eyes were not big, but very bright.

308
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,140
That's all I remember.

309
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,910
Okay.

310
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,000
Unit Chief Pan.

311
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,940
Keep investigating.

312
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,420
Yes.

313
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,690
How about his complexion?

314
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,750
Did he have a lighter or darker complexion than yours?

315
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,380
Almost the same as mine.

316
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,520
How about this?

317
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,210
Look at everyone in this room.

318
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,310
Who looks the most like him?

319
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,780
No one does.

320
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,270
Zhuowen, have you been here before?

321
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,740
Why would I come here?

322
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,110
I thought

323
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,110
you ate dumplings here and didn't pay for them.

324
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,860
Just now, he took a few peeps at you.

325
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,230
What on earth happened?

326
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,430
Maybe I lost it

327
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,400
when I fought with Robin Hood.

328
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,000
Is Robin Hood a good fighter?

329
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:00,790
Yes.

330
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,830
Maybe he didn't want to waste his time on me.

331
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,230
When you fought with him,

332
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,800
did you go all out?

333
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,730
Of course. You need to ask?

334
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,030
The room was dark.

335
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,080
You couldn't even see each other's faces.

336
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,470
One was fighting with his life,

337
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,670
and the other was desperately trying to escape.

338
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,130
Even if your ID had fallen out of your pocket,

339
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,030
I doubt he could've noticed it.

340
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,170
Even if he had noticed it,

341
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,900
how could he possibly have been able to pick it up?

342
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,500
Besides, you used to be a policeman.

343
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,360
How is it possible that you didn't know your ID was lost a long time ago?

344
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,460
Tell me the truth,

345
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,670
or shoot me with this gun.

346
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,280
My car is right downstairs.

347
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,950
You can run away after shooting me.

348
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,790
You saved my life.

349
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,850
If you're lying to me,

350
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
I'm afraid you'll be the death of me.

351
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,950
Shoot me, then.

352
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,470
I'm not afraid of being killed by you.

353
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,120
We could've died

354
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,750
eight years ago.

355
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,230
I'm fine with being killed by you.

356
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,670
I never expected to see you again.

357
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,230
Aren't you afraid of death?

358
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,870
Yes.

359
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,000
So I don't want to live a life

360
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,530
that's full of fighting and killing anymore.

361
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,390
It's so embarrassing that I don't want to tell you.

362
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,120
With a knife held to the throat,

363
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,180
anyone will flinch.

364
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
I begged him to spare me at that time.

365
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,380
I begged him on my knees.

366
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,390
He knew he couldn't get out of Harbin.

367
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,510
His condition was that I give him my ID

368
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,260
so that he could leave the city.

369
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,630
Guan Xue.

370
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,150
I didn't mean to lie to you.

371
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,350
Shoot me.

372
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,630
Whether you two have slept

373
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,050
could affect your brother's life.

374
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,510
Zhuowen.

375
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,760
Being afraid of death is not shameful.

376
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,590
But remember,

377
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,150
if you don't want to die,

378
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,960
you should make your enemy die.

379
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,350
This is over.

380
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,000
Go to my place today.

381
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,260
I'll get you something to eat.

382
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,270
What a tough day.

383
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,610
Can you not make fried pork again?

384
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,580
Anything else will do.

385
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,810
I earned some money on the railway

386
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,750
and ate fried pork every day. I can't stand it now.

387
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,910
I was too shy to tell you last time.

388
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,710
I feel nauseous at the mention of that dish now.

389
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,230
What's wrong?

390
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,360
Why are you so upset?

391
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,660
Is it because Song Zhuowen went to Paramount

392
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,940
or because he lost his ID?

393
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,670
Because I'm too protective.

394
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,390
So you're angry at yourself.

395
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,420
You…

396
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,590
Look. My eyelid is twitching, isn't it?

397
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,120
Isn't it?

398
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,560
Yes.

399
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,260
It is?

400
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,030
It's twitching.

401
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,190
Enough. Don't talk to me.

402
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,750
Go out.

403
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,430
Go out.

404
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,280
Okay. I'll leave you to think about it.

405
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,830
Be gentle. Be gentle.

406
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,050
I won't run.

407
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,590
You're hurting me.

408
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,270
Don't struggle. That'll only make it hurt worse.

409
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,830
Gosh.

410
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,630
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

411
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,550
Let me repeat it.

412
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,670
Shut up.

413
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,200
You should be too ashamed to say anything!

414
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,550
That guy saw my face.

415
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,590
He wouldn't if you hadn't looked up.

416
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,030
You should've just eaten the dumplings.

417
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,110
Why did you look up?

418
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,780
No. He hit me first.

419
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,940
He hit my head like you did.

420
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,330
You can do it, but how could I let him get away with it?

421
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,670
You know who he's not to be messed with.

422
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,190
You should've just dropped the chopsticks and taken off.

423
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,190
I did.

424
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,920
But he followed me out with a knife and tried to stab me.

425
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,350
There were so many people on the street.

426
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,470
Why did he stab you instead of anyone else?

427
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,000
Can't you understand what I'm talking about?

428
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,750
It doesn't matter whether I understand you or not.

429
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,880
From today onwards,

430
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,890
you'll stay here.

431
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,090
I'll keep you fed

432
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,130
and keep you warm

433
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,390
until I arrange for you to leave Harbin.

434
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,720
There's one more thing.

435
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,610
I don't want to hear it.

436
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
Then I won't tell you.

437
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,740
Suit yourself!

438
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,530
I ran into Guan Kai later.

439
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,290
He recognized you?

440
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,910
Release me first.

441
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,990
Tell me first.

442
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,370
Release me. Then I'll tell you.

443
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,580
Hurry. My back itches.

444
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,610
I was with Guan Xue the whole time.

445
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,030
If Guan Kai tells his sister he met Zhuowu,

446
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,630
things will be complicated.

447
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,230
Was Guan Kai alone?

448
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,180
Zhuowu said

449
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,840
he was with a middle-aged man.

450
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,500
That man didn't have distinguishing features.

451
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,050
We need to find a way

452
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,150
to make Guan Kai keep it a secret

453
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,210
that he met Zhuowu.

454
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,230
It's too hard.

455
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,679
He's just a student.

456
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,920
It's not the weekend.

457
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,219
Didn't he have classes during the day?

458
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,550
Why was he on the street?

459
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,330
That's not hard to find out, is it?

460
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,380
I'll look into it.

461
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,560
I hope it's not too late.

462
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,949
What else did Zhuowu say?

463
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,030
Stop.

464
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,050
Don't go to dirty places like that again.

465
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,429
What are you talking about?

466
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,910
You kept asking me if I'd slept with Guan Xue,

467
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,440
yet you didn't pay the girl who slept with you.

468
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,720
Who did I sleep with?

469
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,640
Think about it.

470
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,510
The dirty place run by the Japanese.

471
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,540
The girl told me everything.

472
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,960
What did she tell you?

473
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,620
Ms. Guan, I have something to report to you.

474
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,520
The owner of the restaurant

475
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,320
kept looking at Zhuowu today.

476
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,930
And Zhuowen's ID was found there.

477
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,230
But it may be just a coincidence.

478
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,700
I tend to read into things.

479
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,390
It's good to read into things.

480
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,100
But it's not good to overthink things.

481
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,400
After all, you know Zhuowen better than I do.

482
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,930
You've been through thick and thin together.

483
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,810
No matter what I went through with him,

484
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,810
he's not worth risking my position.

485
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,870
Understand?

486
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,820
Please enlighten me, Ms. Guan.

487
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,500
What should I do next?

488
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,390
Our top priority

489
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,100
is to catch Robin Hood.

490
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:26,790
Okay.

491
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,320
Let's do it the traditional way.

492
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,590
Find a needle in a haystack.

493
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,760
Make him a wanted assassin.

494
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,510
Increase the reward for reporting him.

495
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,660
I trust Song Zhuowen.

496
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,360
You can make a big deal out of it.

497
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,750
Let all your classmates know about it.

498
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,010
We can take our time and talk about it tonight.

499
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,540
Let's go.

500
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,270
They'll believe

501
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,950
whatever you say.

502
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,810
Do you know why?

503
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,510
Why?

504
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,390
Because you have the spirit.

505
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,630
Not only them.

506
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,750
You have to tell them everything.

507
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,630
Tell all your classmates

508
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,030
and everyone in the room

509
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,130
that you guys care about this country.

510
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,930
Are you waiting for me?

511
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,800
Wen.

512
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,510
Why did you skip classes this afternoon?

513
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,970
I didn't have any classes.

514
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,350
You did.

515
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,110
You had classes in material mechanics all day.

516
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,310
I called your school.

517
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Also, who was the guy wearing a fedora?

518
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,450
Material mechanics is an elective course.

519
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,110
I have the freedom to decide what classes I take.

520
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,750
Fine.

521
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,780
If you don't want to tell me the truth,

522
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,180
just forget that I asked.

523
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,480
He's an acquaintance.

524
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,700
A scalper outside Loulan Theater.

525
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,480
It's hard to buy drama tickets nowadays.

526
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,880
I can only go to scalpers.

527
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,170
How much more did he charge for one ticket?

528
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,110
Two yuan.

529
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,870
I know Loulan Theater very well.

530
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,000
It's right across the train station.

531
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,670
There are no scalpers outside it.

532
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,330
Thieves beat all of them away.

533
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,100
Why did thieves beat scalpers?

534
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,060
Only when the audience queues up at the window to buy tickets

535
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,330
can the thieves have the chance to pickpocket them.

536
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,710
If they all go to scalpers for tickets,

537
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,710
who are the thieves going to target?

538
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,150
Behind the theater, in Cuihua Alley,

539
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,990
that's where you can find scalpers.

540
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,630
For each ticket, they mark up the price by at least six yuan.

541
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,730
Two yuan goes to a fat man called Sun at the theater who issues tickets,

542
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,800
two to the patrol officer in charge of the area,

543
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,610
and one and a half to the head scalper,

544
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,810
leaving just five jiao for themselves.

545
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,210
Two yuan is not enough.

546
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,590
You don't need to pick me up tomorrow morning.

547
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,070
Okay.
