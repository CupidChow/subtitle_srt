[theme music playing]

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

3
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,524
[pleasant music playing]

4
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,456
[chuckles softly]

5
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,001
Why are you staring at me like that?

6
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,044
It just…

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,130
This feels just like a dream.

8
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,549
I can't believe it.

9
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,385
[taps forehead]

10
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,304
-Ouch.
-It's not a dream, is it?

11
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,557
You're right. It's real.

12
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,228
And we're together too.

13
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,688
It's strange.

14
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,732
[chuckles softly]

15
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,026
To be here like this together.

16
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,612
What's strange about it?

17
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,283
It's like a ticklish feeling.

18
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,245
I'm not sure exactly where,

19
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,998
but somewhere deep in my heart,

20
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,418
it feels like bubbles popping.

21
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,628
Me too.

22
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,591
Doesn't it tingle like there's electricity
moving through our bodies?

23
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,176
[Seok-ryu] Right. No, it's like this.

24
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,514
You know when you're about to get a shot
and they're looking for a vein,

25
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,058
so they tell you to clench
and unclench your fist?

26
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,102
It's that feeling.

27
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,354
It's love.

28
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,398
What?

29
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,024
That's love.

30
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,903
Come on. It's too early to say it's love.

31
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,489
It's taken 30 years,
but it's still early?

32
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,366
That is true.

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,162
But something about the word "love"
makes me cringe.

34
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,663
It's a bit embarrassing too.

35
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,331
[pleasant music continues playing]

36
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,499
I love you.

37
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,256
As my family, my friend, and my woman.

38
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,593
The kind of love
might have been different at times…

39
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,683
but there was never a time
when I didn't love you.

40
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,024
[door opens]

41
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,151
-[Mi-suk] We had a great time.
-Mom?

42
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,069
-Bye!
-Aunt Mi-suk?

43
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,905
[Geun-sik] I don't remember
how we got back.

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,825
We all went on a trip, but I don't have
a single picture to show for it.

45
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,077
It's because the camera doesn't lie.

46
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,080
That's how you look.
Take it up with your mother then. [laughs]

47
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,918
Gyeong-jong turned Hye-suk
into a supermodel.

48
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,294
He made her legs look so long.

49
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,004
But Hye-suk's…

50
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,006
It was the same when we ate crabs too.

51
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,759
Gyeong-jong picked the meat
out of each leg for her

52
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,719
and fed it to her.

53
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,638
And you?
You were busy eating for yourself.

54
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,389
That's because he's a doctor.

55
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,392
He's an expert at dissection.

56
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,228
-So he picked them clean.
-Did you forget?

57
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,938
You're a cook.

58
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,231
[crow cawing]

59
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,735
I wanted to go for a walk at night,
but you got drunk and passed out.

60
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,320
Why do you snore so much?

61
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,863
I don't snore on purpose.

62
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,950
[Seok-ryu] You're home so early.

63
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,787
[Seung-hyo] Hey, Aunt Mi-suk.
Did you have fun on the trip?

64
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,832
[dramatic music playing]

65
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:15,838
Jeez.

66
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,593
Aren't you two too old to be reading
comic books first thing in the morning?

67
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,636
[Geun-sik] Seung-hyo.

68
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,846
You like romance comics?

69
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,139
[dramatic music playing]

70
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,226
You're such a romantic.

71
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,978
-[laughing]
-[chuckles nervously]

72
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,146
Yes, a little bit.

73
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,648
Right. [chuckles]

74
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,108
-[Mi-suk] Hey, Seung-hyo.
-Yeah?

75
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,528
You missed a button on your shirt.

76
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,238
[dramatic music playing]

77
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,291
Seriously? Are you a kid?
You can't even button your shirt right.

78
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,084
-[Geun-sik] Come here.
-You're right.

79
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,670
-Why are you so clumsy?
-Gosh, how did this happen?

80
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,130
What a dumb mistake.

81
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,465
Mom! He asked if you had fun on your trip.

82
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,092
Ask your father.

83
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,844
What? Did you do something wrong?

84
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,723
-[Geun-sik] No, she wants to pick a fight.
-[Seok-ryu] Dad, just leave him.

85
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,142
-[Mi-suk] The soup's untouched. Seung-hyo!
-Yeah?

86
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,685
Go home and get your parents.

87
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,894
-We'll eat this.
-Okay.

88
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,521
Hey, go! Hurry.

89
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,398
-Yeah, do the rest.
-[Seung-hyo] Okay.

90
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,735
[Geun-sik] Princess Volume 20 is out!

91
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,740
We had no food at home,
so we were about to order out.

92
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,450
-Thanks for the meal.
-[Mi-suk] Sure.

93
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,870
We feel so bad.
You didn't even get a chance to rest yet.

94
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,747
-Gosh.
-[Mi-suk] It's fine with me.

95
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,583
But I don't know
about my hungover husband.

96
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,711
They say you shouldn't even
disturb dogs when they eat.

97
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,048
By the way, gomtang
is pretty good for hangovers.

98
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,591
[Hye-suk] Yeah, it's great.

99
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,134
How was the trip?

100
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,970
It was nice. It really lifted our spirits.

101
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
-Right, honey?
-Yeah.

102
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,141
You two should come with us next time.

103
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,642
Us two?

104
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,103
Goodness, we can't take just these two.

105
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,397
We need to make it
more lively and fruitful first.

106
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,523
What?

107
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,651
She means we should get the kids married
and all take a trip together.

108
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,653
Married?

109
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,654
-[Mi-suk] Yeah.
-What?

110
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,699
Hye-suk and I agreed
to find spouses for them.

111
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,784
[all chuckling]

112
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,245
[Geun-sik] That's so silly.
Did you sign a blood oath or something?

113
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,041
Honey, find someone suitable
at the hospital too.

114
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,667
-Right!
-Okay.

115
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,544
-[Hye-suk] Okay?
-I bet there aren't any.

116
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,465
I doubt there's anyone
who'd marry Seok-ryu.

117
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,885
Hey, Seung-hyo! You can't say that.

118
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,678
[Mi-suk] You ungrateful little brat.

119
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,473
-Why are you criticizing my daughter?
-[Geun-sik] Yeah.

120
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,810
I didn't think you were like that.
I'm upset.

121
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
-That's not what I meant.
-It's okay.

122
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,523
There's no woman who can put up
with his personality either.

123
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,233
[Geun-sik] Why would you say…

124
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,652
Seok-ryu, what's wrong
with Seung-hyo's personality?

125
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,072
[Gyeong-jong] Yeah, he's neat and polite.
He's nice since he takes after me.

126
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,199
I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.

127
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,744
This is how we usually get along.
We make fun of each other.

128
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,412
[Seung-hyo] Yes.

129
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,208
We're always teasing
and dissing each other like this.

130
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,584
I see. [chuckles softly]

131
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,628
So that's what it was?

132
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,796
Hey. That's right.

133
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,340
We'll end up feuding
if we fight over our kids. Let's eat.

134
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,716
[Gyeong-jong] Okay.

135
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,426
Thank you for the meal.

136
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,388
[Hye-suk] Gosh, I was so flustered.

137
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,765
[Seung-hyo breathing heavily]

138
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,353
[Seok-ryu] Wow.

139
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,148
-[sighs]
-I thought I'd suffocate to death.

140
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,195
[exclaims] I was so nervous
I could barely eat.

141
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,741
Well, we got through it,
so let's try harder from now on.

142
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,203
Hey, let's just be honest instead
and tell them we're dating.

143
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,413
No.

144
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,748
Things aren't good right now.

145
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,127
My engagement was called off.

146
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,839
And it hasn't been long
since Hyeon-jun came by.

147
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,718
It'll seem
like I don't take things seriously.

148
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,052
Ooh. [chuckles softly]

149
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,764
So I guess you have
pretty serious feelings for me?

150
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,641
Jeez, how can you joke right now?

151
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,810
Look, you don't have to worry about that.

152
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,271
I can explain everything really well.

153
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,152
No, it's not just that.

154
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,782
[exhales] It's going to get
really uncomfortable and annoying.

155
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,953
I mean, if my parents
find out we're dating,

156
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,039
then you can't come
in my room like this.

157
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,124
-What?
-[Seok-ryu] Think about it.

158
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,877
They'll ask what, when,
where, why, and how.

159
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,546
They'll watch our every move.

160
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,298
[amusing music playing]

161
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,716
They'll impose curfews again.

162
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,968
They'll be scanning
the neighborhood 24 hours a day.

163
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,304
If that happens,

164
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,974
we'll have to have a very wholesome,
innocent, and nice relationship

165
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,392
like little kids.

166
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,812
Let's keep it a secret.
Yeah, let's be strict about it.

167
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,272
We must never get caught.

168
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,608
That's what I'm saying.

169
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,109
[both chuckle]

170
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,492
[pop song playing]

171
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,620
Did you do well?

172
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,372
Hey, what are you doing?

173
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,415
Hey, we're in the middle of the street!

174
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,377
-Did you do well?
-Totally.

175
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,094
You're pretty from this side too.

176
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,430
[chuckles]

177
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,773
[faint laughter]

178
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,201
-Okay!
-Okay!

179
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,536
[chuckles]

180
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,662
[Seok-ryu exclaims]

181
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,873
You can do it!

182
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,127
[exclaiming]

183
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,714
[laughing]

184
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,968
[screams]

185
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,767
[chuckles]

186
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,479
-Let's check out the first floor.
-[Seung-hyo] Let's go!

187
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,566
-There's a claw machine too.
-[Seok-ryu] I love it! Let's try them all.

188
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,321
LOVE

189
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,161
[sighs]

190
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,871
What do I do with all of these?

191
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,457
Should I open group buying again?

192
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,086
No, I haven't promoted enough.

193
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,047
Short-form videos are the trend,

194
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,090
so I'll post one of me
taking it and working out.

195
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,514
[exhales]

196
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,018
[Mi-suk] Dong-jin, come eat some melon!

197
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,729
Jeez, Mom.
Melon's not important right now.

198
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,273
-I don't want any!
-Then don't, you punk!

199
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,733
I'll eat it all.

200
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,235
Is that punk going to drink
only protein forever?

201
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,904
-[phone vibrating]
-[laughing]

202
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,572
[indistinct conversation on TV]

203
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,075
That brat.

204
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,328
She didn't post any pictures
of the scenery. They're all of herself.

205
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,414
[In-suk] Gosh, Hye-suk!
Your pictures came out great.

206
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:10,044
Wow, look at that figure!
You're like a model. [chuckles softly]

207
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,213
[Jae-suk] Yeah,
change your profile picture.

208
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,464
It's your best photo ever.

209
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,967
[Hye-suk] You think so?
I didn't think they did me any justice.

210
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,552
They look better than you in person.

211
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,138
[chuckling]

212
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,431
[Mi-suk] Jeez.

213
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,726
We both went on the trip,
but I don't have a single picture to post.

214
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,522
Are you still going on
about pictures? Good grief.

215
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,566
I'd have to take 100 pictures
to even get one that's decent.

216
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,653
You didn't care if my eyes were open
or if my hair was covering my face.

217
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,654
You didn't even look.

218
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,573
I'm sorry, Mi-suk.
I was wrong, so let's stop.

219
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,325
I think my ears are bleeding.

220
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,702
-Look at this. Look at that composition.
-[sighs]

221
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,871
He took it from below,
so she looks like a model.

222
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,997
I'm going crazy.

223
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,917
Hey, you punk!
Come and eat some damn melon!

224
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,420
-Just like this.
-[Geun-sik] What are you doing?

225
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,346
Are you in a staring contest
with broccoli?

226
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,305
[Seok-ryu] Yeah.

227
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,976
Beans, spinach, and eggplants.

228
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,937
I'm in a war of nerves
with food I hate the most.

229
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,023
If you hate them so much,
why did you buy them?

230
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:17,319
My mom says they're good for your health
and keeps trying to make me eat these.

231
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,322
So you're going to buy and get rid of
all the vegetables in the world?

232
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm developing recipes to try
and make them taste good.

233
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,664
You know when athletes
come up with their own moves

234
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,499
and the moves are named after them?

235
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,754
Yeah, like Kim Yuna's Yuna Spin
and Yeo Hong-chul's Yeo 1 and Yeo 2.

236
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,049
Yeah, so I'm thinking of making
my own signature dish.

237
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,343
So what do you plan on making?

238
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,554
Broccoli and chicken risotto!

239
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:48,017
Yikes. Just hearing it
sounds like the worst combination.

240
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,935
A little bit, right?

241
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,068
Hey, this kitchen is a sacred area.
What are you doing?

242
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,488
Should I stop?

243
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,449
No, keep going.

244
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,536
[Myeong-u] Why is the light on here?
Is someone in there?

245
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,829
[quirky music playing]

246
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,253
Goodness gracious,
you need to turn these off right away.

247
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,256
Goodness, the lights are on here too.

248
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,800
Young people these days
don't know how to conserve…

249
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,344
What's this?

250
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,888
What is all this?

251
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,641
Mushrooms, spinach, and celery.

252
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,559
Hey, these are going to spoil!

253
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,520
You should put these in the fridge!

254
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,939
Good grief.

255
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:39,777
Jeez. For crying out loud.

256
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,708
You said no one's here at night.

257
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,961
He probably came to get something.

258
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,171
He's always forgetful.

259
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,090
How much longer do we have to wait?

260
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,968
My exam's in two days.
I have to prepare for it.

261
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,679
You should've prepared in advance then.

262
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,931
What? You don't think you'll pass?

263
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,476
The written test was easy.
I'm worried about the practical exam.

264
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,313
-[chuckles softly]
-They said less than 30 percent pass.

265
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,275
Are you giving excuses
in case you fail?

266
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,612
Hey, there are three things
that don't exist in my life.

267
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,198
Flunking, failing, and rejection.

268
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,741
All right, then.

269
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,578
Stop standing there like that
and come here.

270
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,122
[Seok-ryu] Hiding and concealing.

271
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,875
My life's a roller coaster these days.

272
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,960
I like it. It's exciting.

273
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,256
You're the one who wanted
to tell the world that we're dating.

274
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,049
It seems you're enjoying this now.

275
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,468
The fun has yet to begin.

276
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,438
There's no end to the fun.

277
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,665
[music ends]

278
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,627
[Jae-suk] Hurry, you'll be late for work.

279
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,088
[gasps] Yeon-du!

280
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,550
-Mrs. Do!
-Yeon-du!

281
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,178
Yeon-du, did you miss me?

282
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,554
[Yeon-du] I did.

283
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,389
[Jae-suk] Me too.

284
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:37,311
Goodness, you look so pretty today.

285
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:42,858
Dan-ho, can't you just
let us take care of Yeon-du?

286
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,027
I'll watch over her well.

287
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,112
Thank you for the words,
but that's okay.

288
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,739
Her new babysitter's coming next week.

289
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,284
But I could help you until then.

290
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,786
[Dan-ho] It's really okay.

291
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,288
If I kept imposing like that,

292
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,540
I'd feel very uncomfortable about it.

293
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,834
Yeon-du.

294
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,046
You're not imposing at all though.

295
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,590
-[Dan-ho] We'll get going.
-[Jae-suk] All right.

296
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,635
-Bye, Yeon-du!
-Bye.

297
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,554
[Yeon-du] Have a nice day, Mrs. Do.

298
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,433
-[Jae-suk] Bye, Yeon-du.
-Bye, Mo-eum.

299
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,311
This won't do.

300
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,982
I must have a granddaughter.

301
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,275
Okay, ask your older daughter for a third.

302
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,528
Hey, go on a blind date.

303
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,239
Okay, ask your older daughter to…

304
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,784
-I don't think she should do that.
-It's a great opportunity.

305
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,537
I thought of asking Seok-ryu,
but it'd be a waste to miss out,

306
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,496
so you should go.

307
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,583
Seok-ryu will never go.
Of course, neither will I.

308
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,919
Why not? Why won't you go?

309
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,338
Is there someone you already like?

310
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,215
Wait.

311
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,011
Wait! You do have someone!
Who is it? Someone from work?

312
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:52,970
-Mother.
-What?

313
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,430
-I'll get going.
-Okay, but…

314
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,931
-Hey! Who is it?
-[exclaims]

315
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
Hey, tell me! Mo-eum!

316
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,896
[mellow music playing]

317
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,900
What's wrong, Yeon-du?

318
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,279
You suddenly don't want to go
to kindergarten?

319
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,989
No, I don't.

320
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:16,326
If I go, I'll have to wait until evening
for you to come and pick me up.

321
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:23,125
-How about I pick you up earlier instead?
-I don't want that either.

322
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,587
Then, you won't be able
to work because of me.

323
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,676
It breaks my heart
to keep you there all day too.

324
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,890
But couldn't you understand
for just a little while?

325
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,768
Can't I stay at Mo-eum's house?

326
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,146
I like it there.

327
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,982
Mrs. Do makes me yummy food.

328
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,943
And Mo-eum always plays with me.

329
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,322
I'll play with you and make it more fun.

330
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,160
How about we go bike riding
at the Han River this weekend?

331
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,246
-Really?
-Yeah.

332
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,166
So let's go to kindergarten, okay?

333
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,889

Students, please don't touch
the ingredients.

336
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,374
Just examine them with your eyes.

337
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,293
See if anything's missing
or if you need more of it.

338
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,087
Please check now.

339
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,799
We won't fulfill any requests
once the exam has started.

340
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,467
Any questions?

341
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,469
Then, we'll start the exam.

00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,070
[microwave dings]

344
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,075
[inhales]

345
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,243
[mellow music playing]

346
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:24,913
[exhales]

347
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,794
Mmm.

348
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,845
-Are you eating that again?
-Yeah.

349
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,848
[Myeong-u sighs deeply]

350
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,231
-Are you seeing someone? Right?
-[Seung-hyo] Yeah. What?

351
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:56,153
I mean, you used to
eat lunch slowly like a French noble.

352
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,113
Now, you've only eaten this for days.

353
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,489
[coughing]

354
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,869
And you leave work exactly at 6:00 pm.
It's suspicious. It's not like you at all.

355
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:08,874
That's because I want to have
more of a life at night now.

356
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,419
Also, everything is
already mixed together here,

357
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,962
so I can save time.

358
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,506
And most importantly, it's good.

359
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,467
Mmm.

360
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,180
You know me. Once I'm hooked
on something, I stick with it.

361
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,266
Yeah, that is true.

362
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,311
Should I try that too?

363
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,396
-Yeah, go ahead. Try some.
-[Myeong-u exhales]

364
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,399
Which one should I pick?

365
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,780
The bulgogi one is good
if you can't eat spicy food.

366
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,490
[Myeong-u] Bulgogi? Okay.

367
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,744
Goodness, there's a spoon too.

368
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,165
[horns honks]

369
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,750
[car door opens]

370
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,504
[Seok-ryu] Choisseung!
What are you doing here?

371
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,507
What do you think?
I'm here to congratulate my girlfriend.

372
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,217
[chuckles softly]

373
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,468
-Here.
-[Seok-ryu gasps]

374
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,013
The results aren't even out yet.
Why are you congratulating me?

375
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,515
What's with the bouquet?

376
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,727
Unlike you, I believe the process is
more important than the result.

377
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,062
I'll kill you.

378
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,816
Even if you killed me,
that would be a happy ending too.

379
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,069
It feels like you're becoming
more and more naughty.

380
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,905
What? I'm updating
my firmware to boyfriend mode.

381
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,824
The newest version includes flowers.

382
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,200
You talk so smoothly.

383
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,703
I'll let it slide
since the flowers are pretty.

384
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,996
[pleasant music playing]

385
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,125
-[Seung-hyo] You're prettier.
-Don't push it.

386
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,545
I can't tell you apart from the flowers.
It's so confusing.

387
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,714
Stop or I'll factory reset you.

388
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,799
No, I don't want that. I'll stop.

389
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,095
[chuckles softly]

390
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,724
[Dong-jin] Oh. Hey!

391
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,727
It's been a while.

392
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811
Yeah.

393
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,314
Did you go somewhere?

394
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,815
A business trip.

395
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,067
I have to go straight to work,
so excuse me.

396
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,195
I can't believe you have to go
to work on such a nice day.

397
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,781
This is why it's bad
to be tied down by a job.

398
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,950
Look at me. I'm so free and happy.

399
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,328
It must be nice to be
unaffiliated and unemployed.

400
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,871
I'm not unemployed anymore.

401
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,081
I've started on new work too.

402
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,625
This is a product I'm selling.

403
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,627
-I'll give one to you.
-No, thanks.

404
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,212
Don't refuse. Just take it.

405
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,299
-[Na-yun] I said it was fine.
-[Dong-jin] I'll get that.

406
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,803
By the way, do you work here?

407
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,555
This is my friend's company.

408
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,933
Who? Mr. Yoon?

409
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,226
No, his name's Choi Seung-hyo.

410
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,938
-Seung-hyo!
-[Seung-hyo] Hi, Dong-jin.

411
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,108
-Gosh, did I get something on me?
-[Seung-hyo] Why are you so sloppy?

412
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,152
-You're here too?
-[Seok-ryu] What?

413
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,112
I knew you couldn't be nice forever.

414
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,614
You're dead when I get home.

415
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,450
But what's with the flowers?

416
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,786
-They're mine.
-They're his.

417
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,245
A client gave them to me.

418
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,081
-But she stole them.
-I held them for him.

419
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,666
You're stealing flowers from people now?

420
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,045
Don't worry. I'll tell my mom on her.

421
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,339
No, you don't have to do that.

422
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,633
Mom? Sister?

423
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,136
Wait. Are you two siblings?

424
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,014
Yes, I'm embarrassed to say
he's my younger brother.

425
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,432
[amusing music playing]

426
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,684
But how do you two know each other?

427
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,728
Oh. She goes to my old gym.

428
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,854
[Seung-hyo] I see.

429
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,524
[Dong-jin] Who knew
we'd be connected like this?

430
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,985
Is the world that small,
or is this fate?

431
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,864
Seung-hyo, since I'm here,
can you show me around your office?

432
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:32,035
What? Sure. Do you want to see?

433
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,912
[chuckles nervously]

434
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:39,126
Wow, it's so nice. It's so cool.
It looks so expensive.

435
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,419
Why did you bring him here?

436
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,547
What else could I do?
I couldn't tell him to leave.

437
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,923
Why not? Hey!

438
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,967
Go! If you're done looking, get out!

439
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,927
Is this your company?
He didn't say anything.

440
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,305
-Why are you telling me to go?
-He wants you to leave too.

441
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,306
[Na-yun] Excuse me?

442
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,060
You said you were selling this, right?

443
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,313
Did you know this caused a stir
on social media recently?

444
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,523
[Dong-jin exclaims]

445
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,985
This is a very popular item
that's really hard to get your hands on.

446
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,737
But you got one
thanks to your connections.

447
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,614
Are you kidding? He didn't give me any.

448
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,241
That's not what I meant.

449
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,661
It caused quite a stir
because it was moldy protein.

450
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,329
You didn't know?

451
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,372
What?

452
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,874
[quirky music playing]

453
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,918
That can't be possible.

454
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,297
[sniffing]

455
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,263
-[door opens]
-[Seok-ryu] Mom!

456
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,308
[Mi-suk] What's going on?
Why are you dragging him by the ear?

457
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,435
[Seok-ryu] Dad's here too. Mom, Dad.

458
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,979
This punk messed up again.

459
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,359
Mom, I told you not to lend him money.
But you did, didn't you?

460
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,486
Not only did he lose all of that money

461
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,905
but he could get sued too.

462
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,283
-Sued?
-You know those boxes in his room?

463
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,534
I wondered what they were.

464
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,705
He's been selling moldy protein
that hasn't been approved by the MFD.

465
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,540
What? Mold?

466
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,085
[Geun-sik sighs]

467
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,504
What are we going to do with this bum?

468
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,216
Hey, you punk!

469
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,802
I should've disowned you a long time ago.

470
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,305
But I've put up with you
because of your mother, you punk!

471
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,932
Is that true?

472
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,061
-I didn't know either.
-[Seok-ryu] Hey.

473
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,772
Not knowing doesn't fix anything.

474
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,565
Let's try to deal with this first.

475
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,151
-How many did you sell?
-[Geun-sik sighs wearily]

476
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,112
[Seok-ryu] Tell me! How many did you sell?

477
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,366
Ten.

478
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,952
For all that big talk,
it's a pretty modest number.

479
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,371
No, it's for the best.

480
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,956
Before this gets out of hand,

481
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,209
call the buyers and apologize.

482
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,377
Refund all of their money.

483
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,464
-Okay.
-[Geun-sik] Good grief.

484
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,840
-That little…
-[scoffs]

485
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,343
I'm the one who was scammed.

486
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:59,391
Even after being deceived
for over a decade, I thought to myself,

487
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,561
"Things will work out this time."

488
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,272
"He'll do well this time."

489
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,067
"He's in his thirties and jobless,
but I can't be too harsh."

490
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,902
"What if he goes astray?"

491
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,490
"Still, he's got a good heart
and he's my son, so I should trust him."

492
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,786
But I've reached my limits now.

493
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,373
If you have eyes, go out and take a look.

494
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,583
Go see how hard people work.

495
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,460
[slow music playing]

496
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,920
But what about you?

497
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,923
Did you think making money
off of others would be easy?

498
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,552
How could you be so careless
and sell a product without checking,

499
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,804
especially one
that's meant to be consumed?

500
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,889
You're hopeless.

501
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:44,894
The way you think
has already become completely corrupt.

502
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,981
No, it's not.

503
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,569
I really wanted to do well this time.

504
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,322
[Dong-jin] I know it too.

505
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,699
I know I'm a burden on you both.

506
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,534
I'm not smart,

507
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,537
I didn't study well like Seok-ryu,
and I'm weak-willed.

508
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,582
I know you never expected
anything from me.

509
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,083
I know that too.

510
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,545
[breath trembling] That's why
I hated being a nobody.

511
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,714
[voice shaking] I wanted to succeed!

512
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,217
I wanted to make a lot of money
to buy Mom a nice bag

513
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,844
and buy Dad a new car!

514
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,637
Me too!

515
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,478
[whimpering] I wanted to be special too.

516
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,898
[sniffles]

517
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,318
-Hey, Dong-jin.
-[Dong-jin sobbing]

518
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,199
-[door opens]
-Goodness.

519
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,243
[breathing heavily]

520
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,008
[Mo-eum] Hey, Dan-ho.

521
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,349
Let's at least still greet each other.

522
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,019
I did greet you.

523
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,938
Not something formal like that nod.

524
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,274
You know, "How was your day today?"

525
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,528
"How have you been?"
Nice greetings like those.

526
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,322
I'm not going to do that anymore.

527
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,448
Wow.

528
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,450
That's so cheap.

529
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:27,038
I have something for you though. Ta-da.

530
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,873
Here, take it.

531
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,584
[slow music playing]

532
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,923
[exclaims]

533
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,639
I kept going back to what you said
at the campgrounds.

534
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,560
No, we can't. Never.

535
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,605
Yeon-du can't become your daughter.

536
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,482
And what happened that day was a mistake.

537
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,651
It has to be.

538
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,571
Why?

539
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,825
Because it can't happen.

540
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,327
But…

541
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,914
doesn't it sound awkward?

542
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,709
What do you mean?

543
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,586
I told you I liked you,

544
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,089
and you said it was something
that can't happen.

545
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,761
You didn't say you didn't like me.

546
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,179
I don't like you.

547
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,307
-What?
-You said you liked me.

548
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,976
So there was no need to be harsh.
I was being indirect.

549
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,229
You're putting me in a tough spot.

550
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,732
Then, what was that?

551
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,277
All of those ointments you gave me.

552
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:45,241
Wasn't that big bag your way
of showing how you felt about me?

553
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,826
You read too much into it.

554
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,662
The ointment was just ointment.

555
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,957
I see. [chuckles awkwardly]

556
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,543
So that's what it was.

557
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,629
Still, take this
since I'm embarrassed.

558
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,136
Well, then. I'll get going.

559
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,473
I forgot.
We're going in the same direction.

560
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,725
Uh…

561
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,602
I'll go first.

562
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,481
Take your time.

563
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,566
[slow music continues playing]

564
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,410
There are so many things
I have to stop liking now.

565
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,209
This is bad.

566
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,928
-[knock on door]
-[Gyeong-jong] Come in.

567
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,558
[Hye-suk] Are you busy?

568
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,644
No, I was finishing up
a dissertation I'd been reading.

569
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,401
-Is it important?
-[chucks aside]

570
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,654
Not really. Reading it is just a habit.

571
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,824
-What is it? Did you need something?
-No.

572
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,326
Just seeing what you were up to.

573
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,662
Wow.

574
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,291
I didn't know you had so many books here.

575
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,835
The window is huge too.

576
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,044
Yeah.

577
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,463
[quirky music playing]

578
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,718
[Hye-suk] But don't you think
this bed is too small?

579
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,428
I bet it's uncomfortable.

580
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,638
Since I sleep alone,
so a full-size bed is enough.

581
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,725
I sleep alone on a queen-size bed.

582
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,605
So I was wondering.

583
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,357
How about coming back
into the master bedroom?

584
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,359
What?

585
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,445
-You don't want to?
-No, I want to!

586
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,572
[Hye-suk] Goodness!

587
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,952
Gyeong-jong!

588
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,997
Gyeong-jong, wait for me.

589
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,957
Yes, I'm sorry.

590
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,668
I'll refund your money right away. Okay.

591
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,087
-[line disconnects]
-[door opens]

592
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,090
-What do you want?
-[door closes]

593
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,092
Why are you entering my room
without knocking?

594
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,970
You can do the same.

595
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,350
You once hung a sign on your door
saying you'd kill me if I came in.

596
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,811
-Because I hated you.
-Now, you're just openly saying that?

597
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,399
I thought Mom loved you more.

598
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,278
No matter how hard I tried
to be number one in things,

599
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,156
you were always number one to her.

600
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,324
No, I wasn't.

601
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,743
You were her everything.

602
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,870
She adored and was proud of only you.

603
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,664
You were the reason why she lived.

604
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,873
[sighs softly]

605
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,541
It's all pointless.

606
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,627
Hey, Dong-jin.

607
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,045
What?

608
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,256
I've lived for 13 months longer than you,
so I'm speaking from experience.

609
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,885
Not everyone can be special.

610
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,473
Most people just live ordinary lives.

611
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,641
[mellow music playing]

612
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,017
And the same goes for me.

613
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,815
So don't be too obsessed
with becoming someone great.

614
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,780
Just find what's valuable
to you in your life.

615
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,949
That's more than enough.

616
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,452
Take it from someone
who's been sick before.

617
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,372
That's so cheap.
You used your illness while lecturing me.

618
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,289
[Seok-ryu exclaims]

619
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,667
While I'm at it, here's one more thing.

620
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,130
I'm telling you since it seems
like you don't know,

621
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,382
but you're not weak-willed.

622
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,384
[Dong-jin] What?

623
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,262
You'd fight me to the death
over drumsticks.

624
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,390
Whenever we went to buffets,
you ate all the food and left devastation,

625
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,766
like a swarm of locusts.

626
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,186
But you survived a year
on just protein shakes and chicken breast.

627
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,690
That's what will is.

628
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,572
It was nice to see you work as a trainer
since you seemed so dedicated.

629
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,116
[mellow music continues playing]

630
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,161
I wasn't a trainer.
I was working to be one.

631
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,831
[Seok-ryu] So why did you fail the exam?

632
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,750
You should've worked harder.

633
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,252
[Dong-jin] You just said I did work hard.

634
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,588
-[Seok-ryu] All you did was try.
-What are you doing?

635
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,715
Everyone tries.
You should've done better.

636
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,759
-It's Seok-ryu.
-[Dong-jin] I wanted to pass too.

637
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,470
-[Mi-suk] She's with Dong-jin.
-What about Dong-jin?

638
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,638
-[Dong-jin] You think I want to be dumb?
-What is it?

639
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,765
-Quiet.
-[Geun-sik] What?

640
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,606
-[exhales]
-[window opens]

641
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,274
[knock on window]

642
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,328
What's wrong? Did you fail?

643
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:46,375
Hey, that's okay.
You can always take it again.

644
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,171
You can't just pass things
like that on the first try.

645
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,299
You won't seem human.
You're already like a fairy as it is.

646
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,510
From now on, [inhales]

647
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,138
just call me Tinker Bell.

648
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,391
-What?
-[chuckling]

649
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,477
Well,

650
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,940
this fairy passed the exam
on her first try!

651
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,694
I got my Korean Food
Craftsman certificate! [exclaims]

652
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,613
Holy cow!

653
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,657
Hey! That's insane!

654
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,909
Wait right there! I'm coming over.

655
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,327
Wow!

656
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,080
-Hey, that's not a door! You'll get hurt!
-Right.

657
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,249
This won't work. I'll go around.

658
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,292
[Seok-ryu] I'll see you later.

659
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,377
[pleasant music playing]

660
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,586
[Seok-ryu laughing]

661
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,963
Go!

662
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,881
What's with him?

663
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,353
[clears throat]

664
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,356
Did anyone follow you?

665
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,400
[chuckling] Am I
in Hyereung-dong or Hawaii?

666
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,987
Don't you think
that makes you look more suspicious?

667
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,031
We should be more careful
around the neighborhood.

668
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,453
You and I have
been hanging out together for decades.

669
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,623
We could be hugging each other,

670
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,168
and no one would find it strange.

671
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,714
That's true.

672
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,639
Hey! What if someone sees us?

673
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,932
[Seung-hyo] I told you.

674
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,310
No one will find it strange.

675
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,233
Congratulations.

676
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,528
You passed on your first try.
That's so like you.

677
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,614
I really am happy.

678
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:44,202
Much more than when I got into college
or when I got hired by Greip.

679
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,708
I'm happy that you're happy.

680
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:54,295
Now that I have my certificate,

681
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,505
I'm going to prepare for real and start.

682
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,299
I'll look for a job too.

683
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,594
You have to be careful in the kitchen
when you start working.

684
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,263
Water, fire, and knives.

685
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,723
[pleasant music continues playing]

686
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,016

[In-suk] That suits
you perfectly, Jae-suk.

873

Come to think of it, you resemble a cow.

-Moo.
-Wow.

Your eyes are as clear as a calf's.

-Hey, girls.
-I do have pretty eyes.

878
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,375
[Hye-suk] Hey, girls. Listen.

879
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,087
It's not a cow.
It's supposed to be a rhinoceros.

00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,756
-[Jae-suk] Jeez.

[Jae-suk] "You were born to pass."

Hey, ukulele class. That sounds good.

-You take that.
-They all sound good.

now that Hye-suk's retired.

904
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,682
We can hang out like this all the time.

905

-I'm going to enjoy my time now.
-Really?

-A trip?

909
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,985
-[Jae-suk] Yeah.
-I already went to Seoraksan with her.

Not for just you two.
A trip with all four of us.

How much does going on a cruise cost?

Around five to six million won?

-Yeah.

at the district office today. Was it fun?

Gosh, it's been rough
because of the poor economy.

in front of Hyereung Middle School.

00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,029
You're all so amazing.

1041
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,783
I didn't hear back
from any of the jobs I applied for.

1042
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,994
Maybe it's because I'm too old.

1043
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,372
[A-young] Maybe it's because your resume
is too impressive.

1044
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,707
-What?
-That's right.

1045
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,084
If an ex-Greip employee
applied to be a kitchen porter,

1046
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,627
I wouldn't hire you either.

1047
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,547
[gasps] It'd so be intimidating
to give you work.

1048
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,673
You think so?

00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:53,678

that's how incredible you are.

-[Seung-hyo] No, it's fine. Hello.
-Hi.

1058
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,592
Thank you for letting us feature
your building in the magazine.

It was nothing.

1060
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,638
Our restaurant won an award,
so I'm grateful.

It'll help with business too.

Oh. Would you like me to make some now?

No, not at all.

1067
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,776
You're on break.
I couldn't ask you to do that.

1068
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,904
I'm making it
because I want to taste it. [chuckles]

1069
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,864
Then…

1070
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,450
can I have some to take with me?

-[Mi-suk] Goodness. What is all of this?

1072

It's lasagna, ravioli, and gnocchi.

1073
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,209
I got it from a very famous restaurant.

1074
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,796
[chuckles softly] This is great.
I didn't want to cook.

1075
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,674
By the way, is Seok-ryu home?

00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,133
Yeah, she's upstairs.

Are you going to leave me
to study abroad again?

I just looked into it just in case.

1106
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,023
Right, but why would you look into it?

1107
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,612
Do you know how hard it was
for me to let you go before?

1108
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,156
We're finally together now,

1109

but how could you… [sighs]

1110
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,828
How could you think about that
without telling me?

1111
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:53,459
The time I spend with you
passes so quickly that it kills me.

Even being next door
feels so far away for me.

1113
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,632
How could you carelessly…

1114
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,095
How could you think of being apart
without even batting an eye?

1115
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,638
It does bother me.

1116
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,767
It's hard for me to be away from you too.

1117
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,186
It's not easy. It's tough for me too.

1119
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,529
Don't you think
you're being contradictory?

You don't want to be away from me,

1121
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,244
but you looked into schools abroad
behind my back.

1122
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:34,208
I wanted to let you do
whatever you wanted to do.

[mellow music continues playing]

1124
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,713
Because you're still hurting.

1125
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,341
You have no choice but to be more careful.

1126
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,597
So I tried to understand
when you wanted to keep us a secret.

Out of all those restaurants,

1132
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,590
not a single one asked me
to come in for an interview.

I thought, "I'm still young

01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,224
I wanted to start fresh.

1135

I think I was too naïve.

1136
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,395
I think…

1137
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,483
being 34 is an awkward age
to start something new.

01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:43,945
Also, I just got certified.

I was sick too.

1140
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,829
Still, I wanted to keep cooking.

1141
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,835
I thought maybe it would be better
if I got a degree.

1142
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,671
I was looking for a breakthrough.

It makes me happy.

But I don't think that's enough for me.

Why do you act the opposite
of what you wrote?

1197
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:53,819
I mean,

1198
01:07:54,695 --> 01:08:00,910
you write your articles with righteousness
and courage like Mudflat Man.

1199
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,079
But to me,

1200
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:07,333
why do you act
like a timid and petty villain?

1201
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,345
You're right.
I'm the villain in your life.

You, Mudflat Man,
should take care of your own feelings.

And this time,

1214
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,975
it's not an accident. It's intentional.

1215
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:10,521
Avoid it if you want. Damn it.

Did you avoid it?

1220
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:32,877
No, put me down!

1221
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:37,089
[in normal voice] Stop moving.
You'll fall if you keep moving like that.

1223

The Earth is spinning.

1224

[weakly] Like Baekdu Mountain…

1228
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,107
The eruption.

1229
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:03,407
Do you think there really is
a monster that lives in the crater?

1230
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,034
[dog barks distantly]

1231
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,328
Where shall we go?

1232
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,081
-Put me down.
-[Dan-ho] Hello.

1233
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,708
[Mo-eum] Hello.

1234
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:13,792
By any chance…

1235
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,588
Is that Mo-eum on your back?

1237
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:24,136
Goodness. Where on earth
did you go to get drunk like this?

1238
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,764
You're such an embarrassment!

1239
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,682
Who are you?

1240
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,268
Who are… Mom?

1241
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,396
It's my mom! [laughing]

1242
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,444
She wanted to be
Spider-Man when she was a kid,

1243
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,488
so she even put glue on her hands.

1244
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:46,116
Now, she's all grown up
and putting shame on my face.

1245
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,455
Pew, pew!

1246
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,000
-For crying out loud.
-Pew.

1247
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,920
[Mo-eum laughing]

1248
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,881
-Why are you so drunk?
-That hurts.

1249
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,218
Dan-ho, thank you.

1250
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,345
I'm sorry.

1251
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,555
I didn't raise my daughter right.

1252
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,017
I wonder who on earth
would take this reckless girl.

1253
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,186
You raised her very well.

1254
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:16,188
[exclaims]

1255
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,439
[Dan-ho] Also,

1256
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,692
I'd like to take Mo-eum.

1257
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:24,571
Excuse me? What do you mean?

1258
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,699
I know she's too good for me.

1259
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,200
I know you'll worry too.

1260
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,287
So I tried all I could
to cut ties with her…

1261
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,456
but I don't think I can anymore.

1262
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,042
Dan-ho.

[groans] I miss you, Seok-ryu.

BAE SEOK-RYU

1268
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:28,052
[Seok-ryu] I just need
some space for a bit.

1269
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:28,969
Just for a few days.

1270
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,972
No, just one week.

1271
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,850
I won't hide away in a cave,

1272
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,269
but I'm embarrassed.

1273
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:40,856
So I just want to disappear for a while.

1274
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,442
Will you do that for me?

1275
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:46,653
[sighs]

1276
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,002
It's not good.

1277
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,477
This is bad too.

1278
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:21,897
Why is everything awful?

1279

What are you doing?

1285
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:48,734
Along with the moldy protein,
I'm throwing out my pathetic past.

1286
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,320
You're paying a steep price.

1287
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,197
You better pay Mom back.

1288
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,407
I'm going to pay her back
as soon as I get paid.

1289
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,368
I'm working at the gym again.

1290
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,412
I'm going to take
the certification exam too.

1291
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,788
Really?

1292
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,540
What's gotten into you?

1293
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,669
I felt something after what you said.

1294
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:12,549
I thought really hard
about why I was so delusional.

1295
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:14,593
And…

1296
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,138
it was all because I felt inferior.

1297
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,767
I felt small and embarrassed,

1298
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,019
so I didn't listen
and resisted for nothing.

1299
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:25,562
I wanted to do better than you too.

1300

[mellow music playing]

1301

But we're family.
None of that's important.

1302
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:35,864
[groans] It's so corny,
so I wasn't going to mention it.

1303
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,076
I'm going to throw these out.

1304
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,578
There we go.

1305
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,213
For the Cheongyu-dong commercial facility,

1306
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:54,049
the boundary restoration
and subdivision survey schedule is out.

1307
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,301
You'll have to go
survey the site next week.

in your love life?

1314

What? Do you see cracks?
Is it about to fall apart?

1315
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,829
Are you asking
because you actually know or not?

1316
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,039
I don't know, but I want to,
so I'm asking.

1317
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:31,753
I don't think I can go
to the Architecture's Night event.

1318
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,089
What? Why not all of a sudden?

1319

It's just…

1320
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,344
Can't you accept the award in my place?

1321
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,764
Look, I know I'm made for the stage,

1322
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,725
but you need to accept that yourself.

1323
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:45,976
Please help me out.

1324
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:49,021
Also, I have to go right now.

1325
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:51,440
Can we continue this meeting later?

1326
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:52,899
Where are you going?

1327
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,234
The site at Sehyeon-dong.

1328
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:57,195
Isn't the frame construction
in the finishing stages?

1329
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,155
Yeah.

1330
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,241

I better detox to accept that award.

1334
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:13,378

to work with us all day.

1335

-And he wants to stay on-site?
-[Seung-hyo] Yes.

1336
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:18,592
He writes his articles
after experiencing things himself.

1337
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,969
How much work can I give him?

1338
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,138
Just let him go through the motions?

1339
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:24,222
No.

1340
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:28,143
He'll work just like the other workers.

1341
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,854
Just think of him
as a new, young employee.

1342

-Teach him.
-[chuckles]

1343

I better not go easy on him.

1344
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:35,692
Bring him here.

1345
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,029
[Seung-hyo] Okay.
Did the finishing materials arrive today?

1346
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:42,824
[supervisor] The insulation materials did.
We're installing them now.

1347
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,243

01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,709
Hey, I won't get hurt. I won't die.

1389
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,048
No matter what happens to me,

1390
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:05,884
I'll always be by your side.

1391
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,596
-Got it?
-Yeah.

1392
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:11,807
[Seung-hyo] So…

1393
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:15,060
say it one more time.

1394
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:16,895
What?

1395
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:20,690
Tell me you love me.

1396
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,027
I said it earlier.
Why are you asking for it again?

1397
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,407
I love you, Seok-ryu.

1398
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,205
I missed you so much,

1399
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,999
but I wanted to listen to you,
so I didn't call

1400
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,001
and waited as long as I could.

1401
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,006
As soon as I got hurt, I thought,

1402
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:50,095
"I'll be able to see Seok-ryu today."

1403
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:53,473
[pleasant music playing]

1404
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,771
It feels unfair that there isn't
an expression better than "I love you."

1405
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,194
Because that's how much I love you.

1406
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:30,886
LOVE

1407
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:37,934
THE GREATEST HAPPINESS
IS TO LOVE OUT LOUD

1408
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:44,274
ANDRÉ GIDE

1409
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:45,817
[pop song playing]

1410
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:21,311
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1411
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,939
You won an award for
a cooking competition. I entered for you.

1412
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,941
I'm sorry I entered it
without your permission.

1413
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:26,942
So I won an award?

1414
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,610
What about doing what you did before?

1415
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:32,155
You made cooking videos in the US.
You can start again here.

1416
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:34,032
-I'm ready.
-Then, we'll start.

1417
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,035
You can never date him!
I don't care if the sky falls!

1418
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,662
Mo-eum and I like each other.

1419
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:39,704
[coughs]

1420
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,749
[Dan-ho] I don't know what to do.

1421
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,542
-I'm going to get married.
-With who?

1422
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,212
[Seung-hyo] I have to propose.

1423
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,838
Do you know any good ways to do it?

1424
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,466
Today's the day.

1425
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,891
