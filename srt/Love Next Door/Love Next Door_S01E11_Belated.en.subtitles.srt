1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,084
It's like you've put
your soul into this cake.

3
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,293
Or did I imagine that?

4
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,294
No, you're right.

5
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,046
I mixed it in with the flour and sugar.

6
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,423
I knew it. You're going for an A plus.

7
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,723
But isn't this too much for us to eat?

8
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,725
We have someone to eat our leftovers.

9
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,726
What?

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,821
We're too late.

11
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,865
He's on a serious upward trend these days.

12
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,785
His grades and popularity
have both improved.

13
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,870
-Mo-eum?
-Yeah?

14
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,040
This is how scary academic stress can be.

15
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,959
They've gone blind.

16
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,710
It must be really tough.

17
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,422
I pity them.

18
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,310
To join someone or something.

19
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,564
One's mind goes…

20
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,774
Don't read and walk.

21
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,067
You'll trip.

22
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,653
Even if I fall,
I'll learn another English word.

23
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,114
Who's forcing you to live like that?

24
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,825
This is your fault.

25
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,120
It's been a year since you quit swimming,
and you've already caught up to me.

26
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,955
You're the fourth-ranked student now.

27
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,540
Oh, that?

28
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,333
I raised a monster.

29
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,336
I should've shooed you away
when you asked me to teach you factoring.

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,963
But what are you going to do?

31
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,798
I've already mastered calculus
and geometry.

32
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,092
You mathematically suck.

33
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,845
It seemed like your class
had home economics today.

34
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,054
You have any leftover cake?

35
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,016
What? What you got earlier wasn't enough?

36
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:03,933
I ate it all.

37
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,769
That's so cheap.
I hope it goes to your thighs.

38
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,567
Wow, are you trying to curse me
before my senior year? Take it back.

39
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,152
I said take it back.

40
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,779
You're not the only one.
I'll be a senior too.

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,073
You're a former athlete,
so you don't gain weight!

42
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,910
LATENESS
BELATED, TO BE LATE

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:27,457
BELATED

44
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,256
What's with my eyes?

45
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,969
I think the fridge has sheet masks.

46
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,440
I took this from the back row.

47
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,317
It's today.

48
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,530
So what? I already answered him.

49
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,158
It's over then.

50
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,375
My goodness.

51
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,421
Hey! I told you not to
open the window looking like that.

52
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,673
Are you Shrek?

53
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,217
It's a mint chocolate sheet mask.
You want to die?

54
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,595
Just eat it instead.
Don't put it on your face.

55
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,266
-It's like putting lipstick on a pig.
-I don't need your input.

56
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,143
Even if they lock me up,
I'm going to kill you today.

57
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,521
Seok-ryu, come and eat!

58
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,106
I'll come too, Aunt Mi-suk!

59
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,193
What a crazy sight.

60
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,112
-Don't test me this early.
-Goodness!

61
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,328
Let's get a divorce.

62
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,081
What?

63
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,958
I want a divorce.

64
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,751
A divorce?

65
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,299
That's kind of sudden.

66
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,801
Did you give this decision enough thought?

67
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,636
I've thought about it
for over 20 years.

68
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,390
It's not a surprise
that we ended up like this.

69
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,019
We've spent more time apart
than together in our marriage.

70
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,645
That's…

71
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,406
Yeah, you're right.

72
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,076
It was bound to end up like this.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,579
It was just a matter
of who would say it first.

74
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,916
Let's talk about the details later.

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,253
I'm too tired today.

76
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,012
She didn't even…

77
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,891
ask why.

78
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,418
You were home.

79
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,128
I'm off today.

80
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,173
Didn't you say you had something
to say to me?

81
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,467
I'm being reassigned.

82
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,344
To where?

83
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,678
Africa.

84
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,849
Let me know
when you have the papers ready.

85
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,559
All right.

86
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,188
When should we tell Seung-hyo?

87
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,694
Dig in.

88
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,530
I know I made it, but it's so good.

89
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,697
Isn't this too much?

90
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,117
I said I wanted my own bowl.
All of our spit will get in.

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,409
-It's so barbaric.
-You punk.

92
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,037
Who cares? We're all family here!

93
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,914
Clean your own room
before acting all clean.

94
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,375
You're the one who lives in a pigsty.

95
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,960
What was that, you orangutan?

96
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,086
Thanks, Aunt Mi-suk.

97
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,963
-She's thankful too.
-Hey!

98
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,968
Wow, it's so good.

99
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,221
It's better than
the Michelin restaurant I went to before.

100
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,305
-Really?
-Yeah.

101
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,518
I don't know who that is,
but I bet I'm much better than him, right?

102
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,356
What? You know who Michelin is?

103
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,399
Mi-suk!

104
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,234
I'm sure it was a joke.

105
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,778
You lied about being smart
in school, didn't you?

106
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,073
You said you were as smart as Hye-suk,
but you kept falling behind, right?

107
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,783
Don't eat. Give me your spoon.

108
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,160
-Mom.
-Yeah?

109
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,036
-Did you add beans to this?
-You did?

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,788
No, the rice I used already had beans.

111
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,207
I told you a million times I hate beans.

112
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,668
Seok-ryu, they're good for you,
so just eat it. Okay?

113
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,128
You little punk!

114
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,671
Jeez, you're so loud.

115
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,590
You ate all the damn eggs.

116
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,384
Dad, I need protein.

117
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,554
Your aging dad
needs the protein more, you punk!

118
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,514
Jeez, be quiet.

119
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,975
-Mom?
-Yeah?

120
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,436
Am I chewing on anchovies right now?

121
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,980
-Anchovies?
-I had leftover side dishes to clear out.

122
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,817
Putting anchovies in bibimbap
is like committing a cardinal sin!

123
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,986
It's hard to eat around it too.
They're so small.

124
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,489
Give me your spoons.
No one can eat except for Seung-hyo.

125
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,115
Don't be like that.

126
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,825
-Hold on.
-I worked hard to make this.

127
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,285
Thank you for the meal.

128
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,411
-Hey.
-Yeah?

129
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,289
Dong-jin, I love seeing you eat food
instead of that shake.

130
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,290
I'll drink some later.

131
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,666
Hey, eat all these beans.

132
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,376
You need protein too.

133
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,587
You put everything
you wanted to toss out, right?

134
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,430
Why are you studying French?

135
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,518
It's a French cookbook.
The drawings were pretty, so I bought it.

136
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,230
But I have no idea what it says.

137
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,274
Blanquette de veau is veal stew.

138
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,485
It's a famous French home-style dish.

139
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,987
Hey, you haven't forgotten your French?

140
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,614
I bet I could still read that.

141
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,449
Then why haven't you spoken it?

142
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,493
Then, should I go around saying,

143
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,203
"Bonjour, mademoiselle"?

144
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,579
That was so gross.

145
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,915
I would've stopped being your friend.

146
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,168
Hey. Read this for me.

147
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,462
It's so thick. It'll take forever.

148
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,131
No, not all of it. Just a little.

149
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,883
Read this page first.

150
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,969
How bothersome.

151
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,397
Blanquette de veau

152
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,358
is a dish that symbolizes
French home-style cooking.

153
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:35,032
Common ingredients are used,
and it's easy to prepare.

154
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,622
The finished dish
boasts a sophisticated flavor.

155
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,589
Coq au vin means "rooster in wine."

156
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,967
With chicken and vegetables
braised in wine,

157
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,719
it's a traditional French dish.

158
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,116
So… I woke up,

159
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,162
and your face was so close to mine.

160
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,123
But there suddenly was
a rainbow right there.

161
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,210
It was so interesting.
I couldn't help but touch it.

162
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,544
It's hot.

163
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,213
What?

164
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,760
Gosh, I almost got heatstroke
while volunteering my services.

165
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,180
You asked me to read you
the book, and you fall asleep?

166
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,808
Well, that was because…

167
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,853
Tell your mom I'll put up
an awning here soon.

168
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,318
Why did the rainbow have to appear there?

169
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,154
Where is the light shining from?

170
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,990
That's odd.

171
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,793
Hey!

172
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,170
Hey, is your skull okay?

173
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,630
Is it broken?

174
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,674
What was that?

175
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,634
What were you doing? Are you okay?

176
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,933
Gosh, don't be such a crybaby.

177
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,935
That's strange.

178
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,270
Hey.

179
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,356
I'm saying this
as an on-site medical professional.

180
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,859
You'll be fine. You won't die.

181
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,071
If I develop aftereffects,
I'll call 119… No.

182
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,532
I'm going to call the cops on you.

183
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,118
It looked like you needed
the cops earlier.

184
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,745
What do you mean?

185
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,165
I mean, your face was red.

186
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,167
What?

187
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,335
Did something happen with Seok-ryu?

188
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:35,963
Nothing happened.

189
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,549
Darn. I was excited for nothing.

190
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,511
Was Seok-ryu okay yesterday?
I heard Hyeon-jun left.

191
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,560
Did I cry too much?

192
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,064
Did I look like someone who had regrets?

193
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,860
Is that why he isn't bringing up the milk?

194
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,491
She cried so much.
I didn't want to pressure her.

195
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,910
Forcing her to answer seems wrong.

196
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,914
So you're taking another step back?

197
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,709
She already has a lot on her mind.
I don't want to make it worse.

198
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,463
-Drink this.
-No, thanks.

199
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,547
Jeez, just drink it.

200
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,258
This is more refreshing than beer
when you're feeling frustrated.

201
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,677
You'll feel much better afterwards.

202
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,306
Goodness.

203
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,392
-Are you okay? Sorry.
-You shook it on purpose.

204
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,852
For crying out loud.

205
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,937
Are you okay?

206
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,563
Do I look okay?

207
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,899
Sorry.

208
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:42,947
It's refreshing.

209
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,864
I know.

210
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,701
If only there was a catalyst
like this for you and Seok-ryu,

211
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,245
there would be zero worries.

212
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,456
Things would feel refreshing,
crisp, and clean.

213
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,092
What are you doing?

214
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,718
Hey.

215
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,428
-Hey.
-No.

216
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,180
-My gosh!
-What on earth?

217
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,685
Hey… Where are you going?

218
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,272
Mo-eum!

219
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,524
Jeez.

220
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,651
Mr. Kang.

221
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,945
Mr. Choi.

222
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,576
I've said it before,

223
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,786
but she really is nice.

224
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,913
I know.

225
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,792
Would you like to sit down?

226
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,504
I was going somewhere,
but I can sit for a moment.

227
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,973
Here.

228
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,394
-You must've been really hot.
-Yes.

229
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,568
Well,

230
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,071
I haven't seen you in a while,
so it feels…

231
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,407
a little awkward.

232
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,660
Yeah, me too.

233
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,753
Still, you're a neighborhood friend.

234
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,922
Also, we're the same age.

235
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,008
You even listened to my problems.

236
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,637
How about we drop the formalities?

237
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,596
Sounds good.

238
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,934
Then, should we casually
call each other by our names?

239
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,269
Yes. No, wait.

240
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,104
Yeah, Dan-ho.

241
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,398
Okay, Seung-hyo.

242
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,875
-Should we go back to how things were?
-That's a good idea.

243
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,585
Yes. Right?

244
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,120
EXPIRATION DATE JUNE 29

245
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,345
EXPIRATION DATE JUNE 29

246
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,167
CHOISSEUNG

247
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,931
It's past the date.

248
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,602
It's over.

249
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,958
DAEHAN MILK

250
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,718
That's right.

251
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,387
I received a personal request.

252
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,140
The pianist Ko Sang-hee
wants to open a bookstore.

253
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,517
Isn't she really famous?

254
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,434
Yeah.

255
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,478
Why does a pianist want to open
a bookstore?

256
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,273
She's always liked books.
Her dream is to open one in her hometown.

257
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,943
That whole area is a field of flowers.

258
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,070
She wants a place
that not only goes well with that

259
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,406
but also features a special theme.

260
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,244
Does anyone have an idea?
Anything good? Come on.

261
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,205
-Where is it?
-Taebaek, Gangwon Province.

262
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,670
What if the building becomes music?

263
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,130
What?

264
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,133
We'll make a building
that creates sound.

265
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,178
We'll use the wind to turn the building
into an instrument.

266
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,556
A bookstore built for a pianist.

267
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,643
But would that be realistically possible?

268
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,811
The risk is…

269
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,148
Overseas, there have been times
when sound was used in the design.

270
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,400
Hyeong-chan,
are you going to the site later?

271
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,902
-Yes.
-On your way back, buy me a recorder.

272
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,821
-A recorder?
-Yeah.

273
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,905
I saw it somewhere.

274
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,118
If you cover different holes
on a recorder, it will alter the pitch.

275
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,537
There's a way to calculate that.

276
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,330
I think I need to play it myself

277
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,666
and see how we can apply that
to the building.

278
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,960
Taebaek, Gangwon Province.

279
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:32,963
My goodness.

280
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,216
Look at his eyes. He's lost it.

281
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,802
I love that look in his eyes.

282
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,597
A handsome lunatic obsessed with work.

283
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,682
A cute lunatic obsessed with Seung-hyo.

284
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,644
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

285
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,396
-Don't forget the recorder.
-Okay.

286
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:55,944
Hello?

287
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,240
Seung-hyo, are you free tonight?

288
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,201
What? Why?

289
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,244
Let's have dinner together as a family.

290
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,079
I see.

291
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,873
Okay.

292
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,752
Then, I'll make reservations. Okay.

293
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,171
I'll see you later.

294
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,304
POUR THE BOILING BEEF BROTH INTO THE ROUX

295
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,242
I thought you two went to work,
so I used the kitchen for a little bit.

296
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,286
What are you making? It smells good.

297
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,248
It's a French dish.
I'm just trying to mimic it.

298
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,209
You want to cook that badly?

299
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,919
Yeah.

300
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,463
The more I try it,
the more I want to do it.

301
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
It's fun and exciting.

302
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,176
Still, I wish you wouldn't do this.

303
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,014
It's hard enough for a healthy person.
I wonder how you'll manage.

304
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,767
I feel the same way.

305
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,853
Stress is poison for your stomach.

306
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,148
You know from watching your dad
it's not an easy job.

307
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,817
I understand how you feel.

308
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,986
But I'll take care of myself.

309
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,364
I'll eat well, and I'll work out
to increase my stamina.

310
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,199
I promise not to get sick.

311
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,293
Quit right away if it gets hard.

312
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,962
That's right.

313
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,423
If it gets hard,
quit and just hang out at home.

314
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,341
You think we can't take care of you?

315
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,884
-Right, honey?
-You did well.

316
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,970
I'm touched.

317
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,180
You promised, Mom.
You have to take care of me.

318
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,223
Okay.

319
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,313
Hang out, and if you get bored,
you can just get a job.

320
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,856
There's Saemsong Electronics.

321
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,108
-And there's Kekeo.
-There she goes again.

322
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,444
-She's at it again.
-Right?

323
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,863
That's the Mom I know.
She knows how to ruin the mood.

324
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,239
I'm just saying.

325
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,035
It's just in case you feel bored
and restless to death.

326
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,620
-Honey, how does it taste?
-It's good.

327
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,122
Really? Let me try some.

328
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,129
Yeon-du, did something happen
at kindergarten today?

329
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,298
You don't look happy.

330
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,759
Today, A-ron said to me…

331
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,678
I didn't have a mom.

332
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,310
I bet that upset you.

333
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,270
So what did you do?

334
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,065
I did what you taught me.

335
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,318
I said not all families
have a mom and dad.

336
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,196
I said it's an ideology created by society

337
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,323
about what they think
"normal families" should be.

338
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,202
You did great.

339
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:54,081
But they're dumb,
so they don't know what ideology is.

340
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,335
Dad, are you sure
you can keep leaving work early like this?

341
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:02,255
Your babysitter hurt her back,
so she can't come anymore.

342
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,966
I have no choice
until I find a new babysitter.

343
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,928
When is the new babysitter coming?

344
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,348
I don't know. No one has applied yet.

345
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,226
How about…

346
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,979
if I do it?

347
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,279
Ms. Jae-suk!

348
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,656
Hey, Mo-eum.

349
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,783
-Mo-eum!
-Hey, Yeon-du.

350
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,743
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

351
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,995
Watch the office for a second.

352
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,414
I'm taking Yeon-du out for some ice cream.

353
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,083
No, that's fine. I'll buy it.

354
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,335
No, I want to buy it for her.
Let's go, Yeon-du.

355
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,838
-Okay!
-I'll go too then.

356
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,673
I'd really like to go!

357
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,384
Your dad's a bit overprotective.

358
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,513
Are you sure
you can trust me to watch her?

359
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,765
Who's watching who? You?

360
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,393
Yeah, I'm going to
look after Yeon-du for now.

361
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,563
You really don't have to.

362
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,566
Come on. What are neighbors for?

363
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,485
We're here to help one another.
Just wait here for a bit.

364
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,903
-I'll be back.
-Bye.

365
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,238
-Let's go.
-Mom.

366
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,073
-Mom.
-Yeon-du…

367
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,284
Mom…

368
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,262
I'm sorry about before!

369
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,689
After what happened to Seok-ryu…

370
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:48,778
and after hearing your story,
I must've been swept up by emotions.

371
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,783
I think it was a type
of temporary insanity.

372
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,247
I'm sorry too.

373
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,875
No matter how sudden it was,

374
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,294
I was wrong for failing to avoid it.

375
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,504
Well…

376
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,965
Right.

377
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:10,967
Well…

378
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,386
I was more at fault here.

379
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:19,309
How about we agree it was
a mutual mistake made by both of us?

380
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,353
-I fully agree.
-Okay.

381
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,480
-Good.
-Yes.

382
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,899
Okay.

383
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,442
-Also…
-Yes?

384
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,779
I declined your mother's offer
to watch Yeon-du.

385
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,863
No, it's okay.

386
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:36,660
That's between you and my mom.

387
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,620
Don't worry about me.

388
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,165
Thank you. I'll try to find
a new babysitter as soon as possible.

389
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,127
-Dad!
-Hey.

390
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,714
Dad, she bought me a ton of ice cream.

391
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,842
You're so lucky. Did you thank her?

392
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,887
I turned on the air conditioning.
Why is it so hot?

393
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,140
It's steaming hot. What's going on?

394
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,982
How's the food?

395
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,235
I came here with our client last time.

396
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,861
I liked it.

397
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,947
Yeah, it's nice.

398
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,158
Yeah, it's good.

399
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,119
That's a relief.

400
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,579
It's usually hard
to get a reservation here.

401
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,959
Thankfully, someone canceled,
and they had one spot left.

402
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,920
I see.

403
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,011
To be honest, we asked you to dinner
because we had something to tell you.

404
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,604
What is it?

405
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,566
I was reassigned.

406
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,861
I see.

407
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,324
Where are you going?
How long is it for this time?

408
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,369
Africa. It's going to be for a while.

409
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,539
Africa…

410
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,172
If I can, I'll take time off to visit.

411
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,591
It'd be nice if you could go too, Dad.

412
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,428
Seung-hyo.

413
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,765
We're getting a divorce.

414
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,601
What?

415
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,771
Our marriage fell apart a long time ago.

416
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,524
We've decided there's no point
in forcing ourselves to be together.

417
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,489
We think ending things here
would be the best for everyone.

418
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,329
Seung-hyo, all I can say is I'm sorry.

419
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,748
We hope you'll understand.

420
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,669
What's there for me to understand?

421
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,296
It's your lives.

422
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,386
Don't worry about me. Do what you want.

423
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,849
I'm sorry.
I forgot about something urgent today.

424
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,311
I'll get going.

425
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,897
You're really going to Africa?

426
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,817
So you don't care about me or Seung-hyo?

427
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,237
You're the one
who has no respect for my career.

428
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,407
You think leaving your family
to go off alone for years makes sense?

429
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,533
Family?

430
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,243
You have no right to say that.

431
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,829
You pretty much live at that hospital
and rarely come home.

432
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,041
When Seung-hyo and I were in France,
you came to see us only once.

433
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,169
So I'm telling you
to stay in Korea!

434
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,920
My goodness.

435
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,467
Let's discuss this again later.

436
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,096
-Hello?
-It's me.

437
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,306
Can you talk?

438
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,474
No, I'm sorry.

439
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,267
I'll call you back later.

440
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,311
Yeah, sorry. Bye.

441
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,814
-Who was that?
-The colleague I'm going with.

442
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,857
I have a work call.

443
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,651
You sure it's for work?
And not another reason for wanting to go?

444
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,694
What does that mean?

445
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,071
You had the chance
to be assigned elsewhere.

446
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,574
But there are civil wars
and always talk of terrorism there!

447
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,993
Why are you bent
on going somewhere so dangerous?

448
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,162
Because Koreans live there too.

449
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,998
Why do this job if it's only to go
to safe and comfortable countries?

450
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,708
So it's solely a sense of duty?

451
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,294
Is that why a woman with a child
would be this stubborn?

452
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,507
Seriously! That's enough!
I'm so sick of this!

453
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,051
-Hye-suk!
-What?

454
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,804
You want me to stay home,
raise our child, and do housework?

455
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,641
You should've married a woman
who'd support you instead of me.

456
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,725
Is that all you can say?

457
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,770
I should've never married you
to begin with.

458
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,439
No, I should've never had Seung-hyo.

459
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,192
-Hey!
-You clipped my wings!

460
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,111
You've trapped me here with a child!

461
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,822
If only Seung-hyo wasn't around,

462
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,698
this wouldn't have happened to me.

463
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,868
I love Seung-hyo,

464
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,287
but I can't live as just a mom.

465
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,254
Seung-hyo.

466
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,787
Ratatouille is a representative dish
of the Provence region.

467
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,417
Add herbs and olive oil to eggplants,
zucchini, bell peppers, and tomatoes.

468
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,545
Simmer it into a vegetable stew.

469
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,130
Ratatouille was a good movie.

470
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,423
I'm leaving.

471
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,465
Keep going.

472
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,349
CHOISSEUNG

473
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,311
Why is he calling me this late?

474
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,609
Hello?

475
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,028
Sorry?

476
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,372
Hey, Choisseung.

477
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,584
-Hey, get up.
-Okay.

478
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,794
Are you the girl
I spoke with on the phone?

479
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,712
Yes.

480
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:07,383
Well, this young man was drinking alone
and he suddenly passed out.

481
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,844
I had a strong feeling this would happen.

482
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,932
He looked very troubled.
He kept drinking with tears in his eyes.

483
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,809
I tried waking him, but he wouldn't budge.

484
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,977
So what could I do?

485
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,147
I pressed the first number
he had on speed dial, and it called you.

486
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,942
Thank you for calling.

487
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,320
Hey, let's go.

488
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,906
Try to get up.

489
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,287
He hasn't paid yet.

490
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,372
What?

491
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,625
Are you kidding me?

492
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,755
-Goodness.
-Where's your wallet?

493
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,763
How much is it?

494
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,892
Damn it. You just had to order
two dishes you didn't even eat.

495
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,271
I can't go any further!

496
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,774
Not even if my life depended on it!

497
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,819
Whether you spend the night here

498
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,863
or sober up and go home,
you figure it out.

499
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,865
I'm exhausted.

500
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,784
I'm not going home.

501
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,287
Hey, are you waking up?

502
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,506
I said I'm not going home.

503
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,091
Stop being such a drunk.

504
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,010
You're going to sleep here then?

505
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,806
Hey.

506
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,474
Tonight,

507
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,144
I had dinner

508
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,271
with my mom and dad.

509
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,648
So what?

510
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,359
Well…

511
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,822
It was the first time
since I graduated college.

512
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:59,203
Your family does it all the time.

513
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,998
You all have meals together.

514
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,878
But for me,

515
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,965
it was the hardest thing to do.

516
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,386
And I did that today, but…

517
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,056
Never mind.

518
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,477
We didn't even finish our meal.

519
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,941
Hey.

520
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,279
Every time I go to your house,

521
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,365
there's something I really envy.

522
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,412
Your family picture.

523
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,627
In our house,

524
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,129
we have everything…

525
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,466
except for that.

526
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,094
No, that's not it.

527
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,640
We look like we have everything.

528
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,352
But we have nothing.

529
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,649
Choisseung.

530
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,746
My parents are getting a divorce.

531
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,457
What?

532
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,418
I was always scared…

533
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,842
that this day would come.

534
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,138
When I was six or seven,

535
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,101
and when I was 18…

536
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,273
But…

537
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,610
I'm 34 now.

538
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,447
It happened later than I expected.

539
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,419
But I'm still scared.

540
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,261
Even though I'm an adult now,

541
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,515
why does my parents' divorce still hurt?

542
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,812
My mom and dad…

543
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:37,153
I know they have their own lives.

544
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,449
But…

545
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:50,917
Instead of being happy apart…

546
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,506
I still wish they were happy together.

547
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,170
Are you sober now?

548
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,966
What's going on?

549
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,885
What happened?

550
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,179
What are you doing here?

551
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,390
Why am I here?

552
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,102
Give it to me.

553
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,147
-What?
-Transport and medical expenses.

554
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,775
I had to drag you here from a tent bar

555
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,193
and almost broke my back.

556
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,406
Also, your bill was 47,000 won. Give it.

557
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,744
Okay, I'll pay you back.

558
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,955
-Do you want it now?
-Forget it.

559
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,417
Do you have a headache? Do you want water?

560
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,669
Yeah, I have a splitting headache.

561
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,301
Where's the water? Why aren't you…

562
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:27,263
Hey, why didn't you toss this out?
It's expired.

563
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,640
This will give you an upset stomach.

564
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,184
Right.

565
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,271
I forgot
that I was going to throw it away.

566
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:01,172
I remember drinking.

567
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,674
But I didn't do anything stupid, right?

568
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,346
You almost did something really stupid.

569
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,389
What?

570
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,683
Tell your mom and dad

571
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,478
how you really feel.

572
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,901
Don't cry alone like when you were seven
after your mom left.

573
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,366
"Don't go." Why is that so hard to say?

574
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,370
Let's go. I'm sober now.

575
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,915
You've been nagging me
all this time to lean on you.

576
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,541
But why won't you lean on me?

577
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,878
I did lean on you.

578
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,630
What?

579
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,471
You held me up on the way here.

580
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,474
You have so much strength.
You were born with it.

581
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:58,479
I should've just left you for dead
in the streets, you little…

582
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,566
Straighten your collar, you klutz.

583
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,661
This was because of you.

584
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,419
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

585
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,429
I didn't know the mandatory waiting period
would take a month.

586
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,434
We have to appear in court again.
What are you going to do?

587
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,061
I'll take time off and come back.

588
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,651
It's raining.

589
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,361
I have an umbrella.

590
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,699
On our wedding day
and when we registered our marriage,

591
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,368
it rained.

592
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,121
It did.

593
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,667
That's why everyone thought
we'd be happy together.

594
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,838
How did we end up like this?

595
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,507
I don't remember fighting all that much.

596
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,594
We didn't even have a chance to fight.

597
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,390
Are you blaming me?

598
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,269
I'm blaming myself.

599
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,691
Take it.

600
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,610
No, wait…

601
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,931
I'm sure there's at least one.

602
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,558
What? You're leaving tomorrow?

603
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,521
It just turned out that way. It's urgent.

604
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,607
Hey, but still,

605
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,734
there's no reason to be so sudden.

606
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,237
Wait, let me call Jae-suk and In-suk.

607
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,571
-I'll tell them to come.
-Stop.

608
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,199
Please! Don't make such a fuss.

609
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,951
I saw them a few days ago anyway.

610
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,994
I'll be back soon.

611
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,247
Yeah, but still…

612
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,166
Here. These are some cosmetics.
Share it with the others.

613
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,501
It's from France.

614
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,796
Apply it generously,
and don't age while I'm gone.

615
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,256
You brat.

616
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,260
You better call often when you get there.

617
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:38,389
Call me when you crave kimchi
and when you want to speak Korean.

618
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,017
Call me if anything troubles you, okay?

619
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,228
Fine, I will.

620
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,690
Why is it so sudden though?

621
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,402
Aunt Hye-suk.

622
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,323
Seok-ryu, were you home?

623
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,118
-I thought I wasn't going to see you.
-Me too.

624
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,078
I would've been sad if you just left.

625
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,918
Seok-ryu, you've been through so much.

626
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,715
But I'm not worried about you.
I know you'll do well.

627
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,430
I've always been grateful for
how well you've looked after Seung-hyo.

628
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,852
Check in on him from time to time
while I'm away, okay?

629
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,187
Go on in. Bye.

630
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,066
Goodness. I'm off now. Bye.

631
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,570
Aunt Hye-suk.

632
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,698
Seung-hyo's sad.

633
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,956
Seung-hyo…

634
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,918
has always been waiting
for his mom since he was a kid.

635
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,173
He was like a kid
in a never-ending game of hide-and-seek.

636
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,928
He hid so no one could find him.

637
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:06,143
But I think he was waiting
for his mom to find him.

638
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,067
Thanks for telling me.

639
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,874
The paramedics are here.
Where's the patient?

640
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,171
I have a piece of raw octopus
stuck in my throat!

641
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,635
The suckers are stuck to your throat.
We have to get it out.

642
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,679
Open your mouth.

643
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,222
She ate a poisonous mushroom!

644
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,557
Why would she eat that here?

645
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,725
Over here!

646
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,853
She's been bitten
by a blue-ringed octopus!

647
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,773
A blue-ringed octopus in the mudflats?

648
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,693
What do I do?

649
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,488
I can't do this on my own.

650
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,287
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

651
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,712
Dan-ho?

652
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,437
MFM

653
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,364
Mudflat Man!

654
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,582
You take care of the poisonous mushroom.

655
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,083
I'll handle the raw octopus.

656
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,851
Mudflat Man.
We still have the blue-ringed octopus.

657
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,814
Blue-ringed octopus have
deadly venom containing tetrodotoxin.

658
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,982
We must move her now.

659
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,795
All of this wouldn't have been possible
without you, Mudflat Man.

660
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,941
You damn lunatic.

661
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,027
I really must be insane.

662
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,613
Yeah, I've lost my mind.

663
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,751
Yeon-du!

664
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,461
Mo-eum!

665
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,130
Are you staying
at our house starting today?

666
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,549
You should've woken me up.

667
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,969
I heard you worked last night
and got home this morning.

668
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,639
You need to sleep well
to rescue people.

669
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,142
You're the only one who worries about me.

670
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,354
But where's my mom? Why are you alone?

671
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,730
I'm right here.

672
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,610
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yeah, and you're coming too.

673
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,613
Yeon-du.

674
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:33,952
When you go to a bathhouse,
eating seaweed soup and sikhye is a must.

675
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:38,832
This is wisdom
that's passed down from an elder.

676
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,292
Make sure to remember that.

677
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,839
Don't forget
these stone-cooked eggs either.

678
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:46,965
You're right.

679
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,133
Want me to peel it for you?

680
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,261
I can do it.

681
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,639
Goodness, she's so smart.

682
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,433
Ms. Do! Over here!

683
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,684
Goodness! Hey!

684
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,728
Wait, I'll be right back.

685
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,731
My goodness, I don't believe this!

686
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,691
You're all here!

687
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,611
You know how to do it.

688
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,488
You crushed it hard.

689
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,490
Do you want to eat eggs or chips?

690
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,951
-Chips.
-Chips? Okay!

691
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,872
Here it comes! Whoosh!

692
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,707
So yummy!

693
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,128
Yeon-du.

694
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,130
Want to see something cool?

695
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,550
All right.

696
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,013
Usually, when you come to a bathhouse,

697
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:39,810
this is a must too, but I forgot.

698
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,812
Here.

699
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,440
Ta-da! A lamb's head towel hat!

700
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,446
My gosh! You're so cute!

701
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,949
Look. She's got one too.

702
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,035
You're eating so well!

703
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,663
Want me to peel you some eggs?

704
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,040
I wasn't looking because of this.

705
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,251
What?

706
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,340
I looked because she has a mom,
and I was envious.

707
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,801
I don't have a mom.

708
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,934
What do you mean you don't have a mom?

709
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,770
In your pretty face,

710
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,690
I can see your dad and your mom too.

711
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,152
Yeon-du.

712
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,114
Everyone goes on that trip one day.

713
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,077
Your mom just left a little early.

714
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,834
My dad left for that trip early too.

715
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:50,130
In return, he sent me a lot of friends
so I wouldn't be lonely.

716
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,759
-Really?
-Yeah.

717
00:50:54,801 --> 00:51:00,390
Maybe your mom and my dad
met on their trip.

718
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,310
So on the day
you were looking for crop circles,

719
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,145
maybe they brought us together

720
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,813
so that we could have fun together.

721
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,484
So we could become good friends!

722
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,903
I have fun hanging out with you.

723
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,196
Me too.

724
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,157
From now on, let's have fun together.

725
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,452
Let's have a blast every day.

726
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,537
Okay.

727
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,165
All right. How about we have some fun now?

728
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,625
I'll peel one too.

729
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,049
It's been hard to see you lately.

730
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,344
You haven't been home for a few days.

731
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,428
Yeah.

732
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,681
I just came for some clothes.
I have to go.

733
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,482
The thing is…

734
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,654
I'm leaving tomorrow.

735
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,616
Okay, have a safe trip.

736
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,118
I'll keep in touch often.

737
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,205
I'll call and text you.

738
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,624
Your birthday's at the end of the year--

739
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:08,792
You don't have to.

740
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,463
When I'd hear that as a kid,
I looked forward to it.

741
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,007
I waited.

742
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,052
There were days when I needed you.

743
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,598
But not anymore.

744
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,648
Seung-hyo.

745
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,142
What are you doing?

746
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,396
Why are you in my office
and sitting there like that?

747
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,273
Why did you wash your hair at work?
Did you stay out all night?

748
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,692
I was busy with work.

749
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,945
But why are you here? What's up?

750
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,197
I have something to give you.

751
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,540
Hey, Seok-ryu!

752
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,208
It's not cooked! You can't eat that!

753
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,876
You want to go to the hospital?

754
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,877
Have some lettuce.

755
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,713
Dong-jin, stop running around
and come here.

756
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,047
It's hot.

757
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,384
-Do we have to eat on the rooftop?
-You have to fight fire with fire.

758
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,386
And it's nice. The atmosphere's great too.

759
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:11,474
But Gyeong-jong, the bags under your eyes
are drooping all the way down.

760
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,518
I know. He looks like a raccoon.

761
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,228
They'd mistake you for a friend.

762
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,647
I came straight from the night shift.

763
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,983
Goodness, shouldn't you
get some sleep then?

764
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,234
We cluelessly invited you.

765
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,736
No, it's fine.

766
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,031
Yeah, fatigue can't be relieved
with just sleep.

767
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,241
You have to have fun
with family like this.

768
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,242
That's how you relax.

769
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:33,997
Yes, you're right.
It's nice being together like this.

770
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,584
I heard you two couldn't go on vacation
because you were so busy.

771
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,587
Think of this as a vacation spot, okay?

772
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,757
Honey, let's take a picture.
We have some film left, right?

773
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,760
-Forget it. Why take pictures?
-No, it'll be a keepsake.

774
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,261
-You look nice today too.
-Don't.

775
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,972
-Just take a picture.
-It's so lame.

776
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,099
-Seung-hyo, sit with your parents.
-Come here.

777
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,684
Let's take one as a keepsake.

778
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,643
Okay.

779
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,562
Goodness, you look miserable.

780
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:01,107
-Is this right? We're eating.
-Smile. Get closer.

781
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,734
Hey, smile!

782
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,487
-Seung-hyo.
-All right. Smile.

783
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,657
One, two, three. Cheese! There you go!

784
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,209
I was cleaning out my room,

785
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:22,587
and I just happened
to come across it by coincidence.

786
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,548
Thanks.

787
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,010
You have one too now. A family picture.

788
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:40,897
Hey. You sure you don't have to
go to the airport to see your mom off?

789
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,483
You know when her flight is?

790
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,779
No.

791
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,697
Wouldn't your dad know?

792
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,450
I'll call him.

793
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,369
FATHER

794
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,997
Hello, I was just about to call you.

795
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,292
What?

796
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,088
She did?

797
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,801
Dad.

798
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,219
What happened?

799
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,263
I just got the call too.

800
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,850
We found Seo Hye-suk's suitcase
at the terminal.

801
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,561
It was taken
to the lost and found center at first.

802
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,856
It had a Ministry of Foreign Affairs tag,
so it was brought here.

803
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,358
Her departure's today.
She was on her way to the airport.

804
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,568
I see.

805
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,777
I'll try calling her.

806
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,076
We tried to call her too.

807
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,245
We think her phone's in here.

808
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,706
-Officer Kim?
-Yes, sir?

809
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,707
Just a moment.

810
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,170
If she lost her suitcase and phone,

811
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,088
isn't she in big trouble then?

812
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,258
All of her contacts would be on her phone.

813
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,844
Do you know the combination on her lock?

814
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,139
Her birthday is June 17.

815
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,935
It didn't work.
Try your birthday and your dad's.

816
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:01,895
Okay.

817
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,457
It opened!

818
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,792
What are those numbers?

819
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,962
Their wedding anniversary.

820
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,554
Where do you think she is?

821
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,681
Is there any way to reach her?

822
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,232
SE-HWAN

823
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,909
Hey. Did you arrive yet?

824
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:58,952
Hello?

825
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,332
-Who is this?
-Choi Gyeong-jong.

826
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,376
Hello.

827
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,547
I'll explain
why I have my wife's phone later.

828
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,507
Do you know where she is right now?

829
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,885
-What?
-Did she arrive at the airport?

830
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,096
The airport?

831
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,973
She's departing for her new post today.

832
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,516
I don't know when her flight is.

833
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,101
What new post?

834
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,437
She's decided to retire. Didn't you know?

835
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,189
What?

836
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,775
I guess she didn't tell you.

837
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,156
I don't know
if I should be telling you this,

838
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,702
but Hye-suk's been acting strange lately.

839
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,956
What's with the flowers?

840
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,792
It's to celebrate your retirement
and hard work over the years.

841
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,460
Retirement? Who's retiring?

842
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,629
-What?
-Gosh.

843
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,257
I love the scent of lily of the valleys.

844
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,260
But who's retiring?

845
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,388
Well…

846
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,933
I almost forgot.
When are you going to reassign me?

847
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:07,186
I'll grab a meeting with the minister
if you don't tell me soon.

848
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,896
Hye-suk…

849
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,649
What are you doing? You're scaring me.

850
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,651
They're so pretty.

851
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:17,780
I had told her
she wouldn't be reassigned anymore.

852
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,034
She clearly accepted it too.

853
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,785
But she couldn't remember that.

854
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,288
It was like she was hearing it
for the first time.

855
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,669
I have to find her quickly.

856
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,505
Do you know where she could've gone?

857
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,053
She's so cruel.

858
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,431
How can she leave without saying goodbye?

859
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,101
The Ice Princess lived up to her name.

860
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,145
How could she just leave a gift and go?

861
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:53,441
She said she was sorry
and that she'd call soon.

862
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,860
Then, does that mean we can open this now?

863
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,279
But isn't this Chatin?

864
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,990
This is expensive.

865
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,535
Wait!

866
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:08,539
Hey, I'm an expert in cosmetics too.

867
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,791
Is this a cream?

868
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,751
Let's see what it says.

869
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,296
-"Suble…"
-Toner?

870
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,547
I think it's sunscreen.

871
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:17,840
"Suble…"

872
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,592
Damn it!

873
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,886
Hey, this is the land of Hangul!

874
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,389
Why the hell would they use
these squiggly letters?

875
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,475
Hey, I'll call Hye-suk later.

876
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,185
No, I'll ask Seok-ryu later.

877
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,145
Jeez, I can't even see it.

878
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,607
Gosh. Hey, Seung-hyo! Seok-ryu!
I'm glad you're here.

879
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,527
Aunt Mi-suk, do you know
where my mom went?

880
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,154
-What?
-Please find her for me.

881
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,546
But what caused it to break?

882
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,382
I found this inside the washer.

883
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,466
Goodness.

884
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,302
Wait.

885
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,679
Saffron.

886
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,807
You consume so much medicine,
and you still don't know that?

887
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,891
What?

888
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,852
It's not saffron.

889
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,105
-Are you sure it's not saponin?
-Yeah, it is.

890
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,607
I thought it was saponin too.

891
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,986
You left a magazine
written in English in my bag.

892
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,070
A magazine?

893
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,655
I never did that.

894
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,198
Retirement? Who's retiring?

895
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,506
I'm sure I had my phone with me.

896
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,182
You can easily confuse the two.

897
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,769
Yeah. And they're about the same size.

898
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,103
You can confuse them.

899
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,113
Where did my suitcase go?

900
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,711
Why am I up here?

901
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,216
Damn it.

902
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,869
We spoke on the phone yesterday.

903
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,913
She was going
to the mountains for some air.

904
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,456
I'm not sure where that would be.

905
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,044
The only mountain Hye-suk
could've gone to is Gajeongsan.

906
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,380
It's where the temple
we visited last time was.

907
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,548
Dad, it's this way.

908
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,134
Hello.

909
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,514
I'm sorry,
but did you see this person here?

910
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,394
Yes, I saw her earlier.

911
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,396
She came alone.

912
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,605
Where did you see her?

913
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,568
She sat over there for a long time.

914
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,947
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

915
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:38,040
She saw her earlier,
so I think she's already left.

916
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,086
Let's go.

917
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,216
Mom wrote this.

918
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,928
It's her handwriting.

919
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,406
To be honest, I'm a Catholic.

920
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,411
But since Buddha
has great compassion and mercy,

921
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,498
could you please grant my wish?

922
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,713
Please don't let me forget
my husband and son.

923
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,013
PLEASE DON'T LET ME FORGET
MY HUSBAND AND SON

924
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:53,240
Mr. Choi, I think she already left,
so don't worry.

925
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,370
Hey, Choisseung.

926
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:01,207
When we make it down, let's search
restaurants, hotels, and other terminals.

927
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,833
Okay.

928
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,345
Dad, this is Mom's shoe.

929
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,429
What?

930
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,558
Are you sure?

931
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,726
I'm sure.

932
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,938
Do you think something happened to her?

933
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,691
We should look in this area.

934
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,943
But it leads to a cliff down there.

935
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,486
And it's getting dark.

936
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:32,697
-I'll go down.
-I'll go.

937
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,616
If there's an emergency,
I'd be better prepared than you.

938
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,827
Then, let's go down together.

939
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,537
No, I'll make my way down from the top.

940
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,289
You two come up
through the hiking trail.

941
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,795
Seung-hyo, I promise

942
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:49,964
I'll find your mom.

943
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,216
Be careful.

944
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,266
Let's go look for her.

945
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,232
Hey, be careful!

946
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,861
Sorry.

947
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,738
This won't do.

948
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,990
You're being too hasty.
You could get really hurt.

949
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,617
Grab my hand, and let's go slow.

950
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,580
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

951
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,499
She's the smartest member of Lavender.

952
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,585
Right.

953
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:28,669
Let's go.

954
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,005
Let's find your mom.

955
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,266
Hye-suk!

956
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:44,977
Hye-suk!

957
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,104
Hye-suk!

958
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,690
Hye-suk!

959
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,986
Hye-suk? Hye-suk!

960
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,363
Hye-suk!

961
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,046
Hye-suk, wake up.

962
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,340
Hye-suk.

963
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,054
Are you awake?

964
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,139
Honey.

965
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,182
Can you hear me?

966
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:25,601
Yeah.

967
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:30,022
Thank you. Thank you so much.

968
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,526
Are you hurt? Were you hurt anywhere?

969
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:39,782
My leg.

970
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,452
I sprained my ankle.

971
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,539
It started to get dark,
and no one was around.

972
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,792
I wanted to call for help,
but I didn't have my phone.

973
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,377
Why did you come here alone?

974
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,757
Why didn't you tell me anything?

975
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,136
Why did you lie about getting reassigned?

976
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:07,810
I thought it'd put your mind at ease.

977
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,687
No.

978
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,107
No, that's a lie.

979
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,695
I wanted to protect my pride.

980
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,281
I didn't want to be abandoned.

981
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,283
Why would I abandon you?

982
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,911
I knew you weren't in love
with me anymore,

983
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,165
but I wanted to hold on
to even just your shadow.

984
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,418
I've spent decades watching you leave.

985
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,629
That's not true.

986
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,507
Every time I went to you,
you kept moving further away.

987
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,760
I was the one
always shuffling towards you.

988
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,472
I missed you.

989
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,143
When you were in France,

990
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,854
when you were in Africa,

991
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,982
when you were at home in Korea,

992
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,650
I always missed you.

993
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,577
Why could we never say things like this?

994
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,413
How did we end up here?

995
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:11,415
Goodness.

996
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:21,675
Mom!

997
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,885
Dad!

998
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:23,802
Seung-hyo!

999
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,805
Mr. Choi! Aunt Hye-suk!

1000
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,725
-Seok-ryu.
-Are you okay?

1001
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,894
You came too.

1002
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,147
Seung-hyo, it's okay.

1003
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:38,525
I'm not that hurt. I'm sorry.

1004
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,485
Did I scare you?

1005
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:41,445
Seung-hyo.

1006
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,531
Why are you doing this to me?

1007
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,409
The divorce.

1008
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,955
Deciding to leave
without even consulting me…

1009
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,833
Why won't you two ask me?

1010
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:57,628
Why?

1011
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,548
Why don't you care about how I feel?

1012
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:10,391
I'd beg Santa Claus every Christmas.

1013
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,396
"I won't cry."

1014
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,232
"I'll be good."

1015
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:24,738
"So…"

1016
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:27,783
"So please give me back my mom."

1017
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:32,997
"So…

1018
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,626
please let me have
a meal with my mom and dad."

1019
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:41,755
Do you…

1020
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,761
Do you know how hard I tried
to be a good kid?

1021
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:52,057
But I'm an adult now.

1022
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,770
I don't even want to care
about stuff like that!

1023
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,773
But…

1024
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,694
when I see you two,

1025
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,324
I still go back
to that day when I was seven.

1026
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,288
I've spent my whole life stuck there.

1027
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:20,419
Even though I've grown up,
like a fool…

1028
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:26,050
I still…

1029
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,015
want to share a meal with my mom and dad.

1030
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,229
I'm sorry.

1031
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,315
I'm sorry, Seung-hyo.

1032
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,027
Seung-hyo.

1033
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,780
I'm so sorry.

1034
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:52,201
I thought you hated me.

1035
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,371
I can't just live as a mom.

1036
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,256
Seung-hyo.

1037
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:17,726
Seung-hyo.

1038
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,522
I'm really sorry.

1039
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:28,112
I must've lost my mind earlier.
I didn't mean it.

1040
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:29,613
I'm sorry.

1041
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,365
I'm sorry, Seung-hyo.

1042
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,622
I love you.

1043
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:41,625
I love you so much.

1044
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,837
I've made so many mistakes.

1045
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,672
You were always…

1046
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,426
so much more comfortable
around Mi-suk than me.

1047
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,595
You're right.

1048
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,181
I am more comfortable with her.

1049
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,309
But still…

1050
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:01,562
Even still…

1051
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:06,984
I always…

1052
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,450
I always missed you.

1053
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,388
Let's go home, Mom.

1054
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,853
I still need you.

1055
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:56,492
Seung-hyo, I'm so sorry.

1056
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,787
I made you feel so lonely, didn't I?

1057
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:03,123
I'm so sorry.

1058
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,420
But I love you so much.

1059
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:13,884
Don't cry, Seung-hyo.

1060
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,388
I won't leave you alone again.

1061
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,266
I love you so much. I'm sorry.

1062
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,160
Dad, are you okay?

1063
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,537
I'll carry her.

1064
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,621
Yeah.

1065
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,082
She's my wife.

1066
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:46,333
I'll carry her.

1067
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,421
Take a hint and stay out of it.

1068
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:53,757
I see.

1069
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,011
Aren't I heavy?

1070
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:00,556
Not at all.

1071
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,267
You're as light as a feather.

1072
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,019
No, you're as light as air.

1073
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,398
Stop it.

1074
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,067
I've thought this for a while,

1075
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,444
but they really suit each other.

1076
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:24,913
Did you call?

1077
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,415
No, they're coming now.

1078
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,708
-There they come!
-Where?

1079
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:28,875
Hye-suk!

1080
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,502
My goodness! You brat!

1081
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,129
-Wait.
-Hey!

1082
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:33,505
Do you know how worried we were?

1083
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,924
Gosh, we thought something had happened!

1084
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,510
Hey, drink this first!

1085
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,263
This medicine is the best
for calming nerves.

1086
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,098
Stop it!

1087
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:44,933
Why are you all out here this late?

1088
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,602
Don't cause a fuss. Go home.

1089
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,061
Goodness.

1090
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,731
-Hey. You really want us to leave?
-Yeah.

1091
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,774
We don't even get an emotional hug?

1092
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,443
Forget it. I'm hot and sticky.

1093
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,652
I need to take a shower.

1094
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,696
-Honey, help me.
-Okay.

1095
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,032
Thank you for today. Get home safely.

1096
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,158
Good night.

1097
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,075
My goodness.

1098
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,535
-Thanks. Go home.
-Hye-suk!

1099
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:06,413
Hey, come here. Let's shake hands.

1100
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:08,832
Come on. Hey!

1101
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:10,417
Look at that snob.
She's totally fine.

1102
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,169
Lavender, let's call it a night.

1103
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,962
-Call it a night?
-Also, you drink that.

1104
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,256
-You need to calm down more. Go!
-I will.

1105
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,467
Seok-ryu, Seung-hyo. Great job.

1106
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,183
It seems simply like a sprain,

1107
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:29,144
but let's go to the hospital tomorrow
for an x-ray.

1108
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:30,854
Okay.

1109
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:35,275
Also, let's get a brain MRI soon too.

1110
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,530
I heard about what's been going on
with you.

1111
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,951
You didn't tell Seung-hyo yet, right?

1112
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:46,536
No.

1113
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:48,789
It's probably nothing.

1114
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,708
It'll be just to check things out.
Don't be scared.

1115
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,838
Even if you're not okay,

1116
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,049
I'll stay by your side.

1117
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,593
"For better or for worse,

1118
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:04,596
in sickness and in health,

1119
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:08,433
to love and to cherish,
till death do us part."

1120
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,228
We made a vow.

1121
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,275
I've forgotten those vows for too long.

1122
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,611
You can just start now.

1123
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:25,033
You must be exhausted from today.
Take a shower and rest.

1124
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,119
You too.

1125
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:30,539
Wait.

1126
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,922
Wait a second.

1127
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:40,841
Do you…

1128
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:44,302
want me to take you to the bathroom?

1129
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:50,809
Could you?

1130
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:56,481
Here.

1131
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:18,795
What's that in your hand?

1132
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,172
A recorder.

1133
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,466
You'll attract snakes
if you play that at night.

1134
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:23,925
I'm not going to play it.

1135
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,846
I have to create a model,
so I'm analyzing its structure.

1136
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:32,184
When we took those apart as kids,
a bunch of spit would come out.

1137
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:35,353
Sorry.

1138
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,983
I have a business trip tomorrow.
I won't be home.

1139
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:40,942
I see.

1140
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,528
-Where are you going?
-Gangwon Province.

1141
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,821
When will you be back?

1142
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,198
After about two weeks.

1143
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,950
Why is it so long?

1144
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,745
It's not overseas.
Who goes on a business trip for two weeks?

1145
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:53,914
It's an important project.

1146
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:55,999
Come with me if you're bored.

1147
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:03,298
I mean, that's if you're really bored
with nothing to do.

1148
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,009
I don't think that'll happen.

1149
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,389
Have a good trip.

1150
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,058
Thanks.

1151
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:13,975
All right.

1152
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:18,730
Bye.

1153
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,097
When preparing mussels,

1154
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:55,559
you need to cut and remove
the beard on the inside with scissors.

1155
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,686
Then, we're going to blanch them.

1156
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,771
Make sure not to cook them for too long.

1157
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:00,689
Okay.

1158
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,032
What will you do about the windows?

1159
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:53,033
It's not fun hanging out by myself.

1160
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:56,411
Think of the mouthpiece
as the entrance to the building.

1161
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:58,121
It'll be made from logs.

1162
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:01,249
We'll make it so when air enters
through the gaps, it'll create sounds.

1163
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,601
I'm bored.

1164
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:24,606
Today…

1165
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:26,775
I'll make coq au vin.

1166
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:48,004
Coq au vin means "rooster in wine."

1167
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:51,299
With chicken and vegetables
braised in wine,

1168
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,259
it's a traditional French dish.

1169
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,017
What?

1170
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,061
Why won't it play?

1171
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:04,980
Is that the end?

1172
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,022
Seok-ryu.

1173
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:33,466
Seok-ryu.

1174
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:49,774
What on earth is he saying?

1175
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,112
I know!

1176
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,764
THAT MILK EXPIRES TODAY

1177
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,854
BUT MY FEELINGS FOR YOU
WON'T SPOIL TOMORROW OR THE DAY AFTER

1178
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,629
APPLICATION APPROVED
FOR SOUTH POLE POSITION

1179
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,381
Mo-eum!

1180
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,675
-Seok-ryu!
-Where are your car keys?

1181
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,260
-In my bag.
-Your bag?

1182
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,388
-Let me borrow your car.
-Sure.

1183
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,183
-Where are you going?
-To see Seung-hyo.

1184
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:08,269
Wow.

1185
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,523
Has the catalyst finally been triggered?

1186
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,113
CHOISSEUNG

1187
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,118
MR. YOON

1188
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,370
Mr. Yoon, it's me.

1189
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,372
Do you know
where Seung-hyo is by any chance?

1190
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:46,182
Seok-ryu?

1191
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,309
Why won't you answer your phone?

1192
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,147
I had it on silent.

1193
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,024
But what brings you here?

1194
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:57,318
I was bored.

1195
01:25:58,736 --> 01:25:59,946
You said I could come.

1196
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:04,033
Were you bored?

1197
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:05,910
Yeah.

1198
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:10,707
Without you, time seems to drag on.

1199
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,216
Without you, comic books aren't fun.

1200
01:26:22,051 --> 01:26:24,137
Without you, the playground is quiet too.

1201
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,059
Without you, every day feels bland.

1202
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:34,564
It's like eating unseasoned soup
or dumplings without soy sauce.

1203
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:41,654
Without you, it's like not drinking
banana milk after going to the bathhouse.

1204
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:50,121
So I was wondering.
You want to go drink banana milk with me?

1205
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:55,919
You still think about food
in this kind of situation?

1206
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,558
I don't think I need
that banana milk anymore.

1207
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:27,343
BELATED

1208
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:33,016
BELATED REALIZATION

1209
