SEOUL OLYMPIC SWIMMING POOL

3
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,071
Seung-hyo, is your mom here?
Wasn't she coming to Korea for the match?

4
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,490
No, something urgent came up,
so she couldn't make it.

5
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,867
Is that so? What about your dad?

6
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,746
A lot of his patients need critical care,
so he couldn't leave the hospital.

7
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,289
They're important.
You get it, right?

8
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,541
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

9
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,959
Let's focus on the meet.

10
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,420
You'll make the national team if you win.

11
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,717
The 200-meter freestyle finals
will begin shortly.

12
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,635
Let's go!

13
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,733
HYEREUNG HIGH SCHOOL SWIM TEAM

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,407
In lane 8, Choi Seung-hyo
from Hyereung High School.

15
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,409
You can do it, Seung-hyo!

16
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,329
Choi Seung-hyo from Hyereung High
in lane 8! Let's go!

17
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,248
What on earth? Why is she here?

18
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,250
Hey, Choisseung! Over here!

19
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,752
-Over here!
-Please, stop calling my name.

20
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,214
Let's go, Choisseung! Crush them!
Leave them in the dust!

21
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,966
Jeez, Seok-ryu.

22
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,885
If you don't win,
don't even think of coming back home!

23
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,848
You can do it!

24
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,525
Take your marks.

25
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,078
Let's go!

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,082
Go!

27
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,168
You're doing great!

28
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,752
Come on!

29
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,338
Let's go!

00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,969
CHOI SEUNG-HYO
SIXTH

31
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,054
It's okay! Keep going!

32
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,604
Go, go, go!

33
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,317
Hey!

34
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,365
Wow.

35
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,784
She seriously must be crazy.

36
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,371
Wow, seriously?

37
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,957
Do you know what time it is?

38
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,711
I don't.
Look at your watch if you're so curious.

39
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,254
You think I'm asking for the time?

40
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,381
-Don't you get what's implied?
-Gosh, he's loud.

41
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,262
College entrance exams were ages ago.
What's with the comprehension questions?

42
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,805
It's 3:00 a.m.

43
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,141
Even the birds and lambs are asleep.

44
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,518
So why am I hearing your screams?

45
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,146
Goodness, poor Seung-hyo.

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,856
Did I wake our precious baby?

47
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,024
Don't do that.

48
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,028
Our baby can't sleep?
Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?

49
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,696
Hey, stop talking like that.

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,783
Then, go back inside and sleep
if you don't want to hear it.

51
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:02,867
You're so loud.

52
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,083
Hey, in that movie,

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,876
the curly-haired one is the ghost.

54
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,798
Hey, did you just say a spoiler?

55
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,884
That's so unethical!
How could you reveal a spoiler?

56
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,178
This isn't The Sixth Sense!
Curly-haired?

57
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,014
I'll make sure you don't sleep tonight!

58
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,975
You have serious character issues.

59
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,693
Hey! Keep going! Just a little more!

60
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,863
You're doing great! Let's go!
Go all the way!

61
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,550

CHOI SEUNG-HYO

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,557
Hey, you came in first!

63
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,977
You did great!

64
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,355
Great job!

65
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:22,155
EPISODE 3
STOP LINE

66
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,193
She's quiet now that it's morning.

67
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,666
Seung-hyo, you're up early.

68
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,794
-Yes.
-I didn't see you come in.

69
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,795
Did you work late?

70
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,047
-Yes.
-How worrisome.

71
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,131
My son's working so hard.

72
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,174
It's fine.

73
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,594
Come down after you wash.
Let's have breakfast.

74
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,084
I wanted to make some jambon-beurre.

75
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,170
But I didn't have the right ingredients.

76
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,673
We used to eat it at times in France.

77
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,590
Do you remember?

78
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,050
No, I don't.

79
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,345
Right? You were so young.

80
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,307
Still, since we're together…

81
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,019
It's nice to eat together.

82
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,648
I never imagined you'd come back
to live here with us.

83
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,025
It's close to work. That's all it is.

84
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,654
Did you clear out your studio apartment?

85
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,283
Yes, building an office building
wasn't easy.

86
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,493
If it's about money,
you should've told me.

87
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,122
Architecture is a business too.
Don't overdo it.

88
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,874
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,625
Always be careful on site too.

90
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,836
We get a lot of injured workers in the ER.

91
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,671
I will.

92
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,385
Thanks for breakfast.

93
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,059
This toast tastes awful.

94
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,273
I'll buy some baguettes
and butter for tomorrow.

95
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,775
There's no need.
I usually don't eat breakfast.

96
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,028
Really?

97
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,327
When are you being assigned?

98
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,206
You asked the same question as your dad.

99
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,459
Why? Do you want me to leave again?

100
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,002
It's not that…

101
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,300
You don't like staying in Korea
for long periods.

102
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,436
Thank you for breakfast.
I'm off to work.

103
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,791
Gosh, you scared me.

104
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,421
Did you deliberately set off
an explosion at me?

105
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,716
What? No, it's a party popper
from Hyeong-chan's birthday party.

106
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,468
No, that's an explosive device.

107
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,012
Don't you know people have died
from those things?

108
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,473
An architect
who disregards safety is trouble.

109
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,183
I'm the one who's troubled.

110
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,477
I'm getting an earful
for congratulating you.

111
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,604
Congratulate me for what?

112
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,233
Hey, Seung-hyo! We did it!

113
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,651
Mr. Yoon will tell you.

114
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,279
What is it? What's going on?

115
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,489
We can finally breathe.

116
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,741
We got a huge offer.

117
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,453
A term reserved
for only the top 1% of Korea.

118
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,123
A prestigious retirement community.

119
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,877
Danyeong Medical Foundation
is partnering with YR Group to build it,

120
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,754
and they came
directly to us to oversee it.

121
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,425
She said something would happen
in the latter half of the year.

122
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,844
-Hye-ran was right.
-Your wife went to a fortune teller?

123
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,221
Yeah. It was tarot cards this time.

124
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,059
We're riding
on the colossal wheels of fortune.

125
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,311
POMEGRANATE TREE

126
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,895
The leaves look a bit dry.

127
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,858
You're worried
about that measly plant right now?

128
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,068
-Someone cast a curse.
-What?

129
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,029
Our company's fate rests on it.

130
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,739
We'll shut down if it withers.

131
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,907
Goodness. Why didn't you water it?

132
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,534
No, never mind.

133
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,828
Can someone go
and buy some plant nutrients?

134
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,788
You're such a slave to superstitions.

135
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,583
That's how desperate I am.

136
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,168
If this deal goes through,

137
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,088
we won't have to worry about anything
for a while! We have to risk it all!

138
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,089
I want to do this.

139
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,343
Of course. But we can't just do it.
We have to do it well.

140
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,302
I want to do it.

141
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,971
I want to do it too.
I want to do it so badly!

142
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,724
No, I want to see you do it!

143
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,855
HYEREUNG HIGH GYM REMODELING
AND EXPANSION DESIGN COMPETITION

144
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,066
Mom.

145
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,194
Mom?

146
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,696
Is no one home?

147
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,373
I made curry. Heat it up and eat it.

148
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,709
Why is she suddenly being so sweet?

149
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,815
A hundred rolls of kimbap.

150
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,526
Where did this incredible order come from?

151
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,987
I don't know.
They're snacks for some TV shoot.

152
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,406
They'll pick them up at 6:00 p.m.

153
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,325
Is that so?
I'll ask what they're shooting later.

154
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,371
So you've decided to leave Seok-ryu be?

155
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,124
-Yeah.
-Really?

156
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,167
What for?

157
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,045
It's called the Romeo and Juliet effect.

158
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,799
They say love becomes more intense
the more the parents interfere.

159
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,843
What does that have to do with this?

160
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,802
Keep listening.

161
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,597
It's an absolute truth that applies
to other areas as well, not just love.

162
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,933
The more parents oppose
and try to control their child,

163
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,726
the more the child rebels.

164
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,937
Yeah, you're right.
You made a good choice.

165
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,107
You should be as gentle
when rolling kimbap too.

166
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,818
If you try to keep things in by force,
the sides…

167
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,450
Seok-ryu won't last long.

168
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,951
How do you know that?

169
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,120
Not just anyone can be unemployed.

170
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,205
She's been diligent her whole life.

171
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,627
She'll end up caving in on her own
with a slight nudge.

172
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,046
I'm waiting for that moment.

173
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,049
It'll come soon.

174
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,927
We need to make 100. How can you eat that?

175
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,847
It's so good. I'm just tasting it.

176
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,098
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

177
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,016
Hurry up!

178
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,747
Done.

179
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,044
BAE SEOK-RYU'S UNEMPLOYED SCHEDULE

180
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,923
PLAY GAMES

181
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:19,840
Nice.

182
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:29,934
SPACE OUT

183
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,272
I'd be so good at that.

184
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,774
WATCH TV

185
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,735
They're not doing it right.
You can't do it like that.

186
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,828
TAKE A NAP

187
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,230
-What's up?
-I'm busy. Bye.

188
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,609
Wait. I didn't even tell you why I called.
What if it's important?

189
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,319
What is it?

190
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,114
The one with straight hair was the ghost.

191
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,031
I'm hanging up.

192
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,992
Wait! It's important.

193
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,287
-Let's go read comic books.
-You may not know this.

194
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,372
But people with jobs work on weekdays.

195
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,124
Hey, I didn't mean now.

196
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,794
I plan to be there
from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.

197
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,462
Come when you get off work.

198
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,172
No. I'm hanging up now.

199
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,094
Heartless jerk.

200
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,723
Forget it. I have other friends.

201
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,020
-Welcome.
-Hello.

202
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,272
Hey!

203
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,066
My best friend.

204
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,110
My very close and long-time friend!

205
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,237
What's with all the flattery?

206
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,823
I didn't even get most of it.

207
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,827
Mo-eum, you're so gloomy.
Did you have a hard day?

208
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,205
Seok-ryu, you're so cheerful.
Did you have fun doing nothing?

209
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,123
Of course.

210
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,083
What do you want to read?

211
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,835
I got something from every genre.

212
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,378
Romance? Martial arts? Shonen manga?

213
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,964
They all sound boring.

214
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,301
FOR ADULTS ONLY

215
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,510
I want something red.

216
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,970
I see.

217
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,642
We're in a public space
in my neighborhood.

218
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,062
I've never seen anyone so brave.

219
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,647
Right?

220
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,733
I took a peek earlier.

221
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,194
See Rose of Bliss?
It looked pretty good.

222
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,571
Grab it when no one's watching.

223
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,323
Pass it to me when you're done.
Okay? Go.

224
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,574
Now. No one's watching.

225
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,992
-Right now.
-Seok-ryu?

226
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,162
That's not the "red" I was talking about.

227
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,416
Something with fresh blood and torn flesh!
Things like that.

228
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,168
Like those.

229
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,213
That type of red? You could've told me.

230
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,176
Hello.

231
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,971
Your other best friend's here.

232
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,186
Nope. As of today, he's out.
He's been disqualified.

233
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,649
You won't even say hi?

234
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,985
You came. You said you wouldn't.

235
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,029
I didn't come for you.
There's a book I wanted to read.

236
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,407
Really? What book is it?

237
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,201
Well… Here it is. This is what I wanted.

238
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,036
The book you wanted…

239
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,621
was "Princess"?

240
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,878
Wow.

241
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,006
What?
You have a problem with my tastes?

242
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,842
No, I have no prejudices.

243
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,430
But you liked tragic love stories

244
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,389
and sad endings?

245
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,890
Yeah, he does.

246
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,851
How do you know that?

247
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,935
I just do.

248
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,855
A weirdo next to an oddball.

249
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,942
You two should stick together.
You'll bother less people that way.

250
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,069
He picks a fight as soon as he comes.
So annoying.

251
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,421
What should we do now?

252
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,923
What do you think? Let's go home.

253
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,885
No, I have free time outside
from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

254
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,305
You planned out your free time too?

255
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,682
Old habits die hard. What a tiring life.

256
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,225
What? What's wrong with that?

257
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,145
I might as well have fun
in a planned and systematic way.

258
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,190
On that note, how about some board games?

259
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,902
Next time. I have to go home and study.

260
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,737
Study for what?

261
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,864
Powerboat certification.

262
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,784
A boat license? You want drive a boat?

263
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,037
No, I developed an interest
in something recently.

264
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,080
But it's required.

265
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,708
I still have work left.
I have to get back to the office.

266
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,755
What is this?
Are you saying you're both leaving me?

267
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,298
Is this really the end?

268
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,674
Bye. Call me tomorrow.

269
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,634
Don't call me.

270
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,551
Come on.

271
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,347
Yeah, fine! You loyal citizens.

272
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,807
You pillars of industry!

273
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,602
The future of Korea depends on you!
Keep up the great work!

274
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,105
What do I do by myself?

275
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,081
Okay. Here's your morning coffee.

276
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,124
Thank you.

277
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,918
Sure. There you go. It's better with that.

278
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,002
That's right.

279
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,340
The sweetness is really getting
my blood pumping.

280
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,342
Don't you have a coffee machine

281
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,385
or a pour over set?

282
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,595
If she did,
this wouldn't be a real estate office.

283
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,139
-My back hurts.
-Jeez.

284
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,058
-Jae-suk, give me that cushion.
-Just take it yourself.

285
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,184
She doesn't lift a finger.

286
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,352
Good morning!

287
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,105
-Hey.
-What's with the flowers?

288
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,774
I bought them from a flower shop
after taking the subway.

289
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,692
Pretty, right?

290
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,609
-Gosh.
-They are!

291
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,237
My husband never buys me anything
this pretty.

292
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,615
Nor do my kids. So what can I do?
I'll buy them for others.

293
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,492
-Thanks so much.
-Pretty, right?

294
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,953
I can't remember
the last time I got flowers.

295
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,581
-Wait, I want to take a picture.
-Sure.

296
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,374
-They're lavenders.
-Send it to me.

297
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,625
-Okay.
-So fragrant.

298
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,086
-Move your face, Jae-suk.
-This smells so nice.

299
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,004
Right?

300
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,463
Move your face, Jae-suk.

301
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,132
Listen while you look at these.

302
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,801
-There!
-I have a matter to bring up.

303
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,762
Let's change the name of our group.

304
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,056
-Why?
-You want to change our group's name?

305
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,726
Yeah. You remember how nasty
the Hee Sisters were?

306
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,352
-Yeah.
-The worst.

307
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,606
I don't want to be associated with them,
and our name doesn't help.

308
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,109
Let's change it
to something really nice this time!

309
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,110
Like what?

310
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,278
You know,

311
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,780
something refined and elegant.

312
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,616
Should we translate Suk to English?

313
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,492
Hye-suk, what's "suk" in English?

314
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,328
I don't know.

315
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,330
You're a diplomat. You don't know?

316
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,790
-How can I know the names of plants?
-Seriously?

317
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,709
-How can you ask that?
-Search on your phone.

318
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,461
Wait. Let me search it.

319
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,630
Wait. They don't eat it outside of Korea?

320
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,882
-I don't think so.
-I've never heard of it.

321
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,259
Hey, I found it.

322
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,677
-What is it?
-Mugwort.

323
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,596
-Mug… What?
-Mugwort.

324
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,473
Wort. Like this.

325
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,390
Are you barking?

326
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,808
-It's worse than "mug cup."
-What?

327
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,769
No, it doesn't roll off the tongue.

328
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,563
But isn't mugwort a type of herb too?

329
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,731
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

330
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,316
And what's the ultimate herb?

331
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,318
Lavender!

332
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,486
You have to be quick!

333
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,112
It's settled! Lavender.

334
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,240
NA MI-SUK
LIVE WITH FRAGRANCE

335
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,116
-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah?

336
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,619
How do you live with fragrance?

337
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,622
I don't know.
Ask your mom when she gets here.

338
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,791
She must be getting old. Take a look.

339
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,502
She put flowers as her profile picture.

340
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,838
-Lavenders.
-Saying your mom's old behind her back?

341
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,092
This is why I can't leave you two alone.

342
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,093
You're so violent.

343
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,387
I wasn't talking behind your back.
I just stated a fact.

344
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,138
We're growing old together.

345
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,431
Just keep quiet.

346
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,892
Why are you making so many?

347
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,978
We still have a way to go.
We need to make 100.

348
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,604
-A hundred?
-Yeah.

349
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,107
A TV production crew came
and bought them before.

350
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,566
They liked them and ordered again.

351
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,151
Really?

352
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,569
I guess I have no choice.

353
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,612
I should help out.

354
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,905
Hey!

355
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,865
Forget it. What can you do?

356
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,201
Don't get in the way.
Just eat some kimbap.

357
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,369
Or have tteokbokki.

358
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,204
-Do you want some?
-No, you're busy.

359
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,831
Welcome…

360
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,040
-Welcome!
-Hello.

361
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,375
Ms. Yu!

362
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,129
Goodness. Is that you, Seok-ryu?

363
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,048
Wow! You haven't changed at all.

364
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,719
I knew it was you
as soon as you walked in. Wow!

365
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,596
Mom, my homeroom teacher from high school.

366
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,849
-Goodness!
-Hello, Ms. Yu!

367
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,727
I'm so sorry I didn't recognize you.

368
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,978
No, it's fine.

369
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:57,524
I only realized after seeing Seok-ryu.
I forgot her parents ran this shop.

370
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,276
What brings you here?

371
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,028
I came to order food.

372
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,489
Can I get 20 orders of tteokbokki
and 20 orders of sundae?

373
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,741
-Of course.
-Goodness.

374
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,242
We'd be so grateful.

375
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,995
But it's so much.
Can you take them by yourself?

376
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:10,912
I'll help her.

377
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,539
No, I'll go. You're busy.

378
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,207
-You will?
-Just a moment.

379
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,167
-Okay.
-Honey.

380
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,418
-I'll do that.
-Just a moment.

381
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,419
-Okay, hurry.
-Hey.

382
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,587
Get Ms. Yu a drink.

383
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,673
Thanks for delivering this for me.

384
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,592
Of course.

385
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,347
Wow, the school hasn't changed at all.

386
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,558
It's always the same here.

387
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,228
Maybe that's why I keep forgetting
that time's passing.

388
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,316
It's amazing.
I can't believe you're the principal now.

389
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,068
You too.

390
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,031
You were so childish.
I can't believe you're all grown up now.

391
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,784
Are you visiting Korea
for a short while? A vacation?

392
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,701
What?

393
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,037
I heard you work at Greip.

394
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,663
Yeah…

395
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,250
I was so happy when I heard that.

396
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,668
And I wasn't the only one.

397
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,879
All the teachers still talk about you.

398
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,547
You were so capable and smart.

399
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,258
A renowned figure of Hyereung High School.

400
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,388
Look, another renowned figure
of Hyereung High School.

401
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,850
What?

402
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:25,237
You applied for the gym remodeling
and new building design competition?

403
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,490
Yeah, today's the site briefing
for the participating companies.

404
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,284
I had my doubts
when I saw a familiar name on the list.

405
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,247
This is great.
It would mean so much if you did it.

406
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,666
Ms. Yu.

407
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:42,003
Doesn't that mean he shouldn't
be sitting here with you right now?

408
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,089
He technically has academic ties.

409
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,382
It violates fairness.

410
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,843
You haven't changed.

411
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:52,264
Experts from the education department
will do the evaluations.

412
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,765
I have no authority.

413
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,725
Nice try.

414
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,435
Rats.

415
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,230
It's been so long.
Are you free this afternoon?

416
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,731
Of course.

417
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,649
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,027
I missed a few things
from the site visit earlier.

419
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,737
I need to look more thoroughly.

420
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,074
Is that so? That's too bad.
I'll have to ask Seok-ryu then.

421
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,160
Since you're here, talk to the students.

422
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,203
A chat with an alumnus.

423
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,123
Excuse me? Me?

424
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,084
I think you'll set a good example.

425
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,629
I bet the students will be excited
to hear you work at Greip.

426
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,424
But I…

427
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,384
I'll get going then.

428
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,429
Okay, I know you're busy. Thanks.
I'll wish you luck.

429
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,346
Thank you.

430
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,141
Are you okay with meeting the students?

431
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,351
Sure.

432
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,983
This is Bae Seok-ryu.
She's a graduate of our school.

433
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,152
She works at Greip in the US.

434
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,196
-Greip?
-That's cool!

435
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,490
I hope her energy rubs off on you.

436
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,701
This old boomer will leave,
so talk freely.

437
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,119
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

438
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,329
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

439
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,211
Hello, I'm Bae Seok-ryu.

440
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,925
This was actually came together
very suddenly,

441
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,801
so I didn't prepare anything.

442
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,263
You can ask me questions if you want.
I'll answer them.

443
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,973
What college did you go to?

444
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,977
I was accepted to Hanguk University
after I graduated.

445
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,980
After attending for a year,
I studied abroad in the US.

446
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,400
I enrolled at UC Berkkeley and graduated.

447
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,237
Does that mean your family's rich?

448
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,447
Not at all.

449
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,783
A friend was preparing to study abroad.

450
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,911
I wanted to study English, too,
so we prepared together.

451
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,496
After I was accepted,

452
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,499
I received a scholarship for four years.
That's how I went.

453
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,834
-That's nuts.
-Wow.

454
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,961
-Wait…
-Yes?

455
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,545
What do you do at Greip?

456
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,881
It's called a product manager.

457
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,426
I'm responsible for overseeing
and managing projects

458
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,263
from their planning stage
to the end result.

459
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:01,184
Was being a product manager
always your dream?

460
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,022
I don't know. I don't think so.

461
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,649
Then, what was your dream?

462
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,859
-My dream?
-Yes.

463
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,113
When you were in high school,
what did you want to be?

464
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,445
Hey, Seok-ryu.

465
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,199
There you go ignoring me again.
Have you had lunch?

466
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,785
Don't talk to me. I want peace and quiet.

467
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,370
Then, quietly come with me.

468
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,955
Later.

469
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,790
We have to go now.

470
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,834
Says who? I don't want to go.

471
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,545
Come with me!

472
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,757
Are you insane?
How dare you grab a woman by the neck?

473
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,467
How could you be so thoughtless?

474
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,344
Speak for yourself. Are you insane?

475
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,095
You're no woman.

476
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,805
Of course, I'm a woman.

477
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,099
Am I a man? What am I then?

478
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,934
You are…

479
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,562
almost gender neutral.

480
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,022
Do you want to die today?

481
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,359
-You want to be buried behind the school?
-Let's go then.

482
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,487
-What?
-Let's go.

483
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,953
I'm sure it was around here.

484
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,748
You've been saying that for 30 minutes.

485
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
Why are we looking for this?

486
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,505
We agreed to take it out after ten years.
It's way past that deadline.

487
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,298
I know.

488
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,176
We forgot about that time capsule.
What's so important about it?

489
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,221
I don't even remember what I put in there.

490
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,473
Hey, you're the one who wanted to do it.

491
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:07,394
I think it was a letter.
"A letter to me in ten years."

492
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:11,773
I must've been crazy.
That millennial sentiment is awful.

493
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,152
Forget it. Don't look for it.
Let's keep it deep in there.

494
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,823
Let's hope it's found a billion years
from now like a dinosaur egg!

495
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,491
No, it'd still be embarrassing.

496
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,036
The Seok-ryu I know would let curiosity
overcome her embarrassment.

497
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,580
Aren't you curious about it?

498
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,501
I'm sure it's full
of dazzling and innocent words.

499
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:36,256
But so what? The reality is
we're just digging really hard.

500
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,343
Hey, anyone can tell
that you're digging half-heartedly.

501
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,014
It was around here.

502
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,476
Why did you do that earlier?

503
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,186
Do what?

504
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,689
I acted like I still worked at Greip.

505
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,942
Why did you play dumb too?

506
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,902
I shamelessly gave a lecture too.

507
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,654
You did work at Greip.

508
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,781
Was that a sham too?

509
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,366
Shut up.

510
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,328
That's good enough.
Your experience there was real.

511
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,665
I think that's enough
to give the kids good advice.

512
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,551
Why won't this dirt come off?

513
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,804
Stop pretending to be clean.
Just wash it off later.

514
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,598
I want to go home.

515
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,392
Hey, let's dig a little more.
I have a good feeling.

516
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,228
We're almost there.
I think it was between these trees.

517
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,521
You look for it.

518
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,690
Are you really going?

519
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,776
Seok-ryu!

520
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,404
Damn. I'm sure it was between these trees.

521
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,703
Seok-ryu, wait for me.

522
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,538
We were almost there.

523
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,749
Hey, Seok-ryu!

524
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,133
I'm home.

525
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,010
Hey!

526
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,139
What's all of this?

527
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,391
Gift boxes.

528
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:15,104
It's the neighbor's side job,
I asked for some.

529
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,398
Why would you do this?

530
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,235
What's wrong with your hand?
What's with the pain relief patch?

531
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,404
I think it was all the kimbap.
My wrist hurts.

532
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,573
I said I'd help.

533
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,618
You help by doing nothing,
you little brat.

534
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,079
I can put 100 more of these patches on.

535
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,207
I hope I can sell 1,000
or 10,000 more kimbap.

536
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,668
-Give it. I'll do it.
-Why would you do this?

537
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,837
This is my work.

538
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,965
Don't interfere with my pocket money.
Go do your work.

539
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,676
Hey, Dong-jin!

540
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,636
She's going nuts again.

541
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,888
You could've helped Mom
if you were at home!

542
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,307
What do you do all day in your room?

543
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,392
What's with you?

544
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,936
I went to work today
and came for my stuff.

545
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,063
-Mom!
-Yeah?

546
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,690
I have a private lesson. I'll be late.

547
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,899
Okay, have a good one.

548
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,442
-I'm off.
-Bye.

549
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,365
Dong-jin has his act together lately.

550
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,578
I didn't think
he'd do anything with his life.

551
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,872
He's living like a human being now.

552
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,457
It's a part-time job, but he gets paid.

553
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,253
The gym owner's helping him
become a personal trainer or whatever.

554
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,254
And he's exercising.

555
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,383
That's good.

556
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,491
Can I really keep doing this?

557
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,873
Aren't you going home?

558
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,666
A little later.

559
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,209
What are you doing?

560
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,130
Is this where you used to swim?

561
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,256
Yeah.

562
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,758
It is pretty old.

563
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,177
Is it still used today?

564
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,804
Sometimes, during PE class.

565
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:17,852
Take it easy. You know public facilities
don't make money and are full of red tape.

566
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:22,231
Tomorrow's client meeting
is what's important to us right now.

567
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,484
They're both important.

568
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,280
It may seem like you have a reputation
and we're doing well on the outside,

569
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,575
but you know this industry
isn't that easy.

570
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,911
A slight downturn
can even affect major corporations.

571
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:36,996
I know.

572
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,585
So turn off the pool,
and turn on the retirement community.

573
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,922
Are you pressuring me?

574
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,549
No, suggesting.

575
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,304
Also, our interview article for
The Chungwoo Daily was published.

576
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,889
It'll be in the paper tomorrow. Bye.

577
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,099
Bye.

578
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,444

SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS

581
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,162
You scared me.

582
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,456
Why are you standing there?

583
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,877
This is why there are so many
strange rumors about you at work.

584
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,297
They say you have spiritual energy
or a third eye on your forehead.

585
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,759
They say I have a third eye
and can read people's minds.

586
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,555
I'm just farsighted due to old age.

587
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,767
How's the article? Do you hate it?

588
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,519
It's not bad.

589
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,771
The concept's good
and the content's clear.

590
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,441
So why doesn't it sound like a compliment?

591
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,236
You're getting sluggish.

592
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,031
Your writing shows
that there was no legwork.

593
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,991
Kang Dan-ho.

594
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,370
I thought you were a madman
when you first joined the company.

595
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,123
When you went around police stations,

596
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,460
you'd pack a backpack
and wouldn't come home for months.

597
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,880
So what? Am I too focused
on maintaining a work-life balance now?

598
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,257
I get it. I really do.

599
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,634
Let's be more proactive.

600
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,887
I'll keep that in mind.

601
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,683
-Are you putting it into action now?
-No, I'm going to buy rice cakes.

602
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,483
Not bad.

603
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,905
-Where's the patient?
-Over there.

604
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,083
When did his seizure start?

605
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,085
About ten to 15 minutes ago.

606
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,088
Do-hyeon suffers from status seizures.

607
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,006
Let's move him. Mo-eum, sit up front.

608
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,174
Okay.

609
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,634
Just a second.

610
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,351
What do we do? The road is blocked.

611
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,979
We're transporting an emergency patient.

612
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,399
We're transporting an emergency patient.
Please cooperate.

613
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,402
A seizure over 20 minutes is dangerous.

614
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,947
Why aren't we moving?

615
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,575
We have a sick kid. Please, move.

616
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,956
What's that person doing?

617
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,335
I think he's trying to clear a path!

618
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,379
What?

619
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,339
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

620
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,799
MUDFLAT GUARDIAN

621
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,776
Okay, that's good.

622
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,294
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

623
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:31,105
A lot of retirement communities
have been popping up lately,

624
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,566
but the quality varies widely, doesn't it?

625
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:37,486
Thus, our cheapest unit will start
at two billion won for the deposit.

626
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,031
We plan to build
a luxurious retirement community.

627
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:44,744
The facility will be designed exclusively
for the top 1% of the senior population.

628
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:49,540
It'll be as beautiful as a landmark since
it'll be located in the heart of Seoul.

629
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,918
It'll be a place that not just anyone
can have access to

630
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,169
or even look at.

631
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,214
For example, the elderly
who ride the subway for free.

632
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,258
I love the subway.

633
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,344
I drove my car today,

634
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,804
but I ride it often
when I have to travel a lot.

635
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,514
I'll enjoy it in the future too.

636
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,018
I'm in favor of welfare policies
that provide transportation benefits

637
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,228
to the elderly.

638
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,898
That's great.

639
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,819
We weren't trying to be demeaning.

640
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,446
It was just a comparison.

641
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,198
-Yes, of course.
-Right.

642
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,785
But if it's going to be at a level
where people can't even look at it,

643
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,037
how high are you planning to build it?

644
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,956
People's necks will hurt.

645
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,709
Well, what Mr. Choi is trying to say

646
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,713
is what kind of concept
are you looking for?

647
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,592
Are you thinking of something
luxurious and extravagant?

648
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,763
Yes, that's why we prepared some drafts.

649
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,975
I'd like to mix in some of these designs.

650
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,601
Excuse me?

651
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,562
As you can see, these are works
by renowned international designers.

652
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,858
Our potential clients have spent
a lot of time overseas before.

653
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,486
Their tastes and standards are quite high.

654
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,407
So, ordinary domestic designs
won't be able to satisfy them.

655
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,867
So you're saying…

656
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,787
you don't trust our capabilities

657
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,915
and want us to replicate
verified designs, right?

658
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,583
Is that what you're requesting?

659
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,002
Excuse me, Mr. Choi?

660
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,086
It's an homage.

661
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,422
All artistic creation
is a form of imitation.

662
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,132
Nothing's ever really new.

663
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,010
No, this is clearly plagiarism.

664
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,512
You don't have to worry about that.

665
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,639
Everyone cries about plagiarism lately.

666
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,727
But when it's debated in court,
it's difficult to enforce penalties.

667
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,522
I can't do this.

668
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,941
Don't try to talk me into it.

669
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,693
I'll never change my mind.

670
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,113
Just hear me out first. I have a plan too.

671
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,156
What plan?

672
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,283
First, we pretend to play along.

673
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,994
Then, we change the design as we proceed.

674
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,495
We offer a new design.

675
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,206
Come on. The dates and budget are all set.

676
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,792
They can't stop midway either.

677
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,712
We'll gradually make changes
and integrate our style.

678
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,755
Sounds good, right?

679
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,799
So you want to retouch
a plagiarized design!

680
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,594
Think of it as a reference.

681
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,720
Are you joking?

682
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,221
Myeong-u.

683
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,100
I know that architecture can't be done
without a client,

684
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,812
I can't work with people
who have that mindset.

685
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,737
With that kind of attitude,
we won't be able to do anything.

686
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,240
We'll have to deal with all sorts
of dirty, disgraceful things.

687
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,492
Is this how you'll act?

688
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,954
We built our office on a mountain of debt.
We have employees to take care of.

689
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,664
For their sake, I won't do it.

690
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,168
I want to preserve their pride
as architects.

691
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,671
You fool!
Do you know what they really need?

692
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,799
They don't need this abstract sentiment.

693
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,718
They need practical incentives.
Salary increases!

694
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,347
If we want to do that, we need money.

695
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,140
The company must do well.

696
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,936
So you want to sell your soul for money?

697
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,772
Is that really what's best
for our company?

698
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,190
Then, what about you?

699
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,275
Are you doing anything for the company?

700
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,112
You didn't care
about the retirement community!

701
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,489
-You're always looking at that pool!
-What?

702
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,451
A retirement community worth hundreds
of billions and a simple gym renovation!

703
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,578
One can't even compare with the other!

704
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,789
You brought personal feelings into work!

705
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,499
Myeong-u.

706
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,626
That damn pool reminded you of the past…

707
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,510
I mean… Look, Seung-hyo…

708
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,473
I'm heading out.

709
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,142
Wait…

710
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,818
Great job.

711
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,944
Great work.

712
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,779
Great work!

713
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,366
I'm glad Do-hyeon is doing better.

714
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,702
This is all thanks to you, Mr. Yeon.

715
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,246
It's my area of expertise.

716
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,458
When Se-yoon was first diagnosed
with epilepsy,

717
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,002
I thought my world was ending.

718
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:07,298
I guess it was a task given by the heavens
to turn us into better paramedics.

719
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,759
-Se-yoon's a gift from the heavens.
-Of course.

720
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,346
Who's the savior
that cleared the road for us?

721
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,140
-My ideal type.
-What?

722
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,852
I usually preferred people
who were like action stars.

723
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,812
But not anymore.

724
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,690
I like someone
who's stoic but full of drive.

725
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,358
The silent but determined type.

726
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,737
Wow. That's what's really sexy.

727
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,866
It's the first time she's describing
someone who's not Iron Man as sexy.

728
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,910
No, she said Spider-Man was sexy too.

729
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,661
The muscles through the tights…

730
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,206
What did it say on the back of his shirt?
Mud something?

731
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,290
"I love you, mudflats."

732
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,791
Yeah, that's right.

733
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:47,922
That means he's Mudflat Man.
Iron Man, Spider-Man, Mudflat Man.

734
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,174
Mudflat Man.

735
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,012
Did anyone see
Mudflat Man's license plate number?

736
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,224
Sorry. I should've checked.
Things were so hectic.

737
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:02,102
You should've checked.
How will I find him now?

738
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,648
Ms. Jung, this came for you.

739
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,275
I see. Thank you so much.

740
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,277
-What is this?
-What is it?

741
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,240
Rice cakes? I was getting hungry.

742
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,407
Can we eat some?

743
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,244
Just a second.
Let's see who sent them first.

744
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,328
Here it is.

745
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,038
-There's a card.
-There it is.

746
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:21,956
Okay.

747
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,166
Come on. Wait.

748
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,253
Thank you so much for last time.

749
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:32,258
I promised I'd reach out, didn't I?
Paramedic Jung Mo-eum.

750
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,926
What?

751
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,137
How did he know my name?

752
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,769
But why did he have to send rice cakes?
It's making me thirsty.

753
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,729
Give me some.

754
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,440
It's good.

755
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,987
Ms. Bae Seok-ryu?

756
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,449
-Hello.
-Hello.

757
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,369
It's nice to meet you. I'm Lee Jin-young.

758
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,788
-Thank you.
-Were you surprised by my call?

759
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,373
Not at all.

760
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,629
I could've come to meet you.
Thank you for coming to my neighborhood.

761
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,047
It was nothing.

762
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,175
I should come to meet someone
as esteemed as you.

763
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,346
But how did you get my number?

764
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,141
I've got a great radar.

765
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,686
I heard a talented person
came back to Korea,

766
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,146
so I started to ask around.

767
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,398
You flatter me. Thank you.

768
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,858
I mean it.

769
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,234
If you don't mind,

770
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,864
may I ask you why you quit Greip

771
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,240
and came back like this?

772
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:43,162
I had a personal reason to come home.

773
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,121
I see.

774
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,541
Then, how long did you work at Greip?

775
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,586
I joined the company in 2015,

776
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,464
and I officially quit last month.

777
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,174
So ten years?

778
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,845
No, I took a year off in the middle.

779
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:01,847
You did?

780
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,641
Yes, when I was 30.

781
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,392
Was that for personal reasons as well?

782
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,894
Yes.

783
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,188
Being 30 is like that.

784
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,149
I transferred jobs at that age.

785
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,361
Your career and portfolio
are very impressive.

786
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,154
I don't think it'll be a problem.

787
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,408
The position I want to offer
is at Serendipity…

788
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,139
Bae Seok-ryu.

789
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,810
Why are you dressed like that?

790
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:48,936
What's this?

791
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,730
Why do you keep showing up like this?

792
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,982
Because we live in the same neighborhood.

793
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,567
I'm not happy about it either.

794
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,444
Looks like we're on the same page.

795
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:58,987
Just be on your way.

796
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,281
Where are you going?

797
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,158
To wake up and smell the coffee.

798
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,505
How have you become
even more carefree?

799
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,673
You sure are bold.

800
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,259
-Want some?
-You drank from that.

801
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,094
-At least rinse it.
-You think I'm dirty?

802
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,679
You don't look clean.

803
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,888
-Come on.
-Sorry.

804
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:25,889
Seriously?

805
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,600
-Did you spray water on me?
-No, my hand slipped.

806
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,394
Just you wait.

807
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,355
To spray on me?
Our country has a water shortage.

808
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,233
This is for the Earth.

809
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,200
Where are you going now?

810
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,208
Why are you so unpredictable in everything
that you do?

811
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,920
I've lost muscle mass
lying around all day.

812
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,130
I have to regain it.

813
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,132
Do you have any muscle mass to lose?

814
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,259
You also never dress right
for any occasion.

815
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,136
It was right until now.

816
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,971
I met with a job recruiter earlier.

817
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,892
-Why?
-I don't know.

818
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,269
I don't know how she got my number.

819
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,230
But you know how capable
and talented I am.

820
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,566
What did she say?

821
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,276
She offered me a few positions.

822
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,653
GLO Korea and Serendipity.

823
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,615
The conditions were pretty good.

824
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,452
It's not as much as before,
but the pay is decent too.

825
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:29,995
Really?

826
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,122
It's similar to the work I did before.

827
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,082
I'll adjust quickly.

828
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,792
Great, right?

829
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,420
Do you want to do it?

830
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,424
-What?
-You want to do that kind of work again?

831
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,010
Work is just work.

832
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,554
-Does it matter if I want to do it or not?
-That's not right.

833
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,098
It's your work,
so you should do what you want.

834
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,519
How can people only do
what they want to do?

835
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,645
Why not?

836
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,314
Why does everyone compromise with reality?

837
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,360
You said you overheated and shut down.

838
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,571
-You said you wanted to reboot.
-Yeah, but…

839
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,199
This is the courage you mustered?
Returning to your old life?

840
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:11,370
-So what if I do? What's it to you?
-You think I don't know you?

841
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,164
When you want to do something,
your eyes light up

842
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,209
and stomp with excitement,
but I don't see any of that now.

843
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,587
Do I still look like a teenager to you?

844
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,006
Don't act like you know me
because we were friends as kids.

845
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,842
I just wish you'd find your real dream.

846
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,761
Dream? Hey! Dreams?

847
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,846
Do you think dreams can just be had?

848
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,016
Only those who have the luxury
to search for them can dream.

849
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,020
Those who get the chance to rise again
after failure can pursue their dreams.

850
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,357
You wouldn't know. You've always lived
in a Mediterranean climate.

851
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,736
A clear, mild, and perfect environment.

852
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,157
Me? Warmth is only momentary.
I'm stuck in Siberia most of the time.

853
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,203
The winds are biting cold.
It snows, rains, and hails.

854
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,955
-Do you know what that's like?
-I do know.

855
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,709
I've had winters like that too.

856
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,009
I thought you'd remember.

857
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,342
You scared me.

858
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,762
-Why are you here?
-I was waiting for you.

859
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,764
Are you in puberty?
What's with your voice?

860
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,600
It's your first day on the national team.
I'll let it slide.

861
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,605
What are you doing?
Did you do something weird again?

862
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,023
It's a gift.

863
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,321
This towel's a gift?

864
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,489
Yeah, open it up.

865
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,494
CHOI SEUNG-HYO, 2008 BEIJING OLYMPICS
GO FOR GOLD

866
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,497
Are you joking?

867
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,414
Isn't it cool?

868
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,458
I asked them to embroider it like that.

869
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,919
-Take it with you.
-No, it's embarrassing.

870
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,087
What if someone sees?

871
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,592
Fine, I'll take it. Okay?

872
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,638
Take care of yourself.
Bring honor to your country.

873
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,765
It's not like I'm going
to the Olympics tomorrow.

874
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,685
Good luck! You got this!

875
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,270
Good luck!

876
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,608
You can do it!

877
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,568
WE'LL REPAY YOUR SUPPORT WITH MEDALS

878
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,575
We bring you some unfortunate news.

879
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:40,704
Choi Seung-hyo, who secured his ticket
to the Olympics after winning

880
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,873
the 2007 National Swimming Championships,

881
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,291
has been involved in an accident.

882
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,710
-Seung-hyo's okay.
-Seung-hyo…

883
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:49,880
Seung-hyo…

884
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,299
It's okay.

885
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,761
It's okay. It'll be okay.

886
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,557
It's okay, all right?

887
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,814
With rehabilitation,
you'll be able to walk again.

888
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,901
But I don't think
you'll be able to continue…

889
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,323
your career as an athlete.

890
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,047
I do know.

891
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,759
I've had winters like that too.

892
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,388
I thought you'd remember.

893
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,901
I left my phone in my office.

894
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,039
I heard you two fought.

895
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,583
Mr. Yoon told me.

896
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:36,129
Why would he tell you about that?

897
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,423
I have some talent in counseling.

898
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,718
I've heard both sides.

899
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,762
I think you're right.

900
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,641
Covert plagiarism? That's so insulting!

901
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,601
Moreover, a person should look ahead.

902
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,479
We're going to succeed in the future.

903
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,439
We can't have plagiarism issues
bring us down.

904
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,776
-Are you taking my side?
-You should let me finish.

905
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,528
However, Mr. Yoon's right too.

906
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:05,200
I want to work nine-to-five
and get paid well.

907
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,619
To do that, the company must do well.

908
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,746
We have to hire more people too.

909
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,750
Due to the nature of architecture,
we're always beholden to the client.

910
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,671
But you don't know how to do that.

911
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,589
Maybe you're too content.

912
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,594
I heard something similar yesterday.

913
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,388
Whoever they are, they were right.

914
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,556
-You know it's true.
-What?

915
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,016
Seung-hyo,

916
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,101
you're marvelous.

917
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,979
You speak beautifully like poetry.

918
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,731
You're an idealist
who loves dreams more than reality.

919
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,443
You're always so full of pride.

920
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,863
But do you know
where all of that comes from?

921
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,992
It comes from privilege.

922
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,369
Hey! Dreams?

923
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,414
Do you think dreams can just be had?

924
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,333
Only those who have the luxury
to search for them can dream.

925
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:59,713
Those who get the chance to rise again
after failure can pursue their dreams.

926
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:05,969
So in conclusion, for the development
and glory of Atelier In,

927
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,972
I hope you two CEOs
can work together beautifully.

928
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,433
Just so you know,

929
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,935
Mr. Yoon stood outside
your door for a long time.

930
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,775
-You're a great counselor.
-I know.

931
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,665
Come in.

932
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:44,549
It looked like you didn't take your coffee
because of me earlier.

933
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,220
Yeah, thanks.

934
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,682
I'm sorry about yesterday.

935
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,143
I put you in a tough spot.

936
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,395
No, it's fine.

937
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:02,358
I know it was a bad call,
but I pretended otherwise.

938
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,236
I'm so ashamed.

939
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,449
Stop it. What are you saying?

940
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,411
I was being selfish for personal reasons.
You were right.

941
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,498
I wanted to work on the pool more.

942
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,836
I thought it was my chance
to turn the page there.

943
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:26,716
I get it, and I gave it some thought.

944
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,387
I thought about how you must've felt
when you quit swimming.

945
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,599
I can't even imagine.

946
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,564
Na-yun just told me…

947
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,984
we'd both fail
if we ran separate companies.

948
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,402
What?

949
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,739
Unless we want to starve,
she said we should stick together.

950
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,370
She really does say whatever she wants.

951
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,372
Millennials and Gen Z sure are different.

952
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,085
Look, you're great and all,

953
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,296
but don't talk about
millennials and Gen Z like that.

954
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,381
What?

955
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,467
Only old people do that.

956
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,844
The kids don't care.

957
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,180
So don't group them
as a generation like that.

958
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,723
So you don't like me?

959
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,184
You won't work with me?

960
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,894
I'll do it. Why wouldn't I?

961
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,814
Yeah, I knew you would.

962
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,482
You're too close.

963
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,151
-I can't work like this.
-Okay.

964
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,531
-I'm really sorry about yesterday.
-No, I'm sorry.

965
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,002
There you go!

966
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,898
Then, what was your dream?

967
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:06,900
My dream?

968
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:11,446
Yes. When you were in high school,
what did you want to be?

969
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,159
Now that I have to answer,
I don't really know.

970
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:22,081
Back then, just coming in first
in everything was my dream.

971
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,710
I wanted to be a daughter
my mom could be proud of.

972
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,087
I wanted my teachers to praise me.

973
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,715
I wanted everyone to recognize me.

974
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:35,720
Looking back now,
I feel a bit sorry for myself.

975
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,514
Why?

976
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,474
I cared about how others saw me,

977
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,895
and I don't think I paid attention
to myself.

978
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:54,072
THE RECRUITING TEAMS AT GLO KOREA
AND SERENDIPITY BOTH WANT INTERVIEWS

979
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,741
Is our family's knucklehead hero
finally up?

980
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,328
I'm hungry.

981
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,246
Are you hungry?

982
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,292
I just started the rice cooker.
It'll take some time.

983
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,836
Eat some rice cakes on the table.

984
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:50,753
What?

985
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,801
I've been eating rice cakes
so often lately.

986
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,219
Who are they from?

987
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,014
The new neighbor who just moved in.

988
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,601
Hey, I was the broker for that house.

989
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,687
It was on the market for ages
with no prospects.

990
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,148
I was so worried. Isn't it great?

991
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,318
Is it good?

992
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,527
It's good.

993
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,157
Is that you, Seok-ryu?

994
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,534
Ms. Yu?

995
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,331
It's a pear and bellflower tea.
It's good for your throat.

996
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,749
Thank you.

997
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,293
I'm sorry about earlier. Did I scare you?

998
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:18,841
It's okay. I'll stay cool for summer
with the chill you sent down my spine.

999
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,137
Speaking of which,
what were you looking for?

1000
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,556
A time capsule.

1001
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,767
I buried it with Seung-hyo and Mo-eum.

1002
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,019
You all did something that cute?

1003
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,480
But you couldn't find it.

1004
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,315
It's for the best.

1005
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,860
I thought I'd find the answers
if I saw it.

1006
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,446
I think it'll just confuse me more.

1007
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,323
What?

1008
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,408
Ms. Yu,

1009
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,743
I lied to you.

1010
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,247
I don't work at Greip anymore.

1011
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,250
I quit.

1012
01:01:53,543 --> 01:02:00,174
To be honest, I don't know if I quit
or got chased out.

1013
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,141
Seok-ryu, you've always done well.

1014
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,809
That's why I worried about you.

1015
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,397
What if you couldn't do something well?

1016
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,023
What would you do then?

1017
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,986
I don't think I taught you how to do that.

1018
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,865
But I realized something
after being a teacher for so long.

1019
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,617
Children keep growing.

1020
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,537
Even if I don't teach them,

1021
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,832
they all find the answers
on their own somehow.

1022
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,172
Was there an answer you thought about
when you quit?

1023
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,217
Then, don't change your mind.
Trust your choice and move on.

1024
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,053
Changing it always ends up wrong.

1025
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:47,972
You're right.

1026
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,976
Go to the pool when you're done.

1027
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,186
I think Seung-hyo's there.

1028
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,313
Okay.

1029
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,323
Hey, Choisseung!

1030
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,867
Did you find the time capsule?

1031
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,077
You scared me. What are you doing here?

1032
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,621
I should be asking you that.

1033
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:16,501
Hey, what's that in your hand?
Is that my letter?

1034
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,592
"To Bae Seok-ryu ten years from now."

1035
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:25,593
"Hi!"

1036
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,512
-"It's me. The best and most beautiful."
-Hey!

1037
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,388
-"Bae Seok-ryu!"
-Don't read that. Hey!

1038
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,474
-"What am I like in the future?"
-I'll kill you!

1039
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:34,602
"I'm imprisoned in a classroom
due to the crime of being a student."

1040
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,395
-Hey, don't run! You'll slip!
-No!

1041
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,232
-Don't read my letter!
-"My school uniform's a prison uniform."

1042
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,858
I was crazy. What did I write?

1043
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,069
-Hey!
-"I'm punished with school work."

1044
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,988
-"I'll be released with graduation."
-Give it!

1045
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,824
"The best and the first."

1046
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,867
-"Do you know they're similar?"
-Are you kidding?

1047
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,619
-"Do your best."
-Hey.

1048
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,162
"And you'll probably come in first."

1049
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,580
I told you to stop!

1050
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,499
We should've kept this buried.

1051
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:59,043
They'll put this in textbooks
if they find this later.

1052
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:02,463
A statement that will go down in history.
It's truly a gem!

1053
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,507
Gem, my foot! Give it to me.

1054
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,342
Give it to me!

1055
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:07,760
Are you crazy?

1056
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,098
Wow, that's low.

1057
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,768
Did you jump knowing I can't swim?

1058
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,478
Come in and take it from me then.

1059
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,522
No, I'm scared of the water.

1060
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,149
Did you know?

1061
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,485
After I quit swimming,

1062
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,988
this is my first time in a pool.

1063
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,784
Wow, why didn't I come in until now?

1064
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,077
It's so nice.

1065
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,874
Hey, I didn't mean what I said before--

1066
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:38,833
Do you remember?

1067
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,544
When I couldn't swim anymore

1068
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,422
and I was cooped up in my room?

1069
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,134
Choisseung, what are you doing?

1070
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,221
I brought some comics.
Let's read them together.

1071
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,974
Then, I'll make you some ramyeon instead.

1072
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,059
No eggs, just how you like it.

1073
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,606
What are you doing? Hey!

1074
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,858
Why are you pushing me?
I have to read that.

1075
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:08,154
Choisseung, at least give me my comics.

1076
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,585
Did you think I couldn't come in
if you locked your door?

1077
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,755
I knew the keys were
in the top shelf of the shoe cabinet!

1078
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,427
Okay, instead of ramyeon,
I'll buy you barbecue!

1079
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,512
I'll buy you meat! How does that sound?

1080
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,727
Hey! Wait! Hey!

1081
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:46,901
Hey! Do you think I'll give up like this?

1082
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,588
What are you doing?

1083
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,715
My gosh!

1084
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,802
-Seriously?
-You really scared me.

1085
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,345
What are you doing?

1086
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,513
Move over.

1087
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,847
Come on!

1088
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:17,807
Move out of the way.

1089
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:29,902
You're insane.

1090
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,656
Are you really laughing right now?

1091
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,700
Why would you climb up here like that?

1092
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,243
You almost died!

1093
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,454
Yeah, so why would you lock
your doors, you jerk?

1094
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,872
I almost died because of you.

1095
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,250
I just saved your life.
You're so ungrateful.

1096
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,293
You're such a lunatic.

1097
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,546
If I'm a lunatic, what are you? A bear?

1098
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:51,549
Did you think you'd turn into a human
after 100 years in your cave?

1099
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,885
You fossilized trilobite-looking fool.
You've regressed into a baby.

1100
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,804
A baby?

1101
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,973
You're the one who's like a Neanderthal.

1102
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,267
Do you lack the brain capacity?

1103
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:05,062
You can't distinguish between
what you can and can't do, can you?

1104
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:08,607
What is this smell?

1105
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,277
Is it mugwort and garlic? No.

1106
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,737
It smells like a lonely old man!

1107
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,030
I don't smell anything.

1108
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,949
Shut up and get lost.
Go back to where you came.

1109
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,703
If I get lost, are you going to stare
at the wall like a loser again?

1110
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,623
-Loser?
-Yeah, you *** *** loser.

1111
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,250
-Stop it.
-No.

1112
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,586
Dummy.
You're the biggest loser in the world.

1113
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:31,047
-Don't cuss.
-What are you going to do about it?

1114
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,507
Go *** and *** your dog bowl,
you ***.

1115
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,968
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to cuss!

1116
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,971
You *** *** loser.
You're so *** dim-witted.

1117
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,973
I told you not to cuss.

1118
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,434
What *** are you, five years old?

1119
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:44,393
You stupid ***…

1120
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,520
Damn it, I said stop!

1121
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:47,938
You think you're cool, don't you?

1122
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:50,107
You're *** frustrating and meek, you ***.

1123
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,234
Damn it, I already feel like ***.

1124
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,863
-Why are you here *** at me?
-You're the *** acting like a *** fool.

1125
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:58,074
I'm *** hurt and can't do anything.

1126
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,535
Why the hell are you yelling at me?
Do you even know how I feel?

1127
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,163
Do you even know what I'm going through?

1128
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,292
Do you feel better now?

1129
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,383
It's my first time hearing your voice
in a month.

1130
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,720
So what?

1131
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,769
Hey. Why do you have that in your bag?

1132
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,354
Lock your door again,

1133
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,773
and I'll break it down.

1134
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:43,536
Damn it.

1135
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,631
That's who you were.

1136
01:08:56,715 --> 01:09:01,137
A damn lunatic wielding an ax
at a bear who trapped himself in a cave.

1137
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,682
That's your identity.

1138
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,517
Stop cowering. It doesn't suit you.

1139
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,979
-You call that words of comfort?
-It means you stink.

1140
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:10,938
What?

1141
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:13,524
The old Seok-ryu was lively and energetic.

1142
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,735
But you're so bland now.

1143
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,071
You're no fun. You're boring.

1144
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,866
You'd better take that back.

1145
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,388
Hey!

1146
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,682
Hey…

1147
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:49,643
Hey…

1148
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,687
Wait! Hey!

1149
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,692
Help me!

1150
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,112
Help me!

1151
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,240
I got you! You won't die. It's okay.

1152
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:06,827
Damn it!

1153
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:11,248
Why would you jump in if you can't swim?

1154
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,792
Why would you piss me off like that?

1155
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,836
-Do you know why you're sinking?
-No!

1156
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,382
It's because your body's tense!
Relax a little! Relax!

1157
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,928
I can't relax when I get a shot
at the doctor's! How do I do it now?

1158
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:26,680
Wait, just… Yeah.
Pretend you're a jellyfish.

1159
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,058
Sway your limbs.
Yeah, just let the water take you.

1160
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,019
-Sway? Like this?
-Yeah.

1161
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,854
There you go. Like that.

1162
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:37,733
What? I think pretending
to be a jellyfish is working.

1163
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,818
-It's working. Yeah.
-It's working.

1164
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:43,155
It's not working! It's not!
It's not working!

1165
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,324
My head!

1166
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,785
Hey! I drank some water!

1167
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:51,205
Don't grab my hair. Please.

1168
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,797
Am I really floating right now?

1169
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:03,801
This is so cool! Wow. I feel so strange.

1170
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,763
Do you want to keep talking
even in this moment?

1171
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,974
Feel the stillness in the water.

1172
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,313
Hey, Choisseung?

1173
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,107
What?

1174
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:20,359
I was actually nervous.

1175
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,363
I wanted to quit because I was exhausted.

1176
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:27,491
I wanted to rest and dream of a new life.

1177
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,410
But…

1178
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:35,124
I felt like nothing
without my Greip background.

1179
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,712
Everyone is moving forward,

1180
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,048
but I'm the only one who's stopped.

1181
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:46,593
That's how I felt after I quit swimming.

1182
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,930
The start signal had sounded,

1183
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,018
but I felt like I was standing alone
at the starting line.

1184
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:56,854
I thought,

1185
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:03,986
"It's going to be hard to find a place
where I can swim freely again."

1186
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,739
But you found it.

1187
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:07,823
I know.

1188
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,743
I found it, so why can't you?

1189
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,789
I hated going into bathwater,
but I'm able to jump back in again.

1190
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,500
You think so?

1191
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,879
Can I swim somewhere new too?

1192
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:23,922
Of course.

1193
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:27,634
Hey, I'm just curious.

1194
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,347
Hypothetically.

1195
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:36,018
Let's say you could swim again.

1196
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:38,937
If that were to happen,

1197
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,274
would you still be an architect?

1198
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,903
Yeah.

1199
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:47,905
-Really?
-Of course.

1200
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,532
What about you?

1201
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,242
-What?
-Hypothetically.

1202
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:54,912
Let's say you go back to before you quit.

1203
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,332
If you can go back to Greip,

1204
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,250
will you go back?

1205
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,545
No.

1206
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,630
One more.

1207
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,591
Hypothetically.

1208
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,678
Let's say you go back to before
your engagement was broken,

1209
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,681
what would you do?

1210
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,479
No. I wouldn't go back.

1211
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,694
Okay, then.

1212
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,787
We'll write letters to our future selves
ten years from now.

1213
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:37,913
Okay.

1214
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,581
Do we have to?

1215
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:40,958
Shut up and write.

1216
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,336
Let's open it in ten years.

1217
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,507
If anyone opens it before then,
they'll have bad luck for 1,000 years!

1218
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,259
Pinky swear! No take backs!

1219
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,898
Hi, Bae Seok-ryu ten years from now.

1220
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,734
It's me. The best and most beautiful.
Bae Seok-ryu!

1221
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,905
What if I can shoot webs
with the advancement of technology?

1222
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:15,242
There's a rumor you climb on the ceilings.

1223
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,318
Ten years from now feels so far away.

1224
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,947
By then, you probably told Seok-ryu
how you felt, right?

1225
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:12,090
STOP LINE

1226
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:17,179
STARTING LINE

1227
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,172
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1228
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,758
But still, how could I
leave evidence like that?

1229
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:56,843
Those feelings have long since expired.

1230
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,804
You finally opened it after all this time?

1231
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,056
I dug it up that night. I was curious.

1232
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,351
Greip contacted us!

1233
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,521
I moved here recently.
It's so nice to run into you.

1234
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:08,605
Really?

1235
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,524
It's the reporter again.

1236
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:12,276
Have our tastes overlapped again?

1237
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,695
No matter how hard you try,

1238
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:15,988
it's a waste of time.

1239
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,490
Don't talk about my hard work like that.

1240
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,575
Seok-ryu?

1241
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:22,578
Seung-hyo!

1242
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,288
What the hell did you just say?

1243
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:30,460
