1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,191
-Did the finishing materials arrive today?
-Yes, the insulation materials came in.

3
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,109
We're installing them now.

4
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,904
-I'll check it since I'm here.
-Sure.

5
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,869
SEOK-RYU

6
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,089
They say those who survive
near-death experiences

7
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,550
often have similar experiences.

8
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,720
Hi, what's your name?

9
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,223
In that fleeting moment,

10
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,559
their life flashes before their eyes.

11
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,480
It happened to me too.

12
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,066
You did great!

13
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,442
Great job!

14
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,236
You can have this.

15
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,823
Lock your door again,

16
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,783
and I'll break it down.

17
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,923
-Seok-ryu?
-Choisseung?

18
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,353
My gosh!

19
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,272
I…

20
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,485
like you.

21
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,536
You're being too hasty.
You could get really hurt.

22
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,204
Grab my hand, and let's go slow.

23
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,008
And…

24
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,302
in every scene in my life,

25
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,429
Seok-ryu was there.

26
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,128
A stone finish?

27
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,965
That's like a solid piece of rock!

28
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,594
A second later,
and you would've been really hurt.

29
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,224
Now that I think about it,
your surroundings aren't safe at all.

30
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,559
Rebar, brick, glass, and nails.

31
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,061
It's too dangerous.

32
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,314
Do you have to keep being an architect?

33
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,403
I'm sure you do. You love it,
so how could you quit?

34
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,909
Still, be careful. Wear your helmet
and put on some armor or something.

35
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,037
Jeez, it's making me so worried.

36
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,043
Why aren't you coming? What are you doing?

37
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,129
-You got third place.
-What?

38
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,007
You won an award
for a cooking competition.

39
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,467
What are you talking about?

40
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,678
I never entered a contest,
so how could I win?

41
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,806
I entered for you.

42
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,059
HEALTHY RECIPE CONTEST

43
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,144
Mr. Choi?

44
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,403
We normally don't allow takeout,
but I made an exception for you.

45
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,405
To whoever it is, deliver it quick.

46
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,489
Thank you.

47
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,367
But what's this poster?

48
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,787
We run cooking classes here too.

49
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,789
I posted it for our students.

50
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,000
Today's the last day,
so I was going to take it down.

51
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,799
HEALTHY RECIPE CONTEST

52
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,433
INSTRUCTIONS

53
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,226
FIRST, PAT THE CHICKEN BREAST DRY

54
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,028
SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE

55
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,612
BAE SEOK-RYU

56
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,657
So what do you plan on making?

57
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,409
Broccoli and chicken risotto!

58
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,122
BROC-CAULIFLOWER AND CHICKEN RISOTTO

59
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,965
I'm sorry I entered it
without your permission.

60
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,343
So I won an award?

61
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,220
Yeah, you came in third.

62
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,347
Show me.

63
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,561
THIRD PLACE
BAE SEOK-RYU

64
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,819
It was held
by the Korean Vegetable Association.

65
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,404
It's a small contest.

66
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,406
Anyone could enter online.

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,868
I just thought your food was so good,
so I thought it wouldn't hurt.

68
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,119
This is so annoying.

69
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,622
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

70
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,458
I'm so happy that I'm annoyed.

71
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,002
What?

72
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,464
I've come in first
for so many things before.

73
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,426
But I've never been so happy
to place third in this random contest.

74
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,136
Really? Seriously?

75
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,387
Yeah.

76
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,475
I want to cook so badly,

77
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,812
but no one will take me,
and I have no place to go.

78
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,524
I said I wouldn't care
about what others thought,

79
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,068
but it was hard to do.

80
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,906
I thought, "Why am I like this?"
And I was feeling hopeless.

81
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,828
But this feels like the heavens
have given me permission to keep trying.

82
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,122
That's a relief.

83
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,959
I thought you'd check to see
who came in first and second first.

84
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,378
Who was first? Let me see.
What's their dish?

85
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,590
"Lee Su-a. Spring root vegetables
and five-grain nutritious rice."

86
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,719
It's not that innovative or anything.

87
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,637
SWEET LOVE

88
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,889
It's kind of traditional.
Let me see again.

89
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,183
You sure you're happy
about coming in third?

90
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,313
You scared me.

91
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,400
Why are you standing here like this?

92
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,944
Mr. Kang is off-limits.

93
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,576
Hey, if you're going to date him,
do it after I die, okay?

94
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,036
And just so you know,
I'm going to live until I'm 100.

95
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,539
Then, we'll be over 70.

96
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,957
"We"?

97
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,460
Did you just say "we"?

98
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,586
Mom!

99
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,423
If you want to live a long life,
stop eating stuff like this.

100
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,967
This is all because of you!

101
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,721
I can't take it out on you,
so I'm eating my stress instead!

102
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,722
Yes, all right.

103
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,056
-Hey.
-Okay.

104
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,141
-Hey!
-Yes, I understand.

105
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,060
Hey, can't you hear what I'm saying?

106
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,565
Hey! You can never date him!
I don't care if the sky falls!

107
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,025
Don't you even dream about it!

108
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,031
Even with a smooth path in life,
it's full of hardship.

109
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,202
Why would you bear kindling
and walk straight into the fire?

110
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,833
Mrs. Do!

111
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,506
Mrs. Do, I ate the snacks
you gave me yesterday

112
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,132
and brushed my teeth really well.

113
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,093
-Really?
-Yes.

114
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,804
And I smiled a lot.

115
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,891
I smiled at my friends and my teacher.

116
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,268
I smiled at my dad too.

117
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,523
I'm sure the bugs
making me sad are gone now.

118
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,944
You'll be late for school.
You should go, Yeon-du.

119
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,992
Yeon-du, let's go.

120
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,495
Let's go.

121
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,664
And we're off.

122
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,644
I know she's too good for me.

123
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,396
I know you'll worry too.

124
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,648
So I tried all I could
to cut ties with her…

125
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,442
but I don't think I can anymore.

126
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,862
Dan-ho.

127
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,743
Hey, go inside.

128
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,329
Why? Why are you locking me in? Wait!

129
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,415
-Dan-ho!
-Please go inside.

130
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,458
I think that'll be best for tonight.

131
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,087
You said you'd take me.

132
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
You said you couldn't quit me.

133
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,301
Okay?

134
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,635
-Go inside.
-Wait.

135
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,762
You said it yourself!

136
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,390
Go inside! Now!

137
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,274
I'm sorry for startling you.

138
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,568
I'll explain how everything happened--

139
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,320
I don't want to know.

140
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
-Sorry?
-I don't need to know.

141
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,200
And it won't change anything
if I did know.

142
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,913
Mo-eum has always been like this
since she was a kid.

143
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,583
She can't ignore anything
that looks pitiful.

144
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,212
If she was on her way to buy toys

145
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,381
and saw an old lady
in the street selling vegetables,

146
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,760
she'd buy all her vegetables instead.

147
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,805
Community Chest. Christmas seals.

148
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,018
She'd spend all her money
on those things for her class.

149
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,854
That's probably the reason.

150
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,981
She loves Yeon-du.

151
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,984
And she pitied seeing you
raise a child alone.

152
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:58,115
So shouldn't you have tried
to keep your composure?

153
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,827
Just because she acts that way
doesn't mean you should go along with her.

154
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,204
You have a child.

155
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,166
-Mother--
-Don't call me that!

156
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,921
I'll pretend I didn't hear
what you just said.

157
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,218
I hope we don't have any more
embarrassing moments as neighbors.

158
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,193
It's all set. Go!

159
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,739
It's hot, isn't it?

160
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,160
Why did you have to come in the summer?

161
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,745
I know, right?

162
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,665
So, how's the work?

163
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,252
I guess it's tough enough yet.

164
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,505
I thought it'd take my mind off it.

165
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,506
What?

166
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,968
Nothing. Another truck is coming in.

167
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,845
Gosh, they don't give us
a chance to breathe.

168
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,847
Hey, go to the back!

169
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,476
Here, take it. Your award.

170
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,312
Gosh, this is heavier
than I thought it'd be.

171
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,440
That's what the weight of an award is.

172
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,234
Is your hand okay though?
How long do you need the cast for?

173
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,904
I can take it off now. I just tweaked it.

174
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,824
That's a relief.
This hand has so many things to do.

175
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,368
What are you doing?

176
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,414
Maybe it was winning the award,
but we're getting tons of requests.

177
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,874
We're going to get super busy.

178
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,460
That's not good.
I wanted to decrease my workload.

179
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,629
What are you saying?
We need to strike while the iron's hot.

180
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,631
We're going to soar to the top.

181
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,385
-I'm going to get married.
-What? What did you say?

182
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm going to get married.

183
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,763
Wait. With who?

184
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,974
-With Seok-ryu.
-Seok-ryu?

185
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,519
-Hey, your girlfriend was Seok-ryu?
-Act like you don't know.

186
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,772
Holy cow!
But how can this happen?

187
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,608
You're childhood friends.

188
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,151
You're like family.

189
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,612
-You can't do that.
-Myeong-u, be quiet and sit.

190
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,238
-I mean…
-Sit down.

191
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,407
Holy cow!

192
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,658
-So…
-Yeah?

193
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,869
-The thing is…
-Yeah?

194
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,205
Like this. Ta-da.

195
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,127
I have to propose.

196
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,630
Do you know any good ways to do it?
You have experience.

197
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,841
Seung-hyo, I'm a professional.

198
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,427
My goodness.
Do you want me to teach you?

199
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,221
-First off…
-Yeah?

200
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,890
Go to a basketball… No.
A baseball stadium.

201
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,935
Then, between innings,
you're bound to appear on the big screen.

202
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,230
That's when you get down on one knee
and take out the ring you prepared.

203
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,731
Then, she'll start to weep!

204
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,608
She doesn't like crowded places.

205
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,569
And taking her there
would be a difficult task in itself.

206
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,113
There's another way.

207
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,407
A performance. Take her to see a play.

208
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,994
Once the lights go down
and the curtain rises, you tell her.

209
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,664
"Will you marry me?
No, let's get married."

210
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,832
Then, she'll start to weep!

211
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,294
Do women really like that stuff?

212
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,547
It's no joke.

213
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,051
See? Even Na-yun's applauding the idea.

214
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,178
Millennials and Gen Z approve.

215
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,179
I see.

216
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,847
-Do it.
-See?

217
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,811
If you want to be rejected
on the spot, do it.

218
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,109
Your marriage proposal
is only important to you.

219
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,696
Unless you're paying for their tickets,
don't ruin the show for others.

220
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,407
I mean, it wasn't my idea.

221
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
Just remember these three things.

222
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,706
No audience, a decent ring,
and a heartfelt letter.

223
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,126
But wouldn't that be too ordinary?

224
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,420
What's the point
if only that day is special?

225
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,298
Just make every day
you spend with her special.

226
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,260
You're right.

227
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:47,970
Thanks.

228
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,805
I'm more grateful.

229
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,811
I used to draw but saw a house you built
and fell in love with it.

230
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,938
It's what brought me here.

231
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,984
It was admiration at first.
And then, it became love.

232
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,404
Everything got mixed together,
so I became confused.

233
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,949
But I've decided on admiration again.

234
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,243
Na-yun.

235
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,494
Be happy.

236
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,705
That's enough for me.

237
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,375
I will.

238
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,502
I promise.

239
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,795
HEALTHY RECIPE CONTEST WINNERS

240
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,675
"Third place.
Broc-cauliflower and chicken risotto."

241
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,054
"Bae Seok-ryu."

242
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,141
I told Dan-ho that I liked him.

243
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,392
What?

244
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,645
-But he rejected me.
-What?

245
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,272
Still, I held onto him.

246
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,273
Hey!

247
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,401
But in the end,
he admitted that he liked me too.

248
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
Then, the mutual agreement was settled.

249
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,574
It's a happy ending.

250
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,285
Wow, what a sudden whirlwind.

251
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,538
Why does your story have
so many twists and turns?

252
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,375
But he told me he liked me

253
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,418
right in front of my mom.

254
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,589
My friend, I apologize.

255
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,010
I was so caught up in my relationship
that I neglected you.

256
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:14,181
Yeah. You're so precious to me,
but I had no idea so much happened to you.

257
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,309
Seriously, I was too neglectful.

258
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,894
I'm really sorry. I regret it.

259
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,813
I'm the one who didn't tell you.

260
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,356
Get off your knees.

261
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,112
You must've had it so hard.

262
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,122
My feelings were like
sour, bitter, and salty flavors.

263
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:42,084
Sometimes, it was so spicy
I thought I had heartburn.

264
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,420
Is this what love is like?

265
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,797
It's complicated.

266
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,633
Just like the durian candy you like,

267
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,301
it stinks, but it tastes good too.

268
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,971
This is why I've avoided love until now.

269
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,473
But despite that, you fell in love.

270
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,434
I'm screwed.

271
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,687
You like Mudflat Man that much?

272
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,188
Well…

273
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,318
I don't know if I like him
for being Mudflat Man or for being Dan-ho.

274
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,115
Which came first? The chicken or the egg?
I don't know anymore.

275
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,118
What about you?

276
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,703
You like Seung-hyo that much?

277
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,580
Yeah, I do.

278
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,832
She likes him!

279
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,003
Hey! What am I going to do about my mom?

280
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,089
I'm burdened with the same issue.

281
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,259
My mom said she won't allow it
unless it's over her dead body.

282
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,471
My mom would probably
make me the dead body.

283
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,809
This is so annoying.

284
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,818
SEOK-RYU

285
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,903
What are you up to?

286
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,366
Hello, ma'am.

287
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,536
You're the one who helped
fix my wagon last time.

288
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,662
Yes, you remembered.

289
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,832
I usually forget everything at this age,

290
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,628
but I do remember those who help me
since I'm so grateful to them.

291
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,879
It was nothing.

292
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,675
It's the same
with that reporter over there.

293
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,638
Gosh.

294
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,312
Right.

295
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,271
Goodness.

296
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,699
Wow, that was like a beer commercial.

297
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,118
Do you want another?

298
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,912
No, one can is my limit.

299
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,330
I see.

300
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,250
It seems I've wasted my life though.

301
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,044
I had no idea beer tasted this good.

302
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,422
Alcohol always tastes the best
after a day of hard labor.

303
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,591
The best makgeolli I've ever had…

304
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,053
was after I volunteered
to build homes for those in need.

305
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,389
-You volunteered to build homes?
-Yes.

306
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,018
I've been volunteering since college,
and now, I go whenever I have time.

307
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,354
Do you know if that organization

308
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,439
also does repairs
for houses in shanty towns?

309
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,024
Shanty towns?

310
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,944
You know the alley of shacks
on the upper side of Hyereung-dong?

311
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,447
That's where the elderly woman
from earlier lives.

312
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,790
I went there myself, and the conditions
were far worse than I thought.

313
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,753
Are you free next week?

314
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,591
It's a bit tight,
but I'll try to prepare as much as I can.

315
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,051
You're going to do it yourself?

316
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,511
Yes.

317
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,805
No, this wasn't my intention.

318
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,765
I wanted to know
if there was a way to apply.

319
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,225
I know.

320
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,269
But still, it'd be quicker if I did it.

321
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,940
Even expressing my gratitude
makes me feel bad now.

322
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,943
Come on. What are friends for?

323
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,490
Right. We did agree to be friends,

324
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,951
even though we're still being formal.

325
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
We're respecting each other.

326
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,792
But you're Mo-eum's friend too.

327
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,835
Yes.

328
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,837
Mo-eum and I like each other.

329
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,174
What?

330
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,468
But her mother doesn't approve of us.

331
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,511
I see.

332
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,055
I…

333
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,808
don't know what to do.

334
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,185
I see.

335
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,234
SEOK-RYU

336
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,777
I'm with Mo-eum.

337
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,488
Wait.

338
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,701
Hey, that's… Did you drink it all?

339
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,204
You said one can was your limit.

340
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,041
-If you need more, I can buy you--
-No, this is enough.

341
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,675
I'm so upset I could die.
I don't want to go for a walk.

342
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,094
Nothing relieves stress
like going for a walk.

343
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,805
Let's sit here for a second.

344
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,889
Let's rest a bit.

345
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,641
What's wrong with you?

346
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,309
This looks like a comfortable spot.

347
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,187
-Goodness.
-Hey, try to look pretty.

348
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,357
I'm not drunk, but why do you
keep telling me to sober up?

349
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,152
That can of beer you drank
was over five percent alcohol.

350
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,197
We can walk and get closer too.

351
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,449
-Us?
-No. What?

352
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,910
-What?
-Yes.

353
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,079
-What's with you?
-Goodness!

354
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,374
I can't believe
we ran into each other like this!

355
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,750
What a coincidence!

356
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,294
You're right.

357
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,547
This neighborhood's so small, isn't it?

358
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,798
Yeah, seriously.

359
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,012
-Is that the best you can act?
-I'm not an entertainment reporter.

360
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,264
But that was terrible.

361
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,769
See? I told you it wouldn't work.

362
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,188
Whatever. I've set the table for you.

363
00:21:55,689 --> 00:22:00,610
So whether you can dance
or get married, you figure it out.

364
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,862
What?

365
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,821
Let's go.

366
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,031
Hey.

367
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,574
Good luck.

368
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,075
Let's go. Come on.

369
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,036
What in the…

370
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,455
What on earth?

371
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,167
Unbelievable.

372
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,463
-What are you doing?
-What?

373
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,758
Right.

374
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,936
-Have you been drinking?
-A little…

375
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,899
However, I'm very sober.

376
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,817
Me too.

377
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,361
I know I was really drunk that night,

378
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,363
but I remember everything.

379
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,533
So why didn't you call me?

380
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,619
Because of my mom?

381
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,122
I understand how she feels.

382
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,375
I would've said no too.

383
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,461
I know. Yeah.

384
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,507
I mean, who asks someone
to be their girlfriend,

385
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,050
which was…

386
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,303
practically a proposal,

387
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,722
by asking their mother?

388
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,891
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,228
I thought a head-on approach
would've been better than lying.

390
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,521
That's not what I meant.

391
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,026
You never told me you liked me.

392
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,153
You even rejected me
when I said I liked you.

393
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,156
But why did you say
those important words to my mom?

394
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,119
To make matters worse,
I'm the one who kissed you first--

395
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,721
Why did you stop?

396
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,848
I'm sorry.

397
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,474
After thinking about it,

398
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,226
I sweated a lot today.

399
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,520
Why does that matter now?

400
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,939
It didn't seem polite.

401
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,233
What you're doing right now isn't polite!

402
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,945
I like you.

403
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,074
After my family had that accident,

404
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,369
every day felt
like an emergency in my life.

405
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,957
But then, I heard a siren,
and a paramedic appeared.

406
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,252
She saved people.

407
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,671
And she helped Yeon-du.

408
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,090
That righteous woman saved me,

409
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,259
and I humbly admit I like her.

410
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,062
After hearing what you just said,

411
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,732
you really are a professional with words.

412
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,656
With the money I earn from my articles,

413
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,118
I'll buy you lots of good food.

414
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:06,463
You think you can handle it?
I… have a pretty big appetite.

415
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,346
I better write more articles then.

416
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,659
OUT OF THIS WORLD SNACK SHOP

417
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,285
Your takeout is ready. Enjoy.

418
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,621
Next is Seo Ji-yeong.

419
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,623
What the hell?

420
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,585
Did this place sprinkle gold
on their tteokbokki or something?

421
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,256
Why is the line so long
this early in the morning?

422
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,590
Number 57?

423
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,051
-Yes, that's me.
-Your takeout is ready.

424
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,552
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

425
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,014
What?

426
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,894
-Mi-suk?
-My gosh! Honey!

427
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,938
What's this? What are you doing?

428
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,106
What?

429
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,441
What are you doing? Honey.

430
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,615
To buy designer bags, they say
you need to line up early outside stores.

431
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,701
They're doing it for tteokbokki now too.

432
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:21,121
Exactly, so why did you buy this?
We have more than enough here.

433
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,956
Bring over some of that tteokbokki.

434
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,291
Why? What for?

435
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,172
"Know thy enemy, and you'll never lose
in a hundred battles."

436
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,632
Let's learn about the enemy first.

437
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,551
Jeez.

438
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,016
What?

439
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,976
What's wrong?

440
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,314
What is it? What?

441
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,990
It's good.

442
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,077
Their food's good.

443
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,620
It's not good.

444
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,457
It's nothing compared to yours!
The flavor's too strong.

445
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,834
There's no subtle savoriness to it.

446
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,378
What's the point when business is bad?

447
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,342
-Most days are a swing and a miss.
-Gosh, people these days…

448
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,010
They only want strong flavors.

449
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,804
Their taste buds have been ruined.

450
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,476
Mi-suk, should I call it quits now?

451
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,645
What?

452
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,067
Never mind. I was kidding.

453
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,653
Gosh, I should cleanse the rags.

454
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,708
Yes, next Friday.

455
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,752
Would it be possible?

456
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,423
Really? Okay, thank you.

457
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,884
Yes, okay. Bye.

458
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,512
-Hey.
-Hi.

459
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,473
-You didn't order yet, right?
-Nope.

460
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,686
Thank you for the food.

461
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,984
It's so good.

462
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,529
How do they make this?

463
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,782
Is this a new work habit?

464
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,785
You'll be like this
every time we go to eat good food.

465
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,412
Probably. I almost forgot.

466
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,665
Mr. Yoon gave me
his list of good restaurants.

467
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,501
If only my stomach was okay,

468
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,671
I'd visit different restaurants
and film mukbang videos.

469
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,550
Why are you staring at me like that?

470
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,011
I was just kidding. Look at me eating now.

471
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,641
I mean it.

472
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,978
What about doing what you did before?

473
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,982
You made cooking videos in the US.
You can start again here.

474
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,983
No way.

475
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:59,696
People there didn't know Korean food well,
so I was just acting like an expert.

476
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,989
It'd be different here.

477
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,033
No, it wouldn't.
You'd do even better now.

478
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,328
There are already
so many talented people.

479
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:12,834
Also, NerTube channels these days
are so professional and high-quality.

480
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,377
How could I do something like that?

481
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,962
I can just film for you.

482
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,882
-You?
-Yeah.

483
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,635
Hey.

484
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,637
-Is it better with it off?
-Yeah.

485
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,972
-It's too bright.
-Okay.

486
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,101
Okay, that should do it.
I just have to press record.

487
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,353
What? Already? Wait!

488
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,147
What do I do first?

489
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,900
I've already prepared the ingredients.

490
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,902
Should I boil water first?

491
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,903
Wait.

492
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,239
No, I have to blanch the broccoli
and make the chicken broth.

493
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:48,286
Chef Bae, why are you so nervous?
This isn't your first time.

494
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,413
I don't know. I'm so nervous.

495
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,917
Do I look weird on the camera?

496
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,964
You're beautiful.
The most beautiful person in the world.

497
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,928
My confidence and self-esteem
are at an all-time low these days.

498
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:05,887
I'm so blue.

499
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,890
Then, let's make it red.

500
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,520
Hey, the camera's on.

501
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,357
Your food really is delicious.

502
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,567
I know that better than anyone.

503
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,530
I'm ready.

504
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,865
-Then, we'll start.
-Okay.

505
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,839
The dish we'll make today

506
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,591
is called Broc-Cauliflower
and Chicken Risotto.

507
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,678
Just from its name, it seems
like a healthy combination, right?

508
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,055
And honestly,
it doesn't sound too good either.

509
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,265
But today,

510
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,686
I'll try to break the perception
that healthy food doesn't taste good.

511
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,735
Miss, is something wrong?

512
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,240
I was rejected.

513
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,450
How could you be so honest about that?

514
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,160
There's no reason to hide it.

515
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,831
Still, wouldn't most people
be embarrassed to say that?

516
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,499
No.

517
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,003
I was proud to have a crush on him…

518
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:27,302
even though I'm burning calories
and my heart at the same time right now.

519
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,932
Drink as you work out. You'll lose
muscle mass if you're dehydrated.

520
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,309
No, thanks.

521
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,519
I'll drink it after.

522
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,813
You look like you need it now.

523
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,859
You look like you're about to cry.

524
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,155
But still…

525
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,075
-Don't fall for me.
-What?

526
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,286
A gym member and a trainer can't date.

527
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,458
I've decided to dedicate myself
to my work.

528
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,465
What's wrong with him? Is he crazy?

529
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,562
I'm home.

530
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,484
Here you go.

531
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,493
What's going on?
You said these would raise my blood sugar.

532
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,703
It's keto bread made with almond flour.

533
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,956
I had to go really far to buy that.

534
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,836
I guess you did want to say sorry to me.

535
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,422
Yeah, I'm sorry.

536
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,092
Also,

537
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,303
I'm going to continue to be sorry.

538
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,430
Because I'm going to be with Dan-ho.

539
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,142
You little brat,
you just made me lose my appetite!

540
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,520
I told you that you can't!

541
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,397
Mom, Yeon-du…

542
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,649
isn't Dan-ho's daughter.

543
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,442
She's his niece.

544
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,530
-What?
-His parents and Yeon-du's parents…

545
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,741
They died in an accident.

546
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,077
That's why Dan-ho's taking care of her.

547
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,540
So what?

548
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,792
Does that change anything?

549
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,004
If she was his niece and not his daughter,

550
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,965
did you think I'd allow you to see him?

551
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,342
I didn't tell you to get your permission.

552
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:36,014
After going through so much,
they were the only two left.

553
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,685
They're each other's only family,
and I'm telling you this,

554
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,687
because…

555
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,650
I want to protect them.

556
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,403
Do you even know what that means?

557
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,322
You have to become her mom!

558
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,119
There are countless times when you want
to quit raising even your own kids.

559
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,456
You think you can care
for someone else's child like that?

560
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,174
Mom.

561
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,551
I…

562
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,387
still remember.

563
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,307
After Dad died,

564
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,227
you, my sisters, and I

565
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,314
were kicked out of Grandma's house.

566
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,901
You worked during the day

567
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,861
and studied at night

568
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,155
to pass your real estate agent exam.

569
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,409
When you started work while raising us,

570
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,663
you never once forced me to study.

571
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,458
You were never obsessed with grades.

572
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,506
Whether it was my career path or whatever,
you've always respected my choices.

573
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,267
Can't you try
to be understanding this time too?

574
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,396
I can't. Not about this!

575
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:13,027
Go on a blind date tomorrow.
And get married before the year ends.

576
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,114
I'm not going on a blind date, Mom.

577
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,117
You're so understanding
about everything else.

578
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,411
Why are you so old-fashioned
when it comes to marriage?

579
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,874
Because I don't want you
to live a hard life like me!

580
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,545
I want my daughter to marry
a man who lives a long life

581
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,588
and have a lot of babies.

582
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,468
I want you to grow old with him
as you watch your kids grow!

583
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,639
I want you to have
a happy and normal life!

584
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,557
Mom.

585
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,434
I'm happy right now.

586
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,020
Being your daughter

587
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,981
and working as a paramedic

588
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,315
makes me more than happy.

589
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,027
I like Dan-ho,

590
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,655
and I want to be with Yeon-du,

591
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,325
because I want to be even happier.

592
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,547
Just have one piece of bread.
Too much is hard to digest at night.

593
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,073
Wow, she didn't throw this out.

594
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,830
FALLING BLOSSOMS BY LEE HYEONG-GI

595
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:57,048
"How beautiful it is to see one leave
when they know it's time to go?"

596
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,217
When did you get down here?

597
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,889
You made this yourself
and gave it to me for my birthday.

598
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,350
You remember.

599
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,896
I think I was 22 or 23 then.

600
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,983
Gosh, that feels like a lifetime ago.

601
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,778
"As it heads toward lush, verdant growth

602
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,530
and fruitful autumn in the near future

603
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,742
my youth fades away
beautifully like a flower"

604
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,330
If life was like the four seasons,

605
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,749
are we in autumn now?

606
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,255
Well, we're probably
in the middle of autumn.

607
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:42,468
Still, don't you think we've managed
to bear some good fruit?

608
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,303
What?

609
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,805
Seok-ryu grew up well.

610
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,849
Dong-jin seems to be finding
his place in the world.

611
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,143
After enduring the blazing sun
and scorching heat,

612
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,231
I think our summer bore
truly precious fruit.

613
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,067
You're right.

614
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,744
Honey.

615
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:14,000
Let's close the snack shop now.

616
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,752
What?

617
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,839
You used to like poems,

618
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,591
and these hands drew so well.

619
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,178
But you picked pans over pens
to earn a living.

620
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,768
You've done a great job, Geun-sik.

621
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,941
Do you mean that?

622
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,359
Yeah.

623
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,655
So let's sort things out
before winter comes.

624
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,950
Let's live the rest of our autumn
admiring the foliage.

625
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,795
Then, how about going to Seoraksan
one more time with Seung-hyo's parents?

626
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,466
Forget it. So you can take
more awful pictures?

627
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,800
No, I have time now!

628
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,095
I'll learn how to take pictures properly,
and make you look good.

629
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,473
Then, Naejangsan Mountain.
I want to see other places too.

630
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,058
Sure, let's go there!

631
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,726
-Songnisan too.
-Songnisan. Okay!

632
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,978
But where's Naejangsan Mountain?

633
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,147
-Jeolla Province.
-I see.

634
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,774
-Where's Songnisan?
-And Jirisan.

635
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,026
Jirisan? How would we climb that?

636
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,184
Today's the day.

637
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,868
Hey.

638
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:14,995
What's going on?

639
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,165
Why won't the water come out?

640
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,084
Dad!

641
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,879
Dad, the…
The water won't come out in the bathroom.

642
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,215
Didn't your mom tell you?

643
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,176
The water tank is being cleaned.
It'll be off until noon.

644
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,094
What?

645
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,140
You want this?

646
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,154
YOON MYEONG-U

647
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,453
Hey, Myeong-u.

648
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,205
That?

649
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,291
Okay, good luck.

650
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,292
Bye.

651
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,753
Crap!

652
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,341
Come on!

653
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,887
Damn it!

654
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,348
Seriously?

655
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,684
Hey!

656
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,768
You brat!

657
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,437
You're the one who called us here!

658
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,563
-And you're late!
-Come on.

659
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,939
-Seriously?
-Sorry!

660
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,942
I stopped by at a travel agency.

661
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,528
Hey, look at this.

662
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,157
I asked for all the cruise packages
they had available.

663
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,158
Already?

664
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,494
You know,
you're actually really impatient.

665
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,704
Hey, we need to set a date
while it's on our mind

666
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,914
or it'll never happen.

667
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,957
-This is a premium package.
-Yeah.

668
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,211
We'll fly business class
from Incheon to Italy.

669
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,713
And that's where the cruise starts!

670
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,258
Hey, business class
would make this pretty expensive.

671
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,345
Hey, this will be
our first trip overseas together.

672
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,097
Think of it
as an early 60th birthday trip.

673
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,725
-Our 60th?
-This cruise starts in Italy.

674
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,228
And it includes Greece and Turkey.

675
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,979
-That's right.
-Jeez.

676
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,898
Hey. Come on.

677
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,234
There are tons of places
in Korea we haven't visited.

678
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,902
So why go all the way there?

679
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,071
What if we end up getting seasick?

680
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,323
Hey, motion sickness meds
work great these days!

681
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,449
That's right.

682
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,575
And in Korea?

683
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,827
-We'll travel Korea when we're older.
-Yeah.

684
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,413
You won't be able to visit Europe
because of your knees later.

685
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,707
Yeah, In-suk's right about that.

686
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,669
My body feels different every day.
And my knees creak.

687
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,629
-Right?
-Yeah.

688
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,881
Jae-suk, take a look.

689
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,634
Look at the color of the ocean.
Isn't it great?

690
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,594
Imagine meeting a man here.

691
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,099
-It's so incredible!
-Wow.

692
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,351
You're closing your shop?

693
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,936
That's why I told you to come.

694
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:48,524
The owner has gone mad today,
so eat as much as you want.

695
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,943
That's such a shame.

696
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,445
The tteokbokki
and these deep-fried peppers.

697
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,197
These are so good.

698
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,992
You can come to our house and eat them.

699
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,619
Now, I'll be free and hanging out all day.

700
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,079
I couldn't impose.

701
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,330
This is a deal I'm offering.

702
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,082
What?

703
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,375
Look,

704
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,002
teach me how to take good photos.

705
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,505
Okay? Do you know how much
my wife has nagged me about that?

706
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,340
Why did you have to
take pictures like that?

707
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,925
You've made life unbearable!

708
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,302
Is that so?

709
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,098
Okay, I'll make sure
to teach you those skills.

710
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,391
Thank you so much.

711
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,521
It's so empty in here.

712
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,817
And so, on that note,

713
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,028
let me show you
something really special to me.

714
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,530
My precious

715
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,991
I swear! Seriously!

716
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,660
I'll pay for the lessons with this today.

717
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,288
I'll open it now.

718
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,628
Is this okay in the middle of the day?

719
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,339
Come on. I'm the owner here.

720
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,049
And I said the owner's gone mad.

721
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,385
This is for my wife anyway.

722
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,387
So I'm paying for this course.

723
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,389
Then, I won't refuse.

724
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,932
-Thank you.
-Sure.

725
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,107
Yeah, right there.

726
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,610
It makes you aware
of where all your internal organs are.

727
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:18,781
Wow.

728
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,742
It's very special.

729
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,122
Jeez, did you leave
something behind again?

730
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,083
Mrs. Do.

731
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,503
Yeon-du.

732
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,546
What brings you here?

733
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,132
I have something to give you.

734
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,762
What is it?

735
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,306
Here.

736
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,850
What's this?

737
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,893
It's a flower.

738
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,855
I only give this to people I like.

739
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,483
I wanted to give you one.

740
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,861
I used the prettiest colors to make it.

741
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,155
You want to give this to me?

742
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,199
Yes.

743
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,160
You didn't seem
to be smiling a lot lately.

744
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,456
What if you get bugs in your heart too?

745
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,127
Take this and smile.

746
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,591
Thank you.

747
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,927
My babysitter is waiting for me.

748
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,638
Have a nice day.

749
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,182
Okay, bye.

750
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,650
She's so sweet.

751
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,405
And I'm the worst.

752
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:47,911
Hello.

753
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,372
-Hello.
-Everything's ready. Here.

754
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,498
Thank you.

755
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,550
Thank you.

756
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,431
BROC-CAULIFLOWER AND CHICKEN RISOTTO

757
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,601
The number of views
isn't increasing at all.

758
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,145
HOUSE COOK MASTER BAE
79 VIEWS 1 WEEK AGO

759
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,024
Yeah, I wouldn't want to watch it either.

760
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,735
It's broccoli, cauliflower,
and chicken breast.

761
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,236
I wouldn't eat that either.

762
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,783
CHOISSEUNG

763
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,452
I forgot. We're supposed to meet today.

764
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,801
Choisseung, did you wait a long time?

765
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:45,802
Sorry!

766
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,596
I'm sorry for making you wait.

767
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,765
It's fine. You didn't have to rush.

768
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:50,849
Your hair's still wet.

769
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,434
What if you catch a cold?

770
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,020
It's okay. So what are we doing today?

771
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,983
First, let's get something good to eat.

772
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,944
I made reservations.

773
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,612
Nice!

774
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,781
I'm going to get fat because of you.

775
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,407
That's my dream.

776
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,003
What the heck?

777
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,488
Gosh, the rear's been wrecked.

778
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,116
What? Your rear?
Your rear hurts?

779
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,368
No, not me. Your car.

780
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,954
It's fine as long as you're not hurt.

781
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,039
Still, let's go
to the hospital just in case.

782
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,708
It's all right. I'm fine.

783
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,293
Let's go eat. I'm hungry.

784
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,336
Are you really okay?

785
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,838
Yeah, really.

786
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,464
Let's go eat.

787
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,431
So this is the building
you won an award for?

788
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,310
You've grown a lot, Choisseung.

789
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,687
You used to cower behind me as a kid.

790
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,147
You've grown so well.

791
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,942
You're the first woman
who's ever treated me like this.

792
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,153
Of course, you'll be the last too.

793
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,070
Hey.

794
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,283
But are you sure this place is famous?

795
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,493
There aren't any customers here.

796
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,330
-It's only us.
-Right.

797
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,374
It is a famous place.

798
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,085
There's a reason
why there are no customers.

799
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,671
-It's because today--
-Yeah!

800
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,091
Don't you know how famous our chef is?

801
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,093
You don't know anything.

802
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,303
I apologize.

803
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,596
It's fine.

804
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,890
I had a sensitive matter
to deal with today.

805
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,600
Allow me.

806
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,488
Today's first dish is bruschetta.

807
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,948
With top-quality extra virgin oil…

808
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,037
-It's fine. Please, take it.
-Right.

809
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,996
Excuse me.

810
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,541
Hey.

811
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,668
What? Right now?

812
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,337
Wow!

813
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,422
Yeah, okay.

814
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,884
Great job. You did great.

815
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,054
Is something the matter?

816
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,432
My baby was just born!

817
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,559
My wife has been in labor since dawn.

818
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,477
Wow.

819
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,189
Then, why didn't you tell me before?

820
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,441
I mean, I wanted to.

821
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,611
But everything had been prepared,
and it's such an important day.

822
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,697
-Gosh, but still…
-Wait.

823
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,824
Then, shouldn't you be going now?

824
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,326
Quick. You should go to your wife.

825
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,537
Yes, go ahead. Don't worry about us.

826
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,622
Then, I'm really sorry,

827
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,541
but I'll get going now.

828
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,960
-I almost forgot!
-Yes?

829
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,211
-Mr. Choi!
-Yes?

830
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,590
The cake's in the kitchen.

831
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,968
-Good luck today.
-Good luck.

832
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,387
-You too!
-Good luck!

833
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,472
Holy cow!

834
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:19,850
Wow.

835
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,937
Well, I guess we're done eating.

836
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,107
-Should we go home after this?
-Yeah.

837
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,817
I mean, no. We can't.

838
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,695
The chef's cake…

839
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,322
He made us a dessert.

840
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,658
How about we eat that before we go?

841
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,368
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

842
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,662
Thank you for the meal.

843
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,918
It's okay. I still have a chance.

844
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,256
It's fine as long as things end well.

845
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:53,967
For me,

846
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:59,181
the results are more important
than the process, right?

847
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,558
I can do this.

848
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,561
I can do this, right?

849
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,564
Let's go.

850
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,218
Are you okay?

851
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,806
You should've been more careful.

852
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,685
I bet that hurt.

853
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:52,901
Hey.

854
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,820
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

855
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,198
Goodness. I made acorn jelly.
Take some with you.

856
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,159
Goodness. I'd be so grateful.

857
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,746
Hey, I heard our husbands

858
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,540
are at the snack shop together.

859
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,835
Gosh, despite being neighbors,
they used to be so distant.

860
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,170
They're suddenly great friends. How funny.

861
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,213
I know.

862
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,343
Mi-suk, I have something
to talk to you about.

863
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,553
Go ahead.

864
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,180
You know the cruise trip
we agreed to go on? Let's go together.

865
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,226
I don't know. I'll think about it.

866
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,937
If this is about money, I'll pay for you.

867
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,483
What?

868
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,445
Why would you pay for me?

869
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,575
Well, because I want to go with you.

870
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,493
Also, it's not that much money.

871
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,870
Friends can do that.

872
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:45,787
No, they can't.

873
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,873
It's not like letting friends
borrow money.

874
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,708
Who would ever pay that much?

875
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,335
I've never heard of that before.

876
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,129
We're not just ordinary friends.

877
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,839
We've been friends for 40 years.

878
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,427
And most importantly,
I'm so grateful for you raising Seung-hyo.

879
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,178
You paid me for that.

880
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,181
What?

881
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,142
You paid me a salary.

882
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,978
I was paid for it,
so why be grateful?

883
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,608
Hey, that's still something
to be grateful for.

884
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,568
I can tell by how much he likes you.

885
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,320
You looked after him with such care.

886
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,034
That's true.

887
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,493
Yeah, I did.

888
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,664
When Seung-hyo
and Seok-ryu both got sick,

889
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,209
I took care of him first
and took him to the hospital first too.

890
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,587
Why? Because I was paid to.

891
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,298
I didn't want to be told I raised
my friend's precious son poorly.

892
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,303
Hey. When did I ever say that to you?

893
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,471
You didn't.

894
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,848
But I could silently sense it.

895
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,100
Whenever you paid me extra for the month,

896
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,812
whenever you gave me gift certificates
for the holidays to thank me,

897
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,856
do you know how miserable I felt?

898
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,943
Is that how you've thought of me
all this time?

899
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:01,863
-Did you even think of me as a friend?
-You probably thought of me as a maid.

900
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,075
If that weren't the case,
why would you pay for my trip?

901
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,368
Who are you to pity me?

902
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,703
It's not pity. It's friendship.

903
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,665
And if that's how you felt,
it's due to your inferiority complex.

904
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,000
-Inferiority complex?
-Yeah.

905
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,253
Are you done talking?

906
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,214
No, I can go on. Why?

907
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,133
No one thinks that way of you,
but you put yourself down.

908
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,886
That's an inferiority complex.
It's a complex!

909
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,096
Hey!

910
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,015
-Hey!
-You bitch!

911
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,517
You were always so arrogant!

912
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,019
-Hey!
-You constantly tried to teach people!

913
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,646
-Hey!
-You always looked down on them!

914
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,398
-With eyes like this!
-Let go!

915
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:40,235
How did you pretend to be my friend
while secretly hating me all this time?

916
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,403
Hey! Let go!

917
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,946
-Hey!
-You were two-faced.

918
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,864
But I believed you were my friend.

919
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,825
Hey! I'm the crazy one!

920
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,326
-Hey!
-Hey!

921
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,453
-Hey!
-Hey! Let go!

922
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,579
Honey!

923
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,207
-Honey, what's wrong?
-Honey, what are you doing?

924
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,125
-Let go!
-Honey!

925
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,835
-What's going on?
-What are you doing?

926
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,295
-What's wrong with you?
-Honey! Hey!

927
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,341
It's over between us now!

928
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,801
I won't hang out with you anymore!

929
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,179
That's what I wanted to say!
Don't act like you know me anymore!

930
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,723
That's what I wanted!

931
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,599
You leave the Lavender group text.

932
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,185
Yeah, right!
Jae-suk and In-suk are closer to me!

933
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,312
No, they like me better!

934
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,439
-Honey!
-Hey!

935
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,108
Tonight, let's go home.
We'll talk about this later.

936
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,317
There's no later!

937
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,446
Hey, it's over between us now!

938
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,865
-Okay, all right!
-Hey, you!

939
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,116
Give my food containers back!

940
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,034
Get out!

941
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,326
-I'm so sorry!
-My containers!

942
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,995
-Don't you worry about them!
-Sorry!

943
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,371
-Go!
-Hey, you!

944
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,331
-Quick!
-Who acts like that?

945
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,375
-Okay. That's enough.
-Let me go!

946
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,096
We still haven't eaten anything yet.

947
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,100
That's okay. We were going to film anyway.

948
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,770
It worked out.
Get ready for my new dish.

949
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,241
What? What are you looking at?

950
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,957
Seok-ryu, what's the matter?

951
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,215
My mother is currently
undergoing chemotherapy.

952
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,635
She needs proper nutrition,
but she has trouble eating.

953
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,970
I was looking for a healthy recipe
and tried yours.

954
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,098
It's been a while,
but she ate an entire bowl.

955
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,349
Thank you.

956
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,728
Your sincerity got through.

957
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,688
Yeah.

958
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,778
So why are you crying?

959
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,449
-Well?
-Because she's like me.

960
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,537
It was like that for me too.

961
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,623
My mouth was filled with sores.

962
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,086
Even drinking water was nauseating,

963
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,755
but everyone kept telling me
I had to eat something.

964
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,846
But to hear that someone enjoyed
the food I made…

965
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,723
I feel so moved.

966
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,603
It makes me want to keep doing this.

967
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,481
To those who've been in pain like me,

968
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,776
and to those who are still in pain,

969
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,280
I want to tell them it'll be okay

970
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,533
and that things will get better

971
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,202
by offering a bowl of comfort.

972
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,498
I bet no one could do that
better than you.

973
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,505
I'm going to work harder to make videos.

974
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,426
That's strange.

975
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,930
You're smiling so beautifully,

976
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,684
but I feel like I'm going to cry.

977
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:01,853
Why?

978
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,360
Now, whenever you make rice,

979
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,907
slice potatoes,

980
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,285
or season vegetables,

981
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,665
I think it might break my heart sometimes.

982
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,753
Back when you were sick

983
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,049
and couldn't eat anything,

984
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,556
I'm so sorry I couldn't be there with you.

985
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,976
I regret it so much.

986
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,108
So I was wondering…

987
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,700
Will you let me

988
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,247
spend the rest of my life with you?

989
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,541
What?

990
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,462
Well, this wasn't my original plan.

991
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,259
The flowers are at the auto shop,
the food is gone,

992
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,512
and the cake was ruined, but still…

993
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,057
Fortunately,

994
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,104
I still have this.

995
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,613
Seok-ryu.

996
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,326
Will you marry me?

997
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,082
I'm sorry.

998
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,962
I can't marry you.

999
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:52,922
No, I won't marry you.

1000
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,307
I'm sorry.

1001
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,653
That's right!

1002
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:19,365
So Songhan Industrial Development
rejected our proposal last time.

1003
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,367
Rejected? Says who?

1004
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,249
-What?
-Well…

1005
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,918
Songhan Industrial Development.

1006
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,422
They can't proceed with construction
due to a scheduling conflict.

1007
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:35,965
Right.

1008
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,677
I see. I thought you meant something else.

1009
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:44,140
Sorry, I misheard you. It was my mistake.

1010
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,560
Excuse me, the CEO has a guest.

1011
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,020
Which one?

1012
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,229
You.

1013
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,939
-Me?
-Yes.

1014
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,027
Mr. Choi.

1015
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,530
You said you needed pictures
of the shanty town, so I took some.

1016
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,075
Mr. Kang.

1017
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:09,707
So that day was strange from the start.

1018
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:14,796
The dark clouds of anxiety
were gradually approaching.

1019
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,631
It felt like a sign from the gods.

1020
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:17,882
"You won't succeed."

1021
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,300
"You're going to fail."

1022
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,302
"She's going to say no!"

1023
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,681
Then, you could've gone
with the option to postpone it.

1024
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,598
-What?
-What?

1025
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,518
Never mind. Continue.

1026
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,271
In the end,
nothing went according to plan.

1027
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,442
Still, just as I was instructed,
there was no audience.

1028
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:37,777
And…

1029
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,614
It wasn't a letter,
but it came from my heart.

1030
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,117
And the bracelet.

1031
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:52,709
Was it the bracelet?

1032
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,502
Bracelet?

1033
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,006
Na-yun told me to buy her a ring, but I…

1034
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,967
I bought a bracelet instead.

1035
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,720
I doubt that was the reason.

1036
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,555
Then, what could it be?

1037
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:10,810
Why would Seok-ryu reject my proposal?

1038
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,022
I don't understand.

1039
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,444
Maybe it was because she was hungry.

1040
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,696
I heard women get sensitive
when they're hungry.

1041
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,364
You're right.

1042
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:25,825
That's it.

1043
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,704
You're right. That's why.

1044
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,790
Ever since she was a kid,
she could never stand being hungry.

1045
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,001
That's why she'd always…

1046
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:39,714
Gosh, I should've fed her
before asking her.

1047
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,508
I'm glad I could help.

1048
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,010
Thank you so much.

1049
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,562
Seok-ryu.

1050
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,232
Will you marry me?

1051
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,787
That mean brat.

1052
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,955
How could she bring all of these?

1053
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,668
Jeez, look at all these containers.

1054
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,755
I was crazy to make her all that food.

1055
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,757
But to be precise,

1056
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,802
I don't think she ever asked you to.

1057
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,179
Maybe she did.

1058
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,599
That rude brat.

1059
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,768
Who is she to pay for my trip?

1060
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,269
So what if she's rich?

1061
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,188
How could she taunt
her friend with money?

1062
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:41,484
But honey, I don't think
she was intending to say that.

1063
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,027
No, that's how she is.

1064
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,905
She acts nice and sophisticated
as she slowly ticks people off.

1065
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,242
She's always been jealous of me.

1066
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,077
She was so resentful towards me!

1067
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,578
It didn't seem like that.

1068
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,789
That's because you don't know anything!

1069
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,332
Gosh, what a mean brat!

1070
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,878
I mean, I suggested it with her in mind.

1071
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,172
But she didn't appreciate
my good intentions!

1072
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,715
How could she do that?

1073
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,389
And another thing.

1074
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,933
Jeez, she said…

1075
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,101
How are things over there?

1076
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,936
Things aren't good over here.

1077
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,398
She must've thought so little of me
to have offered money like that.

1078
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,650
She thinks I'm a charity case.

1079
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,110
It's the same here.

1080
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,987
I don't think her anger
will subside easily.

1081
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,239
How can you trample
on good intentions like that?

1082
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,199
Let's meet at my shop later.

1083
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,951
I was sad Mi-suk was being left out.

1084
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,369
Okay, I understand.

1085
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,913
I was trying to help.
Hey, what are you doing?

1086
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,666
-Are you listening to me right now?
-Yeah, of course!

1087
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,167
I'm listening.

1088
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,963
How could she distort things
and misunderstand me like that?

1089
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,223
Why is the group text so quiet today?

1090
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,395
Are they too busy to check their messages?

1091
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,154
Now, they're going around together
out in the open…

1092
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,322
I'll do it.

1093
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:10,948
Yeon-du.

1094
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:16,078
I'll teach you how to tie your shoes
so they never become undone.

1095
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,209
-Hello.
-Hello.

1096
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,628
Hello, little one.

1097
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:29,133
Mo-eum. Goodness.

1098
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:33,429
You'll get hurt
if you walk on your laces like this.

1099
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,306
They keep getting undone.

1100
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:42,271
Want me to show you a magical way
to keep your shoelaces tied?

1101
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,439
Yeah.

1102
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:46,692
Here we go.

1103
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:52,907
Make loops like this
in the shape of bunny ears,

1104
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,617
cross one ear over the other,

1105
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,328
put it under and through,

1106
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,748
and out to the front,

1107
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,210
and pull them like this.

1108
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,004
All done!

1109
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,300
Now, you can fly out
as Superman 100 times,

1110
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,718
and they'll still be tied.

1111
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,680
Really? Yeah!

1112
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:18,224
-All done!
-All done!

1113
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,810
Let's go!

1114
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,066
All done.

1115
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,862
I put a spell on it,
so they won't ever get loose.

1116
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,658
Thank you, Mo-eum.

1117
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:36,951
You're welcome!

1118
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,870
They'll really stay tied this way?

1119
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:40,830
Of course.

1120
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,125
I tied them like this every day
when I was a kid.

1121
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:46,544
Yeon-du!

1122
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:48,462
Want me to do something fun for you?

1123
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:56,220
One, two, three!

1124
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,807
I'm happy right now.

1125
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,059
I like Dan-ho,

1126
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,895
and I want to be with Yeon-du,

1127
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,273
because I want to be even happier.

1128
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,781
Like this!

1129
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:20,953
Mother.

1130
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:24,957
Jung Mo-eum.

1131
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,126
Why are you home so late?

1132
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,172
-Well…
-I was waiting for you.

1133
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,840
So I couldn't even have dinner!

1134
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,259
Hurry and order some Chinese.

1135
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,763
Okay.

1136
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,307
Jajangmyeon or jjamppong?

1137
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,020
What do you want to eat, Dan-ho?

1138
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,189
I'll have jjamppong.

1139
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,692
You eat japchae rice.
I'll order jjamppong.

1140
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:57,656
Yeon-du, do you want jajangmyeon?

1141
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,283
Yeah, I'd like that.

1142
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:05,331
We have to order different dishes,
so we can all share.

1143
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,750
That's the good thing
about having lots of people around.

1144
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,502
Mom?

1145
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,715
Yeon-du, want to go inside?

1146
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,510
We can wash our hands
and wait for the food.

1147
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,428
-Okay!
-Come here!

1148
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,014
-There you go!
-Wait.

1149
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,307
She's heavy. I'll carry her.

1150
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,227
She's not heavy. She's too skinny to be.

1151
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,479
Do you even feed her?

1152
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:32,274
Yes, I try my best,
but I'm not skilled at cooking.

1153
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,485
This won't do.

1154
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:38,781
Starting tomorrow, I'll show you
just how astounding my cooking is.

1155
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,242
Let's go inside.

1156
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,994
Yeon-du!

1157
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,496
Wait for us, Mother!

1158
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,667
Goodness gracious!

1159
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,003
I'll get the door!

1160
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:54,964
Just a moment.

1161
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,010
Gyeong-jong!

1162
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,681
No one followed you, right?

1163
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:04,890
I think so.

1164
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,475
But is this place safe?

1165
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,685
What if Mi-suk comes?

1166
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,854
She doesn't come in the evening.

1167
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,648
And she's so angry
that she's lying down.

1168
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,066
It's the same with us.

1169
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,235
-This may last a while. What do we do?
-I know.

1170
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,864
I swear, they were fighting so fiercely.

1171
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,867
I've seen enough women fighting
on Street Woman Fighter.

1172
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,326
What was that?

1173
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,037
Street Woman Fighter. It's…

1174
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,456
It's a show. Don't ask.
You don't have to know.

1175
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:34,170
Let's have a drink
while we come up with a solution.

1176
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:37,006
I don't think we should.

1177
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,049
-Really? Then, I'll drink alone.
-No, wait.

1178
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,801
Jeez, I didn't mean it.

1179
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,557
We shouldn't be laughing right now.
We have to be serious.

1180
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,937
Gosh. Why does it taste so good today?

1181
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,403
Goodness, the shop
should be closed by now. Where is he?

1182
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:08,787
Hey, Ms. Kang.

1183
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,208
Yeah, everything's fine.

1184
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,085
No, not yet.

1185
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,045
What?

1186
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:18,756
He's with someone?

1187
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,134
How could you do this to me, Geun-sik?

1188
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,260
This is betrayal!

1189
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,304
Choi Gyeong-jong.

1190
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:27,264
ROOT DINER

1191
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,104
-Hey!
-I grabbed it first. What are you doing?

1192
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,440
-I grabbed it first. Hey!
-Move.

1193
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:38,525
-Love shot!
-Love shot!

1194
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,902
Bae Geun-sik!

1195
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,404
Gyeong-jong!

1196
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,658
-What are you doing?
-We're closed today!

1197
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,161
Romaine, chicory.

1198
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,080
Frisée.

1199
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,917
Rosemary, chives, blueberries.

1200
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,419
Tomatoes, eggplants.

1201
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,340
What should I make with these?

1202
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,804
CHOISSEUNG

1203
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:08,973
Hello?

1204
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,726
Excuse me?

1205
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,109
It's you again.

1206
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,402
Hello.

1207
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,529
Why do you two lovers fight so often?

1208
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,949
He was sipping alcohol by himself
and passed out again.

1209
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,373
You didn't even eat anything
while drinking,

1210
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,791
so why are you so heavy?

1211
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,584
Wait.

1212
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,503
Hey, wait.

1213
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:42,798
Hey! Sit here for a second.

1214
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,174
-What?
-Sit down.

1215
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:51,890
Hey, Choisseung.

1216
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,145
-Choisseung?
-Yeah?

1217
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,022
Pull it together.

1218
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,445
Are you sobering up a bit?

1219
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,076
It's Seok-ryu.

1220
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:16,457
Hey.

1221
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:19,918
You…

1222
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:24,256
Why did you reject me?

1223
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,219
How…

1224
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:35,934
How could you say you can't marry me?

1225
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:41,065
You're drunk.
Let's talk about this when you're sober.

1226
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:43,817
For me…

1227
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:48,405
Without you,

1228
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:55,120
my life doesn't have any flavor.

1229
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:57,748
You…

1230
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:04,338
You're like my salt and sugar.

1231
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,804
You're my sesame oil.

1232
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,642
How could you…

1233
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,687
Hey, wake up.

1234
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,566
I'll leave you here if you don't.

1235
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:26,652
You can't…

1236
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:55,556
What?

1237
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,393
What am I doing here?

1238
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,188
This was as far as I could get you.

1239
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,234
Seok-ryu.

1240
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,071
Jeez, that was exhausting.

1241
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,031
-Take yourself home now.
-Hey.

1242
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,454
Tell me…

1243
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,125
why you rejected my proposal.

1244
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,006
You said we'd talk when I was sober.

1245
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,178
I'm fine now.

1246
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,270
I guess you didn't blackout.

1247
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,317
You said you loved me.

1248
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:56,575
Then, why can't you marry me?

1249
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,079
We're perfectly fine the way we are now.

1250
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,665
So why bother?

1251
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,044
It could be even better.

1252
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,465
I can become your roof,

1253
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,051
and you can be my rafters.

1254
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,637
We'll take shelter from the wind and rain,

1255
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,848
and we'll get plenty of sunshine.

1256
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,645
We can become stronger and closer.

1257
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,566
And we can live
a long and happier life together.

1258
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,527
Why…

1259
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,531
do you think we'll live long lives?

1260
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,493
It might not be long.

1261
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,620
I may look okay now,

1262
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,832
but there might come a day when I'm not.

1263
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,168
Why would you think like that?

1264
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,836
I don't want to either.

1265
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,297
But I can't help it, Seung-hyo.

1266
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:57,594
It wouldn't be strange
if I became sick again one day.

1267
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:01,682
Who knows?

1268
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,686
Something terrible
could happen to me tomorrow.

1269
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,480
That's the same for me.

1270
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,149
Did you…

1271
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,570
forget about the accident I recently had?

1272
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,657
And it's not just us.

1273
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,119
It's the same for everyone else.

1274
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,830
Life is finite,

1275
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,835
and death is inevitable.

1276
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:34,840
Everyone lives under the same conditions.

1277
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,429
Seok-ryu.

1278
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,433
I know what you're worried about,

1279
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,185
and I can't tell you that it won't happen.

1280
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,647
I'm not a god.

1281
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,986
But there's one thing
I can tell you for certain.

1282
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:58,572
I…

1283
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,160
want to spend my life with you.

1284
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,423
A hundred years.

1285
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,885
Ten years.

1286
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,223
No, if I can live for only one day,

1287
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,060
it has to be with you.

1288
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,271
Me too.

1289
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:35,067
I feel the same.

1290
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,904
To be honest, I want to so badly.

1291
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,495
Then…

1292
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,582
will you accept my proposal?

1293
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:56,380
As long as you didn't return the bracelet.

1294
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,178
What do I do?

1295
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,932
I lost it after that day.

1296
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,107
I'm just kidding.

1297
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,567
It's at home. I'll go and get it now.

1298
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:18,610
Aunt Hye-suk.

1299
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:20,821
Mom…

1300
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:37,295
SWEET LOVE

1301
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,799
BITTER LIFE

1302
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:16,084
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1303
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,044
What's going on between you and Seung-hyo?

1304
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,379
We're dating and it's serious.

1305
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,964
She turned you down?

1306
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:22,466
Is she out of her mind?

1307
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,050
No. It can't be Seung-hyo.

1308
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:26,428
Your parents are really upset,
aren't they?

1309
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:29,139
Well, we've already been caught.
I don't care!

1310
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,808
We're here too. Hi!

1311
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,685
That's pretty cool, Choisseung.

1312
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:37,189
You're like the architect
in charge of Hyereung-dong.

1313
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,358
I saw on the snack shop's door.
It was a sign saying they're closing.

1314
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,903
From now on,
Hye-suk doesn't exist in my life.

1315
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:47,407
I'm against it too. I have no desire
to make him my son-in-law at all.

1316
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:50,911
Will you marry me?

1317
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,459
