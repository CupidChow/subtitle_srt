182
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,223
Listen to me when I tell you something!

183
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,685
Then, eat as much as you want
when you come here.

184
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,728
When's your flight?

185
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,647
I can't go.

186
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,650
[slow music playing]

187
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,568
I won't be able to
call for a while either.

188
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,071
Why? Are you really busy?

189
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,907
Yeah, I started a new project.

190
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,408
It's very important.

191
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,451
Oh.

192
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,994
Okay, I get it.

193
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,664
You're doing important work.
I shouldn't bother you.

194
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,748
Even if you have no time,

195
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,584
don't skip meals, drink a lot of water,
and get a lot of sleep.

196
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,336
Call me more often too.

197
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,298
Okay. I think…

198
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,468
I think I'm getting a call from work. Bye.

199
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,803
-Okay…
-[line disconnects]

200
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,724
[clicks tongue] That brat.

201
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,269
[sighs]

202
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,774
[sobbing]

203
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,072
[sobbing] It's okay, Seok-ryu.
It's not a big deal.

204
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,284
[sniffles] I'll get better.
I'll tell them after I get better.

205
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,496
It's not a big deal. It's nothing.

206
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,834
[sobbing]

207
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,303

213
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,119
Hyeon-jun, hold me up.

214
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,704
[Hyeon-jun] You can lean on me.

215
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,209
To me, Seok-ryu isn't some child.

216
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,544
She's a woman.

217
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,879
-[thuds]

218
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,380
[Mo-eum clapping]

219
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,425
Nice batting stance.
Your timing's perfect too.

220
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,802
-Hey.
-[Mo-eum] "Hey"?

221
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:46,515
You're having fun hitting balls alone
after giving me a scare like that?

222
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,351
You can join if you want.
You need some cash?

223
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,936
[Mo-eum] I have money too, you fool.

224
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,271
It's been a while.

225
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,358
Goodness, how about we loosen up a bit?

226
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,860
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

227
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,571
[Mo-eum] Oh. Wow.

228
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,907
No matter how I think about it,
it's amazing.

229
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,535
You don't look like someone
who'd be good at sports.

230
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,329
If you're here to pick a fight, save it.

231
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,206
I'm not in the mood.

232
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,042
I'm sure you aren't.

233
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,210
What's wrong?

234
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,462
Is it Seok-ryu again?

235
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,672
[laughing]

236
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,091

[exhales]

238
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,181
So she went to the hospital
with that punk instead of you?

239
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,974
[pop song playing in the background]

240
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,059
Wow.

241
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,520
I guess I did beam you with a fastball.

242
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,773
-Is this fun for you?
-A little.

243
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,775
[clears throat] So?

244
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,443
Did you ask her?

245
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,530
Why did she choose him at that moment?

246
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,614
[sighs]

247
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,032
No.

248
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,992
Jeez, you're so frustrating and dumb.

249
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,037
You still haven't fixed
that chronic habit.

250
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,916
Do I need to step up to the plate?

251
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,417
Forget it.

252
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,335
You're right.

253
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,380
Whether you hit a home run
or strike out, it's up to you.

254
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,884
Then, say something
so I can at least cheer you on.

255
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,636
Tell me your feelings.

256
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,597
How are you feeling right now?

257
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,517
I feel like crap.

258
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,436
I feel jealous too.

259
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,982
I told Seok-ryu

260
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,776
I wouldn't ask
about why her engagement was called off.

261
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,112
And I told him

262
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,575
I wasn't curious
since things were over between them.

263
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,118
I pretended not to care.

264
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,371
But I want to ask so badly.

265
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,416
I'm so curious it's driving me crazy.

266
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,462
There's a gap
between Seok-ryu and me.

267
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,424
And Hyeon-jun

268
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,969
is inside of it
with a part of her I don't know.

269
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,056
It's… How can I explain it?

270
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,560
It makes me angry.

271
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,105
Think about all the time
you've been together for.

272
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,774
If they're American history,

273
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,527
you two are like
the four great ancient civilizations.

274
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,238
You're like Egypt and Mesopotamia.

275
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,575
So don't be scared. Don't shrink back.

276
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,328
[amusing music playing]

277
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,495
I didn't.

278
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,541
No, you've shrunk
and wrinkled up a lot lately.

279
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,459
You've aged too.

280
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,544
How? Really?

281
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,381
What's the big deal about having a crush?

282
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,553
Hey.

283
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,682
Does your heart start to beat too?

284
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,226
How can someone live
if their heart doesn't beat?

285
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,270
That's not what I meant.

286
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,608
So when a person likes another person,

287
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,529
does your heart beat faster?

288
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,323
Of course.

289
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,117
It races when we're together.

290
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,245
It races when she's with someone else.

291
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,999
Like the fast, rumbling beat
of Korean traditional drums?

292
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,377
What? What are you rambling about?

293
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,920
Forget I said anything.

294
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,714
Never mind.

295
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,467
So how's Seok-ryu? Is she okay?

296
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,511
[exhales] I don't know.

297
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,346
[exclaims]

298
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,932
That brat's been picking
at her food a lot lately.

299
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,266
Is she getting old too?

300
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,978
She could eat dirt and be fine back then.

301
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,021
[sighs audibly]

302
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,564
[Mo-eum] Seriously.

[Seok-ryu exhales]

HYEON-JUN

305
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,574
Make sure to take your medicine.

[pills rattling]

307
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm so sick of this.

[mellow music playing]

309
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,968

[exhales]

311
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,601
It's late. Go to bed.

312
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,981
[chuckles softly]

313
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,984
Good night, Seok-ryu.

314
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,790
[Seok-ryu] After I got sick,
I'd lie in bed every night and think.

315
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,835
I'd think, "Why is it called cancer?"

316
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,173
Names are important for everything.

317
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,300
"Cancer" sounds so dark and scary.

318
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,179
"Flower." "Moon." "Star."

319
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,100
It would've been better if it had
a brighter and more cheerful name.

320
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,860
[birds chirping]

-[Mi-suk sighs]
-[door closes]

328
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,298
I won't stop you
from taking cooking classes.

329
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,843
Nothing bad can come from learning.

330
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,470
It'll be beneficial to you.

331
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,556
-Really?
-[Mi-suk] Of course. [exclaims]

332
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,101
It's something we do to survive.
It's a great hobby.

333
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,312
Learn and use those skills
when you get married.

334
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,857
Also, I thought about it.

335
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,193
You don't have to go
to the US if you don't want to.

336
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,779
But instead, get a job here.

337
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,532
You could easily join a major company
with your background.

338
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,574
Mom.

339
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,409
You're allowed to wander for a bit.

340
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,497
But you have all that experience.
Think of your future.

341
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,415
I'll decide my future.

342
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,085
And that's cooking.

343
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,336
Don't be ridiculous.

344
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,338
Your father and I won't ever allow it.

345
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,674
What parent would stand by
and let their child stray?

346
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,551
I'm not straying. I'm on the right path.

347
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,804
I didn't even know
what my path was up until now.

348
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,890
I've just been running like crazy,
but I finally found direction.

349
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,227
It's a path full of thorns.
You'll get stuck in the mud!

350
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,521
Stop wasting time
and focus on getting a job.

351
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,231
[door opens]

352
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,441
My advice isn't worth
listening to anymore?

353
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,695
I worked so hard to raise you.
You think you did it on your own?

354
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,369
[door slams]

355
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,912
What took you so long?

356
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,289
I was starving to death.

357
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,083
What? Did we have a prior engagement
that I don't know about?

358
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,086
-Did you fight with your mom again?
-Mind your own business.

359
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,546
Let's get something to eat.

360
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,716
Like what?

361
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,053
Is this really all you could pick to eat?

362
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,515
You looked beat up like this porridge.
That's why I picked it. What's wrong?

363
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,392
-You little…
-[stomach growling]

364
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,602
[chuckles softly]

365
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,270
Just eat. Try it first.

366
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,688
[quirky music playing]

367
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,733
I'm mad I have to spend
a precious meal eating soft food.

368
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,948
What is this?

369
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,326
-Why is it good?
-Right?

370
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,912
This place is good.

371
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,955
I won't bring you to just any place.

372
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,499
What are you talking about?
Hurry up and eat.

373
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:10,959
Okay.

374
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,353
Mmm.

375
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,486
That was so good.

376
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,324
Remember when you were complaining?
I thought you'd eat the bowl too.

377
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,701
Of course. I could eat steel bars too.

378
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,994
This bowl is nothing.

379
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,750
What? Are you feeling sick again?

380
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,295
Since it was a bit bland,
I'm craving tteokbokki now.

381
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,798
Do you even have room
after eating all that?

382
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,383
I can make room.

383
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,302
I'm going to the restroom.

384
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,141
Ma'am, do you have any toilet paper?

385
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,394
[employee] No,
take some from the roll here.

386
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,441
[bird chirping]

387
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,944
Yeah, you have to make room for more.

388
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,698
[sighs] I must be crazy about her.

389
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,491
[chuckles softly]

390
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,704

[groans weakly]

393
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,961
[exhales] Did I eat too quickly?

394
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,170
[breathes weakly]

395
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,006
I'm getting dumping syndrome again.

[dance music playing in the background]

399
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,685
[Dong-jin] Wow, he has a great body.

00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,103
[gasps]

401
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,479
Look at his back.

402
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,276
Wow, I heard you make hundreds
of thousands with just one ad.

403
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,695
I wish I could get just one offer.

404
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,196
[phone chimes]

405
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,492
WE'D LIKE YOU TO HELP PROMOTE
OUR NEW PRODUCT

406
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,660
[cash register dings]

407
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,414
It's here! A life-changing opportunity!

408
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,207
[chuckling]

409
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,880
Just you wait, Seok-ryu.
I'll succeed. I'll show you.

410
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,675
Thank you.

411
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,927
This is my first promotion.
What do I need to do?

412
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,681
[chuckles softly]

413
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,058
How cute.

414
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,070
What's this?

415
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,655
Did we really not take
that many photos together?

416
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,783
-[glass breaking]
-That scared me!

417
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,119
What was that?

418
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,913
What's going on?

419
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,165
Goodness.

420
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,750
[gasps]

421
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,752
[breathing heavily]

422
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,255
My goodness. How did this happen?

423
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,383
[exclaims]

424
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,094
[pleasant music playing]

425
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,266
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

426
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,935
No, I'm okay.

427
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,106
The washing machine suddenly…

428
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,780
It's dangerous,
so go and sit. I'll clean this.

429
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,033
Yeah, okay.

430
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,245
[vacuum humming]

[Gyeong-jong groans]

433
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,174
I'm finished cleaning.

434
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,136
I vacuumed too,
but there still could be some shards.

435
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,595
Don't walk around barefoot.

436
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,931
As for the washing machine,

437
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,142
I'll call for a repair tech.

438
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,561
Wait.

439
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,316
You're bleeding!

440
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,241
[groaning]

441
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,829
I said I could do it.

442
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,080
I'll do it.

443
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,041
Still, I'm a professor of ER medicine.

444
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,209
[Hye-suk scoffs]

445
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,837
I guess ER professors bleed
after stepping on glass too.

446
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,881
[exclaims]

447
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,215
-[chuckles softly]
-That stings.

448
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,925
And he's a crybaby.

00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,886
[blows air]

450
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,263
I get hurt like other people too.

451
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,056
Pain receptors don't discriminate.

452
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,642
-Pain receptors?
-[Gyeong-jong] Did you know?

453
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,647
Pain receptors don't distinguish
between physical pain and emotional pain.

454
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,776
Whether it's being cut by glass
or emotionally hurt,

455
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,819
they react the same.

456
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,739
Really?

457
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,867
All done.

458
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,120
Well, I'm just saying.

459
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,539
I'll get going.

460
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,374
[Hye-suk] Hey.

461
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,212
Do you want some ramyeon?

00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,172
[pleasant music playing]

463
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,348
[closes cupboard]

464
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,978
Stop staring at me.

465
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,188
Right!

466
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,525
Does she have eyes
in the back of her head?

467
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,703
[device beeping]

468
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,622
[chuckles softly]

469
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,542
[timer winding]

[slurping]

472
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,774
It's good. The noodles are al dente.

473
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,276
-It tastes just right.
-Yeah.

474
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,987
Cooking ramyeon is a science.

475
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,155
I just haven't tried,

476
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,908
but as long as I know the recipe,
I can make anything.

477
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,870
This reminds me of the past.

478
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,124
We ate this often in my dorm near school.

479
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,250
[chuckles softly]

480
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,419
Do you remember?

481
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,587
Back then,

482
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,133
you threw up your ramyeon
after studying anatomy with cadavers.

483
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,511
[chuckling] I never did that.

484
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:40,223
You did. You looked so pale.
You were the one who looked like a corpse.

485
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,683
What are you talking about?

486
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,185
I was a promising young talent
from the start. [chuckles]

487
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,812
[Hye-suk chuckles]

488
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,189
Yeah, a promising talent indeed.

489
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,276
I'd never seen anyone study
as well as you did.

490
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,697
Why are you out here?

491
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,699
Because we were done eating.

492
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,951
-Here.
-Thank you.

493
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,370
-Thanks for the meal.
-Take this too.

494
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,250
What is this exciting black bag?

495
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,918
Is it tteokbokki?

496
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,172
[Seung-hyo] Take them as per your needs.

497
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,257
What a bummer.

498
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,051
I don't need this stuff.

499
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,345
I have to get to work now.
Tomorrow's chicken porridge.

500
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,555
-Who says I'll eat with you?
-Bye.

501
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,973
[phone vibrating]

502
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,684
[Seung-hyo] Hey, I'm on my way now. Okay.

503
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,731
That fool bought so much. It's so heavy.

504
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,235
[door closes]

505
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,447
-[Myeong-u sighs]
-Don't move!

506
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,825
What? What's the matter?
What's going on?

507
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,951
[Seung-hyo] Oh.

508
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,246
That milk!
Did you steal that from my fridge?

509
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,207
-You did.
-[Myeong-u chuckles] Yeah.

510
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,250
Right, I guess you could say that. Why?

511
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,419
Just carefully put it down.

512
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,754
-[Myeong-u] What?
-No, wait.

513
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,422
Just give it to me.

514
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,466
Seriously? It's just milk.
Don't be stingy--

515
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,592
It's not just milk!

516
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,928
My life depends on this milk.

517
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,889
Hey, why do so many things
in your office depend on something?

518
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,810
Last time, you said our company's success
depended on that tree… My gosh!

519
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:07,852
What now?

520
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,937
Our company.

521
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,856
-What?
-Our company is withering.

522
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,904
[doorbell chiming]

523
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,705
We're not open yet--

524
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,416
Hello.

525
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,667
It's this.

526
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,710
Can you save my tree?

527
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,711
Oh.

528
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,130
This tree?

529
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,006
Yes.

530
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,591
[shop owner] Okay.

531
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,555
[pleasant music playing]

532
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,639
[chuckles softly]

533
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,809
I thought it was an emergency.

534
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,019
You sounded so desperate to save it.

535
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,982
It suddenly started to wither,
so I thought it was an emergency.

536
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,943
I guess you don't talk to it often.

537
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,154
Talk to it?

538
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,614
We may not hear them,
but plants can speak too.

539
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,616
They say they're tired or hungry.

540
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,871
This one's saying it's too humid.

541
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,914
This will stop it from bearing fruit.

542
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,667
It can bear fruit?

543
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,628
-Can it bloom flowers too?
-Of course. [chuckles softly]

544
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,007
Our friend has a lot to do this year.

545
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,426
[Seung-hyo] Then…

546
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,387
What should I do to listen to my tree?

547
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,266
So I was grilling
the dried pollock earlier.

548
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,104
I think meat's better than fish.
I was craving pork belly so badly.

549
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,272
[all laughing]

550
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,657
Are you done?

551
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,910
You looked so happy earlier.

552
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,454
What?

553
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,957
You were smiling so beautifully.

554
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,420
It was like you returned
to your familiar usual self.

555
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,257
What was my usual self like?

556
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,092
You're brighter
than California sunshine.

557
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,429
Bright, positive, and full of energy.

558
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,352
Open it.

559
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,317
-What is this?
-[envelope rustling]

560
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,364
[Hyeon-jun] Remember the cooking school
I mentioned last time?

561
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,033
I got these from a study abroad agency.

562
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,910
If you're going to start this,

563
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,914
I want you to take
a proper path so you won't fail.

564
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,087
There's one more thing in there.

565
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,599
[mellow music playing]

566
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,309
-Is this…
-[Hyeon-jun] Yeah.

567
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,311
It's the engagement ring

568
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,564
that you left behind.

569
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,360
Just like how you've begun to dream again,

570
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,988
let's start over again too.

571
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,408
I want to continue to support you.

572
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,618
I want to be with you.

573
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,522
Nice reflexes.

574
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,566
That's what we former athletes
pride ourselves on.

575
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,777
Is this for me?

576
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,529
SSING-SSING BAR

577
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,949
[clicks tongue, inhales]

578
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,452
You should always split
and share this ice cream.

579
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:53,870
I agree.

580
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,789
[Seok-ryu] There are no stars
or moon tonight.

581
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,377
[Mo-eum] Did you ask her?

582
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,464
Why did she choose him at that moment?

583
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,468
-About that night…
-He proposed to me.

584
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,054
What?

585
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,598
Hyeon-jun proposed to me.

586
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,439
[exhales audibly]

587
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,691
Wow, he must be a lunatic.

588
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,028
I wanted to at least be respectful,

589
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,488
he's really ticking me off.

590
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,824
What on earth is he doing? It's too late.

591
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,785
What if it isn't late?

592
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,288
What?

593
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,585
When he proposed for the second time,
I had this thought.

594
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,338
"Maybe it's not too late."

595
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,469
He keeps taking me back to the good times.

596
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,642
It's like a breeze
blowing through my heart.

597
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,020
And the book I once closed
is open again.

598
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,023
I remember all of my forgotten memories.

599
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,486
The osam bulgogi we ate when we first met.

600
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,114
It was so good.

601
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,281
Things like that.

602
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,870
Even though I'm here?

603
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,040
Yeah.

604
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,377
Even though…

605
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,171
I told you how I felt?

606
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,758
Yeah.

607
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,138
[exhales]

608
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,639
[slow music playing]

609
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,019
Is that why you went
to the hospital with him and not me?

610
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,187
Yeah, it was like instinct.

611
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,314
Usually,

612
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,067
people become the most vulnerable
and honest when they're sick.

613
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,903
I guess I subconsciously
wanted to lean on him.

614
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,990
You can't lean on me?

615
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,118
To me,

616
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,121
you're still…

617
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,875
a five-year-old kid crying
at the top of a jungle gym.

618
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,504
A childhood friend
I can split ice cream with.

619
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,506
The successful son of my mom's friend.

620
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,268
[exhales]

621
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,853
You're so cruel.

622
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,521
[clicks tongue]

623
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,565
How could you…

624
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,027
How can you make it
so I can't say anything?

625
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,655
I'm letting you know. You're mistaken.

626
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,119
You don't like me. You imprinted on me.

627
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,663
Did you know?

628
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,207
A duckling mistakes

629
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,418
the first thing it sees
for its mother and follows them around.

630
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,128
-[sighs]
-[Seok-ryu] It's like that.

631
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,884
I'm just like a mother duck to you.

632
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,886
[Seung-hyo] Don't jump
to conclusions like that.

633
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,055
It doesn't matter how you feel.

634
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,017
It can't be helped if I'm not the one.

635
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,685
But…

636
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,688
don't tell me how I feel.

637
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,818
No matter how much I like you,

638
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,404
you have no right to do that.

639
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,534
-Seung-hyo…
-The milk hasn't expired yet.

640
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,121
And I'm not scared
of the jungle gym anymore.

641
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,264
[music ends]

642
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,267
[Jeong-u] Did you see the article?

643
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,270
"They allow us to make it home

644
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,815
to our friends and family
with a smile each day."

645
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,694
"To our heroic paramedics
who protect our precious daily lives,

646
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,571
I'd like to express my respect once more."

647
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,574
-They even printed our picture.
-[Min-ho] Oh.

648
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,742
I'm glad I used that sheet mask.

649
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,120
Send me that link.

650
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,122
I want to show my wife.

651
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,290
[Jeong-u] Yes, sir.

652
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,295
-Ms. Jung, isn't the article awesome?
-What?

653
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,964
I don't know. I haven't read it yet.

654
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:18,092
What? It's about us though.

655
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,178
He put a lot of effort into it.
You should read it.

656
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,597
I don't care about stuff like that.

657
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,473
Just get back to work.

658
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,142
[amusing music playing]

659
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,144
[Jeong-u] Your picture
came out really well.

660
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,106
PARAMEDICS ARE SO COOL

661
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,566
THEY'RE AMAZING
I'M GRATEFUL

MUDFLAT MAN

663
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,530
[phone vibrating]

664
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:05,056
I told you to just come in.
Why make it a hassle and call me out?

665
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,477
Everyone's busy working,
so I didn't want to bother them.

666
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,229
Do I not look busy?

667
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,481
[chuckles] That's not what I meant.

668
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,399
Please share this with the others.

669
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,193
We're civil servants.
We can't accept this.

670
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,154
I'm giving you this
as a fellow colleague, not a reporter,

671
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,698
even if it was just for a day.

672
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,908
Oh.

673
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,161
You're really good
at making it hard to refuse things.

674
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,289
Thank you. [chuckles softly]

675
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,501
Thank you for helping me
write that article.

676
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,962
I found my motivation again
thanks to you.

677
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,298
Me? What did I do?

678
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,842
Don't give anything up.

679
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,886
My dad passed away when I was young.

680
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,264
So I know what it's like.

681
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,724
If my mom ever sacrificed
anything for me,

682
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,060
I hated that the most.

683
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,521
Someone got out of his car,

684
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,982
and he directed traffic to clear the road.

685
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,150
He was like a superhero.

686
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,068
[chuckles softly]

687
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,237
-You just did.
-[Mo-eum] What?

688
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,239
I'll get going now.

689
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,241
Bye.

690
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,661
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

691
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,579
[heart thumping]

692
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,335
[amusing music playing]

693
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,129
-Dan-ho.
-Yes?

694
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,966
From now on,
don't wear that T-shirt anymore.

695
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,343
What? Why not?

696
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,095
If I say not to wear it, just don't.

697
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,055
[Mo-eum exclaims]

698
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,807
Is that the only shirt you have?

699
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,891
Is it your favorite?

700
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,520
No, but it's really soft and stretchy.

701
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,024
Yeah, sure. I'll buy you something nicer,
so don't wear it anymore.

702
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,191
Oh.

703
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,402
Why would you buy me clothes?

704
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,780
You said we were colleagues.

705
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,408
Colleagues can't buy each other shirts?

706
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,118
No, it's not about that.

707
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,119
[Mo-eum] Bye.

708
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,829
-What?
-Go on.

709
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,625
I need to get an ECG soon.

710
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,003
Something's wrong. [sighs]

711
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,343
But…

712
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,268
[drill whirs]

713
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,812
[mechanic] It's all fixed. [grunts]

714
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,522
[Hye-suk] Thank you so much.

715
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,941
But what caused it to break?

716
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,318
Well…

717
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,696
I found this inside the washer.

718
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,573
[Hye-suk] Goodness.

719
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,492
Wait.

720
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,328
Why would this be in…

721
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,206
[mechanic] I think
the spoon caused the issue.

722
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,916
It could've been really bad.

723
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,753
Thank you. Have a nice day.

724
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,672
-All right. Have a good day.
-[Hye-suk] Thank you very much.

725
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,383
-Thank you for your work.
-No problem.

726
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,760
-[Hye-suk] Have a nice day.
-[mechanic] You too.

727
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,472
-[Seung-hyo] Did something break?
-[Hye-suk] No, it was nothing.

728
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,641
[chuckles nervously] Hey, Seung-hyo.

729
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,311
-[door closes]
-Have you had trouble sleeping lately?

730
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,063
No. Why?

731
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,607
You look pale,
and your light stays on at night.

732
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,317
Oh.

733
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,027
I've been busy with work.

734
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,363
-[phone vibrating]
-I see. Poor thing.

735
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,281
Go ahead. Take it.

736
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,284
Hello?

737
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,370
Hey, Myeong-u.

738
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,748
What?

739
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,208
[tense music playing]

740
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,211
-Myeong-u!
-Hey, Mr. Choi.

741
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,089
They told us to stop construction?
What's going on?

742
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,842
The district office got a complaint
and said to stop now.

743
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,759
[Seung-hyo] Wait.

744
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,054
We got consent from everyone in the area.
Why would this happen?

745
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,597
Someone next door complained.

746
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,724
Right to light
and obstruction of view or whatever.

747
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,893
That's ridiculous.
I checked several times.

748
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,811
[Myeong-u] I know.

749
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,937
I discussed things already

750
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,022
with the official in charge
to not violate rules.

751
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,942
You did, but they said
the person in charge changed.

752
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:45,860
[sighs]

753
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,698
That means we have to
start everything over again.

754
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,326
Let's meet with the people
who filed the complaint first.

755
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,620
Persuading them will be the priority.

756
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,830
[man] Well, look at this!

757
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,584
Are the people trying to build
this great building finally here?

758
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,502
[whispering] Speak of the devil. It's him.

759
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,380
[in normal voice] Hello, sir.

760
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,467
I'm the CEO of the architectural firm
that designed this building.

761
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:14,221
May I ask about the kind of inconvenience
you had during construction?

762
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,599
There were so many, I can't name them all!

763
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,018
There's no need to discuss it.
Get rid of this now.

764
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,396
Sir, you agreed
to the construction last time.

765
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,482
I allowed you
to build a house on the land,

766
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,108
not to extend it into the sky!

767
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,943
They say you need
more sunlight as you age,

768
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,154
but this house will shorten my lifespan!

769
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,864
I only get a tiny bit of sun.

770
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,782
Half the sky's covered now.

771
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,159
You think that's all?

772
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,536
The ground has sloped.

773
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,455
And the flowers have wilted
from the noise.

774
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,832
Sure, fine. I can understand all that.

775
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,418
But we made the groundwater suddenly flow?

776
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,046
That's too much, isn't it?

777
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,257
[Na-yun] Still, to show us,

778
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,551
wasn't it funny when he came
with a bent wire hanger?

779
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,761
[all laughing]

780
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,931
Hey, it really was.

781
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,849
-It started to move!
-Yeah!

782
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,354
You two can both leave.

783
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,189
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

784
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,067
I think this was his plan from the start.

785
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,611
He asked a lot of questions
whenever we came on-site.

786
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,530
He looked at things very closely.

787
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,615
[sighs] What he really wants
is a settlement.

788
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,535
He agreed at first,
but now, he's having second thoughts.

789
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,870
Then, what do we do now?

790
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,501
But didn't we already obtain
the project cooperation agreement?

791
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,418
[gasps]

792
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,088
Yeah, we did
to prepare for something like this.

793
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:33,008
Even if there's a worst-case scenario
of a civil lawsuit, it can be dismissed.

794
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,344
Goodness! Why didn't I think of that?

795
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,845
Right? Hey, who obtained it?

796
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,806
-I did.
-[Myeong-u] Go and get it.

797
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,017
Let's take this chance to show them
the importance of a signed document.

798
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,019
-Stop smiling and go get it!
-Oh, me.

799
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,272
-I'll be right back.
-[Myeong-u] Okay.

800
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,232
[sighs] That should do it.

801
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,776
THE NOT-SO-SIMPLE CURIOSITY OF KANG DAN-HO
HEROES OF OUR TIME

802
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,902
[pleasant music playing]

803
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,780
[telephone ringing]

804
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,452
[chuckles softly]

805
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,624
[music distorts]

806
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,168
Just climb inside your monitor,
why don't you?

807
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,088
[Dan-ho exclaims] Why do you keep
popping up behind me?

808
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,381
It's going to cause problems.

809
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,676
-I'll report it as workplace harassment.
-I'll report you too.

810
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,887
I'll say a journalist is writing
with personal bias, not objectivity.

811
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,890
When did I ever do that?

812
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,602
You suddenly wanted
to write about your experiences…

813
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,353
because of her?

814
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,480
The paramedic you know?

815
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,649
-Well…
-[Yeong-in] I knew it.

816
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,360
I could sense the affection in your words.

817
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,653
And I was right. [claps hands]

818
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,947
It was due to your love for the subject.

819
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,407
It's not like that.

820
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,743
If there's any personal bias
in this article,

821
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,661
it's out of respect and reverence.

822
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,164
-Okay? Yeah.
-[Yeong-in] Yeah? Okay.

823
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,124
Is that so? I see.

824
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,500
[amusing music playing]

825
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,503
Gosh, but she really is pretty.

826
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,173
Good luck!

827
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,011
Complimenting someone's looks
is a form of judgment too.

828
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,139
[whispering] And don't wish me luck!

829
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,268
[man in normal voice] Good luck, Dan-ho.

830
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,688
Hey! Don't eavesdrop.

831
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,357
[man] It's because I can hear you.

832
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,610
-Stop.
-[man] What does she look like?

833
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,611
God.

834
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,946
[Mo-eum] "I could sense the true essence

835
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,616
of heroism from the spirit
of these paramedics."

836
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,868
"And I thought about it."

837
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,580
"If the Avengers had paramedics,

838
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,128
wouldn't they have defeated
Thanos more easily?"

839
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,463
Wow.

840
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,507
Nice article.

841
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,424
[Mo-eum] Hey.

842
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,219
It's not just nice.

843
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,848
This is a masterpiece
that will go down in history.

844
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:49,561
You can feel the authenticity of someone
who experienced things firsthand.

845
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,772
[chuckles softly]

846
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,526
Goodness, he worked so hard that day too.

847
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,113
With these little hands that have
probably only touched keyboards,

848
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,783
he wanted to do all he could to help out.

849
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,037
Goodness.
I think that's how he normally is.

850
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,832
He leads by example, and he's just.

851
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,921
Well, that's probably why
he was Mudflat Man.

852
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,258
You've fallen head over heels
for Mudflat Man.

853
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,761
You're knee-high in mud.
You won't be able to free yourself easily.

854
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,720
What?

855
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,890
Did you know you've been talking
about him for 30 minutes now?

856
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,475
Hey, that's because…

857
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,270
[laughing] Hey, you!

858
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,232
That was because it's a good article.

859
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,026
[laughingly] It was praise
for his professionalism.

860
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,361
[amusing music playing]

861
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,363
Gosh, that's so funny.

862
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:50,664
People usually look cool
when they excel at their job.

863
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,669
Even Seung-hyo looks all right
when he's designing.

864
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,713
What are you talking about?

865
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,799
Seung-hyo? Don't be ridiculous.

866
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,884
Hey.

867
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,219
Has he said anything recently?

868
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,347
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a while.

869
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,141
Really?

870
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,355
Yes, that's right.

871
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,441
Yes.

872
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,904
-Yes, I understand.
-[line disconnects]

873
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,198
-What did the official say?
-It's as expected.

874
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,327
They have no choice but to stop things
when they get a complaint.

875
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,579
They said we should reach a settlement.

876
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,165
Should I meet with him again?

877
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,834
If it's not possible, we'll just settle it
at a reasonable price.

878
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:36,752
No.

879
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,881
More people will try to exploit us
if we give in to unreasonable demands.

880
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,717
We can't create a bad precedent.

881
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,594
-[knock on door]
-[sighs softly]

882
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,304
Come in.

883
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,225
[Seung-hyo] Hey.

884
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,560
-Did you bring the agreement?
-[door closes]

885
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,437
Well… [exhales]

886
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,399
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

887
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,735
The agreement…

888
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,403
I lost it.

889
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,614
-What?
-[Myeong-u] What?

890
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,158
[stuttering] Where did it go?

891
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,494
I have no idea.

892
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,746
I got it that day
and put it somewhere safe.

893
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,249
I checked the bookshelf,
my desk, and the trunk of my car.

894
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,668
I spent hours looking for it,
but I can't find it.

895
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,213
Are you kidding me?
Is this the best you can do?

896
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,549
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry is not enough!

897
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,676
You think an apology will fix this?

898
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,969
-Myeong-u, wait.
-I mean…

899
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,303
Don't get worked up. Calm down.

900
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,138
-Hyeong-chan.
-Yes?

901
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,100
Do you understand
the gravity of your mistake?

902
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,686
I've caused significant damage
to the company.

903
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,020
You're not wrong.

904
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,982
Delaying construction
will push the schedule back

905
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,692
and increase costs.

906
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,486
But do you know
what's more important than that?

907
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,072
I don't know, sir.

908
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,865
Go and think about it.

909
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,869
And come back when you find that answer.

910
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,954
Yes, sir.

911
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,832
I'm sorry.

912
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,712
[door closes]

913
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,506
But what's the answer?
I don't know what it is either.

914
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,259
[sighs] This is driving me crazy.

915
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,599
[Mi-suk] Did you drop money on the ground?

916
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,478
-Why do you have your head down?
-Hi, Aunt Mi-suk.

917
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,147
Have you had dinner?

918
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,774
[exhales]

919
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:29,531
Why would you feed me?
Aren't you mad at me for deceiving you?

920
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,075
I don't understand myself either.

921
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,621
But what can I do?
I can tell something's up with you.

922
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,499
How did you know?

923
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,877
I raised you myself.

924
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,420
You're like my child.

925
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,299
Aunt Mi-suk,

926
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,469
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about Seok-ryu.

927
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,721
That wasn't your fault.

928
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,557
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

929
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,101
But the thing is…

930
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,022
Seok-ryu's really serious about it.

931
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,941
You cut me some slack.
Can't you do the same for her?

932
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,570
Eat up.

933
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,782
You're abandoning me
because you don't want to hear it?

934
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,826
There's a neighborhood meeting.
I'll get fined if I miss it.

935
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,744
A fine?

936
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,913
How much is it?

937
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,709
How much will it cost
to sit at a table with you?

938
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,796
You little… How dare you flaunt your money
by impersonating Han Suk-kyu?

939
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,716
-Eat as much as you want.
-[Seung-hyo] Okay.

940
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,386
[clicks tongue]

941
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,768
[door opens]

942
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,770
[door closes]

943
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,481
[door opens]

944
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,233
[footsteps approaching]

945
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,704
-I didn't know you were home.
-I didn't know you were here either.

946
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,706
Where's my mom?

947
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,375
-She went to a neighborhood meeting.
-I see.

948
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,420
Eat up.

949
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,380
Why are you avoiding me?

950
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:09,881
I'm not.

951
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,218
I came to the kitchen
to drink something, but I forgot.

952
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,222
DAEHAN MILK

953
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:20,726
Hey, Choisseung.

954
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,437
What?

955
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,440
Throw out that milk.

956
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,568
What?

957
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,070
I'm answering you in advance.

958
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,114
To me,

959
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,283
you can't be more than a friend.

960
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,871
Is that all you have to say?

961
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,206
Yeah, I'm sorry.

962
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,419
There's no room for reconsideration?

963
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,465
No.

964
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,341
[emotional music playing]

965
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,636
It'll be awkward for a few days,
but it'll get better soon.

966
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:02,225
Our friendship wouldn't break that easily
over something like this.

967
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:10,942
Eat and put the dishes
in the sink before you leave.

968
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,197
Friendship?

969
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,200
There's no such thing as that anymore.

970
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,285
[slow pop song playing]

971
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,418
[exhales]

972
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,113
Hyeon-jun,

973
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,658
do you remember when I first got sick?

974
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,578
They removed two-thirds of my stomach

975
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,082
and I lost ten kilograms
after starting chemotherapy.

976
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,378
Chemotherapy…

977
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,964
I hear it's hard.

978
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,674
It's okay.

979
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,218
I dealt with surgery pretty easily.

980
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,430
I'm Bae Seok-ryu. I'll overcome this.

981
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,516
Don't worry.

982
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,275
Once I recover,

983
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,111
should we go to Salar de Uyuni?

984
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,696
-Uyuni?
-Yeah.

985
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,865
No, wait.

986
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,954
Should we go to Peru
to visit Machu Picchu?

987
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,747
Machu Picchu.

988
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,499
-Peru.
-Where do you want to go?

989
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,085
-We can visit both.
-Both?

990
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,504
Sounds good.

991
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,515
-I applied to return to work.
-Already?

992
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,561
I'm all better now,
so I should go back to work.

993
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,730
Aren't you overdoing it?

994
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,941
I can't stay like this forever.

995
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,110
So what if I was sick?

996
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,862
I can overcome anything with my will.

997
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,657
[chuckles softly]

998
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,452
[Hyeon-jun] Seok-ryu, you're incredible.

999
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,746
It's what I thought as I watched you.

1000
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,207
You're so much stronger
and more resilient than I thought.

1001
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,585
I really respect you.

1002
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:35,962
And I love you.

1003
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,759
[song continues playing]

1004
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,451
Seok-ryu.

1005
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:10,956
Raymond invited us
to his vacation home in Palm Springs.

1006
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,082
He said to come with you.

1007
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,501
[weakly] I just want to stay at home.

1008
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,044
Don't be like that. Let's go.

1009
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,254
We haven't gone anywhere for a while.

1010
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,132
It's always been
the hospital, home, and work.

1011
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,009
[weakly] No, I don't want to.

1012
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:28,556
The doctor said plenty of sunlight
would help with the depression.

1013
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,228
Have you been actively attending
your therapy sessions?

1014
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,105
Are you taking your meds?

1015
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:36,856
Yeah.

1016
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,484
Okay.

1017
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,445
That way, you'll get better.

1018
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,241
I'll tell Raymond we can't go.

1019
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,702
I'll say we're busy with the wedding.

1020
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,203
[solemn music playing]

1021
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,872
By the way, did you hear?

1022
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,126
Well, it's about why she took
a break from work three years ago.

1023
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,587
That? That was quite big,
what happened to her.

1024
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,260
[whispering] She has stomach cancer.

1025
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:06,720
[Susan] Really?

1026
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,638
-[Chris] Yeah, to think…
-[Susan sighs]

1027
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:12,350
…she returned to the office
after literally working herself to death,

1028
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,354
I don't know
whether to call it crazy or…

1029
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,440
-Oh, crazy.
-[Susan chuckles]

1030
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,983
[Peter] Talk about a loyal dog.

1031
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,026
[Chris] Exactly.

1032
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,070
That girl really doesn't know
how to take care of herself, huh?

1033
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,363
[exhales]

1034
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,532
Poor little girl.

1035
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,159
[music continues playing]

1036
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,747
[people laughing]

1037
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,629
[Seok-ryu breathing heavily]

1038
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,019
What do you think you're doing?

1039
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,272
[Hyeon-jun] Seok-ryu?

1040
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,527
[breathes deeply]

1041
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,156
[breathes deeply]

1042
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,247
How could you not trust me?

1043
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,750
Why didn't you pick up your phone then?

1044
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,545
You're the one who ghosted me first.

1045
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,963
Still…

1046
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,509
Did you really have to show up like that?

1047
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,718
What?

1048
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,054
Are you embarrassed of me?

1049
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,724
-Are you ashamed?
-[Hyeon-jun] No, it's not that.

1050
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,561
Everyone I work with was there.

1051
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,525
As my fiancée,
you should've considered my perspective.

1052
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,276
Am I really your fiancée though?

1053
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,947
-What?
-Your fiancée is sick.

1054
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,243
She's going through a hard time.
But you wanted to go to a party?

1055
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,622
You don't care about how I feel.

1056
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,000
Did you want to have fun
with others at that party?

1057
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,168
Yeah.

1058
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,254
I did.

1059
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,173
Please let me breathe!

1060
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,596
When you became sick,

1061
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,473
I gave up everything.

1062
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,143
I took time off work
and cared for you.

1063
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,645
I put golf, traveling,
my friends, and my life on hold.

1064
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,189
I thought things would be fine
if I endured a little more.

1065
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,860
Because you're strong.
Because you're going to beat this!

1066
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:27,777
We…

1067
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,614
Because we'll overcome it together.

1068
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,074
But suddenly, what?

1069
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,286
[sighs wearily] This goddamn depression…

1070
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,002
"This goddamn depression"?

1071
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,297
Is that what you were thinking?

1072
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,884
You said you understood me.

1073
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,677
How can I?

1074
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,847
How can I understand you?

1075
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,767
You finished your treatment,
but now, you're not yourself.

1076
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,979
You're not the Seok-ryu I know.
How can I accept that?

1077
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,023
Please snap out of it.

1078
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,067
How long are you going to struggle
with that depression for?

1079
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,029
If you drag me down
with you to the bottom,

1080
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,530
are you going to stop then?

1081
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,327
[music fades]

1082
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,625
[sighs]

1083
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,126
Seok-ryu.

1084
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,337
Look, what I just said…

1085
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,005
I'm already at rock bottom.

1086
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,966
Hyeon-jun.

1087
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,471
I just witnessed our rock bottom.

1088
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,944
[slow music playing]

1089
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,529
The ring's too big.

1090
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:57,158
-It fit perfectly back then.
-It's because you've lost weight.

1091
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,246
It's okay. Let's go back
to the US and get it resized.

1092
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,250
[Seok-ryu] We can fix the ring,

1093
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,754
but we can't fix our relationship.

1094
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,382
Seok-ryu.

1095
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,301
I'm really sorry

1096
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,720
for what happened back then.

1097
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,139
It was so hard for me.

1098
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,644
-I was tired and out of my mind.
-You don't have to apologize to me.

1099
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,731
You really tried your best.

1100
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,817
I know that better than anyone.

1101
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,780
It's just too much for me.

1102
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,617
You know,

1103
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:43,288
I'm going to worry
about a recurrence next year

1104
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,498
and the year after that.

1105
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,253
Even if I remain
in complete remission for five years,

1106
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,215
I won't be completely free.

1107
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,512
I'll always be near death's door.

1108
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,350
I'm going to feel
a little anxious and sad.

1109
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,523
That's how my life's going to be.

1110
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,985
That's why…

1111
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,446
I don't need love anymore.

1112
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,699
The stomach I have left

1113
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,036
can barely handle digesting my dream.

1114
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,008
[sighs deeply]

1115
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,776
[doctor] The endoscopy showed
some inflammation where the surgery was.

1116
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,986
It's highly likely
to be just inflammation,

1117
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,572
but we've conducted a biopsy to be sure.

1118
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,282
The results will be out in a few days.

1119
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,827
Good job.

1120
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,122
It was the right thing to do.

1121
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,792
This is right.

1122
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,274
[slow music fades]

1123
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,784
What is it?

1124
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,661
Is my food not good?

1125
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,079
It's not that.

1126
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,457
I have no appetite.

1127
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,836
Still, you should eat.

1128
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:58,798
Balanced growth and development
are a child's responsibility.

1129
01:01:58,881 --> 01:01:59,924
[Yeon-du scoffs]

1130
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:02,051
Children have too many responsibilities.

1131
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,388
I have to eat this carrot.

1132
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,765
I have to brush my teeth.

1133
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,183
And I have to sleep early.

1134
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,184
[chuckles softly]

1135
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:12,103
[phone vibrating]

1136
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:14,772
YEON-DU'S BABYSITTER

1137
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,607
Hello?

1138
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,778
Oh, are you okay?

1139
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,282
Of course, your health is most important.

1140
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,952
You should go to the hospital.
Let me know when you know the results.

1141
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,788
Okay.

1142
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,708
-[line disconnects]
-What was that about?

1143
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,503
Your babysitter fell in the bathroom
and hurt her back.

1144
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,007
I guess you're hanging out with me today.

1145
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,843
You said you had
an important interview today.

1146
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,763
There's nothing
more important to me than you.

1147
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,058
No, you should go.

1148
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,144
I have a friend I can play with.

1149
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,396
Who?

1150
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,939
[quirky music playing]

1151
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,483
You want to hang out with me?

1152
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,484
-Yes.
-[Mo-eum gasps]

1153
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,780
I'd love that! I'm so happy! But…

1154
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,072
What do I do?

1155
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,283
I have something important to do today.

1156
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,035
I was on my way out.

1157
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,870
[Dan-ho] I'm sorry.

1158
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,914
It was an unreasonable request, wasn't it?

1159
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,503
Yeon-du, let's hang out
with Ms. Jung next time.

1160
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,338
Wait!

1161
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,466
I have a good idea.

1162

[exclaims]

1163
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,309
[Jae-suk] Mo-eum called to let me know.
Don't worry. Leave her with us.

1164
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,602
-Hi, Yeon-du.
-Thank you.

1165
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,103
Sit between them.

1166
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,688
[In-suk] You're so cute.

1167
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,191
I couldn't come empty-handed.
Please accept this.

1168
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,819
[Jae-suk] Goodness.
You didn't have to buy this.

1169
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,070
But what is it?

1170
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:47,657
It's a health supplement.
It helps with managing your blood sugar.

1171
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,325
Goodness.

1172
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:53,120
My blood sugar does spike after a meal.
This is the perfect gift.

1173
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,747
Thank you so much.

1174
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,834
Can we all try it?

1175
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,377
-[Jae-suk laughing]
-Yes, of course.

1176
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,294
Thank you.

1177
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,672
I know it's shameless of me,

1178
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,383
but please take good care of Yeon-du.

1179
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,759
[Jae-suk] Don't worry.

1180
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,261
Yeon-du, I'll be back later.

1181
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,720
Have a good day.

1182
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,890
Drive carefully and don't trip again.

1183
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,684
-Okay.
-[Jae-suk] Goodness.

1184
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,394
Have a great day.

-The scissors.
-Okay.

1186
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,189
Can I drink two?

1187
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,482
Just drink one.

1188
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,860
-Jae-suk, who was that?
-Our neighbor.

1189
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,028
-[Hye-suk] Your client?
-[Jae-suk] He was.

1190

01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,492
-Do you want one?
-No, I'm fine.

01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,451
[In-suk] Why not?

Kang Yeon-du.

1195
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,875
I was born in the spring.

1196
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,669
My name means "to live with vitality,"

1197
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:45,131
like the vibrant color of the first leaves
that emerge after winter.

1198
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,550
What a great name.

1199
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,468
You're smart and clever, aren't you?

1200
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,804
Her dad's a journalist,
so she's smart too.

1201
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,432
So that's why you said he was off-limits.

1202
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:55,766
[Jae-suk] Yeah.

1203
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,767

01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,020
Let's have a blast today.

We can't be the only ones
enjoying something.

1206
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:02,565
Right?

1207
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:03,900
Here.

1208
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,484
Auntie got this as a free gift.

1209
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,612
You're more like a granny than an auntie.

1210
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:08,863
-What?
-[Mi-suk] Goodness.

1211
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:09,780
Granny?

1212
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,157
[Mi-suk laughing]

1213
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,536
Hey, people still think
I'm in my early forties.

1214
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,371
I don't know.

1215
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,749
They say the eyes of children
are the most honest.

1216
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,501
I bet she could become a reporter
like her dad.

1217
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,003
She's brutally honest.

1218

-[all chuckling]
-I should increase my collagen intake.

1219
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,717
Anyway, you can have this.

1220
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,929
-Thank you.
-[laughing]

1221
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,890
-Can kids eat red ginseng?
-[In-suk] Of course.

1222
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,059
It has good ingredients.

1223
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:40,311
What was it called again?

1224
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,520
[amusing music playing]

1225
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,730
Saffron.

1226
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,900
You consume so much medicine,
and you still don't know that?

1227
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,943
What?

1228
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:50,655
It's not saffron.
Are you sure it's not saponin?

1229
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,156
[In-suk] Yeah, it is.

1230
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,116
I thought it was saponin too.

1231
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,785
-Saponin…
-[Hye-suk] I…

1232
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,578
That's what I said too.

1233
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,372
-Yeah, right.
-[all laughing]

1234
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,374
You said it was saffron.

1235
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,793
No, my pronunciation was bad.

-Hey.

1237
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,546
-Hey.
-Are you joking?

1238
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,840
I can see how you could've misheard me.

1239
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:10,925
No way.

1241
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,808
It's saffron.
That sounds like the name of a detergent.

1242
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,102
I know it's saponin too.

1243
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,520
Saponin!

1244
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,605

[all laughing]

1246
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,778
Saffron is a spice. It's very expensive.

Where's this from?

Sir, didn't you say
you couldn't make it today?

1260
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:24,540
Are you trying to sell
this unverified product to people?

1261
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,541
What?

1262
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,835
Oh.

1263

I got an offer to promote it,

I want you out of my gym.

Excuse me?

You're all show and no substance.
You only care about appearances.

Isn't that harsh?

What? Am I wrong?

1278
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,587
You should be helping with sincerity

and taking responsibility
for someone's health.

-[Seul-gi] What?

It's because of punks like you

1283

that others take our work lightly.

1284
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,978

Hi.

I'm sure today was sudden. I'm very sorry.

Was it hard looking after Yeon-du?

Not at all.

After dealing with
grown, disgusting kids for so long,

1400

looking after a baby was so pleasant.

Okay. I have to wake her
and take her home though.

-Let me watch her for a little more.
-Yeah, okay.

1411
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:08,295
[exclaims]

1412
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:19,181
No matter how much I see her,
I just want to see her some more.

1413
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,474
[chuckles softly]

1414
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:23,268
How is she so pretty?

1415
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,272
Her eyes are pretty.

1416
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:28,857
Her nose is pretty.

1417
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,818
Every part of her is pretty.

1418
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,908
Right? I know she's my daughter,
but she amazes me every time I see her.

1419
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,368
[Mo-eum chuckles softly]

1420
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:42,371
I wish Yeon-du was my daughter too.

1421
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,331
-Yeah…
-[Mo-eum chuckles softly]

1422
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,792
[amusing music playing]

1423
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,294
-What?
-That's not what I meant.

1424
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,588
I just meant she's so pretty.

1425
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,924
Right. I got it.
I didn't get the wrong idea.

1426
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:54,925
Okay.

1427
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:12,776
[music fades]

1428
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,993
[in normal voice] How cute.
You haven't changed at all.

1429
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:22,953
Excuse me?

1430
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:24,079
What?

1431
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,539
What did I just say?

1432
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,624
You said I was cute.

1433
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:31,128
Well, all animals and people
are cute as babies.

1434
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,589
-[chuckles nervously]
-I see. [chuckles nervously]

1435
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,132
That must be Mr. Choi next to you.

1436
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:37,050
This must be your neighborhood friend.

1437
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,719
The three of you must be very close.

1438
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:40,012
[Mo-eum] Yes.

1439
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,388
Those two were friends first.

1440
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:44,683
I started hanging out with them
after I moved here.

1441
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,602
You visit each other's houses often too?

1442
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:47,853
Yes, of course.

1443
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,565
That reminds me.

1444
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:55,652
Aside from Seung-hyo,
you're the first man to be in my room.

1445
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,906
Man?

1446
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:00,991
Goodness.

1447
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:02,659
[quirky music playing]

1448
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:04,870
-Why did I say that?
-[exhales softly]

1449
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,414
Well… Come to think of it,
this isn't the first time.

1450
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:08,457
Ah…

1451
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:12,127
A technician came in here to fix
the air conditioner when it broke.

1452
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,046
He was a man.

1453
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,716
All of my nephews are boys too.
I must've overlooked them. [chuckles]

1454
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:18,967
-I see.
-[Mo-eum] Yeah.

1455
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:21,053
[chuckles nervously]

1456
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,766
[Jae-suk] Mo-eum, come and eat!

1457
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:29,269
Dan-ho, stay for dinner!

1458
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,772
-Would you like to eat dinner?
-Dinner?

1459
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,482
My mom's a great cook.

1460
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,567
Dinner sounds good. [chuckles nervously]

1461
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,320
-Should I wake Yeon-du first?
-Sure.

1462
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:39,321
Wake her up.

1463
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,074
[Dan-ho] Yeon-du, wake up.

1464
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,408
[Yeon-du groans softly]

1465
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,493
[Dan-ho] Open your eyes.

1466
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,536
-[Yeon-du groans softly]
-Please.

1467
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,414
[exhales]

1468
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:58,799
[inhales]

1469
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:13,563
[grunts softly]

1470
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:20,987
[soft music playing]

1471
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:25,325
You asked me how I'm always there to see
your life's embarrassing moments.

1472
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,666
How are you always there when I'm sick?

1473
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:48,849
[exhales]

1474
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:50,767
[grunts softly]

1475
01:18:58,358 --> 01:18:59,401
[Seok-ryu] Are you up?

1476
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,447
Are you okay?

1477
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,240
Why are you here?

1478
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:10,412
-Why would you barge into my room?
-I mean…

1479
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:14,374
Mr. Yoon said you were really out of it.

1480
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:18,670
He called to say
you nearly passed out before going home.

1481
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,339
I came and rang the doorbell.

1482
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,799
No one came to the door.

1483
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:27,721
You could've called me if you were sick.

1484
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:29,848
Why would you suffer on your own?

1485
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,475
I'm not going to call you anymore.

1486
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,435
Even if something happens,

1487
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,145
whatever the reason,

1488
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,564
it won't happen again.

1489
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,526
So just go.

1490
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:42,611
Do whatever you want.

1491
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,406
Even if you cut ties with me, eat first.

1492
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,076
Do you have any food in the fridge?
I'll go and check.

1493
01:19:58,168 --> 01:19:59,127
[exhales]

1494
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:11,932
What do the people in this house eat?

1495
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:20,649
[Seung-hyo] Seriously?

1496
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,285
What's this?

1497
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,412
[papers rustling]

1498
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,053
DIAGNOSIS

1499
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,433
JUNE 24, 2024
PARTIAL GASTRECTOMY FOR STOMACH CANCER

1500
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:57,394
[emotional music playing]

1501
01:20:57,477 --> 01:20:59,813
ADMITTED WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN
OUTPATIENT SURGERY

1502
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:02,983
BAE SEOK-RYU

1503
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:05,193
Hey, your fridge was totally empty.

1504
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,654
I'll run to my house and get some…

1505
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:13,994
What is this?

1506
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,540
Hey. This is a mistake, right?

1507
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,875
Why is your name on here?

1508
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,793
I should've gone home first.

1509
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,336
It was a hassle, so I just came up.

1510
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,797
What on earth is this?

1511
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,174
Don't you know? It's a diagnosis.

1512
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:30,969
I needed it for something.

1513
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:35,974
I should've taken it that day.
I had to make a second trip there.

1514
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:39,769
Was this it?

1515
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,063
Is this why you came back?

1516
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:47,444
[sighs] This is why
I didn't want to tell you.

1517
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:53,658
[exhales] Hey, I don't care.

1518
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:57,162
I'll never tell you anyway
even if I tell everyone else in the world.

1519
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:00,540
Are you sick?

1520
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,667
I was sick.

1521
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,921
-And now?
-I'm okay.

1522
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,340
[sighs softly]

1523
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:09,424
You…

1524
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:11,051
[emotional music continues playing]

1525
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,261
How could you not tell me about this?

1526
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,139
Because of this.

1527
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:19,976
-I was afraid you'd act like this.
-Hey…

1528
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:23,021
[voice shaking] This is how little
I meant to you?

1529
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,983
Even as a friend,
I meant this little to you?

1530
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:29,736
You're sick.
I didn't mean to make it worse.

1531
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:30,654
You should rest.

1532
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:33,615
[sniffles] I'll ask Mo-eum
to buy you some porridge.

1533
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:35,283
Get some rest!

1534
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,368
[exhales]

1535
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:44,000
I have to go home.

1536
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:45,669
We need to talk.

1537
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:46,920
Let's talk later.

1538
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:48,630
How can I wait until later?

1539
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:52,592
You…

1540
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,053
How could you do this to me?

1541
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:57,639
Seok-ryu.

1542
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,226
How much longer
were you going to put this off for?

1543
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:06,606
How long were you going to hide this for?

1544
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,900
Seung-hyo. [inhales]

1545
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,820
[voice shaking] This doesn't make sense!

1546
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:16,950
How could you go through something
like that without telling anyone?

1547
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:24,457
Stomach cancer surgery is serious.
How could you not tell anyone?

1548
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,668
[Mi-suk] Who has cancer?

1549
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,004
[door closes]

1550
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,880
[emotional music continues playing]

1551
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,133
[Seok-ryu's breath trembling]

1552
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:39,264
[Mi-suk] I heard it from outside.
Stomach cancer?

1553
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:42,017
Who has cancer?

1554
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:49,691
Who has cancer?

1555
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,120
Is it you?

1556
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,337
Is it really you?

1557
01:24:16,509 --> 01:24:19,137
[whimpering]

1558
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:25,852
[both crying hysterically]

1559
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:38,490
[Seok-ryu] To be honest, the first person
I wanted to call was Seung-hyo.

1560
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,243
Just like when I'd fall
and scrape my knee,

1561
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,413
I wanted my mom to hold me as I cried.

1562
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:51,127
If I had, would it have made the cancer
seems like it was no big deal?

1563
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,797
Could I have brushed it off
and gotten back up?

1564
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,216
[emotional music playing]

1565
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:57,550
I mean it when I say

1566
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,136
that I really wanted to live.

1567
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:05,016
DARKNESS IN LIFE

1568
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,895
LIGHT OF LIFE

1569
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,897
[slow pop song playing]

1570
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:45,932
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1571
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:49,936
[Seung-hyo] Back then,
I should've run to Seok-ryu.

1572
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:53,356
She sent all those signals in the dark,

1573
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:54,983
and I missed them all.

1574
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:56,109
[Seok-ryu] Mom!

1575
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:57,360
If their child is sick,

1576
01:25:57,443 --> 01:26:00,029
a parent would go
to the moon or Mars for them.

1577
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,614
[Mo-eum] You said it was okay to cry.

1578
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,324
I'll keep it secret too.

1579
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:08,413
[Seung-hyo] You hurt
the people who love you.

1580
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,708
[Seok-ryu] You don't know anything!

1581
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,918
You don't know how I feel!

1582
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:18,089
[Seung-hyo] When things are really tough,
