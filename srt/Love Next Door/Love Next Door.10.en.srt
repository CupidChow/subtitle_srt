[humming]

4
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:10,820
What's this?

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,365
Hye-suk's things must've got into my bag.

6
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,328
What is this? It's all in English.

7
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,624
Does she carry this around
to show off how she can read it?

8
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,584
She's such a brat. [clicks tongue]

9
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,463
[magazine rustling]

10
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,427

[groans softly]

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43,853
Where was Seok-ryu's
old electronic dictionary?

13
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,153
Why does she have so much medicine?

14

[solemn music playing]

-[pills rattling]
-Are they all vitamins? What are these?

16
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,287
Damn it. These are all in English too.

17
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,372

HYE-SUK

20
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,880
Jeez, you brat. Speak of the devil.

21
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,716
Hey, Hye-suk.

22
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,053
What? Seung-hyo's sick?

23
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,723
-Thank you so much.
-[scoffs]

24
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,600
He's sick.

25
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,645
But how can I make him porridge?
I've never tried.

26
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,315
You made a good decision.
He always gets sick around this time.

27
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,650
-Really?
-Yeah.

28
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,527
Strangely,
it's always in summer, not winter.

29
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,487
He had a fever of 40 degrees once.

30
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,198
Geun-sik and I had to carry him
to your husband's hospital.

00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,199
[exhales]

32
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,702
By the way, I almost forgot.

33
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,997
You left a magazine
written in English in my bag.

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,039
A magazine?

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,041
I never did that.

36
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,459
You probably took it.

37
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,588
Why would I take that? It's useless.

38
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,008
-[Seung-hyo] We need to talk.
-[Seok-ryu] Let's talk later.

39
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,885
I think Seok-ryu's inside.

40
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,512
-Seok-ryu's here?
-Yeah.

41
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,681
[Seung-hyo] How long
were you going to hide this for?

42
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,100
Seung-hyo. [inhales]

43
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,853
[voice shaking] This doesn't make sense.

44
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,025
How could you go through something
like that without telling anyone?

45
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,532
Stomach cancer surgery is serious.
How could you not tell anyone?

46
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,618
[Mi-suk] Who has cancer?

47
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,412

49
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,588
[Mi-suk] I heard it from outside.

50
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,547
Stomach cancer?

51
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,425
Who has cancer?

52
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,016
Who has cancer?

53
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,112
Is it you?

54
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,621
Is it really you?

55
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,545

-Seok-ryu, let's go to the hospital.

59
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,995
-Hye-suk, call your husband.
-Okay.

60
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,038
Tell him we're coming right now, okay?

61
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,415
-[Hye-suk] Okay.
-Mom, I'm fine.

62
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,624
I don't have to go.

63
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,876
What do you mean? Why not?

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,838
Seung-hyo, get the car.
We have to go to the hospital now.

65
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,173
No, Mom. I'm fine.

66
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,175
I already had the surgery. I'm okay.

67
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,139
What are you talking about? When?

68
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,808
[voice shaking] Three years ago.

69
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,021
Three years ago?
But that's when you were in the US.

70
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,690
No way.

71
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,359
How could I not know about that?

72
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,030
[Mi-suk's breath trembling]

73
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,825
Is it true?

74
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,952
Really?

75
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,582
[voice shaking] I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm so sorry.

76
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,922
Seung-hyo, did you know?

77
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,051
Did you both lie to me again this time?

78
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,721
[voice shaking] No, I didn't know.
I just found out.

79
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,764

-Mi-suk!

00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,101
Mi-suk, are you okay?

82
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,811
-Mi-suk.
-[Seok-ryu] Mom!

83
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,564
-[Hye-suk] Where are you going, Mi-suk?
-[Seok-ryu] Mom!

84
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,732
-Mom!
-[Hye-suk] Mi-suk!

85
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,070

Mom! Listen to me!

89
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,085
I can explain everything.

90
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,669
Okay? Mom, please!

91
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,213
-Please, don't.
-[Mi-suk] Honey.

92
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,133
-[Geun-sik] What?
-Honey, she has cancer.

What are you talking about?

96
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,601
Hey, what did your mom say?

97
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,687
[breathing heavily]

98
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,564
She had stomach cancer.

99
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,944
She received surgery
three years ago without telling us.

100
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,904
That's ridiculous.

101
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,697

Seok-ryu.

104
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,211
-It's not true, is it?
-[Seok-ryu sniffles]

105
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,256
[Geun-sik] It's not true, right?

106
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,050
This is… [chuckles nervously] No. No way.

107
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,635
What on earth are you saying?

108
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,347
[Dong-jin] Hey, Seok-ryu.
This is a prank, right?

109
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,724
Why would you joke
about something serious like that?

110
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,101
[Mi-suk groans]

111
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,060
[exhales]

112
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,230

[breathing heavily]

120
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,893
Is this why you didn't want to
go to the bathhouse?

121
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,769
Mom, this…

122
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,855
It'll fade.

123
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,318
They said it'll hardly
be noticeable later.

124
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,736
[pills rattling]

125
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,988
What are all these pills?

126
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,823
Why do you have so much?

127
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,617
-Is it because you're sick?
-[Seok-ryu] No.

128
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,285
I'm not sick at all now.

129
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,120
[Mi-suk] Then, why do you have so much?

130
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,165
They're just liver supplements,
probiotics, and vitamins.

131
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,918
Don't leave anything out
and tell me the truth.

132
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,003
What happened to you?

133
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,880
Three years ago,

134
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,799
I had a health checkup in the US.

135
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,886
-And I was diagnosed with stomach cancer.
-[cries]

136
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,848
I had surgery,
and it turned out to be stage 2.

137
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,519
I underwent chemotherapy as a precaution.

138
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,690
But I overcame it.
I'm completely fine now.

139
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,070
Is that why your engagement
was called off? Because you were sick?

140
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,782
-[voice shaking] I'll kill that bastard!
-[Seok-ryu] No, it wasn't like that.

141
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,535
He stayed by my side while I was sick.

142
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,537
He took time off work
and cared for me.

143
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,913
And…

144
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,542
I didn't want to make him suffer anymore.

145
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,963
-So I called the marriage off.
-Do you think parents are a joke?

146
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,173
How…

147
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,635
How could you hide
something like this from us?

148
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,554
I wasn't trying to.

149
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,932
I was going to get treated in the US.

150
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,811
-You'd only worry if you knew.
-Who cares if it was the US?

151
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,437
If their child is sick,

152
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,023
a parent would go
to the moon or Mars for them.

153
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,361
How dare you be so arrogant
and pretend you did this for us?

154
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,321
[voice shaking] Mom.

155
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,239
[Mi-suk] Listen.

156
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,826
You were once a part of me.

157
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,454
While you were in my womb,
you ate the food I ate.

158
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,832
And you drank the water
I drank as you grew.

159
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,874
[sniffles]

160
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,712
I endured 20 hours of labor
before an emergency C-section.

161
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,797
But how could you not tell me
you were sick?

162
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,508
[voice shaking] How? How could I not know?

163
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,801
[sniffles]

164
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,511
I'm sorry, Mom. [crying]

165
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,930
Dad, I'm sorry.

166
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,975
[voice shaking] You should've told us.

167
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,687
You should've told us what was happening.

168
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,357
No matter how useless we are
as your parents…

169
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,153
Still, we should've known.

170
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,072
She thinks she's better than us,
so she doesn't see us as her parents.

171
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,700
No, don't say that. [crying]

172
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,747
I just couldn't tell you.
I couldn't bear to do it.

173
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,083
I wanted to tell you after I got better.

174
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,712
That's what happened.

175
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,838
[sniffles]

176
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,801
I was wrong, Mom. I'm sorry.

177

[cries]

178
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,304
Goodness.

179
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,432
[whimpering, crying]

180
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,767
[emotional music playing]

181
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,394
-[Dong-jin] Mom.

[sniffles]

184
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:49,940
Seok-ryu.

[whimpering, sniffles]

186
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,450
[voice shaking] Are you really okay now?

187
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,869
There aren't any problems, right?

188
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:06,123
Yeah, I'm healthy now. I'm fine.

189
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,543
You don't have to worry.

190
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,837
Okay. [sniffles]

191
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,756
Then, that'll do.

192
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,257
[Seok-ryu groans softly]

193
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,634
That'll do.

194
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,552
[breath trembling]

195
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,596
[breathing heavily]

196
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,812
[breath trembling]

197
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,527
Mom, drink some water.

198
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,743
[breath trembling]

199
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,916

00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,560
[groans softly]

205
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,147
[sniffles, exhales]

206
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,570
[playing drums]

207
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,540
[faint drum sounds]

208
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,809
[faint drum sounds continue]

[playing drums]

214
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,350
Choisseung was going to
bring me something, so--

215
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,643
[Mi-suk] Talk to him later!

216
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,103
People will talk if they see you here.

217
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,438
Mom.

218
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,899
Are you ashamed of me?

219
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,985
That's right.
I don't even want to see your face.

220
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,154
You're sleeping all day
and fooling around.

221
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,532
Didn't it ever occur to you to wonder

222
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,242
how sleep-deprived I must've been?

223
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,995
Or how little fun I must have had
all these years to fool around like that?

224
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,623
Everyone has it hard. You're not special.

225
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,166
Try having kids of your own.

226
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,627
See if you can treat
your sick child that way.

227
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,880
-Are you taking his side again?
-[objects clattering]

228
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,632
Is being sick that big of a deal?

229
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,676
[continues playing drum]

230
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,226

[groans]

234
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,328
[crying] Why my Seok-ryu?

235
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,622
Why did she have to get cancer?

236
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,042
Why did she have to get sick like that?
[sobbing]

237
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,920
If anyone, it should've been me.

238
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,049
All she ever did was work hard.
She did nothing wrong.

239
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,260
That poor child. [sobbing]

240
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,519
My goodness.

241
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,740
My goodness…

242
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,369
No, my poor girl.

243
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,039
Seok-ryu.

244
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,123
[continues sobbing]

245
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,173
What am I going to do? My poor girl.

246
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,470
[emotional music continues playing]

247
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,683
[knock on door]

248
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,684
[door opens]

249
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,978
[Hye-suk] Seung-hyo.

250
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,399
What's that?

251
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,151
[Hye-suk] Porridge.

252
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,780
You didn't seem well,
so I asked Mi-suk to make it.

253
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,867
I just can't believe what's happened.

254
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,286
Did you come into my room before?

255
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,829
Yeah.

256
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,835
Just leave it here. I'll eat this later.

257
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,587
I heated it. Before it cools, you…

258
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,506
[sighs]

259
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,423
[Hye-suk] Okay.

260
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,592
Rest up.

261
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,932
But did you really not know?

262
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,018
You went to the US
on a business trip three years ago.

263
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,645
You didn't see her then?

264
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,907
-I'm almost there.
-[phone vibrating]

265
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,033
What's this?

266
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,076
MO-EUM

267
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,078
-Hey.
-Hey, Seung-hyo.

268
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,831
-I heard you're in the US.
-How did you know that?

269
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,374
[Mo-eum] Aunt Mi-suk told me.

270
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,542
This is great.

271
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,961
Can you go and see
Seok-ryu while you're there?

272
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,921
She's been so busy I can't reach her.

273
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,299
Hey, do you think I have time to waste?

274
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,385
Don't be like that. Go and see her.

275
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,929
You two are in the same world now.

276
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,224
It's a six-hour plane ride
from New York to California.

277
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,894
I see.
Well, that's practically another country.

278
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,897
I guess they're different worlds.

279
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,482
Got it? Good. Bye.

280
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,443
[line disconnects]

281
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,578
[footsteps approaching]

282

[inhales]

283
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,087
[slow music playing]

284
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,722
Back then,

285
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,975
I should've run to Seok-ryu.

286
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,353
I should've told her she looked thin

287
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,023
and that she looked tired.

288
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,735
I should've asked her if she was okay.

289
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,243
Could you display the screen in the back?

290
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,412
Please take a look at the documents.

291
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,373
Create new floor plans
to prevent construction errors.

292
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,417
-[man] Okay.
-[phone vibrating]

293

BAE SEOK-RYU

294
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,337
[lady] Has CAD work
for landscaping started?

295
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,254
[man] Yes.

296
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,548
HEY, YOU'RE IN THE US?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL?

297
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,968
Share the bill of quantities
once the working design is complete.

298
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,471
-Any issues with the schedule, right?
-[man] No.

299
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,016
Choi Seung-hyo is a true captain.

300
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,561
You understand? In the sea of life,
we won't get lost with him!

301
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,188
He navigates the way for us.

302
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,566
This is all thanks to him.
Do you all know that?

303
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,652
-You're drunk.
-Hey.

304
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,695
What's that? Who's calling this late?

305
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,781
SEOK-RYU
HOW ARE YOU? YOU MUST BE BUSY

306
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,241
It's nothing.

307
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,243
Hey, you like dried pollock.

308
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,953
[pop song playing]

309
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,371

311
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,854
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHOISSEUNG

312
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,401
THANKS

[exhales]

314
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,453
[sighs softly]

315
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,291
[Seung-hyo] But I was a coward,

316
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,835
and while I'd been out of reach,

317
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,589
she was sick.

318
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,842
Without anyone knowing

319
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,095
and alone for a long time.

320
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,894
When I was hurt,

321
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,478
Seok-ryu was the only person

322
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,815
who dragged me out of my cave.

323
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,818
But…

324
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,322
she sent all those signals in the dark,

325
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,115
and I missed them all.

326
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:08,540
BEAR IN THE CAVE

327
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,918
[birds chirping]

328
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,090
[door opens]

329
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,800
[Mi-suk] What are you doing?

330
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,844
Hey.

331
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,888
Are you making porridge?

332
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,015
[Geun-sik] Yeah.

333
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,854
Take these.

334
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,272
[exclaims softly]

335
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,691
How did you think of freezing these?

336
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,569
It'll upset her
if she sees that our eyes are swollen.

337
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,655
Right.

338
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,660
[Seok-ryu] What are you two doing?

339
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,827
Honey, the porridge.

340
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,912
It's boiling over.

341
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,957
[Geun-sik] Goodness.
I almost wasted all this great porridge.

342
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,126
I'm making abalone porridge.

343
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,419
Because of me?

344
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,130
I don't need to eat porridge.

345
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:03,345
You should eat food that's easy to digest.
You almost choked on abalone rice before.

346
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,554
[exclaims]

347
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,391
I just had something in my throat then.

348
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,644
I even ate the tteokbokki
you made me last time.

349
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,145
You're right.

350
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,774
Why would you eat that?
You should've said no.

351
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,693
It's good. Why wouldn't I eat it?

352
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,779
Dad, I'm fine. Don't worry.

353
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,155
Still, be careful.

354
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,242
Take me with you
when you visit the doctor next time.

355
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,619
What for? You don't have to come.

356
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,207
Okay, you can come.

357
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,626
Dad, the porridge.

358
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,714
Jeez! I turned down the heat,
but it's still boiling over.

359
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,427
Gosh, I burnt the bottom. [chuckles]

360
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,721
It'll still taste good.

361
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,264
[Jae-suk] Hey.

362
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,599
What do you mean?

363
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,435
Seok-ryu has cancer?

364
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,104
I heard it myself,
but I still don't believe it.

365
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,315
I don't know how this happened.

366
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,401
Hang up. I'm going to call Mi-suk.

367
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,528
Hey, don't.

368
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,905
Just leave her be
until she tells us herself.

369
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,490
Don't act like you know.

370
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,534
How can I do that?

371
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,621
Hey, you might be able to do that,
but I can't!

372
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,541
-I'd rather go and comfort her.
-[door closes]

373
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,211
[voice shaking] Imagine the hard time
she's going through!

374
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,047
Her daughter has cancer.

375
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,926
Mom, what did you just say?

376
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,308
Seok-ryu, you crazy…

377
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,395
[breath trembling]

378
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,148
-How could you hide that?
-Yeah, I hid it.

379
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,275
I didn't tell you. I kept it a secret.

380
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,359
What the hell?

381
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,071
You thought I'd go easy on you
if you confessed?

382
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,238
Don't go easy on me.

383
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,618
What are you doing?
Are you turning yourself in?

384
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,037
I know I deserve to get chewed out.

385
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,997
So do as much as you desire.

386
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,085
No.

387
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,378
I don't do anything that's made easy.

388
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,132
You're not qualified to be a hero.
They love getting things handed to them.

389
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,967
You're right.

390
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,261
I'm not qualified.

391
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,847
I couldn't save you.

392
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,308
Why would you suddenly
say something like that?

393
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,144
A tteokbokki fanatic
suddenly can't eat spicy food.

394
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,313
You drank non-alcoholic beer.

395
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,317
When I think about it,
there were so many clues.

396
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,695
I should've figured it out. Damn it.

397
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,948
Maybe I'm good at acting.

398
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,951
Should I pursue acting instead of cooking?

399
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,081
Did your mom cry a lot?

400
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:40,043
[sighs] My parents had spoons
on their eyes like this in the morning.

401
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,211
They looked like Ultraman.

402
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,213
I won't cry.

403
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,550
I'll never cry.

404
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,594
If you won't cry or cuss me out,
what will you do?

405
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,054
Well…

406
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,725
I will…

407
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,105
do this.

408
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,983
[slow music playing]

409
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,485
You should've hugged me
like this at the airport.

410
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,071
You're right.

411
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,617
You've endured so much, Seok-ryu.

412
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,537
Physically and mentally.

413
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,624
Thanks.

414
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,588
Just so you know,

415
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,049
you're really flat.

416
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,636
[laughing] I don't feel a thing.

417
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,055
What are you talking about?
We're not even touching!

418
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,974
I'm more curvaceous than you think!

419
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,058
I doubt that.

420
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,185
Want me to get undressed?

421
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,895
-Go ahead.
-I'll really do it.

422
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,439
I meant you're too skinny.

423
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,485
Buy me something nice to eat
if you feel sorry for me.

424
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,864
-I'm paid in peanuts.
-I'm unemployed.

425
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,618
-Should we buy lottery tickets?
-How many?

426
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,578
-How about seven?
-No.

427
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,331
Make it an even number.
It's easier to split.

428
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,291
Okay, let's buy ten!

429
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,168
Sounds good. [chuckles]

430
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,252
[Mo-eum] All right, then.

431
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,213
[both laughing]

432
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,554
Professor, we just had people
from a car accident come in.

433
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,974
The car went up onto the sidewalk
and crashed into a building.

434
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,184
How's are the patients?

435
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,937
The scans show
a pelvic bone fracture in one patient.

436
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,648
One has a clavicle fracture,
and another has a hip fracture.

437
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,857
Let me see.

438
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,282
Bae Seok-ryu?

439
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,408
What?

440
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,078
Oh.

441
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,580
This patient was here a few days ago.

442
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,500
She had surgery
for stomach cancer in the US.

443
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,543
I remembered
because of her unique name.

444
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,128
[solemn music playing]

445
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,634
[sighs]

446
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,137
The client requested a new contractor?

447
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,055
[Myeong-u] Oh.

448
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,181
Why?

449
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,100
He wants to let an acquaintance do it.

450
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,269
The brother-in-law

451
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,603
of his father-in-law's

452
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,980
high school classmate

453
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,607
has a construction firm.

454
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,234
Isn't that a stranger?

455
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,568
Yeah.

456
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,570
But during construction,

457
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,282
the client thinks we could mess with
material and labor costs.

458
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,200
They said they couldn't trust our choice.

459
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,369
[Na-yun] Are they crazy?

460
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,579
Why did they trust us
with the design then?

461
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,998
Switch it for them.

462
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,582
-What?
-What?

463
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,252
We should carry out our client's request.

464
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,089
Get their number, contact them,
and schedule a meeting.

465
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,759
I'll call Mr. Bang
from Sunjong Construction and apologize.

466
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,345
-Yes, sir.
-[Seung-hyo] All right.

467
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,306
Let's wrap up today's meeting.

468
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,975
Keep up the great work.

469
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:50,233
Wow.
Normally, he would've never allowed this.

470
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,236
He must be in a really good mood today.

471
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,740
No, it's the opposite.

472
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,034
Something's up with him.

473
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,038
I have to ask you something.

474
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,040
Are you free?

475
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,085
[Gyeong-jong] So you knew.

476
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,549
I was debating whether to call you or not.

477
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,385
You know about her condition, right?

478
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,806
Even if you're my son,
I can't release a patient's information.

479
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,559
Can you just tell me if she's okay?

480
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,062
Seung-hyo.

481
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,648
I've always liked Seok-ryu.

482
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,194
A lot of people are awkward with me,
but she never was.

483
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,198
I adored that about her. I was grateful.

484
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,327
Bring Seok-ryu to the hospital.

485
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,913
I'll make sure she's okay.

486
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,167
I promise you.

487
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,836
Okay, Dad.

488
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,138
[both] Mi-suk!

489
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,265
[Jae-suk] Hey, are you okay?

490
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,518
You look so drawn today.

491
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,062
-You didn't get any sleep, did you?
-Mi-suk.

492
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,231
There's an herbal medicine clinic I know.

493
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,316
I asked them what's good
for the stomach.

494
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,361
Cabbages and broccoli.

495
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,197
-And lotus root. Lotus root is great.
-Did you tell them?

496
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,408
Yeah.

497
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,660
Why did you go
and do something I didn't ask for?

498
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,161
It's not like that.

499
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,706
She told us to pretend
like we didn't know.

500
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,292
We're just worried.

501
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,504
Goodness. You even asked them
to act like they didn't know?

502
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,339
Mi-suk, it's not like that.

503
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,758
We just wanted to comfort you.

504
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,928
Why would you comfort me?

505
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,347
Who said I wanted that?

506
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,224
No one asked you to do this!

507
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,892
Na Mi-suk.

508
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,687
You're in one of the five stages of grief.

509
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,439
You're passing through anger.

510
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,524
But that's expected and natural.

511
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,443
You're really something too.

512
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,696
You want to brag
about how smart you are right now?

513
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,407
Fine, just get angry.
Be as angry as you want!

514
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,743
Just take it out on us!

515
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,453
-What?
-You can do that.

516
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,122
We're your friends.

517
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,290
Friends?

518
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,250
So what?

519
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,920
Are friends allowed
to cross the line like this?

520
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,216
Hey, don't talk to me
if you've never experienced it before.

521
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,051
You're right. We haven't.

522
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,138
But we know. Because we're parents too.

523
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,600
We know how you'd rather suffer
in Seok-ryu's place

524
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,769
and how much you blame yourself.

525
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,520
[In-suk crying] Yeah, Mi-suk.

526
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,273
You act tough on the outside,
but we know how sensitive you are.

527
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,901
We know how delicate you are.

528
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,152
[Mi-suk] Goodness.

529
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,196
What am I going to do with Seok-ryu?

530
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,657
[voice shaking] I didn't
even know she was sick.

531
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,327
I'm no mother.

532
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,163
I'm not qualified to be a mother.

533
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,956
My gosh. [sobbing]

534
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,292
-Hey, Mi-suk.
-Mi-suk! [crying]

535
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,795
[all sobbing]

536
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,173
[Hye-suk] No, don't blame yourself.

537
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,424
Okay?

538
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,593
It's okay.

539
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:07,055
Just cry, you brat. Cry it all out.

540
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,098
[phone vibrating]

541
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,310
SE-HWAN: WHERE ARE YOU?

542
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,311
[insects trilling]

543
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,856

SURVIVAL RATE RISES TO 78%

545
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,403
EARLY DETECTION AND PREVENTION ARE KEY

546
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,456
[groans]

547
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,625
Bae Seok-ryu.

548
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,419
She looks strong enough to eat rocks.

549
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,046
How could she get sick?

550
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,342
-Damn it.
-[Na-yun exclaiming]

551
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,844
[Dong-jin] Are you okay?

552
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,930
No, I'm not okay. I almost got hurt.

553
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,516
-You're our gym member.
-[Na-yun] What?

554
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,684
What are you doing here?

555
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,770
-Shouldn't you be at work?
-[Dong-jin] Oh.

556
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,772
I quit.

557
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,109
That place wasn't big enough
for someone like me.

558
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,194
I see. So you were fired.

559
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,904
No, I wasn't!

560
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,489
I left on my own.

561
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,033
You were about to be fired,
so you quit first.

562
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:09,993
No, I didn't!

563
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,873
Take this advice from someone who's had
more experience in the workplace.

564
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,001
Get on your knees
and beg for your job back.

565
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,002
Why would I?

566
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,546
You don't know anything.
Why are you meddling?

567
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,964
Meddling?

568
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,050
That's not something I ever do.

569
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,514
I'm just giving you advice
after what you did with the treadmill.

570
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,640
[pleasant music playing]

571
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,685
I was running too fast back then.

572
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,068
Hey, your strides are too long!

573
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,194
[Na-yun] I can't hear you.

574
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,530
The optimal cadence
for running is 180 bpm.

575
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,407
So what cadence is…

576
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,867
I think you hear me.

577
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,076
[Na-yun] Jeez.

578
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:58,958
Ms. Jung.

579
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,589
Ms. Jung?

580
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,966
[exclaims]

581
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,426

586
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,854
[weakly] Ms. Jung.

587
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,946
[Mo-eum] Slowly.

588
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,948
[mellow music playing]

589
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,699
-Be careful when you sit.
-Okay.

590
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,161
[Mo-eum grunts softly]

591
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,329
[Dan-ho exhales]

592
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,372
[Mo-eum] Are you okay?

593
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,043
Let's just go to the hospital.
I think you need an X-ray.

594
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,628
It's fine.

595
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,589
Who knew I'd end up
feeling the power of a black belt?

596
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,548
[chuckles softly]

597
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,678
You should've known how to avoid it
if you were a red belt.

598
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,762
[chuckles softly]

599
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,472
Do you have pain relief patches?

600
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,848
[Dan-ho] Um…

601
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,227
-No.
-Wait here. I'll go buy some.

602
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,857
It's fine, so just sit for a second.

603
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,989
[Mo-eum] Maybe I have some at my house.

604
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,991
I'm really okay.

605
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,452
I'm not that weak.

606
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,250
I didn't say anything.

607
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,797
[exhales]

608
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,053
Can I ask why you were crying back there?

609
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:38,016
Why are you asking to ask
when you've already done so?

610
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,185
-You're right.
-[chuckles softly]

611
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,480
The thing is…

612
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,651
this is actually a very popular place
for listening to people's problems.

613
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,195
I've already had someone here before.

614
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,033
Who? Choi Seung-hyo?

615
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,785
Oh.

616
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,328
How did you know?

617
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,666
Well, the security maintenance here
seemed like a mess.

618
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,004
Oh.

619
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,758
[scoffs] No wonder.

620
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,220
You see,

621
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,433
it's about a friend of mine, not me.

622
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,395
My friend has a really close friend.

623
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,524
They've been best friends
since they were kids.

624
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,028
That friend lived abroad for a long time.

625
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,905
I see.

626
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,032
[Mo-eum] But…

627
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,992
my friend's friend…

628
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,078
Um…

629
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,040
had surgery…

630
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,087
for cancer three years ago.

631
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,799
And my friend

632
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,843
just found out recently.

633
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,516
Your friend must be having
a really hard time.

634
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,226
But…

635
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,855
she keeps acting
like she's not having a hard time.

636
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,024
[slow music playing]

637
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,486
But it's killing me.

638
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,825
[gasps]

639
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,036
I mean, I'm not talking about me.

640
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,998
It's my friend. And my friend's friend.

641
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,292
Why is this so confusing?

642
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,087
It's not about me.
It's my friend's friend.

643
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,381
Don't worry.

644
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,925
I'll make sure
security is tighter this time.

645
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,223
[groans softly]

646
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,561
Well…

647
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,857
I can't believe Seok-ryu's sick.

648
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,361
Due to the nature of my job,

649
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,823
I see a lot of sick people.

650
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,410
And people on the verge of death.

651
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,288
But…

652
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,420
[voice shaking] …I never imagined that
Seok-ryu could be one of those people.

653
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:13,963
[sniffles]

654
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,966
I said I wouldn't cry, but I can't stop.

655
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,887
You can cry here.

656
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,389
What?

657
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,142
Cry a little bit here in secret.

658
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,810
Then, smile even more after that.

659
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,439
Share a drink with her.

660
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,610
Chat, have fun, and just be with her.

661
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,278
[sniffles]

662
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,281
Being with someone
who miraculously returned

663
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,035
is a miracle in itself.

664
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,620
[slow music continues playing]

665
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,456
It's just like what Yeon-du means to me.

666
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,126
-Yeon-du?
-[Dan-ho] Yes.

667
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,214
It was two years ago.

668
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,343
I looked at my phone
after finishing an interview.

669
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,180
I'd several missed calls
from the same number.

670
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,391
I called back and they said

671
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,727
it was the hospital.

672
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,356
[panting]

673
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,415

[breath trembling]

677
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,562
My child.

678
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,108
[voice shaking] I have a child.

679
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,320
Where is she?

680
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,078

684
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,757
Yeon-du…

685
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,553
miraculously survived the accident
and came back to me.

686
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:27,930
[Mo-eum] Dan-ho…

687
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:34,145
So I know how precious
each ordinary morning is.

688
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,815
Waking her up every morning,

689
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,235
feeding her breakfast,

690
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,321
running to daycare together

691
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,990
so she's not late,

692
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,244
and seeing her wave goodbye to me

693
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,539
as she walks inside.

694
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,999
Ordinary days like that.

695
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,710
So you should also…

696
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,090
You said it was okay to cry.

697
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,928
Why are you holding it in?

698
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,223
[mellow music playing]

699
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,603
I'll keep it secret too.

[breathing heavily]

705
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,872
What's the point of running away?
I live next door.

706
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,084
[door closes]

707

[jazz music playing in the background]

709
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,070
[Hye-suk] Sorry.

710
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,615
I forgot we were supposed to
have lunch together.

711
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,950
That's okay.

712
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,494
We can just have dinner together.

713
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,121
I must be getting old.

714
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,457
I've never made such mistakes before.

715
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,000
What? It's cute.

716
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,127
[Hye-suk] Thank you.

717
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,629
Seo Hye-suk's doing things
unlike her usual self.

718
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,590
My gosh. What's this?

719
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,717
Chablis wine. Nice, right?

720
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,635
It's so nice.

721
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,928
As for me,

722
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,390
I'm used to hearing adjectives
like "beautiful" and "cool."

723
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,726
But "cute"? That's not bad either.

724
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,311
[both chuckle]

725
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,523
Cheers.

726
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,446
Mmm.

727
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,281
This really is nice.

728
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,118
What did you need to discuss with me?

729
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,203
Well…

730
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,710
Have you thought about my offer?

731
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,712
I see.

732
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,759
That?

733
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,598
[Hye-suk] What's this?

734
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,851
Why did you come here?

735
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,978
Well…

736
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,188
I had something to tell you.

737
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,321
What do you mean? Take time off?

738
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,283
It's how it sounds.
You've been overdoing things.

739
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,035
[scoffs]

740
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,621
I didn't overdo things. I just worked.

741
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,581
Right.

742
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,377
"The Woman of the Wind
who crossed the Sahara Desert."

743
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,295
"The Foreign Ministry's African Tongue."

744
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,715
Jeez. Go get everyone
who gave me those names.

745
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,676
-I'll teach them.
-[chuckles]

746
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,762
You've lived up to your names

747
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,932
by being in the field
for over 20 years now.

748
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,977
Let's take a break.

749
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,814
Let's eat and have tea at our leisure.

750
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,824
I know that you're worried.

751
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,662
But I want to stay on active duty.
I'm years away from retirement too.

752
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,542
I'll speak to the minister myself
and ask him where I should go.

753
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,543
You…

754
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,254
can't go anywhere.

755
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,381
What?

756
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,299
Because…

757
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,843
you won't be reassigned.

758
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,553
Oh. [chuckles]

759
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,723
I bet there aren't
any suitable positions right now.

760
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,016
I'll wait then.

761
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,642
It doesn't matter which country it is.

762
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,562
-When a spot opens, anywhere is--
-There's no point in waiting.

763
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,566
You understand what I mean, right?

764
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,820
You're telling me to just collect my pay
while on standby with no job?

765
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,491
-Don't tell me…
-You'll hear soon.

766
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,202
You'll be asked to voluntarily resign.

767
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,663
[scoffs]

768
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,707
Did you agree with it too?

769
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,544
It was an organizational decision.

770
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,183
Sure.

771
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,605
Then, I'll have to accept it.

772
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,339
[sighs softly]

773
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,886
You're mad at me, right?

774
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,263
No.

775
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,683
Then, why didn't you call me?

776
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,186
I was busy.

777
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,647
Liar. You were avoiding me.

778
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,528
I know. It's because of my cancer.

779
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,489
It bothers you to look at me.

780
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,993
You don't know if you need to
comfort me or encourage me.

781
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,163
You probably don't know what to say.

782
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,500
Hey, it's like that at my house too.

783
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,836
My mom's crying.
My dad's having a hard time.

784
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,424
Even Dong-jin's become pale with fear.

785
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:22,261
They walk on eggshells around me.
It's so uncomfortable.

786
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,930
I knew this would happen.

787
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,599
That's why I kept it a secret.

788
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,061
But no one understands
how thoughtful I was being.

789
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,147
Yeah, right.

790
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,651
Seok-ryu, you're saying
you kept this a secret for our sake?

791
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,990
No, you only thought about yourself.

792
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,998
You're a coward, and you're pathetic.

793
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,083
What?

794
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,836
You're weak and hypocritical.

795
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,129
Hey.

796
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,213
You…

797
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,551
hurt the people who love you.

798
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,805
You did the unthinkable.

799
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,015
[slow music playing]

800
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,350
To your mom, your dad, me.

801
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,811
And to yourself.

802
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,772
You…

803
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,067
in your loneliest
and most difficult moment,

804
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,195
left yourself alone.

805
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,114
Seok-ryu.

806
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,784
When things are really tough,

807
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,205
you lean on the people closest to you.

808
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,664
What if I did lean on them?

809
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,376
Would that have changed anything?

810
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,631
If I'm hurting,
you'd all be hurting with me.

811
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,219
If I fall, you'd fall with me
like dominoes.

812
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,430
Who cares if we fall?
Who cares if things crumble?

813
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,390
We can hit rock bottom together.

814
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,059
Then, we can get back up again.

815
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,061
I don't know how to do that.

816
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,021
This is who I am,
so what can I do?

817
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,731
You did it for me!

818
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,276
When my mom left for Africa

819
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,363
and when I had to quit swimming
because I hurt my leg,

820
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,782
you reached out to me.

821
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,242
You stayed with me.

822
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,284
Hey.

823
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,203
That's…

824
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,413
That's different.

825
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,749
But why won't you give me
the chance to do the same?

826
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,627
You did all those things for me.

827
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,464
Why won't you let me do the same for you?

828
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,466
That's enough.

829
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,594
Let's stop.

830
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,473
Seok-ryu. Are you running away again?

831
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,892
Stop!

832
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,186
I said stop!

833
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,523
[sighs]

834
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,836
I should've done the same back then.

835
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,088
Just like you,

836
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,090
I should've shouted and gotten angry.

837
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,384
I should've been more honest.

838
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,929
Back then,

839
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,514
was Seok-ryu…

840
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,935
in a lot of pain?

841
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,190
She endured it courageously.

842
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:24,901
[sighs]

843
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,500
[exclaims]

844
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:43,962
[groans]

845
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,631
[Geun-sik exclaims]

846
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,090
[sighs]

847
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,302
I thought the alcohol
would be sweet, but it's bitter.

848
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,720
[liquid pouring]

849
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:52,763
[exhales]

850
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,222
That's good.

851
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,600
We can split this bottle

852
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,852
and go to bed.

853
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,482
[both sigh]

854
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,443
Honey.

855
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,487
[exhales]

856
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,365
I keep thinking about all the wrong things
I've done to Seok-ryu.

857
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,743
When Seok-ryu was three,

858
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,537
Dong-jin was crying at night.

859
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,250
She woke up and started to cry too.

860
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,712
So I scolded her.

861
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,467
I said, "You're a big kid.
Why are you crying?"

862
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,261
"Why are you giving me a hard time too?"

863
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,889
You were young.

864
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,850
You didn't know.

865
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,186
Still…

866
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,731
I shouldn't have done that.

867
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,985
I think I made this happen to her.

868
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,533
My excuse was I had to
give Dong-jin extra care,

869
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,370
and I pushed her too much to the side.

870
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,247
But…

871
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,167
she grew up so well on her own.

872
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,253
Yeah, she did.

873
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,089
Our daughter…

874
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,426
never caused us any trouble. [inhales]

875
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:17,180
[voice shaking] That poor girl
must've tried so hard to do that.

876
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,724
She must've been so stressed.

877
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,808
[both whimpering]

878
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,311
But all I did
was boast about it to others.

879
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,981
I never gave her
the support she needed. [sniffles]

880
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,694
She was so worried
that she endured such an awful thing…

881
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,071
[sniffles] …all on her own. [sobbing]

882
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,118
[voice shaking] It's mostly my fault.

883
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,037
[breath trembling]

884
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,875
Gosh, that restaurant was doomed anyway.
Why did I try so hard?

885
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,376
[slow music playing]

886
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,921
I wasn't able to focus
on my family. [sniffles]

887
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,758
I passed it off onto you.

888
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,634
[sobbing, sniffles]

889
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,555
I feel terrible for what I did to her.
What am I going to do? [sobbing]

890
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,725
I'm so sorry.

891
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,728
I'm sorry.

892
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,065
I'm sorry to you. [sniffles]

893
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,819
And I'm sorry to Seok-ryu.

894
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,782
Honey, what do we do? [sobbing]

895
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,869
[Geun-sik whimpering]

896
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,039
[both whimpering]

897
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,168
[Mi-suk sobbing] I'm so sorry.

898
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,505
[Geun-sik] I'm sorry. [sobbing]

899
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,422
I'm so…

900
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,011
[voice shaking] I'm sorry.

901
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,767
[Mi-suk sobbing] Honey,
what are we going to do?

902
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,478
[music ends]

903
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,356

[amusing music playing]

907
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,715
I can't even greet Yeon-du
because of my careless lips.

908
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:21,263
All of this happened
because I had a lot on my mind.

909
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,558
As a result, it short-circuited a little.

910
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,977
Let's put out the fire.

911
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,770
I have to extinguish it.

912
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,230
[breathes deeply]

913
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,486
Why did she hide?

914
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,490
Is she playing hide-and-seek?

915
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:45,036
-What are you talking about?
-Mo-eum just hid after she saw us.

916
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,371
I saw her.

917
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,334
We're late. Yeon-du, should we run?

918
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,461
-Yeah.
-[Dan-ho] Ready, set, go!

919
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,880
[Yeon-du] I'm going to beat you!

920
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,591
[Yeon-du talking indistinctly]

921
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,260
Hey, Seok-ryu.

922
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,476
Seok-ryu?

923
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,149
She left her phone. Where did she go?

924
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,109
[phone vibrating]

925
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,828

[indistinct conversation]

929
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,554
[Seung-hyo] Back then,

930
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,848
was Seok-ryu…

931
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,267
in a lot of pain?

932
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,688
She endured it courageously.

933
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,315
[sighs]

934
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,987
At least,

935
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,783
that's what I thought.

936
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,785
[slow music continues playing]

937
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,495
After her surgery,

938
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,580
about a year passed…

939
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,542
and she developed depression.

940
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,297
Depression?

941
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,716
I didn't know.

942
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,889
She was falling apart alone.

943
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,100
[metal bangs]

944
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,978
[supervisor] Be careful!

945
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:33,895
[employee] Yes, sir!

946
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,230
Please be careful.

947
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,650
Mr. Choi, could you come here?

948
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,402
Can you explain this?

949
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,403
[Seung-hyo] Sure.

950
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,948
[Myeong-u] Here.

951
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,534
So this isn't your average structure.

952
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,703
I thought it'd be hard to implement.

953
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,999
I'll send you a detailed floor plan
and additional materials to explain.

954
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,209
We'd be grateful for that.

955
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,211
As for that area, if you look here…

956
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,379
[phone vibrating]

957
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,755
Just a moment. Sorry.

958
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,093
Hi, Aunt Mi-suk.

959
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,596
What? Seok-ryu?

[music ends]

975
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,695
Hey, Seok-ryu!

976
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:50,740
Choisseung?

977
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,034
What are you doing?

978
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,327
How did you know I was here?

979
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,081
If you're going to go somewhere,
you should let people know!

980
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,999
How could you disappear
without your phone?

981
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,835
Well, that…

982
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,295
interferes with my deep meditation
and self-reflection--

983
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,005
[Seung-hyo] Are you joking?

984
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,466
Do you know how much
I've been looking for you?

985
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,468
Do you know how worried everyone is?

986
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,596
I came here
because I was frustrated, okay?

987
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,098
I need to breathe too.

988
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,307
Hey.

989
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,060
Because of you,
I'm the one who's suffocating here.

990
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,271
How long were you
going to keep it a secret?

991
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,939
How long were you
going to hide it for?

992
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,025
You want to talk about this again?
Aren't you sick of it already?

993
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,528
Your emotional pain,
not your physical pain.

994
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,156
You…

995
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,868
had depression.

996
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,786
Why didn't you tell me?

997
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,955
Where did you hear that?

998
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,542
Did you see Hyeon-jun?

999
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,294
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

1000
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,589
Are you a fool?

1001
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,299
Why are you so stupid?

1002
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,010
How much have you bottled up
in that tiny body of yours?

1003
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,136
Stop it. I'm leaving.

1004
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,345

[Seok-ryu exclaims] Hey!

1006
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,892
What are you doing?

1007
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,518
What on earth are you doing?

1008
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,561
Hey!

1009
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,022
Wait! What are you doing?

Hey, what are you doing?

1013
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,236
Are you insane?

1014
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,654

[mellow music playing]

1016
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,872
What are you doing, you lunatic?

1017
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,291
You said you were frustrated.
Isn't it refreshing now?

1018
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,250
Hey!

1019
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,794
[Seung-hyo] Yeah.
You should shout like that.

1020
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:27,712
[pop song playing]

1021
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,339
You have everything pent up inside.

1022
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,466
Let it all out.

1023
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,095
What's inside you is bitterness.

1024
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,055
So…

1025
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,976
don't try to foolishly
carry that burden alone!

1026
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,937
Let it all out here.

1027
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,482
Why are you yelling at me?

1028
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,652
Why do you keep getting angry at me?

1029
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,738
I'm the one who was sick.

1030
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,449
I'm the one who's having the hardest time.

1031
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,160
[voice shaking] Why do you
keep scolding me?

1032
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,872
I wasn't being angry at you.

1033
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,334
I'm mad at myself.

1034
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,422
After I heard you were sick,
I thought back.

1035
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,385
I didn't hear you…

1036
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,804
knocking on my door.

1037
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,185
You sent me signs
that you were struggling.

1038
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,438
But I had my eyes and ears closed.

1039
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,571
Even though I knew that…

1040
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,283
I said those harsh things to you.

1041
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:45,290
I felt so pathetic and frustrated.
I felt like garbage.

1042
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,505
Why didn't you text me back?

1043
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,341
I'm sorry.

1044
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,428
Why did you ignore my calls?

1045
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,055
I'm sorry.

1046
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,143
[crying]

1047
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:09,522
I wasn't able to tell anyone!

1048
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,566
Do you know how scared I was on my own?

1049
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,280
Why did you do that?

1050
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:24,454
I was so worried my parents
would collapse from shock if I told them!

1051
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,874
I had all sorts of thoughts
in my head when I made this decision.

1052
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:32,086
I debated if I should tell you or not
over a hundred times. [sobbing]

1053
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,049
You don't know anything!

1054
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,217
You don't know how I feel!

1055
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,322
[continues crying]

1056
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,159
[waves splashing]

1057
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:21,761
Here.

1058
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,555
Nothing beats banana milk
after going for a swim.

1059
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,640
[chuckles softly]

1060
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:29,310
It's nice. It's like when we'd visit
the bathhouse as kids.

1061
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:30,853
[Seung-hyo exhales]

1062
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:37,944
[Seok-ryu] Mmm.

1063
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,156
Hey, you haven't answered me yet.

1064
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,992
How did you know I was here?

1065
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,870
This is where you ran away to before.

1066
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,956
It was short-lived though.

1067
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,874
You didn't have to say that part.

1068
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,168
It's true that I ran away.

1069
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,213
It was justified too.

1070
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,590
Mom.

1071
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,551
How come only he gets a new phone?

1072
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:05,471
How come only Dong-jin
gets a new phone?

1073
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,307
Gosh, I had no choice. His was broken.

1074
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,060
Mine's broken too. It broke twice.

1075
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,729
But I had it fixed!

1076
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,356
I said I'd buy you one
if you got the highest mock exam score.

1077
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,191
-But you didn't.
-[coughing]

1078
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,986
He's the dumbest kid in school,
but you bought him one!

1079
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,487
This takes great pictures.

1080
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,906
-They're killer!
-Delete them or I'll kill you.

1081
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,075
-[Mi-suk] Seung-hyo, are you okay?
-Yeah.

1082
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,244
[Mi-suk] Look, you think I wanted
to buy him one?

1083
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,455
I can't reach this brat without a phone!

1084
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,249
Also, all gadgets are the same.

1085
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,709
Try to be more like Seung-hyo.

1086
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,503
He's been using the same phone for years.

1087
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,213
But he's never complained once.

1088
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,007
-What a sweet boy.
-[Seok-ryu] Mom, listen.

1089
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,593
Only his phone is old.

1090
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,470
Everything else he owns is expensive.

1091
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,096
-[groans]
-Look at this. This shirt?

1092
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,557
-Let go. Get your hands off me.
-It's over 100,000 won!

1093
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,684
And he only wears
foreign-brand underwear. Look!

1094
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,602
What are you doing?

1095
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,187
-[Mi-suk] Stop!
-Are you crazy?

1096
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,813
This is so unfair, Mom.

1097
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,566
How come only he gets
a swivel phone and not me?

1098
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,194
[voice shaking] You always let
stuff like this happen!

1099
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,278
It's not fair!

1100
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,613
[pleasant music playing]

1101
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,824
[waves splashing]

1102
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,327
Jeez, what is wrong with her?

1103
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:15,833
I want to go back!

1104
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,587
You wore your uniform to school,

1105
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:22,215
went to all your classes,
and then ran away.

1106
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,342
Does that even count?

1107
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,637
Absences would lower your grades.

1108
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,057
Fine, forget it.

1109
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,184
I didn't have much guts.

1110
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,353
It's because you're too nice.

1111
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,854
[pleasant music continues playing]

1112
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,022
What?

1113
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,149
You were mad
and felt things were unfair,

1114
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,611
but you didn't want to worry your parents.

1115
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,238
So that was your compromise.

1116
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,825
My brother was always causing problems.

1117
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:54,455
But I was the one
who caused the biggest mess.

1118
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,418
[slurping]

1119
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,379
I'm done.

1120
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,341
[sighs audibly]

1121
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:09,136
I'd wish for nothing more
than a cold beer to chug right now.

1122
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,392
But I can't do that anymore.

1123
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,686
That makes me sad.

1124
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,735
Make the call.

1125
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:26,320
To who?

1126
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,530
My dad.

1127
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,241
They said you got a text
from the hospital.

1128
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,702
Your biopsy results are out.

1129
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:37,665
That? Later. I can do that later.

1130
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,750
Not later. Do it now while I'm here.

1131
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,923
Do you remember when they put
seven metal pins in my leg?

1132
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,801
Yeah. Why?

1133
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,805
Did something happen when you stubbed
your foot into the bed that time?

1134
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,057
What? No.

1135
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,479
But once you injure a knee,
it can get hurt again.

1136
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,984
If that happens, I'm going to
take you with me to the hospital.

1137
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:06,986
Don't I get any say in it?

1138
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:10,114
I'm going to make you buy me juice.

1139
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:13,326
And what else? I'll make you
get comic books for me.

1140
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,495
-And I'll ask you to wash my greasy hair.
-[scoffs]

1141
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,872
That's ridiculous.

1142
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:18,956
Who says I'll do it?

1143
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,124
I'd do it for you.

1144
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,503
That's what I'm going to do
no matter what you say.

1145
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,549
So…

1146
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,302
don't worry that something might happen.

1147
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,724
Call them,
and I'll stay by your side.

1148
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,313
[slow music playing]

1149
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,234
[Seok-ryu sighs]

1150
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:50,488
FATHER

1151
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,324
[line ringing]

1152
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,497
Hello, sir. It's Seok-ryu.

1153
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,749
Yes.

1154
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,211
I'm sorry I hid it from you.

1155
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,047
So…

1156
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,217
I heard the biopsy results are out.

1157
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,346
Right.

1158
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,349
Okay.

1159
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,644
Oh.

1160
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,354
Okay, I understand.

1161
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:25,606
Okay, bye.

1162
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,196
What did he say?

1163
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,448
He said it was nothing.

1164
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,450
It was just an infection. I'm clean.

1165
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,702
[sighs deeply]

1166
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,578
[pleasant music playing]

[exhales]

1168
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:49,463
-Hey, why the hell are you hugging me?
-Just…

1169
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,383
Let me give you a damn hug.

1170
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,721
[sighs deeply]

1171
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,493
Goodness.

1172
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,751
Gosh.

1173
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,961
[sighs wearily]

1174
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,514
[pleasant music continues playing]

-[clears throat]
-[line ringing]

1176
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,881
Where are you right now?

1177
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,553
Professor, are you going to eat?

1178
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,471
Yeah.

1179
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,807
The cafeteria's serving bibimbap today.

1180
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,391
I'm going to have steak.

1181
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,893
What? They're serving steak?

1182
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:27,561
Professor, where…

1183
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:28,896
The cafeteria's this way.

1184
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:30,856
Professor?

1185
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:33,859
[music ends]

1186
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,414
[dramatic music playing]

1187
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,668
[female 1] It's the vice minister
and ambassador.

1188
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:55,089
-[female 1] Didn't they graduate together?
-[female 2] Yeah, they're really close.

1189
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,383
They went to Africa together
in the past too.

1190
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,927
What's with the flowers?

1191
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:04,306
[female 3] Who knows?
There are tons of rumors about them.

1192
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:08,269
It's well-known. They say
the vice minister isn't married yet

1193
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:10,771
because the ambassador still is.

1194
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,481
[female 1 gasps] That's insane.

1195
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:21,824
[music ends]

1196
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:31,458
Hey, Mo-eum did the same thing too.

1197
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,919
Why are you expressing
your friendship with hugs now?

1198
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,880
Not me.

1199
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,883
I told you we're not friends anymore.

1200
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:46,056
We're here.
It's so quick without the traffic.

1201
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,648
Where are we going? That was my house.

1202
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,737
Wait, where are we going?
Hello? Where are we going?

1203
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,156
My legs are falling asleep.

1204
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:03,741
-Mom.
-Yeah?

1205
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,201
Do we have to do all this?

1206
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,452
I know from experience,

1207
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,579
but a surprise party requires patience.

1208
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,873
-Hang in there.
-When is Seok-ryu coming?

1209
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,374
The food's getting cold.

1210
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,292
-Aunt Mi-suk.
-Yeah?

1211
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,711
-This cake didn't come with any matches.
-[Geun-sik] Huh?

1212
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,338
That can't be.

1213
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,840
Does anyone have a lighter?

1214
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,593
I may drink, but I don't smoke.

1215
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,262
Should I start smoking again then?

1216
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,349
How can you not have
lighters in a kitchen?

1217
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,808
Well, yeah. It's a kitchen.

1218
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:31,894
I have a torch. Hold on.

1219
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,437
-I'll shine a light.
-Where was it?

1220
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,356
-Help him find it.
-It's so dark. I can't see.

1221
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:36,357
My legs.

1222
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,151
[Seung-hyo] Hey, wait. Slow down.

1223
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,903
-[Seok-ryu] For what?
-[Seung-hyo] Okay?

1224
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:41,904
[Seung-hyo] Hey.

1225
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,530
[Mi-suk] It works.

1226
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,074
-The door's unlocked.
-Slow down.

01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,285
[amusing music playing]

1228
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,580
CONGRATULATIONS
SEOK-RYU'S WELCOME HOME PARTY

1229
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,210
[Seok-ryu] My gosh!

1230
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,588
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,131
[all cheering]

1232
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:06,220
Mom, Dad? What's going on?

1233
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,764
Well, so…

1234
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,892
We wanted to throw a party
to welcome you back home.

1235
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:16,272
[laughs] But I've been home
for some time now.

1236
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,775
This is so cheesy. Whose idea was this?

1237
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,527
It was him.

1238
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,444
Him.

1239
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,781
[Seok-ryu] This is ridiculous.

1240
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:27,241
[Geun-sik] What will you do?

1241
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:29,118
[line ringing]

1242
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:31,495
Aunt Mi-suk, I found Seok-ryu.

1243
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,999
Yeah. But I was thinking.

1244
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,584
How about we give her
a welcome home party tonight?

1245
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:39,461
I know it's a little late,

1246
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,214
but we didn't do anything for her
when she came home.

1247
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,341
What are you doing?

1248
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,052
I mean, I just… [clears throat]

1249
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,887
I just wanted to
have a meal with everyone.

1250
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,557
You prepared a lot, Uncle Geun-sik.

1251
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,351
-Because you told me to.
-Okay, then!

1252
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,936
-Come in.
-Let's sit, everyone.

1253
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,439
-Sit down.
-Yeah, let's sit.

1254
01:11:58,522 --> 01:11:59,898
Goodness!

1255
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:03,777
Chef, please introduce tonight's dishes.

1256
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,238
[all cheering]

1257
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,699
-What's with you all? [laughs]
-[all laughing]

1258
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:12,453
It's been a while for me.
I'm a little nervous. [laughs]

1259
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,538
Wait a second. All right.

1260
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,166
Tonight's main dish is

1261
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:21,170
gungjung tteokbokki, which was served
originally during the Joseon Dynasty.

1262
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:24,923
It has rice cakes made with
organic brown rice fresh from the mill.

1263
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:28,469
They've been cooked and reduced
in the chef's special sauce

1264
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,013
for the person I love the most
in the whole world…

1265
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:32,306
[sniffles]

1266
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,144
For my daughter,

1267
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,775
I present this special dish. [chuckles]

1268
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,027
-[Dong-jin] A round of applause!
-[all clapping]

1269
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:46,987
Thanks, Dad.

1270
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:51,241
This is the only type of tteokbokki
you can eat now. Got it?

1271
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,202
Okay.

1272
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,705
Weren't you worried the food
would get cold? What a long speech.

1273
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:57,956
-Let's eat.
-Goodness!

1274
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,583
You should say a few words too.

1275
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:00,709
-[Dong-jin] Yeah.
-Hey! No.

1276
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,836
-A speech to welcome her home.
-Hurry up.

1277
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,381
-I'll do it sitting down.
-[laughs]

1278
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,009
We're a family.

1279
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,260
[pleasant music playing]

1280
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,513
A family doesn't just share
the good times.

1281
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,893
A family shares the difficult, sad,
and painful times together too.

1282
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:21,730
So…

1283
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,191
from now on,

1284
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,902
no more keeping things to yourself.

1285
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,695
[Dong-jin] No more.

1286
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,073
That's our family motto now.

1287
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,409
-Our motto!
-Sounds good!

1288
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:35,452
Friends are family too!

1289
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,622
-Family!
-Just join our family. [laughs]

1290
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,834
We have so many kids.
We have four of them.

1291
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,585
We've always been family.

1292
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,254
That's right.

1293
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,296
[Mo-eum] Yeah. Hey.

1294
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,924
But what do we do about the cake?
We didn't light it.

1295
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,968
It's fine. Our surprise failed.
Don't do it.

1296
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,345
No, we can have it for dessert later.

1297
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,055
-[Mo-eum] Yeah, okay.
-[Geun-sik] Okay.

1298
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,893
This is fried yam.
Yams are good for the stomach.

1299
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,855
I'm going to grate and fry them
for your breakfast and dinner.

1300
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,023
-You better eat them all.
-[Dong-jin] Hey.

1301
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,275
Eat up.

1302
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,235
How dare you talk that way
your older sister?

1303
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:09,153
You brat!

1304
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,029
-Her name's not "Hey."
-Be respectful.

1305
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,030
[Mi-suk] Do it now.

1306
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,701
Seok-ryu, eat up.

1307
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,328
-[Mo-eum exclaims]
-[Geun-sik chuckles]

1308
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,623
-[Seok-ryu] Let's eat!
-Thanks for the food!

1309
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,791
Thank you for the meal.

1310
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,502
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

1311
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,508
[music ends]

1312
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:35,220
[Mo-eum grunts]

1313
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,598
-I'm so full.
-[laughs]

1314
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:39,057
My stomach might explode.

1315
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,809
[dog barks distantly]

1316
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,899
-What?
-[Geun-sik] What?

1317
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,525
No, it's not what I meant.

1318
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,819
That's how good the food was.
I ate a lot.

1319
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,488
That's what I meant.

1320
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:57,451
Seriously, I'm okay. Don't worry.

1321
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:58,952
-You scared us.
-[Dong-jin sighs]

1322
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,997
-[Mo-eum] She says she's fine.
-All right.

1323
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,999
Come up to the rooftop tomorrow.

1324
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,375
I'll be your personal trainer.

1325
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,629
Are you insane?
Why would I entrust my body to you?

1326
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:09,630
I'll help you too.

1327
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:12,299
-Honorary paramedic, Bae Seok-ryu.
-So cheesy!

1328
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,384
-Gross.
-[Mo-eum] Hey, call 119.

1329
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:17,804
I'll come faster than anyone
from the dispatch center.

1330
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,766
[chuckles softly] I love
getting this type of treatment.

1331
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,101
My dad's going to
make me gungjung tteokbokki.

1332
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,686
That's not all.

1333
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,397
I'll make you whatever you want,
three square meals a day.

1334
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,025
-Of course.
-Then, what about you?

1335
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,235
Will you build me a house?

1336
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,945
[scoffs] Don't get your hopes up.

1337
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,530
-That sounds good.
-Seung-hyo.

1338
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:35,864
It was worth a try.

1339
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,533
-Aunt Mi-suk!
-What about you, Mom?

1340
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,036
I'll scrub your back.
Let's go to the bathhouse tomorrow.

1341
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,579
Okay, let's go.

1342
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,289
[Geun-sik chuckles]

1343
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,708
Want to come too? Just like old times?

1344
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:50,170
Why would I go with you?
You lunatic. Don't be ridiculous.

1345
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:53,131
I mean, we can just go
to the bathhouse together.

1346
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,467
Then, we'll part ways
in front of the lockers.

1347
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,261
-What were you thinking?
-[Mi-suk] Yeah.

1348
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,429
[Seung-hyo] I wasn't thinking
about anything. Jeez.

1349
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,223
[Mo-eum] He's stuttering.
He was thinking.

1350
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,183
-[Seok-ryu] He's flustered.
-[Mo-eum] He did!

1351
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,477
[Mi-suk] Hey, stop ganging up
on Seung-hyo!

1352
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,687
-You did? Why you…
-I didn't!

1353
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,730
-[Geun-sik] Come here!
-[Seung-hyo] I'm innocent!

1354
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,482
Why is he going in?

1355
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:12,985
[Geun-sik] You better have
that house built!

1356
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,570
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

1357
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,363
[slow music playing]

1358
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,075
[music ends]

1359
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,076
[door opens]

1360
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,455
[door closes]

1361
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,417
[Hye-suk] You're home late.

1362
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,014
I'm sorry. I couldn't make it to lunch.

1363
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:45,142
No, it's fine.

1364
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:49,062
Things were hectic for me too,
so I forgot.

1365
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,190
Honey.

1366
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,652
I have something to tell you.

1367
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:02,159
[sighs]

1368
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,412
So do I.

1369
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:08,540
Go ahead. Mine might take a while.

1370
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,668
Let's get a divorce.

1371
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,632
What?

1372
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:17,758
I want a divorce.

1373
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,140
[phone vibrating]

1374
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:28,769
HYEON-JUN

1375
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:33,899
[exhales]

1376
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:37,319
Hello?

1377
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,112
[Hyeon-jun] You picked up.

1378
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:41,990
I'm glad.

1379
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,617
I have no reason not to.

1380
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:46,203
Where are you?

1381
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,413
Where else? I'm at my hotel.

1382
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,583
[Seok-ryu] Did you have something to say?

1383
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,126
Yeah.

1384
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,297
I'm going back to the US.

1385
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,425
I think…

1386
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,054
this call might be

1387
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:06,431
the last one I give you.

1388
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,933
[slow music playing]

1389
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:11,978
Seok-ryu.

1390
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,357
I…

1391
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,111
loved you so much.

1392
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,656
But…

1393
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:24,908
[sighs]

1394
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,329
…I think the way I loved you was wrong.

1395
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,709
I only focused on
getting you back on your feet.

1396
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,754
I never thought to fall down with you.

1397
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,591
It was only after I came to Korea…

1398
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:47,222
that I realized who the people
you truly needed were…

1399
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,060
and where you needed to be.

1400
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:55,188
I'm sorry.

1401
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,232
Back then,

1402
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,819
I couldn't relate to your pain.

1403
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:03,405
I couldn't accept you…

1404
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,367
for who you were.

1405
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,453
No, it was my fault.

1406
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,997
I used being sick as an excuse

1407
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,292
and exploited you.

1408
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:18,754
I was so consumed with my own emotions

1409
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,382
that I didn't recognize…

1410
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,386
how lonely you were.

1411
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,724
Seok-ryu,

1412
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,478
let's not regret the time we shared.

1413
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:39,441
Let's remember
how I was everything to you

1414
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,987
and how you meant
everything to me back then.

1415
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,074
That should be enough then.

1416
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,495
Okay.

All right.

Hi.

Are you going to work?

Are you going to class?

1430

I asked you first.

1431
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:59,104
What, you think
I'd be getting off work at this hour?

1432
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:03,900
True. Hey, don't work too late.

1433
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,152
It's pointless to devote yourself to work.

1434
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:08,697
It's my company. I'll take care of it.

1435
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:10,615
That's true too.

1436
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,411
All right, you take care of it,

1440
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,335
[Seung-hyo] I'm not.
I said I'm going to work.

1441
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:25,005
Yeah, I know that. But go a different way.

1442
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:28,383
Before I cook, I need time
to seriously meditate alone.

-Hyeong-chan.
-Yes, sir?

[Seung-hyo] Come here.

1448
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,318
Why is the proposal so flat?

1449
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,236
Did you finish analyzing
the surrounding area?

1450
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,572
-What about the commercial district?
-Not yet.

the construction procedures first--

1452

You did things in the wrong order.

1453
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:58,496
If we review regulations and build
according to those sizes, we're done?

[pop song playing]

1455

You need to work

If we only consider the ratios,

[Hyeong-chan] I'm sorry.
I'll have it redone.

Mr. Choi's in a good mood today.

Did you review Misom's flagship store
and its environmental sustainability?

No, not yet.

1464
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,523
I asked you to do that a while ago.
You still haven't finished?

[Seung-hyo] It can bear fruit?

1471
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:45,377
Can it bloom flowers too?

1472
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,419
Of course.

it needs a lot of sunshine

1477

for around six to ten hours a day.

1478
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,606
Also, it likes warm temperatures.

1479
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,568
Putting it in a place with a good breeze
will make it feel less humid.

1480
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,738
Don't be withering alone again.

1481
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:16,950
Tell me if you have something to say.

1482

-Where?
