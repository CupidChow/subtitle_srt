1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,897
WANT SOME PORK BELLY?

3
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,946
What am I doing here?

4
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,157
What do you think? You're cleaning grills.

5
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,618
Make sure to clean them thoroughly.

6
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,286
Look, these aren't clean at all.

7
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,121
I can't believe I trusted this nutcase

8
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,373
when she said
she'd take me someplace nice.

9
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,374
This is someplace nice.

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,294
You can work out and also smell the meat.

11
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,757
Grilled pork jowls, pork neck,

12
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,467
and pork belly too.

13
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,302
I wish they made perfumes out of them.

14
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,596
Are you being optimistic or insane?

15
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,097
Optimistically insane?

16
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,182
I see.

17
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,726
It's tough, right?

18
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,355
Still,

19
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,525
this is nothing compared to dinner time.

20
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,281
Good luck.

21
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,960
Good luck.

22
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,547
Wait, are you leaving? Really?

23
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,008
-Let me go.
-No way.

24
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,552
Over my dead body.

25
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,761
Let me go right now.

26
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,848
No, I can't! I won't let you go!

27
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,724
-Let me go.
-No.

28
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,144
You and I are in the same boat today!

29
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,271
Stop clinging to my pants!

30
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,398
Then stop trying to leave.

31
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,775
I won't go, so let go of my pants already!

32
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,194
-Do you promise?
-I do. So just let go.

33
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,823
Jeez.

34
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,452
Look at you.
Already spending your part-time pay.

35
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,789
The reason you're always broke
is because you buy these useless things.

36
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,332
Hey.

37
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,376
Let's go out this weekend.

38
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,628
What is it this time?

39
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,047
A part-time job cleaning corpses?

40
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,093
That must pay a lot.

41
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,763
-Why didn't I think of that sooner?
-What?

42
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,390
Where can I get a job doing that?

43
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,226
-This isn't what I expected.
-You're a genius!

44
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,687
Why earn money
if you're going to waste it?

45
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,230
In order to waste it, of course!

46
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,030
What is this?

47
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,744
I was right!

48
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,955
I knew you'd find it first
if I hid it here.

49
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,499
This is made of real gold, okay?

50
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,209
Don't give it to anyone else.

51
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,298
It's beautiful.

52
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:22,428
HATE

53
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,246
Onto the next news item.

54
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,374
Many of you
will find this quite thrilling.

55
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,420
This week brings
a spectacular cosmic event,

56
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:59,048
the Eta Aquariids meteor shower.

57
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,260
With the moon
in its waning crescent phase,

58
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,555
its light will have minimal impact
on the visibility of the shower.

59
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,889
However, please be aware

60
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,600
that potential rain could impact
the visibility of the event.

61
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,893
Come and eat.

62
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,645
-If the weather is favorable--
-Okay.

63
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,940
So should I…

64
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,900
wake Seok-ryu up?

65
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,155
Maybe I should just let her sleep, right?

66
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,282
Hey.

67
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,286
Good morning.

68
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,663
Did you sleep well?

69
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,290
I slept like a baby.

70
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,417
What is this?

71
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,962
You made gochujang stew, Mom?

72
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,674
This smell makes it feel like
I'm truly back home.

73
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,385
Right? Your mom's gochujang stew
is the best.

74
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,636
Here you go.

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,346
Why are there only three portions?

76
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,557
Where's my bowl of rice, Mom?

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,516
Honey.

78
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,310
Mom.

79
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,064
I see. She's pretending I don't exist.

80
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,274
It's fine. I can get it on my own.

81
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,817
Yes, good thinking.

82
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,947
She's already so skinny as she is.
You should at least feed--

83
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,078
I'm asking you one last time.

84
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,996
Did you really mean everything you said

85
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,164
last night?

86
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,375
Tell me the truth.

87
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,419
No matter how I look at it,

88
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,465
I can't believe that you cheated.
You don't have it in you.

89
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,591
How do you know?

90
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,344
Maybe I have a whole other
seductress side of me.

91
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,261
You little…

92
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,431
I know you do outlandish things sometimes,

93
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,558
but never something like this.

94
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,310
You have a line you wouldn't cross.

95
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,605
Right. You continued going to school
even after you ran away from home.

96
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,526
There must be a valid reason
for your decision to end your engagement

97
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,944
and quit your job.

98
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,904
So tell me what it is.

99
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,907
I just got bored.

100
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,117
What?

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,536
I worked in the same company
for too many years.

102
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,663
I was fed up with it all.

103
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,289
And then it got me thinking,

104
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,251
"Wouldn't I eventually
get bored with my marriage too?"

105
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,044
So I quit both of them.

106
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,629
-Hey…
-Are you kidding me?

107
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,760
So what are you planning to do now?

108
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,972
You wouldn't have caused
such a commotion without a plan, right?

109
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,349
-Of course not.
-Of course she has a plan!

110
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,309
-The last letter of your MBTI is…
-J.

111
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,521
So tell me what you're going to do now.

112
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,480
First,

113
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,483
-I'm going to sleep.
-What?

114
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,569
-She's going to sleep.
-I'm turning off my alarm

115
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,779
and sleeping for as long as I want.

116
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,116
And I also want to eat
a lot of good Korean food.

117
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,033
You…

118
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,789
And then?

119
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,957
And then…

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,918
I just want to do nothing for a while.

121
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,671
Is that your plan?

122
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,589
Yes.

123
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,134
I want to be happily unemployed.

124
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,431
You stay out of it!

125
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,100
-Were you serious?
-Yes.

126
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,768
I was completely serious for real.

127
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,063
You don't get to eat.

128
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,441
You don't have the right to eat.

129
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,152
You're being so harsh.

130
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,862
You're all being so loud.

131
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,114
-You woke me up.
-You little… Wake up earlier.

132
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,950
What are you, a caveman? Wear something.

133
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,161
This body is meant to be seen, not hidden.

134
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,122
Eat your breakfast.

135
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,082
Someone is here.

136
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,004
-You go. I'm your older sister.
-See who it is.

137
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,256
Who is it?

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,966
-It's Seung-hyo.
-Is it?

139
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,926
Well, let him in!

140
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,802
Mo-eum is here too.

141
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,889
-I'm touched.
-Get dressed, Dong-jin.

142
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,724
-That's right.
-Okay.

143
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,392
Cover yourself up.

144
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,728
Hello.

145
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,271
How are you, Auntie?

146
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,648
-Welcome.
-Good morning.

147
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,732
-What's all this?
-Morning.

148
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,192
Look up.

149
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,111
-Show me your tongue.
-Mo-eum.

150
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,072
Your temperature
and blood pressure seem fine.

151
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:51,989
Anything else?

152
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,284
Were you worried
that I might've beaten her to death?

153
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,455
Well, you almost did break her leg
when she ran away from home before.

154
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,082
I should've gone through with it.

155
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,042
-Come on.
-Did you get any sleep?

156
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,335
What do you think?

157
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,461
Of course you couldn't.

158
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,173
I brought you some
of your favorite pumpkin porridge.

159
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,385
You're the only one who takes care of me.

160
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,971
What about me, Seung-hyo?
I passed out yesterday.

161
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,138
Don't just stand about.

162
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,932
You two didn't have breakfast, right?

163
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,100
I didn't.

164
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,686
I did, but I can always eat more.

165
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,729
Hey, this is my seat.

166
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,856
What a generous household this is.

167
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,818
Starving the daughter to feed the guests.

168
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,945
-Eat up. There's more.
-Okay.

169
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,071
Give me your bowls.

170
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,823
-The stew is cold.
-It's fine.

171
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,449
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

172
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,706
-That's right. Share.
-Thanks.

173
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,040
Thank you for the meal.

174
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,250
We need to talk.

175
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,586
No, we don't.
I came here to see Aunt Mi-suk.

176
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,130
Come have breakfast, Dong-jin!

177
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,298
Don't make me serve it twice.

178
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:51,882
I'm not eating.

179
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,220
Consuming carbs is a crime,
and consuming sodium is a punishment.

180
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,472
I can't get tempted by them.

181
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,849
What a bunch of nonsense.

182
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,768
Look, idiot. Tofu, kimchi,
seasoned vegetables, and meat.

183
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,271
-It can't get any healthier than this.
-Here, honey.

184
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,230
Thanks.

185
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,025
You should know these things
if you want to be a trainer.

186
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,443
Don't get on my nerves.

187
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,529
This is why
you keep failing the certification exam.

188
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,240
Look who's talking, you jobless pest.

189
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,534
-Excuse me?
-There they go again.

190
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,662
Did you just call me a pest?

191
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,374
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,
my pest of a sister.

192
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,335
Did you just grab my hair bun, you brat?

193
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,252
Let go.

194
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,921
Not on my watch.
Get your hand off my head first, you pest.

195
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,590
Let go, or else!

196
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,764
Where are you going, Mom?

197
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,308
That brute tore out my hair.

198
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,810
Where's she going, Dad?

199
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,895
You'll find out soon.

200
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,688
Five,

201
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,065
four,

202
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,399
three,

203
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,901
two,

204
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,818
one.

205
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,207
Is this coming from our basement?

206
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,458
Yes.

207
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,753
A legendary drummer lives in our basement.

208
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,673
She only appears when her anger peaks.

209
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,925
Is that drum kit

210
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,386
the one you got in middle school
when you wanted to be a musician?

211
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,513
Mom is so talented.

212
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,723
She's good at anything
that involves hitting.

213
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,641
She does.

214
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,643
-She's really good.
-Yes.

215
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,770
She's like Ringo Starr.

216
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,232
She's as skilled at hitting those drums
as she is at hitting people.

217
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,290
Come on, tell me already.

218
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,000
What really happened?

219
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,172
Why did you quit your job
and break off your engagement?

220
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,757
You're rubbing it in.

221
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,511
How could you rub salt in my wounds
when your job is to save people?

222
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,305
You need to tell me so I can help you out.

223
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,433
Why did you do it? Whose fault was it?

224
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,560
Who, what, when, where, why, and how?

225
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,062
Did my mom ask you to ask me?

226
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,732
Yes. In the utility room.

227
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,943
I'll let it go since you were honest.

228
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,446
It just doesn't make any sense.

229
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,782
It's not something
a perfectionist like you would do.

230
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,785
A perfectionist?

231
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,912
-Me?
-Yes.

232
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,206
No one else I know
lives as diligently as you.

233
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,209
Competitiveness, grit, drive,

234
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,420
achievement, meticulousness,
and persistence.

235
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,298
As I see it, you have it all.

236
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,092
Do I? You flatter me too much.

237
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,886
It wasn't a compliment.

238
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,971
You're obsessed with success,

239
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,931
neurotic about others' opinions,

240
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,058
-and you have too much ambition--
-Hey!

241
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,518
That's very accurate.

242
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,395
So why would someone like you

243
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,441
give up everything and come back here?

244
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,734
Stuff happens, okay?

245
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,194
Sure.

246
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,362
To someone else, maybe.

247
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,740
But not to you.

248
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,326
Come on.

249
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,162
Spit out the truth.

250
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,914
-Come on.
-It's five minutes to nine.

251
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,123
Tell me. What?

252
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,124
You're late.

253
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,584
-Go on.
-Darn it.

254
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,213
-I'm not done with you.
-Bye.

255
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,297
See you.

256
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,509
If you keep lazing around like that,

257
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,177
you'll go to the Hell of Indolence.

258
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,679
I don't care. I'm in heaven right now.

259
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,098
If this is what heaven is like,
I'd rather not go.

260
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,099
How do you even sleep here?

261
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,101
Come here for a second, Choisseung.

262
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,395
-Why?
-I have something to say.

263
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,855
Get up first.

264
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,066
Just come here for a second!

265
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,984
-I don't want to.
-Come on!

266
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,654
It's important! Come on, hurry up!

267
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,365
Stop throwing a tantrum, you nutcase.

268
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,116
What is it now?

269
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,493
Come closer.

270
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,328
-Jeez.
-Hey.

271
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,621
Wanna know something cool?

272
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,915
You traitor.

273
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,543
How could you
just hand me over to my mom like that?

274
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,710
I'll end you today.

275
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,295
I did it for you.

276
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,297
You did it for me?

277
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,924
Is that right?

278
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,717
George Orwell once said,

279
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,638
"The quickest way of ending a war
is to lose it."

280
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,307
Bae Seok-ryu once said,

281
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,810
"A traitor must be punished by death."

282
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,687
I can't breathe. Aunt Mi-suk!

283
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,980
What's going on?

284
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,190
-Take that, you jerk.
-You little brat! What are you doing?

285
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,317
-It hurts.
-My goodness.

286
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,069
Are you okay, Seung-hyo?

287
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,237
-Auntie.
-You're nuts!

288
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,697
She tried to kill me.

289
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,574
Dear me.

290
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,076
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

291
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,496
Judging by the way you coddle him,
you'd think he's your actual son.

292
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,914
If only that was the case!

293
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,041
Yeah? Then why don't you
exchange me for him?

294
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,587
There's an idea. Should I be your son
from now on, Aunt Mi-suk?

295
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,423
I'm all for it. But what about work?

296
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,549
I have to go now.

297
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,426
It hurts.

298
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,553
Hey, get up.

299
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,513
You didn't have to kick me.

300
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,891
You should be grateful
I didn't trample you to death!

301
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,642
You're so mean to me, Mom.

302
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,560
Shut it.

303
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,438
Get up and take these rice cakes
to Seung-hyo's office.

304
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,398
Tell him to do it himself!

305
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,357
-Rice cakes?
-Yes.

306
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,277
I ordered some rice cakes for you.

307
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,071
You should hand them out
to everyone in the neighborhood.

308
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,866
You take such good care of me. Thank you.

309
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,659
How touching.

310
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,287
You're moving me to tears.

311
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,204
Get up!

312
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,166
He looks so handsome.

313
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,167
Na-yun!

314
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,963
So the client from Buryeong-dong
wants the windows somewhere else?

315
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,884
Yes. Initially, he wanted them
oriented east for the morning sun.

316
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,054
But now he wants to see sunsets instead.

317
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,306
Why does he keep changing his mind?

318
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,641
We already started construction!

319
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,020
Hey, I called you in
to organize the desks,

320
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,439
but here you are,
organizing Seung-hyo's photos instead.

321
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,274
-Myeong-u.
-Hey.

322
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,901
What did the Buryeong-dong client say?

323
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,152
He said…

324
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,154
Oh, is she a new client?

325
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,865
-Hello, welcome.
-Hello.

326
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,909
What is this?

327
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,872
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,209
You'll have to wait a bit
since Seung-hyo's on the phone.

329
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,003
Don't worry about it.
I just came to deliver the rice cakes.

330
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,465
You even brought us rice cakes.
We should at least serve you some tea.

331
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,885
These are from my mom.
I'm just delivering them.

332
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,681
Wait, are you…

333
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,558
the childhood friend
that Seung-hyo told me about?

334
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,060
Yes, I am. Do you know me?

335
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,147
Of course I do!
I'm thrilled to finally meet you.

336
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,441
-That's right. Next Tuesday,
-Yes?

337
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,610
we're hosting an opening party.

338
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,112
You should come.

339
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,613
Oh, okay.

340
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,365
Drink up.

341
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,617
So you've known Seung-hyo for a long time?

342
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,328
I guess we have a long history.

343
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,122
Please enlighten me.

344
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,249
I want to know everything chronologically.

345
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,043
-Well, let's see.
-Don't.

346
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,503
It's going to be very long.

347
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,257
You know he was born in France, right?

348
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,174
Yes.

349
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,553
It all started in 1995.

350
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,097
A summer's day

351
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,267
when the playground dirt
was as hot as coal.

352
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,270
-Bonjour.
-Seung-hyo.

353
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,648
It was a day like any other.
I came home from playing outside

354
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,775
and found a boy
standing in front of my house.

355
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,527
That was Seung-hyo.

356
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,571
-Get along, okay?
-Okay.

357
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,822
Say hello, Seung-hyo.

358
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,907
Hi. What's your name?

359
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,077
He was so short
and couldn't speak any Korean either.

360
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,621
He kept hiding behind his mother.

361
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,415
That was when it hit me.

362
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,416
Say hello.

363
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,544
I'd have to help this fragile boy out.

364
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,545
I'll leave him in your care.

365
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,880
Don't worry about a thing.

366
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,049
Aunt Hye-suk left Seung-hyo in our care

367
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,301
when she began working
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

368
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,635
because my mom

369
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,763
-used to work as a babysitter.
-Welcome.

370
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,056
You're so cute.

371
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,224
-She's a cutie.
-You little brat.

372
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,894
That was when I started looking after him.

373
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,896
Does my baby
want to be a king or a prince?

374
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,064
No, wait.

375
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,149
You should be a princess.

376
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,484
All of this is your castle.

377
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,236
I engaged him in creative play.

378
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,196
It's huge, right?

379
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,199
Do you need to pee, baby?

380
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,120
I protected his dignity as a toddler
and took care of his hygiene.

381
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,582
This will make you grow taller.

382
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,251
And this will make your teeth stronger.

383
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,005
I also encouraged healthy eating habits
so he could get proper nutrition.

384
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,465
This one is just good for you.

385
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,467
Eat up, my baby.

386
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,931
Everyone, be nice to him.

387
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,641
You don't have a problem with that,

388
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,518
right?

389
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,522
I contributed to his social development
within his peer group.

390
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,692
Yes, I believe we have enough.

391
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,444
Let's go, baby.

392
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,822
I even helped him learn about economics.

393
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,244
I basically raised Seung-hyo.

394
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,539
That's just what you think.

395
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,003
Don't come to my workplace
and spread rumors about me.

396
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,214
I should sue you
for spreading false information.

397
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,675
What an ungrateful jerk.

398
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,010
You should repay me instead of suing me!

399
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,095
She's right.

400
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,056
Don't trust her.
Every word she says is a lie.

401
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,975
She's a compulsive liar.

402
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,811
No way.
Her story doesn't sound like a lie.

403
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,354
It has a narrative arc.

404
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,481
-Yes, it does.
-Yes.

405
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,774
But it's been manipulated.

406
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,484
This girl

407
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,655
was the first lunatic I met in my life.

408
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,573
Lunatic?

409
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,118
Seung-hyo, she's my old friend, Mi-suk.

410
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,079
And that girl is her daughter, Seok-ryu.

411
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,372
She's the same age as you.

412
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,459
Hi. What's your name?

413
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,087
You're dirty.

414
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,840
I could tell since our first encounter.

415
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,383
-Hi, Seok-ryu.
-Hello!

416
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,218
She was so aggressive.

417
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,469
You're so cute.

418
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,679
It was overwhelming.

419
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,389
Gross.

420
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,437
Does my baby
want to be a king or a prince?

421
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,480
You both know me.

422
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,940
I need my alone time.

423
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,358
It's sticky.

424
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,861
But this girl

425
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,071
-All of this is your castle.
-never left me alone.

426
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,781
It's so big!

427
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,451
She disrupted my peaceful solitude.

428
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,620
Do you need to pee, baby?

429
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,962
Hey!

430
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,506
-She sexually harassed me,
-Mom! He's speaking Korean!

431
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,425
leaving me no choice but to speak up.

432
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,761
-I hate beans in rice.
-And she says she taught me Korean.

433
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,139
Here.

434
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,016
Eat some beans, Seung-hyo.

435
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,062
She gave me things
that she didn't want to eat.

436
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,146
I don't like them.

437
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,233
A baby shouldn't be picky.

438
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,318
Eat up, my baby.

439
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,986
Who's going to be "it"?

440
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,655
My baby.

441
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,740
He'll do it.

442
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,617
-Red light, green light.
-Baby should be "it."

443
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,743
Red light…

444
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,286
She told everyone to be nice,

445
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,205
but made me be "it" all the time.

446
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,380
Let's go, baby.

447
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,508
That's right. She even began
stealing my money later on.

448
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,676
I'll get my revenge.

449
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,262
All my allowance

450
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,639
turned into chocolates and ice creams

451
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,808
and ended up in that mouth right there.

452
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,477
Says the boy who couldn't even
use the toilet on his own.

453
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,189
You're the little pervert
who followed me into the bathroom.

454
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,607
I was trying to help you.

455
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,192
You couldn't unzip your pants

456
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,986
-and kept wetting yourself.
-Goodness.

457
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,321
Stop spewing such nonsense.

458
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,448
I told you,
some water splashed onto my pants.

459
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,908
It didn't look like water.

460
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,576
Oh dear.

461
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,328
My goodness.

462
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,582
I've never seen Seung-hyo
act so childish before.

463
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,169
Me neither. But seeing how they even
went to the bathroom together,

464
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,130
I can tell they're really close friends.

465
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,717
You know, I've been reading
various romance stories for ten years

466
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,927
-from fanfics to fantasy novels.
-Yeah?

467
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,305
And there's one trope I get crazy over.

468
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,974
The one and only childhood friend trope.

469
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,517
What's that supposed to mean?

470
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,895
They should start looking for
English kindergartens for their kids.

471
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,773
Do you have any idea
how expensive English kindergartens are?

472
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,193
And yet my wife
wants our twins to enroll in one!

473
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,655
Hey, where are you going? I'm not done!

474
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,160
This is Yoon Myeong-u.

475
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,244
Oh, hello.

476
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,997
Excuse me?

477
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,295
-Did you hear?
-What?

478
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,214
Apparently, Root Diner's daughter
cheated on her fiancé,

479
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,424
so the engagement's off.

480
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,303
Of course I heard about that.
Everyone knows already!

481
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,513
-I knew it.
-Oh my.

482
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,558
Didn't Mi-suk brag
about her daughter's great job in the US?

483
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,895
I heard she got fired too.
That'll teach her not to brag so much.

484
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,480
I know, right?

485
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,234
Did you go grocery shopping, Mi-suk?

486
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,820
Yes. I wanted to shred something.

487
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,616
What are you going to shred?

488
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,660
I haven't decided yet.
It could be some vegetables

489
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,954
or someone unlucky.

490
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,089
HYEREUNG REALTY

491
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,133
Hey, Mi-suk.

492
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,011
All right, Hye-suk. Okay.

493
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,972
I'll see what I can do. All right.

494
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,517
Goodbye.

495
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,145
Oh my.

496
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,439
Why is your face so red?

497
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,524
Those darn gossipers.

498
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,859
They're having a field day.

499
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,071
They were absolutely going at it
behind my back!

500
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,614
They're the worst.

501
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,990
If you didn't want that to happen,

502
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,327
you shouldn't have beat up your daughter
in front of everyone…

503
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,412
What I mean is,

504
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:39,334
it would've been better to discipline her
in the privacy of your own home.

505
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,921
What did Hye-suk say?

506
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,091
Actually, she told me
she invited the Hee Sisters

507
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,884
to Seung-hyo's opening party.

508
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,469
You mean Yeong-hee, Soon-hee,
Jung-hee, and Min-hee?

509
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,972
-Yes, them.
-Why would she invite those snooty girls?

510
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,100
Don't you remember Hye-suk telling them
about Seung-hyo's new office

511
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,143
at the class reunion?

512
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,105
Why did she blab about it
to people she's not even close to?

513
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,024
"Oh dear, didn't you guys know?"

514
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,360
"My daughter works for Greip."

515
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,612
"She's getting married too,

516
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,739
and the wedding will be held in the US."

517
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,784
"My son-in-law
is an international lawyer."

518
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,829
It's humid as hell today.

519
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,165
Also, I never spoke that smugly.

520
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,500
"International lawyer. Greip."

521
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,502
-"International lawyer…"
-This is so annoying.

522
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,629
-That's enough!
-Jeez, calm down.

523
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,636
Sunsets in Korea are the best.

524
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,088
It's done.

525
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,567
Bravo! What was that cool trick just now?

526
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,569
It's nothing.

527
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,655
Just a survival tactic I learned abroad.

528
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,032
Oh, I see.

529
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,158
Where's Seung-hyo?

530
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,660
Why would I call that jerk?

531
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,536
Where are you, Seung-hyo?

532
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,829
Don't call him over!

533
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,539
Come to Seok-ryu's if you're done.

534
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,584
What do you mean "why"?
Have dinner with us.

535
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,628
Okay, bye.

536
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,255
Is he coming?

537
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,840
No, he told us to stuff our faces
without him.

538
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,801
Seok-ryu.

539
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,803
Do you have anything to drink?

540
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,762
I don't.

541
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,432
We have better soju at home.

542
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,518
I need that for the diner.

543
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,108
I don't want to see Seok-ryu's face.

544
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,150
Really?

545
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,195
I like that she's back home.

546
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,406
Seriously?

547
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,951
Do you also like seeing her
sprawled around doing nothing?

548
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,371
My blood is boiling
just thinking about it.

549
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,082
I also feel like
I've been through a hurricane.

550
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,711
My heart is in pieces
like it's been hit by a natural disaster.

551
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,798
Then why don't you
have a talk with Seok-ryu?

552
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,717
I bet she's hiding something from us.

553
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,927
Get her to tell you the rest.

554
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,264
Just leave her alone. What's with you?

555
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,809
How could you be so indifferent?
It's like she's a stranger to you.

556
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,561
You're acting as if
she's not your daughter.

557
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,187
That's out of line!

558
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,522
I'm just saying.

559
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,775
You're so carefree, sitting on your hands,

560
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,694
while I feel like I'm on a razor's edge.

561
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,741
There you go, being silent again.

562
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,202
You're avoiding the problem
just like you always do.

563
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,756
I'm too scared to ask.

564
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,925
I'm afraid her engagement broke off

565
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,346
because I wasn't good enough
for her fiancé's family.

566
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,938
That was so cool.

567
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,815
-I'm so good at it, right?
-You are!

568
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,108
-Aren't I awesome?
-You are.

569
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,568
It was like watching a circus.

570
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,778
That was a hard one.

571
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,820
-It looked hard.
-Right?

572
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,614
Come on, show me again!

573
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:41,076
You guys are too loud.
I could hear you down the street.

574
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,328
-Hi.
-Look at this party crasher.

575
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,496
You ruined the mood.

576
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,623
Shoo!

577
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,041
Did you buy something to drink?

578
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,084
Of course not.

579
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,920
You guys don't know how to have fun.

580
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:57,008
Listen. We really need some beer
on a lovely spring night like this.

581
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,260
-Should I go buy some?
-Never mind.

582
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,637
I'll go.

583
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,472
Thanks.

584
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,850
Or should I get rice wine
to go with the green onion pancakes?

585
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,976
Beer for me.

586
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,019
Zip it.

587
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,317
Aren't you too busy
to be here or something?

588
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,444
-Are you picking a fight already?
-No, I mean…

589
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,239
It looked kind of serious earlier.

590
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,159
If you're going to keep lying,
just go home.

591
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,953
Why did you come here anyway?

592
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,496
Watch your mouth.

593
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,248
I carried these all the way here.

594
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,125
-You should be grateful.
-Seung-hyo!

595
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,919
I mean, Mr. Choi. We need to talk.

596
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,344
The townhouse project is being delayed?
Why so suddenly?

597
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,722
Due to the increase in raw materials costs
and construction costs.

598
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,223
It's been suspended indefinitely.

599
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,351
Then they won't pay us for the designs
until construction resumes.

600
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,229
What do we do?
We still have a lot of expenses to cover.

601
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,692
We'll get paid for
the youth center in Seongjin though.

602
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,778
They said they'll pay us next year
because of budget issues.

603
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,530
The economy must be really bad.

604
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,615
We don't have any new clients either.

605
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,828
Something happened, right?

606
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,455
Something's happening right there.

607
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,665
-It's burning.
-Oh no.

608
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,462
Damn it, it's burnt.

609
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,511
I'm glad if it's nothing to worry about.

610
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,929
Do you want some?

611
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,931
You want me to eat that?

612
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,975
No, I'll make you another one.

613
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,394
Move over. I'll make my own.

614
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,687
No way.

615
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,606
You just hurt my pride.

616
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,317
I'll have you know
that I'm known as House Cook Master Bae.

617
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,113
I even had a vlog channel
specializing in Korean cooking.

618
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,240
I see.

619
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,659
You don't believe me?

620
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,412
I'll show it to you.

621
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,540
How long are you going to hold out?

622
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,629
You managed to hold them off for two days,

623
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,340
but your parents and Mo-eum
will keep asking

624
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,842
why you did what you did.

625
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,803
They won't stop asking.

626
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,931
What about you?

627
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,309
Are you going to ask?

628
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,897
I'm not curious.

629
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,026
Hey, I don't care.

630
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,612
I'll never tell you anyway,

631
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,906
even if I tell everyone else in the world.

632
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,741
Fine.

633
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,663
But still,

634
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,416
you shouldn't wait too long
to tell Aunt Mi-suk.

635
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,838
She's your mother.

636
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,770
What is it?

637
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,647
Did Mom ask you to do this?

638
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,190
What?

639
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,985
-Hey.
-You little rat.

640
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,945
Get ready for round two.

641
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,239
Let go of me, you nutcase.

642
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,699
I told you not to let your guard down.

643
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,950
Come on, it really hurts.

644
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,036
-Wait, I'm…
-You punk.

645
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,790
It really hurts.

646
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,464
MY SON-IN-LAW

647
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,439
He's not picking up.

648
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,903
Why are you hiding your phone?

649
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,654
Who were you calling?

650
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,075
I guess she can't hear me.

651
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,498
Your ears aren't
failing already, are they?

652
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,588
Are you going to
Choisseung's opening party tomorrow?

653
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,756
Of course.

654
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,552
Wait, are you going too?

655
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,887
I was invited, so…

656
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,476
No. Why would I go there?

657
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,229
It's only been a few days,
but I'm already sick of him.

658
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,899
Seung-hyo's like that, you know?

659
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,070
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What were you trying to hide?

660
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,197
Give it back now!

661
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,450
Mom.

662
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,410
Did you call him?

663
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,703
Yes.

664
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,623
What? Did I do something wrong?

665
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,876
I told you we were over, Mom!

666
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,503
You're not telling me everything,

667
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,672
so I was going to ask him about it.

668
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,091
What are you doing? Hey, stop!

669
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,635
Don't call him ever again.

670
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,637
You little…

671
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,889
What the…

672
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,393
Did she erase his number? My goodness.

673
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,564
Do I really have to do this interview?

674
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,067
It's not for promo. I know you hate those.

675
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,568
It's a special on Social Overhead Capital.

676
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,239
A reporter wanted to ask us
about the senior center we built.

677
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:12,991
Is that so?

678
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,243
What are you reading anyway?

679
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,286
I'm researching precedents.

680
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,831
It's not right
that they're not paying us the design fee.

681
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,958
I'll ask around

682
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,584
and meet up with a lawyer I know.

683
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,378
Would that help?

684
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,842
The contract doesn't specify
when the design fee has to be paid.

685
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,343
Still, I should try everything.

686
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,304
I'm worried about the loans too.

687
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,306
Seung-hyo.

688
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,643
Were we being rash
by building our own office?

689
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:42,937
Wait.

690
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,189
I think that's the reporter.

691
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,692
He's going in the wrong direction.

692
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,902
What…

693
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,072
It's dangerous here, ma'am.

694
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,866
I have to pick these up.

695
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,659
It's such a waste.

696
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,994
Let me. Please wait over there.

697
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,040
Wait here, ma'am.

698
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,876
I'm sorry.

699
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,338
Thank you.

700
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,593
Mr. Choi Seung-hyo?

701
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,677
Let's hurry.

702
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,596
Oh, right.

703
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:21,976
Goodness.

704
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,564
The wheels are worn out
and the axle is crooked.

705
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,567
I managed to balance it for now,
but it won't last long.

706
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,028
Where were you going?

707
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,821
I'm taking them to a junkyard.

708
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,450
How much can you sell them for?

709
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,287
I used to get at least 130 won for 1 kg,

710
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,664
but now I only get less than 100 won.

711
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:50,088
I stole too much of your time.

712
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,631
Thank you for your help.

713
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,176
Will you be okay
with pulling this by yourself?

714
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,804
I'll be fine. I do this every day.

715
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,307
Then please be careful, ma'am.

716
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,434
Let's go and do our interview.

717
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,895
Do you want to push or pull?

718
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,439
I'll push.

719
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,152
We'll help you out.

720
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,446
-Ready?
-Yes.

721
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,956
Why aren't they coming?

722
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,966
It's utterly unbelievable.

723
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,384
Sorry?

724
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,720
Oh, do you want some water?
I thought you didn't want any.

725
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,305
I'm not talking about that.

726
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,100
She only got 3,000 won
for that much cardboard and paper.

727
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,395
I know, right?

728
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,231
It was hard enough for two grown men.

729
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,358
How does she do it every day?

730
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,820
Life is tough.

731
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,663
Hyeon-jun.

732
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,837
I really…

733
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,218
I really need you right now.

734
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,182
Hyeon-jun.

735
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,965
It's the last stop.

736
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,007
Please get off.

737
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,719
Oh, sorry.

738
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,432
Thank you, sir.

739
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,517
No problem.

740
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,607
Hello, sir.

741
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,078
The two of you used to work
at Jangyu Architecture, right?

742
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:13,165
It's the best architecture firm in Korea,
not to mention ranking eleventh worldwide.

743
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,294
May I ask
why you chose to branch out so early?

744
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,966
I learned the basic principles
of architecture at Jangyu.

745
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,928
They taught me everything I needed to know
to make a living.

746
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,558
But since it's a huge company
that is departmentalized,

747
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,561
some parts were out of my hands.

748
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,062
You're right.

749
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,480
The more I gained experience,

750
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,900
the more I wanted to try
handling the projects by myself,

751
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,486
from start to finish.

752
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,157
It seems like you've achieved success
in a highly competitive field,

753
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,576
with your own architectural firm
opening soon.

754
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,703
How does it feel?

755
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,538
To be honest, I'm regretting it.

756
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,040
Sorry?

757
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,335
What are you talking about?

758
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,088
I doubt my decision a dozen times a day

759
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,215
and wonder if I've made the right choice.

760
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,593
But I still think that it's better

761
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,305
to regret doing something
than to regret not doing something.

762
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,187
I'm sorry. I have to take this.

763
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,521
No worries.

764
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,361
There's no hidden meaning behind it.

765
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,209
When will you be back?

766
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,670
The day after tomorrow.

767
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,881
I'm on duty, and I have a seminar too.

768
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,217
Did you forget
about Seung-hyo's opening ceremony?

769
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,260
You should've cleared your schedule.

770
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,345
I had no other choice.

771
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,640
I'll send him flowers and give him a call.

772
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,101
Do whatever you want.

773
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,981
When is your next assignment?

774
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,692
It's been a month since you returned
from Tunisia--

775
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,152
It'll happen when it happens.

776
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,446
Why? Do you want to get rid of me already?

777
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,490
Tell me when you know for sure.

778
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,693
POMEGRANATE TREE

779
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,074
What are you doing here?

780
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,827
Why are you home so late?

781
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,370
I asked you first.

782
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,663
Get some sleep.

783
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,540
Hey!

784
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:01,584
What?

785
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,003
Take this.

786
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,092
A pomegranate tree?

787
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,427
For the opening ceremony tomorrow.

788
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,637
I wanted to get you something unique.

789
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,181
There, it'll remind you of me.

790
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:16,932
Can I throw it away?

791
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,476
Yes, you can throw it away,

792
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,020
but pomegranates symbolize abundance.

793
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:25,774
With every leaf that falls out,
your company will shrivel up too.

794
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,194
So you were trying to curse me.
Take it back.

795
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,529
You can't give back a present. Keep it.

796
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,657
Just bring it with you tomorrow.
It's too heavy.

797
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,409
I'm not going tomorrow.

798
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,287
Why? Are you busy?

799
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,914
Yes. Terribly busy.

800
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,374
Say hello to Mr. Yoon for me.

801
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,766
Where is it?

802
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,101
I know I put it somewhere around here.

803
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,022
What are you looking for?
You're going to be late.

804
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,565
My brooch.

805
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,860
The one you bought me a long time ago
with a pearl in the middle.

806
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,195
Oh, that?

807
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,239
Why are you looking for that?

808
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,199
I want to wear it to the ceremony.

809
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,285
My old classmates are coming,

810
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,955
and they're always dressed to the nines.

811
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,499
Isn't that brooch old and kind of beat-up?

812
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,792
You said it was real gold.

813
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,378
Gold doesn't tarnish, so it's okay.

814
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,298
Are you going to wear that dress?

815
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,676
Does it look weird? Should I change?

816
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,719
No, it's fine.

817
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,930
Where did you put it?

818
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,225
If I knew that, I'd have found it already.
Where could it be?

819
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,810
It's so strange.

820
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,522
Let me look. Sometimes other people
can find these things faster.

821
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,148
Did you look here?

822
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,693
I wore it over my hanbok
at your cousin's wedding.

823
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,737
So where is it?

824
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,364
Here?

825
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,366
I put it somewhere.

826
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,578
Mom.

827
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,123
Why didn't you use the cosmetics
that I sent you from the US?

828
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,584
I was keeping them for a special occasion.

829
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,627
I bought them ages ago!

830
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,754
It's not good to use them
past the expiration dates!

831
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,047
Put them back.

832
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,550
I don't have time
to argue with you right now.

833
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,677
I'm already late. I have to go now.

834
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,678
I'll be off then.

835
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,765
SERUM FOR BRIGHTER SKIN

836
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,397
Come on.

837
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,072
CONGRATULATIONS

838
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,825
Hey, you're here!

839
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,785
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

840
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,038
Come inside, girls.

841
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,165
-My goodness!
-Seung-hyo.

842
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,834
-Thanks for coming.
-It's amazing!

843
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,419
It's beautiful.

844
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,880
The building looks amazing.

845
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,298
Tell me about it.

846
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,050
It looks incredible.

847
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,426
Go on, get inside.

848
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,554
I can't believe that picky little kid
grew up to be such a successful man.

849
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,765
I'm proud of you.

850
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,683
I'm just the CEO for show.

851
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,477
This guy here is the real boss.

852
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,270
Hello, ma'am.

853
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,272
I knew you were back in Korea,
but I didn't get to meet you.

854
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,358
She's Seung-hyo's mother, not me.

855
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,901
I'm just her friend.

856
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,153
I'm Seo Hye-suk.

857
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:17,946
Nice to meet you.

858
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,116
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
My name is Yoon Myeong-u.

859
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,077
Looking at you now,

860
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,870
I can see where Seung-hyo

861
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,872
got all his good looks from.

862
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,123
-Really?
-Yes!

863
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,291
I hear that a lot.

864
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,877
Aunt Mi-suk, where's Seok-ryu?

865
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,212
-Well, she's…
-Hye-suk!

866
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,547
-Hye-suk.
-Yeong-hee.

867
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,882
-Hello.
-They're really here.

868
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,092
-What now?
-Good to see you.

869
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,426
-Hi!
-Hello.

870
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,594
This is my son.

871
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,054
-Say hello.
-Hello.

872
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,889
-My goodness.
-They're my friends.

873
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,059
-Thank you for coming.
-Do you remember me?

874
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,227
It's nice to meet you.

875
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,646
Hye-suk, Mi-suk, Jae-suk, and In-suk.

876
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,898
It's been a while since I've seen you all.

877
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,402
Yes, it's been a while
since the Hee and Suk Sisters met up.

878
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,653
What tacky names!

879
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,616
I don't know why we gave ourselves
those nicknames back then.

880
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,412
Thank you for coming, everyone.

881
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,123
Of course we'd come
to celebrate our friend's good news.

882
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,502
Don't you have some good news too, Mi-suk?

883
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,878
Isn't Seok-ryu getting married?

884
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,172
Well, the thing is…

885
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,842
Didn't you hear?
The engagement was called off.

886
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,430
My, my. It was called off?

887
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,014
I didn't know that.

888
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,850
Well,

889
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,810
I announced it in the reunion group chat

890
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,312
since some already sent wedding gifts,
but you must have missed it.

891
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,772
I'm sure they saw it.

892
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,152
Didn't you say the ceremony would be
in some fancy resort in Hawaii?

893
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,028
What went wrong?

894
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,072
Nothing went wrong.

895
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,117
We're just being extra cautious
since marriage is such a big deal.

896
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,411
It would have been better
if you'd done that

897
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,913
before the engagement in the first place.

898
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,708
Stop being so old-fashioned.

899
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,170
It's not like she's marrying a king
in the Joseon dynasty or something.

900
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,963
The times have changed.

901
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,840
It's not a crime to change your mind.

902
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,634
Of course not.
It's better than getting married

903
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,052
and divorcing afterward.

904
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,137
-Right?
-Of course.

905
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,389
-It's better this way.
-Your mindsets

906
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,224
are even tackier than our nicknames.

907
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,767
I didn't mean it like that.

908
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,270
Let's not spoil the day
and talk about something else.

909
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,481
All right. I'll raise my glass to that.

910
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,648
It's good to see you guys.

911
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,066
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

912
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,451
I'm sorry. I should've been there.

913
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,245
It's okay. I know how busy you are.

914
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,789
All right. I have to go now.

915
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,834
Okay. Don't skip your meals.

916
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,007
FATHER

917
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,067
Mi-suk was trying so hard
to look like she was fine.

918
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,444
She's always been like that.

919
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,154
So snobby, even though she's got squat.

920
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,532
I feel sorry for her though.

921
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,742
She was just as smart as Hye-suk

922
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,536
but too poor to go to college.

923
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,706
And look, she's still playing
second fiddle to her.

924
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,793
Does she think her daughter's success
makes up for her own failure?

925
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,336
"Her daughter's success"?

926
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:23,173
It doesn't look so successful now
with the engagement breaking off.

927
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,258
You're right.

928
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:28,178
As they say, "like mother, like daughter."

929
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,304
Exactly.

930
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,196
I thought you weren't coming.

931
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,825
I decided to just stop by for a bit.

932
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,410
What's the difference?

933
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,247
Look at all these guests.
Good for you, I guess.

934
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,374
Thanks.

935
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,793
I'll just stay here.
Can you call my mom over?

936
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,878
You're still my guest.

937
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,839
You even got me a gift.

938
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,008
You brought it here?

939
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,134
I can't toss it, can I?

940
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,386
You're probably hungry, right?

941
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,305
It's okay.
I'll just say hi to my mom and go.

942
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,142
What's with you?

943
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,602
Something's wrong.

944
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,980
You keep glancing
as if you've done something wrong.

945
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,815
-No, I didn't.
-You're still doing it.

946
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,817
Is someone chasing you?

947
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,360
I said I'm fine.

948
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,445
Are you?

949
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,655
Then wait here.

950
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,699
I'll bring your mom and some food.

951
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,992
I'm really okay.

952
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,453
We used an expensive catering company,
so try some.

953
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,003
Seok-ryu.

954
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:43,962
Mom.

955
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,591
-What are you doing here?
-To give you this.

956
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,384
I found it after you left.

957
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,969
Why would you bring it all the way here?

958
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:54,097
I just thought you'd want this.

959
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,766
You'd look better with--

960
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,683
You should go now.

961
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,437
Choisseung was going to
bring me something, so--

962
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,438
Talk to him later!

963
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,148
What's wrong?

964
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,317
People will talk if they see you here.

965
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:07,653
Mom.

966
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,489
Are you ashamed of me?

967
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,617
Mi-suk.

968
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,786
Oh, it's Seok-ryu.

969
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,204
Hello, Seok-ryu.

970
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:21,166
They're about to head out,
so I was going to see them off.

971
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,709
I see.

972
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,211
Is this Seok-ryu?

973
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,587
-My, my.
-Hey.

974
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,422
You must be Mi-suk's daughter.

975
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,133
It's nice to meet you.

976
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,177
We're your mother's
high school classmates.

977
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,222
I'm glad we ran into you.
I wanted to introduce you to her anyway.

978
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,848
Say hello to my friends.

979
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,642
Hello, my name is Bae Seok-ryu.

980
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,769
-Hello.
-She's so pretty.

981
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,522
I told you she worked for Greip, didn't I?

982
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,941
But she recently quit.

983
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,068
But that's such a prestigious company.

984
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,778
Yes, she's unemployed now.

985
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,200
Just kidding, of course!

986
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,161
She's taking a break between jobs.

987
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,164
She got scouted by an even better company.

988
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,250
Really? What company?

989
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,544
I can't keep track of them all.

990
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,462
I'll tell you once it's decided.

991
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,880
Is she going back to the US?

992
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,133
Of course. That's her home.

993
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,262
I want to spend as much time with her
as I can while she's here

994
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,847
and make her lots of good food.

995
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,182
I feel so bad for how skinny she is.

996
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,601
-I know, right?
-Yes.

997
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,395
When she told them she was quitting,

998
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,189
they offered her more money
to make her stay.

999
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,275
But she chose to go
to a better place anyway.

1000
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,193
Good for her.

1001
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,718
You're very good at lying.

1002
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,012
Did you practice that in advance

1003
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,263
in case I disgraced you?

1004
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,973
I didn't lie.

1005
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,266
You'll go back to the US.

1006
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,810
-What?
-I'll buy you a ticket,

1007
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,646
so pack up
and go back to the US right now.

1008
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,149
You don't want me here, do you?

1009
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,943
You never wanted me to come back.

1010
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,445
That's why you got rid of my room.

1011
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,238
That's a different issue.

1012
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,365
Why are you whining
about your room like a child?

1013
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,409
This room tells me
everything I need to know.

1014
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,244
You didn't want me to come back at all!

1015
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,163
That's right! So pack your bags.

1016
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,748
-Mom!
-Aren't you going to?

1017
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,334
Then I'll do it for you. Where's your bag?

1018
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,295
What are you doing, Mom?

1019
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,797
-Let go.
-Don't do this.

1020
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,965
I'm not going!

1021
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,051
-You are.
-No, I'm not!

1022
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,303
-I said I'm not going!
-Let go!

1023
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,563
Are you out of your mind?

1024
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,982
You're darn right I am.

1025
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,277
You're the one
who drove me out of my mind.

1026
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,988
-What did I even do?
-Do you have to ask?

1027
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,700
I really don't know why you're acting
like I committed some big crime!

1028
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,618
Hey.

1029
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,956
How could you do this to me
after everything I did to raise you right?

1030
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,625
The way I saw it,

1031
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,044
no matter how pathetic my life was,

1032
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,589
I could bear anything
as long as you were doing well.

1033
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,801
So what if my life is like this?

1034
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,553
My daughter is living a great life.

1035
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,389
But how could you betray me like this?

1036
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,766
You stabbed me in the back!

1037
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,687
Is my breaking off the engagement
and quitting my job

1038
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,146
betraying you?

1039
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,316
Yes, that's right.
I don't even want to see your face.

1040
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,944
You're sleeping all day
and fooling around like an idiot.

1041
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,863
Doesn't it ever occur to you to wonder…

1042
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,532
how sleep-deprived I must've been?

1043
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,744
Or how little fun I must have had
all these years

1044
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,996
to fool around like that?

1045
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,248
Everyone has it hard. You're not special.

1046
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,916
Even if that's the case…

1047
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,503
can't you just be on my side?

1048
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,089
Mom!

1049
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,010
I came home because I was exhausted.

1050
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,307
You know how hard I've been working.

1051
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,892
So why can't you…

1052
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,186
just tell me I did a good job,

1053
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,855
and let me take a break?

1054
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:15,358
Of course I know
how hard you've been working.

1055
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,526
That's why I'm so mad!

1056
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,820
While other people paid to go to the US,

1057
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,280
you got a full scholarship

1058
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,240
and earned your living expenses yourself.

1059
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,368
But now you're letting
all that hard work go to waste.

1060
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,954
I can't just let that stand.

1061
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,664
You're my precious daughter.

1062
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,458
You're my pride and joy!

1063
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,542
Why do I…

1064
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,796
Why do I always have to be
your pride and joy?

1065
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,258
Can't I just be your daughter for once,

1066
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,886
no matter how
pathetic or flawed I might be?

1067
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,850
Why do I have to cover up for your life?

1068
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,646
Jeez.

1069
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,565
You look like a ghost in a horror movie.

1070
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,483
You scared me.

1071
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,904
How did you know I was here?

1072
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,281
You're too unimaginative
to go anywhere else.

1073
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,328
The playground got so much nicer.

1074
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,539
It might as well be Disneyland.

1075
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,002
What should I play with next?

1076
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,586
Hey, wanna ride the seesaw with me?

1077
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,963
No, but knock yourself out.

1078
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,673
I can't go on the seesaw by myself.

1079
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,299
What about the jungle gym?

1080
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,678
Oh, that's right.
You used to be scared of that.

1081
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,887
That's not true.

1082
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:08,888
You're still scared.

1083
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,348
-No, I'm not!
-You are.

1084
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,606
What's so scary about this?

1085
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,817
-Looking for me?
-You startled me.

1086
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,569
When did you climb up?

1087
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,031
Do you think I'm still the little kid
you used to know?

1088
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,284
No, you're a tall man now.

1089
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,995
You got so tall, old man.

1090
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,956
Of course. I'm 34 already.

1091
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,460
I guess we are.

1092
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,009
This jungle gym looked so big
when I was little.

1093
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,642
Remember what you always said
whenever you were at the top?

1094
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,104
You said you wanted to
eat the clouds like cotton candy

1095
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,607
and crunch on the stars
like they were candies.

1096
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,151
I remember.

1097
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,782
I thought I'd get tall enough
to touch the sky when I got older.

1098
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,161
But there's just no way.

1099
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,712
It's raining.

1100
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,228
You're such a nuisance.

1101
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,235
Did you only buy one umbrella?

1102
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:49,155
Yeah, I really hate buying umbrellas
at convenience stores.

1103
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,200
You just had to get a tiny one.
Let me get under it.

1104
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,660
Go away.

1105
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,453
Just put up with it.

1106
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,163
I told you we should get down!

1107
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,082
No way. I want to keep playing!

1108
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,219
-Hey.
-Why are you laughing by yourself?

1109
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,804
I thought of something funny.

1110
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,972
Do you remember

1111
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:18,393
when I left you up here all alone
and ran away

1112
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,186
when we were little?

1113
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,398
You stayed here all night crying

1114
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:27,026
until some juvenile delinquents
who came for a smoke helped you out.

1115
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,653
They were nice guys.

1116
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,821
"Nice guys"?

1117
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,242
They were a group of thugs!

1118
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,327
-No, they weren't.
-Come on.

1119
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,247
They were obviously thugs
out to have a smoke.

1120
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,498
Then do you also remember

1121
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,835
that there used to be
a merry-go-round right there?

1122
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,045
And one time…

1123
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,798
I hit my head against it

1124
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,343
and got a huge bump
that made me look like an alien.

1125
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,596
I couldn't even look…

1126
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,099
I couldn't look in the mirror for a while.

1127
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:02,187
The kids said that the merry-go-round
would turn into a time machine

1128
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,439
if you spun it hard enough.

1129
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,441
I really believed that, you know.

1130
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,234
That's why I…

1131
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,071
It's so funny I'm about to cry.

1132
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,244
Hey, it's still raining.

1133
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,581
Just pick one thing.

1134
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,665
What?

1135
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,336
Don't force yourself to laugh
if you feel like crying.

1136
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:20,950
What an idiot.

1137
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,163
What a complete idiot.

1138
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,673
Gross, you're getting snot
all over your sleeve.

1139
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,593
It's not snot, it's rainwater.

1140
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,845
The rain washed it all away.

1141
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:27,517
Your makeup also got washed away.
You look horrible.

1142
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,522
Who cares?
I don't have to look nice for you.

1143
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,738
You heard our fight, right?

1144
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,157
Your voice was too loud for me to miss it.

1145
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,534
You're so annoying.

1146
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,743
Just forget everything.

1147
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,495
Already forgotten.

1148
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,879
My mom hates me.

1149
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,509
You hate her too right now.

1150
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,220
Isn't it pathetic

1151
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,140
that I still hate my mom at my age?

1152
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,232
Did you know?

1153
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,027
Just like how the moon
is Earth's satellite,

1154
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,530
hate has its own satellites.

1155
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,326
Your high expectations, your faith,

1156
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,371
and your fondness for a certain person

1157
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,081
are all interconnected.

1158
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,085
But when any of those elements
leave orbit or retrograde,

1159
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,420
it can turn into hate.

1160
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,467
You can't hate someone
unless you love them.

1161
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,308
What is it?

1162
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,769
-Did you see that?
-See what?

1163
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,187
A shooting star.

1164
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,814
There was a shooting star just now!

1165
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,775
You were just seeing things.

1166
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,777
I know what I saw!

1167
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,071
Look! There was another one!

1168
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,698
-I saw it.
-Right?

1169
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,700
-That's so cool.
-Make a wish.

1170
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,495
That's so childish.

1171
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,473
What did you wish for?

1172
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,517
I wished that my company
wouldn't go under.

1173
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,645
I know you're just showing off.

1174
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,396
Why would your company go…

1175
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,526
Something happened, right?

1176
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,697
-I'm right, aren't I?
-You're so violent.

1177
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,909
It's just that

1178
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,204
I took a big risk…

1179
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,458
and I'm afraid I'll end up
falling on my face.

1180
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,670
We have no new clients,

1181
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,464
and we're not getting
the design fees either.

1182
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:04,924
Let's go.

1183
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,843
Right now? Where?

1184
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,888
Just tell me who owes you money.
I'll make them cough it up.

1185
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,057
How will you do that?

1186
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,308
I won't leave until they do.

1187
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,020
I should've gotten
a scary tattoo or something.

1188
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,482
I know. I should change
into animal-print clothes before we go.

1189
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,527
I'm sure my mom has some in her closet.

1190
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,404
You're really something else.

1191
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,030
So where should I go?

1192
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,574
Let's go to a food stall.

1193
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,117
Let's have some udon.

1194
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:32,952
Hey.

1195
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,329
Did you read my mind?

1196
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,748
How did you know

1197
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:41,043
that I wished for the nearby food stall
to still be open?

1198
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,004
Who wishes for something like that?

1199
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:44,338
I do.

1200
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,174
Let's go get your money
after we eat some udon.

1201
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,594
I guess I can't ever go under now.

1202
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,680
I'll have to push through everything
no matter what.

1203
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,181
Why's that?

1204
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:58,436
Because I don't ever want to see you
wearing leopard-print clothes.

1205
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,646
Are you worried
that I'd look too hot for you?

1206
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,858
You know what would happen
if you wore something like that?

1207
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,443
You'd get shot down and hunted.

1208
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,446
Do you want to die,
bite the dust, or perish?

1209
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:09,530
I'd rather eat udon.

1210
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:16,329
Seok-ryu.

1211
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,833
Where did she go so early?

1212
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:34,263
YOON MYEONG-U

1213
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,514
-Mr. Yoon.
-Yes?

1214
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,267
I talked to the client from Buryeong-dong,

1215
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,811
and he decided to
keep the windows facing east.

1216
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,064
Really? How did you convince him?

1217
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,232
I just told him
that having east-facing windows

1218
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,360
would bring in good fortune and money.

1219
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,861
What?

1220
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,280
Did that really work?

1221
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,365
Yes.

1222
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,369
But where's Seung-hyo?

1223
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,120
I miss him so much.

1224
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,331
I don't know.
He hasn't been in the whole day.

1225
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,708
Yes, you can put that here.

1226
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,835
YOON MYEONG-U

1227
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,549
You're home, Seok-ryu.

1228
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,052
Hurry up and get changed
so we can have dinner.

1229
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,303
I'm not hungry.

1230
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,274
Mom.

1231
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,611
Mom!

1232
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,412
Mom!

1233
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:41,872
Mom!

1234
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:45,001
Why don't you yell for your dad for once?

1235
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,293
Sure, Dad. Mom!

1236
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,129
What happened to my room?

1237
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,506
Pipe down already.

1238
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:51,924
Go and wash your hands.

1239
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,719
Your mom asked Seung-hyo to do that.

1240
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:02,727
What is it, Aunt Mi-suk?

1241
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,604
I have a commission for you, Seung-hyo.

1242
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,150
-Can you redecorate Seok-ryu's room?
-What?

1243
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:13,112
I can't have her sleep in the storage
like she's a piece of luggage.

1244
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,991
Whether it's for a few days
or a few months, she deserves a room.

1245
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,201
I approve wholeheartedly.

1246
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,259
The walls should be green

1247
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:38,304
but with some tree patterns like this.

1248
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,264
Do you have something similar?

1249
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,390
Of course.

1250
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,810
It's an old-fashioned design,

1251
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,063
but please keep to it
as closely as possible.

1252
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:51,108
I think we have what you need right here.

1253
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,193
Thanks.

1254
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,028
YOON MYEONG-U

1255
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,908
Where should we put this?

1256
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,577
Put it close to the wall, please.

1257
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,661
-Here?
-Yes.

1258
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:06,749
You should've told me
that you were going to redo my room.

1259
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,751
I was going to tell you in the morning,
but you weren't home.

1260
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,712
Where were you all day?

1261
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:12,838
Just here and there.

1262
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,091
She must have had some business.
Let's eat.

1263
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,134
Look at that.

1264
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:20,554
Here.

1265
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:26,811
Eat.

1266
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,064
-Honey.
-Thanks.

1267
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:31,565
Thank you for the food.

1268
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,068
Why did you make abalone rice?
Wasn't it expensive?

1269
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,319
Don't you worry.

1270
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:37,113
Nothing is too expensive for my daughter!

1271
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,030
Eat up.

1272
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,787
It's so good.

1273
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,080
It's unbelievably good!

1274
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,414
It is, right?

1275
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,666
Have some braised short ribs.

1276
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,379
-This is incredible.
-You like this too, don't you?

1277
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,214
-It's eggplant.
-Have some.

1278
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,049
-It's your favorite.
-I'll give you some more.

1279
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,926
Slow down before she chokes.

1280
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:00,845
Stop hitting me!

1281
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,472
What's with this unnaturally
happy family vibe?

1282
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,307
You're just in time. Wash your hands.

1283
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,185
I told you I'm on a diet, Mom.

1284
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,147
Shut up and eat.

1285
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:15,484
If you two fight again,
I'll kick you out immediately.

1286
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,194
-Sit.
-All right.

1287
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,237
-Sit.
-Okay.

1288
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,073
Here, try some of this too.

1289
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,742
Didn't you hear your mom
tell you to wash your hands?

1290
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,453
You should wash them in the bathroom.

1291
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,913
Give this to Seok-ryu.

1292
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,874
There you go. Eat up.

1293
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,126
It's really good.

1294
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,252
It really is.

1295
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,935
Hey, it's the middle of the night.

1296
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:15,562
What's with the stars on the ceiling?

1297
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:18,482
Shouldn't you be thanking me first?

1298
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:20,442
You're so meticulous.

1299
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:23,445
How did you even recreate
the stars on the ceiling?

1300
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,698
Just the stars?
What about everything else?

1301
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,449
Everything else too.

1302
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,910
Did you work some magic on my room?

1303
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,453
I turned back time.

1304
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,456
The desk where you wrote
a love letter to your senior.

1305
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,709
The bed you cried on
after he rejected you.

1306
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,335
The blanket you used to kick
in embarrassment.

1307
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,129
I recreated your embarrassing past.

1308
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,256
Damn it, I remember everything now.

1309
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:45,926
No, stop! Go back
to the realm of the subconscious!

1310
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:49,680
I need to stop remembering
all those embarrassing things!

1311
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,473
I have a favor to ask.

1312
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,684
Make sure your curtains
are drawn shut properly from now on.

1313
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:54,935
What?

1314
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,230
I'm all over the place. It's so hot.

1315
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:05,988
Wait, what?

1316
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,614
Why are you there?

1317
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:08,824
This is why.

1318
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:12,786
I don't want to see anything unpleasant
whenever I open the window.

1319
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,580
Your bed hair and your bare face,

1320
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,248
for example.

1321
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:21,045
I was actually feeling grateful
toward you for a second there.

1322
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,755
But forget it. I'm coming over.

1323
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,092
By the way,

1324
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,636
why are you worried
about your view anyway?

1325
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,221
You don't even live there.

1326
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:32,848
I moved back here.

1327
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:34,308
What?

1328
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,101
I live here now.

1329
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:31,949
HATE

1330
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:36,703
LOVE

1331
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,365
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1332
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:17,035
You know that people who have jobs
actually work during the day, right?

1333
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,871
What should we do now?

1334
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,998
Are you both leaving me here?

1335
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,499
I want to do this.

1336
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,585
You joined the design contest
to rebuild the gym

1337
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,503
and construct a new school building?

1338
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,505
What was your original dream?

1339
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,132
My dream?

1340
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:32,134
We're transferring an emergency patient.

1341
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:34,553
I think he's trying to clear the way.

1342
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:37,473
If you could swim again,

1343
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,099
would you still be an architect?

1344
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,894
What's the big deal
about that old time capsule?

1345
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,604
Aren't you curious to know what it says?

1346
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:44,813
I told you not to do it!

1347
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,900
Come and get it then.

1348
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:55,866
