1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,978
Wow, look at this.

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,773
Honey, did they install
a moving walkway in our neighborhood?

4
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,733
My legs are moving on their own.

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,069
You fool! Stand up straight.

6
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,403
-Straight!
-Goodness.

7
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,406
Why are you so heavy? Jeez.

8
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,117
Just how much tteokbokki did you eat?

9
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,786
I had some deep-fried food.

10
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,871
I have high cholesterol.

11
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,124
-But how could I pass up good food?
-It's plant-based.

12
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,251
Why on earth
did you have to go this way?

13
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,963
Excuse me.
Does all of Hyereung-dong belong to you?

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,591
I wish I could, but I can't afford it.

15
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,010
Jeez, it's always about money with you.

16
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,016
Aunt Hye-suk.

17
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,477
Mom…

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,525
Seung-hyo. Seok-ryu.

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,151
What are you two doing here?

20
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,363
What's going on here?

21
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,156
I was mistaken, right?

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,742
You two brats always fight!

23
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,703
Now, you're ramming your bodies
up against each other!

24
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,163
What's the meaning of this?

25
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,581
So what happened was…

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,209
-We're dating.
-What?

27
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,087
You're… dating.

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,172
Are you talking about some old 80s song?

29
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,423
Wait, hold on.

30
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,092
-We…
-What?

31
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,803
We're in a serious relationship.

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,640
Yes, we're sorry
we didn't tell you earlier.

33
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,393
We thought it over
for a while before doing this.

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,270
So we had to be careful.

35
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,939
We know you're very shocked.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,152
We know you'll be worried too. But…

37
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,407
Our feelings for each other
aren't shallow or superficial.

38
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,120
So you're telling me
they're not shaking hands right now?

39
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,205
My goodness.

40
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,915
Hey…

41
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,459
Let's go home.

42
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,880
Okay, Aunt Mi-suk. I'll go with you
and explain everything.

43
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,882
No, Seung-hyo. You go home.

44
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,552
-Seok-ryu, let's go.
-Just me?

45
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,387
No. You can't.

46
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,514
You can't take just her. I'll go too.

47
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,683
Don't you have something
you need to tell me?

48
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,519
Yes, but I'll go
to Seok-ryu's house first--

49
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,606
But I'd like to hear it now!

50
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,524
I'm sorry. But first…

51
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,860
Hey, you goddamn idiot!

52
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,279
You must think
very little of me, don't you?

53
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,199
Enough with the nonsense
and come here right now!

54
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,911
If you don't I'll kill you!

55
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,205
What did she say?

56
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,874
It's better if you didn't know.

57
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,044
It always sounds so beautiful
when you speak French.

58
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,003
Yeah, okay.

59
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,130
-She's being pretentious again.
-Wait.

60
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,967
Hey, it's better than pretending
to be a lifelong friend like you.

61
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,970
You wouldn't have had
any friends if I didn't do that.

62
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,390
You were so cold
people called you the Ice Princess.

63
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,434
That's a personal attack!

64
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,478
Mom, why are you
being like that to Aunt Hye-suk?

65
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,063
Did you two get into a fight?

66
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,898
They did. It was bad.

67
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,445
Seok-ryu, come with me.

68
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,239
Bye, Gyeong-jong.

69
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,157
-No, you can't.
-Seung-hyo!

70
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,159
What's wrong with you?

71
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,535
Hey!

72
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,957
Choisseung! There's a Spanish proverb.
"All sunshine makes a desert."

73
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,417
"Rain and wind make the land fertile."

74
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,254
We're going through this hardship
to become stronger.

75
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,214
-No, we can't!
-You understand, right?

76
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,591
I can't let you go by yourself.

77
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,886
-My goodness.
-We have to be together no matter what.

78
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,137
Don't worry.

79
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,390
-I'll never let you go now.
-No. All right.

80
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,516
-Don't worry.
-No.

81
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,644
-You deserve a beating.
-Choisseung! You trust me, right?

82
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,646
-Don't worry!
-Mom!

83
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,191
I think your mom is upset.
Let's go home for now. Okay?

84
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,150
Dad, wait.

85
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,070
No! Don't hit her, Aunt Mi-suk!

86
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,947
How could you hit her?

87
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,241
Shut your mouth!

88
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,870
UNDERSTANDING KINEMATICS

89
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,957
-Mom.
-Be quiet!

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,875
No, wait. Just listen…

91
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,631
Seok-ryu, what did you do this time?

92
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,259
Hey, getting in trouble is my specialty.

93
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,261
You keep stealing my shtick.

94
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,595
Just butt out.

95
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,556
-Explain yourself.
-Go ahead.

96
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,892
What's going on between you and Seung-hyo?

97
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,520
It's like we said earlier.

98
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,731
We're dating and it's serious.

99
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,444
Is that funny to you?

100
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,529
-You find that funny?
-Stop lying.

101
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,906
Did you drug him? Why would he date you?

102
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,325
I told you to butt out.

103
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,786
You two are dating. That's it?

104
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,788
He wanted to ask for permission first,

105
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,789
but I stopped him.

106
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,042
You and Aunt Hye-suk are friends.

107
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,336
And honestly, I wasn't confident then.

108
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,005
But I can tell you for certain now.

109
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,132
I really like Seung-hyo a lot.

110
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,885
What? You're serious?

111
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,804
It's not just a casual relationship.

112
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:52,769
Does that mean
you're considering marriage?

113
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,395
-No.
-What?

114
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,774
Whatever the case may be,
it can't be Seung-hyo.

115
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,025
Why not?

116
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,985
You like Seung-hyo.

117
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,488
In any case, you can't.
I'll never allow it.

118
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,656
-I've made myself clear.
-Mom.

119
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,574
Mom.

120
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,160
Your mom had a fight
with Aunt Hye-suk.

121
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:13,331
Honey, you should drink a lot of water.
You need it when you're angry.

122
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,291
It's gaslighting.

123
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,001
What?

124
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,295
I'm sure he was brainwashed by you.

125
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,172
If not, why on earth would he…

126
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,342
Come on.
You used to beat him up all the time.

127
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,803
And you dragged him around
like a rag doll.

128
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,554
I told you to butt out, didn't I?

129
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,932
-Didn't I?
-I'll butt out! I'm sorry!

130
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,143
Damn it, my hair!

131
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,564
-That damn temper of hers!
-What did you say?

132
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,277
For someone who told us
he wanted to share a meal with us,

133
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,822
I wondered where you went every night.

134
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,408
I guess you were busy dating.

135
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,827
We still have breakfast together.

136
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,913
Yes, I've been actively taking part.

137
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,794
When did you and Seok-ryu
start dating and how?

138
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,629
Who initiated it?

139
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,465
I'm sure Seok-ryu
said she liked you first.

140
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,677
You're perfect in every way,
and you're right beside her.

141
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,098
So how could she not develop
feelings for him? My word.

142
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,891
I liked her first.

143
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,895
-What?
-I've liked her since we were kids.

144
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,523
My feelings only grew after we met again.

145
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,985
Honestly, Seok-ryu told me no
and rejected me several times.

146
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,486
But I persisted.

147
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,823
Wait. Wait a second.

148
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,785
So she turned you down?

149
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,998
Well… At first, but now--

150
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,041
She is ridiculous!

151
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,420
Goodness, I really adored her,
but is she out of her mind?

152
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,589
Why? What's wrong with my son?

153
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,215
-I know!
-Why?

154
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,843
What is he, chopped liver?

155
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,511
-Why would she reject him?
-Hilarious.

156
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,890
I'm not saying this because you're my son,
but you don't deserve that treatment.

157
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,849
Exactly!

158
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,185
Well… What I meant was…

159
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,896
It was only like that at first,
but we're dating now.

160
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,482
She's even accepted my proposal.

161
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,150
You proposed to her too?

162
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,069
Did you make it a special event too?

163
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,864
-What?
-Look at him. He did.

164
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,908
He did do it!

165
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,328
Did you put flowers
in your car with balloons

166
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,455
and rent out an entire restaurant too?

167
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,917
Mom, did you stick
a listening device on me?

168
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,713
-For crying out loud.
-What is it?

169
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,423
Sit down.

170
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,341
Take a seat.

171
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,177
There's no point in raising a son.

172
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,554
No wonder why it's a saying.

173
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,474
Hey!

174
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,018
Remember this necklace
you got me for my birthday?

175
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,771
I already had the same one.

176
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,690
I didn't know. You should've told me then.

177
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,735
-How could I be so petty and tell you?
-You're doing it right now.

178
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,699
Want me to buy you a necklace?
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

179
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,369
Forget it! I don't need any of it!

180
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,918
Dad, I…

181
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,297
Don't even think of trying to convince me!

182
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,383
I'm on your mom's side!

183
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,678
-Dad, if you can talk to her…
-Hey.

184
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,305
My hands are already full.
Let's fight our own battles.

185
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,269
Honey, do you want a foot massage?

186
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,286
Honey, can I ask you something?

187
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,162
-No.
-Okay.

188
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,834
It's about Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo.

189
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,918
Why can't they date?

190
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,341
It's not anything personal
because of your fight with Hye-suk, right?

191
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,011
I said don't ask,
so why do you keep asking?

192
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:01,350
I know blood's thicker than water,

193
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,644
but who'd be a better son-in-law than him?

194
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,773
He's handsome, he has a great job,
and he has good character.

195
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,318
-We've known him since he was a kid.
-That's why they can't.

196
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,529
-We've known him for too long.
-What?

197
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,323
Hye-suk knows everything too.

198
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,867
Seok-ryu's canceled engagement
and illness. She knows it all.

199
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,455
I don't want that to become
a weakness for my child.

200
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,832
I don't want her to be
at a disadvantage, and above all…

201
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,793
and I don't want her to get hurt!

202
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,631
If they hurt Seok-ryu…

203
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,216
I don't care who it is.
I'll make them pay.

204
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,261
Friend or not.

205
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,702
What are you thinking about?

206
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,497
It's just…

207
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,207
In the past,

208
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,626
when we were busy…

209
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,463
I wonder about how Seung-hyo had felt.

210
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,882
Things like that.

211
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,011
We were terrible to him.

212
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,683
If I could turn back time,

213
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,769
I would go back to that day

214
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,146
when Seung-hyo was seven,

215
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,607
standing behind the door alone,

216
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,152
and I'd give him a hug.

217
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,614
Still, back then…

218
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,826
since Seok-ryu was by Seung-hyo's side,

219
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,662
we were so fortunate.

220
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,456
Honey.

221
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,002
What's the survival rate
for stomach cancer?

222
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,091
Never mind.

223
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,094
Pretend you didn't hear that.

224
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,887
Let's sleep.

225
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,729
CHOISSEUNG

226
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,449
The person you dialed is unavailable…

227
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,124
Hey!

228
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,587
-Hey…
-Jeez!

229
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,671
Help me.

230
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,465
-Come here.
-I almost died.

231
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,842
What are you doing?

232
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,472
Why did you climb through the window?
You could've been hurt!

233
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,681
But…

234
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,059
I missed you so much.
What else could I do?

235
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,312
So I did my best impression of you.

236
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,522
Your wrist isn't fully healed yet.

237
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,940
Let me see.

238
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,651
Doing this will make it better.

239
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,991
Your parents are really upset,
aren't they?

240
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,743
No.

241
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,245
They're just a bit flustered.

242
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,791
-What about your parents?
-What?

243
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,753
They're a little surprised.
They're just…

244
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,671
They're flustered too.

245
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,634
-Liar.
-You lied too, babe.

246
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,887
But it's funny when you think about it.

247
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,680
What did we do that was so bad?

248
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,349
Why do we have to be so scared?

249
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,852
What did you just say?

250
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,188
"Babe"?

251
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,315
Well, yeah.

252
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,401
What happened to the person
who wanted to keep things secret?

253
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,946
Well, we've already been caught.
I don't care!

254
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,449
So if my mom doesn't approve,
you're not going to see me, babe?

255
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,078
That would never happen.

256
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,955
Can't you tell from how I climbed up here?

257
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,166
My instinct to fight back is kicking in.

258
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,086
Should I wear a protest headband
saying, "Seung-hyo's mine"?

259
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,922
Not a headband.

260
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,882
Instead…

261
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,886
let's put this on you.

262
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,654
It's beautiful.

263
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,658
I know why people wear wedding rings now.

264
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,078
This gives me a strong sense of unity.

265
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,541
Do you like it?

266
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,418
Yeah, I love it.

267
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,422
But I'm curious. Why did you get
a bracelet instead of a ring?

268
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,758
Because…

269
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,137
Don't come to my workplace
and spread rumors about me.

270
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,347
I should sue you
for spreading false information.

271
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,850
What an ungrateful jerk.

272
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,477
You should repay me instead of suing me.

273
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,690
You even remembered what we said in jest?

274
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,609
It wasn't on purpose.

275
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,778
I guess my mind saved

276
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,117
everything you did
and every word you said.

277
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,579
And I'll continue to do so.

278
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,664
I'll listen closely

279
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,875
to the things you say.

280
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,253
And I won't waste

281
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,340
our time together.

282
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,427
I'll hold onto you

283
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,513
and everything you are.

284
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,268
I'll hold on tightly forever.

285
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,154
So Seok-ryu,

286
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,824
will you…

287
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,535
marry me?

288
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,044
I'd be a fool
to refuse a proposal like this.

289
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,750
CLOSING AFTER SEPTEMBER 13

290
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,809
This one.

291
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,106
Hey, my mom found out
Seung-hyo and I are dating.

292
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,109
Well, you did well to hide it
as long as you did.

293
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,321
My dad and Seung-hyo's parents
caught us too.

294
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:57,201
Taking your lumps all at once
isn't that bad of a thing.

295
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,456
Why aren't you surprised?

296
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,333
Because I got my mom's approval.

297
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,293
Really? How?

298
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,171
There's a method for everything.

299
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,756
So what is it? Tell me!

300
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,132
Well…

301
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,761
Share bowls of jajangmyeon
and jjamppong with everyone.

302
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,930
Get the japchae rice too.

303
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,223
What are you talking about?

304
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,475
Do it with sincerity.

305
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,852
That's the only answer.

306
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,355
Are you fanning the flames right now?

307
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,191
You don't work
for Korea Fire Service, do you?

308
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,819
I'm off duty today.

309
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,326
What are you doing?

310
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,792
This isn't like you at all.

311
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,793
Well…

312
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,463
I'm adding some oil to my hair.

313
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,507
Jeez, you're the worst.

314
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,467
Your friend is in shambles right now,

315
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,344
and you're here
sitting pretty by yourself?

316
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,640
I have a date today.

317
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,774
Hi, Dan-ho.

318
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,234
Hi, Mo-eum.

319
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,486
Did you wait a long time?

320
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,615
No, I was happy waiting for you too.

321
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,701
Don't be ridiculous. Come on.

322
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,244
-You look pretty today.
-What?

323
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,328
Hello. How are you?

324
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,539
Hi, I'm fine.

325
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,374
But don't mind me. I'll let you continue.

326
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,333
I'm going home.

327
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,711
Just a moment.

328
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,629
Hello, Mr. Choi.

329
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,385
-It's not Choi Seung-hyo, is it?
-It is.

330
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,596
Yes, go ahead.

331
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,015
-Is that Choisseung?
-Go.

332
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,601
I see.

333
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,394
Right now?

334
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,439
Yes, I can.

335
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,655
Right about now, I would be
on a Wolmido Island amusement ride

336
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,783
or having chicken and beer
by the Han River.

337
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,287
But why am I here?

338
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,874
You dreamed a lot
about going on dates, didn't you?

339
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,501
Hey, are you going to handle
your boyfriend right or what?

340
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,794
Sorry.

341
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,463
We can hear you, you know.

342
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,672
So what?

343
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,757
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,052
We're remodeling
an elderly lady's house next week.

345
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,012
-An elderly lady?
-Yes.

346
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,890
There's an elderly lady
in the neighborhood we know.

347
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,892
She lives alone.

348
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,395
Mr. Choi took time
out of his busy schedule to help.

349
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,231
That's such a good deed.

350
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,316
It's so good you can't complain.

351
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,403
It's more serious than I thought.

352
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,366
They're plywood walls, which are weak
for soundproofing or insulation.

353
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,534
Essential amenities are nonexistent.

354
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,705
They could've made a kitchen
or a bathroom in this leftover space.

355
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,666
If the owners had that kind of money,

356
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,793
they would've made more rooms like this.

357
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,671
More units mean
more rent they can collect.

358
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,881
Why would they go this far?

359
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,966
For money.

360
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,844
Recently, there have been rumors
of redevelopment.

361
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,890
My mom's been getting
a lot of calls about that at work.

362
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,351
But I like how Hyereung-dong is now.

363
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,603
-Me too.
-Me too.

364
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,523
Yes, me too.

365
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,776
By the way, why do you two
still speak formally with each other?

366
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,403
When are you going to speak casually?

367
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,362
-Sorry?
-What?

368
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,280
You're right.

369
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,490
We live in the same neighborhood.

370
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,994
We're friends of the same age.
You should drop formalities.

371
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,829
-It's fine.
-It's okay.

372
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,792
This is more comfortable for us.
Trust us.

373
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,961
An appropriate distance
is the key to friendship.

374
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,379
I see.

375
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,631
Right.

376
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,551
-What was that?
-They seem close.

377
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,136
And at times, they don't.

378
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,021
Hey! Why has it been so hard
to reach you these days?

379
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,732
Hye-suk didn't come by here, did she?

380
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,027
She's been out of touch too.

381
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,862
The group text has been so quiet.

382
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,242
Wait, did you make
a new group text without me?

383
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,163
I'm glad you said that.
If you know how, create a new group.

384
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,874
Leave Hye-suk out.
It'll be just you, me, and In-suk.

385
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,250
What?

386
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,463
-Did you two fight again?
-I've decided to never see her again.

387
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,882
Is it serious?

388
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,052
From now on,
Hye-suk doesn't exist in my life.

389
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,637
Still, you've been friends for 40 years.

390
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:32,142
You may have your differences,
but if you cut ties with her,

391
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,561
it would be sad to see
all those years become a waste.

392
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,607
Hey, I have a lot of years ahead of me.
I can make new friends.

393
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,402
Like shoes, old friends are always
more comfortable than new ones.

394
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,196
You have a long ways to go,

395
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,074
so don't hurt yourself with new shoes.

396
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,868
Were you always this good of a talker?

397
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,458
It's because I have
a lot on my mind these days.

398
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,337
I've almost attained nirvana
by letting everything go.

399
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,964
What? Is something going on with you too?

400
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,594
Mo-eum is dating Mr. Kang.

401
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,137
Mr. Kang?

402
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,264
Your next-door neighbor?

403
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,684
-Yeon-du's dad?
-Yeah.

404
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,937
So what did you do?

405
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,814
You didn't give them permission, did you?

406
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,691
They like each other,
so what can I do?

407
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,112
Break her legs
and keep her at home?

408
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,197
Shave her head
and send her to a temple?

409
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,160
Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo are dating too.

410
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,454
That's hot! I mean, it's cold!

411
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,705
What?

412
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,959
Hey, Hye-suk.

413
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,378
Sorry, Jae-suk. I'll come back later.

414
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,213
-I'm off, Jae-suk.
-I said I'm leaving!

415
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,048
Jae-suk, can you tell her I'm going

416
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,467
because it's time to go
and not because of her?

417
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,220
She must think
the world revolves around her.

418
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,849
-That little brat.
-Why are you two being so childish?

419
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,977
She's the one who always starts it.

420
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,979
Mi-suk! Goodness.

421
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,063
Where are you going?

422
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:05,402
Gosh! She's just leaving.
I had something to ask her though.

423
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,821
Hye-suk! It's been a while!

424
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,614
-How are you?
-Good.

425
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,991
What were you going to ask?

426
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,910
Well, on my way here,
I saw on the snack shop's door.

427
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,079
What was it?
It was a sign saying they're closing.

428
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,622
What?

429
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,416
-Really?
-Yeah.

430
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,879
What's going on?

431
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,314
Yeon-du.

432
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,152
There's actually something
I have to tell you today.

433
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,322
The thing is…

434
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,490
I'll do it.

435
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,493
I want to do it.

436
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,711
Yeon-du.

437
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,007
I need to ask
your permission for something.

438
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,426
What is it?

439
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,929
Can you give me…

440
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,933
the chance to become your mom?

441
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,190
I know I can't be your real mom,

442
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,651
but I can promise you a few things.

443
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:33,156
I won't force you
to eat spinach and carrots.

444
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,037
I promise to win the parents' relay race
at your kindergarten's sports day.

445
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,374
Also…

446
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,336
When you're sick,

447
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,421
and when things are hard,

448
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,758
I promise to be by your side.

449
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,019
But if…

450
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,314
by any chance, if you'd hate that--

451
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,691
I don't hate it.

452
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,112
I mean… to be honest, I would love it.

453
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,908
-Really?
-Yes.

454
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,703
I've been waiting for this day.

455
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,707
This is a secret,
but I've dreamt about it too.

456
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,256
Did you sleep well?
Any dreams about being an alien's friend?

457
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,841
No, I dreamt of something else.

458
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,175
What was it?

459
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,178
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

460
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,224
I went to the moon in my dream,

461
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,477
and you and Dad got married there.

462
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,357
We were wearing spacesuits
and floating around.

463
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,275
What?

464
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,527
Mo-eum,

465
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:58,116
you're my best friend in the whole world.

466
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,872
So please be

467
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,167
a good friend to my dad too.

468
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,091
Of course.

469
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,057
Dad, are you crying?

470
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,227
I'm not crying.

471
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,980
I didn't get much sleep last night.

472
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,860
-I was just yawning.
-What? I don't think so.

473
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,905
You're obviously crying
because you're touched.

474
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,865
We made your dad cry!

475
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,369
No, I wasn't crying.

476
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,414
-Are there any tissues?
-Tissues?

477
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,208
I wonder if they have any tissues.

478
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,021
I'm currently sick, and I saw your video
while searching for healthy food.

479
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,357
It looks so good.

480
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,360
But I don't have the energy to cook,
so I can't make it.

481
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,113
It'd be nice if I could try your food.

482
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,326
What are you thinking so hard about?

483
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,538
What? It's nothing.

484
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,331
Hey, you can't talk to me though.

485
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,750
We agreed to take an hour to work.

486
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,252
Don't talk to me.

487
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,963
Yeah, I'm working really hard too.

488
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:42,554
-I can't take this. I'll move a seat over.
-No!

489
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,765
Then, you'll want to move
two seats over and get even closer.

490
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,809
Then, you'll want to sit beside me
and hold hands.

491
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,728
No, you can't.

492
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,939
We're an ideal couple that can manage
successful careers and love.

493
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,734
What do I do?

494
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,153
I'm already done with work.

495
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,030
It's time for something else now.

496
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,907
No, not yet!

497
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,367
I still have a lot to do!

498
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,703
I'm not finished yet!

499
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,371
I'm still not done!

500
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,004
I came to work on a Saturday night
to pursue wealth and honor.

501
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,089
And I end up seeing something like that.

502
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,767
SHANTY TOWN
BEFORE AND AFTER

503
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,116
-What's this?
-A gift.

504
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,075
Open it.

505
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,662
Honey, am I dreaming right now?

506
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,581
Did I fall asleep with my eyes open?

507
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,000
You damn punk, did you mess up again?

508
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,002
What is it this time? What did you do?

509
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,087
-You little punk, you're dead!
-What?

510
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,590
What is it? Did you make another mess?

511
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,008
No, I didn't.

512
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,302
I got my paycheck,
so I bought this for Mom and Dad.

513
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,429
That makes no sense, you punk!

514
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,265
The last thing I ever got from you

515
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,601
was a colored paper flower
you made in school!

516
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,228
Wait, hold on.

517
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,563
I must've been a scumbag.

518
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,732
Take a look. It's a health supplement.

519
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,067
You're right.

520
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,193
I know what this is.

521
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,153
You and Dad are older now.

522
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,072
I got something nice
to help your blood sugar.

523
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,283
Since it's opened now,
each of you take one.

524
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,786
Here's yours, Dad.

525
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,622
Is this really that good?

526
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,208
Yeah. This is for you, Mom.

527
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,669
This is too precious to drink.

528
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,337
Hey.

529
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,798
What does that make me
if you say that? I drank all…

530
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,592
Yeah, Mom. That's like a chronic disease.

531
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,469
Be happy when your kids
give you something.

532
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,887
-Yeah.
-Okay?

533
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,265
And use those beauty products I got you.

534
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,808
All right, I'll drink it.

535
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,394
I need to be healthy
so I don't trouble you.

536
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,564
I thought this punk
was trying to sell this to us.

537
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,191
Dong-jin, you've finally grown up.

538
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:01,943
You don't get any.

539
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,444
You still have a ways to go.

540
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,697
There you go being rude to me again.

541
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,532
Seok-ryu, Dong-jin.

542
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,075
Mom, we weren't fighting.

543
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,619
Our conversation
just got intense for a second.

544
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,954
It's not that.

545
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,333
-I have something to tell you two.
-Can I have two at once?

546
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,293
-Honey?
-Yeah?

547
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,129
I see.

548
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,386
Well…

549
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,432
I've decided to close the shop.

550
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,100
-What?
-Why?

551
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,978
Why do you think?
I'm at the age for retirement now.

552
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,022
The FIRE movement. Don't you know?

553
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,315
-What's that?
-You don't?

554
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,441
What is that?

555
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,916
Dad.

556
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,544
If you're here to get permission
to see Seung-hyo,

557
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,464
I have no power.
Talk it out with your mom.

558
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,051
Honestly, it's about that too,

559
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,679
but let's put him aside for now
and talk about you first.

560
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,181
What? What about me?

561
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,766
I'm worried about you.

562
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,727
Are you really okay
with closing the shop?

563
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,103
Of course, I'm okay.

564
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,023
You know I had a hard time.

565
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,069
I almost got scammed by those jerks too.

566
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,822
Gosh, the thought of being liberated
makes me so relieved.

567
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,992
It's like putting
a bunch of ice in your mouth

568
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,411
and crunching it on a hot day.

569
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,871
Then, that's a relief.

570
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:44,504
Still, if you become uneasy
or troubled by any chance,

571
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,339
you have to let me know.

572
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,758
What's our family's new motto?

573
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,886
"No more keeping troubles to yourself."

574
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,388
Yeah, that's it.

575
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,682
Good job, Dad.

576
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,436
Then, in that case,

577
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,232
are you going to hang out
with me more when I don't have work?

578
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,776
I am a little busy.

579
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,777
What?

580
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,072
So you're going to put me aside
and only hang out with Seung-hyo?

581
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,532
You little…

582
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,242
Don't even think of getting my approval.

583
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,910
Okay, I've persuaded you.

584
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,036
What?

585
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,913
What do I do about Mom?

586
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,624
Hey, I'm going to be
against it until the end.

587
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,712
Gosh, no way!
You're too precious to give up.

588
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,922
Honestly, it's true.
I have pretty eyes.

589
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,507
Jeez… I agree.

590
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,092
What was that?

591
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,137
You have pretty eyes,
but your nose is even prettier.

592
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,346
-Really?
-Let me see.

593
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,558
Look at that bridge.
It's as high as Mount Everest.

594
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,269
Come on. That's an exaggeration.

595
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,688
-It's unique. My nose takes after yours.
-Yeah.

596
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,606
-That's right.
-I have Mom's eyes.

597
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,108
Eyes? What are you talking about?

598
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,361
If I grow my hair out,
I'd look exactly like you.

599
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,118
Hi, Mr. Choi.

600
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,953
Hello.

601
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,371
-Am I late?
-Of course not.

602
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,458
We're here too. Hi!

603
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,793
What? Why are you two on-scene so early?

604
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,337
I'm more of an expert
on being on-scene than you.

605
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,548
I'll be responsible for your safety today.

606
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:14,427
In that case, I can write articles
and add wallpaper.

607
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,514
And I don't mean desktop wallpaper.
I mean actual wallpaper.

608
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,641
I'm in charge of the food.

609
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,643
You can't work on an empty stomach.

610
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,271
-Wow.
-Don't you need more skilled personnel?

611
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,522
-Hello.
-Hello.

612
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,232
-Hello.
-Myeong-u.

613
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,984
I mean, your intentions are good,

614
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,029
but as it stands, Seung-hyo will do
all the work by himself.

615
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,074
So you're here to help me?

616
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,077
Did you forget? I introduced you
to this volunteer group.

617
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,913
Okay, let's go! We must be quick
if we want to finish before sunset!

618
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,289
-Yes, sir.
-I'll sit in the back.

619
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,835
-I'll sit in the middle.
-Wow.

620
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,462
Okay.

621
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,799
Goodness.

622
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,516
Goodness, the walls are covered in mold.

623
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,975
We'll have to rip them out.

624
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,146
Goodness gracious.

625
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,858
There's no kitchen.

626
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,445
Does she cook with this portable stove?

627
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,533
The area out front is too dangerous.
The stairs are cracked too.

628
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,828
There's not enough space.

629
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,454
Will this be possible?

630
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,498
We'll have to try.

631
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,938
-It won't withstand it. It's too old.
-Really?

632
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,439
It'll be better if we put it here.

633
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,732
-Here?
-Yeah.

634
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,722
Wow.

635
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,224
Great job.

636
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,693
Dan-ho…

637
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,279
Keep holding that.

638
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,663
-Just a bit. Good, right?
-Yes.

639
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,498
-We can move over a bit more.
-Okay.

640
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,334
Hold on.

641
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,436
Who wants to put up wallpaper with me?

642
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,813
No one?

643
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,106
Me!

644
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,901
Fill the gaps. Yeah.

645
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,611
-Great job.
-Let's do our best.

646
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,987
Good, right?

647
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,998
There.

648
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,257
Goodness.

649
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,218
Is this really my house?

650
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,511
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,851
Mr. Choi renovated your home.

652
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,274
I thought you'd need it
in your daily life.

653
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,484
We made you a mini kitchen.

654
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,319
You'll be able to cook here now.

655
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,531
There's a window here.

656
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,745
It was the first thing I thought
when I saw this house.

657
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,539
I wanted to give you a window.

658
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,834
Now, when you come home after work,

659
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,585
open the window first.

660
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,505
You can look at the sky
and take a deep breath.

661
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,550
Whenever I'd come home
after collecting scrap paper all day,

662
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,177
it would feel so suffocating.

663
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,141
I couldn't enjoy life
and spent each day just waiting to die.

664
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,018
I felt so trapped.

665
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,354
But I can truly live life now.

666
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,525
Ma'am.

667
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,068
If you look out front,

668
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,738
we made your stairway safer
and installed handrails.

669
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,449
That was Mr. Yoon's idea.

670
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,369
Yes, well…

671
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,830
It seemed a bit dangerous,
so always be careful.

672
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,623
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

673
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,500
-Thank you so much.
-It's all right.

674
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,353
Hey, Jae-suk.

675
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,813
I called to see what you were up to.

676
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,816
What do you think?
I cleaned up after dinner.

677
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,905
If you're not doing anything,
want to come by the office?

678
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,406
-Right now?
-Yeah.

679
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,533
I got a bottle of wine as a gift today.

680
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,036
They said it's really nice.

681
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,287
Okay.

682
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,417
Since we're drinking expensive wine,
I put on a wine-colored lipstick…

683
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,508
-What are you doing here?
-Jae-suk called me here.

684
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,468
Did she call you too?

685
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,970
-What's going on?
-What?

686
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,013
What's going on?

687
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,975
What on earth? Was that the sound
of the door locking?

688
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,060
But we're still inside.

689
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,479
You brats! Listen up!

690
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,980
Jae-suk, what are you doing?

691
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,109
-We're the Suk Sisters…
-Hey! It's Lavender!

692
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,151
Right.

693
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,237
Lavender, formerly known as Suk Sisters.

694
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,990
The four of us met at 17,
and for 40 years,

695
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,160
we've been inseparable friends.

696
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,122
But you suddenly want to cut ties

697
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,832
and go your separate ways,

698
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,000
so how can we just sit back
and let that happen?

699
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,795
Yeah! That's not what friends do!

700
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,965
So we created an opportunity
for you to reconcile.

701
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,342
I didn't want you to get drunk and fight,

702
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,053
so I put grape juice
in the fridge instead of wine.

703
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,555
Hey, open the door. Open it now!

704
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,181
Hey, are you insane?

705
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,517
This is confinement, you know!

706
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,979
I'll open it in one hour,
so play nice until then.

707
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,481
Hey, wait! The bathroom!

708
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,858
What if we have to pee?

709
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,192
Hey, don't worry.

710
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,445
Look over there.

711
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,447
There's a chamber pot under the table.

712
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,159
My goodness, it really is there.
You crazy brat!

713
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,161
-Hey.
-Anyway, have a good time!

714
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,580
-Let's go!
-Open the door! Hey!

715
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,666
What do you take us for?
How can we pee in a chamber pot?

716
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,252
-Hey! Those little…
-Come on! Seriously…

717
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,179
I don't believe this.

718
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,513
I swear.

719
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,182
-Jeez.
-Come on!

720
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,155
I'm sorry about that day.

721
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,366
I think I spoke without thinking.

722
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,660
You probably said what you were thinking.

723
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,455
You didn't hold back anything at all.

724
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,416
Don't you see I'm apologizing first?

725
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,877
-Who asked you to?
-My heart did. What?

726
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,838
I mean…

727
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,133
We can't face Seung-hyo
and Seok-ryu like this.

728
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,595
We're being petty and immature.

729
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,805
I'm thirsty.

730
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,225
-Do you want some juice?
-No.

731
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,768
What if I need to pee?

732
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,977
You can use that.

733
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,830
Hey, can I have a sip too?

734
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,055
Have you ever thought about it?

735
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,224
About Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo

736
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,142
being together?

737
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,353
No, I never even imagined it.

738
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,982
I was so flustered.

739
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,821
What were you so flustered about?

740
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,739
It wasn't something expected.

741
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,866
So? What do you want to do?

742
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,326
What's there for us to do?

743
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,370
After hearing about it,

744
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,330
it seems they just started to date.

745
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,459
-Is that what Seung-hyo said?
-No.

746
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,921
It's not that.

747
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,051
What I mean is, let's wait
and respect what they choose to do.

748
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,137
Wait?

749
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,224
It sounds like you want them to break up.

750
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,061
So what I mean is

751
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,897
we shouldn't make
hasty judgments or decisions.

752
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,317
-Seok-ryu's been through a lot too.
-Like what?

753
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,944
Her canceled engagement? Or…

754
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,654
Her cancer?

755
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,573
Hey.

756
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,410
It seems you're trying
to find fault in Seok-ryu with that.

757
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,579
Forget it. I'm against it too.

758
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,666
I have no desire
to make him my son-in-law at all.

759
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,043
Hey, Mi-suk!

760
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,754
What on earth do you take me for?

761
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,964
Also, what's wrong with my son?

762
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,592
There's nothing wrong with him.
You're the problem!

763
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,885
You for a mother-in-law?

764
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,429
Wow, I'd be crazy to let
my daughter marry into that.

765
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,680
Hey! Are you done?

766
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,390
No, I have more to say!

767
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,143
If you can't fix that personality of yours
in this day and age,

768
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,731
Seung-hyo's going to be
on the fast track to die a bachelor.

769
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,232
Hey!

770
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,902
HYEREUNG REALTY

771
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,904
It should be over by now, right?

772
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,238
Let's open up and see.

773
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,681
Hey, I swear if I ever talk to you again,

774
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,683
I'll change my name.

775
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,559
Instead of Na Mi-suk, I'll be Ga Mi-suk.

776
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,187
Fine, change it. Go ahead.

777
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,982
Sure. Why don't you
go with Da Mi-suk then?

778
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,486
If I ever end up talking to you,

779
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:02,366
I'll bark. Woof, woof!

780
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,035
I'll become a dog.

781
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,871
Our plan failed.

782
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,998
Let's go.

783
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,168
Those darn brats.

784
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,462
Goodness!

785
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,392
STIR-FRIED TOMATO AND ACORN JELLY

786
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,103
She's gotten more views.

787
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,859
I'm currently sick, and I saw your video
while searching for healthy food.

788
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,486
It looks so good.

789
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,448
But I don't have the energy to cook,
so I can't make it.

790
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,825
It'd be nice if I could try your food.

791
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,745
Seung-hyo, come on out!

792
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,750
Professor Kim Chi-hun recommended us?

793
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,087
Yes, he said you were
the top architect these days

794
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,256
and praised you so much that I came here.

795
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,051
Coming from Gangnam,
the traffic was so bad.

796
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,097
Is there a reason why you built
your office outside of Seoul?

797
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,724
This is where I grew up.

798
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:13,020
A good location became available
while I was looking for a site.

799
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:14,897
Well…

800
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,442
There were rumors
of redevelopment in Hyereung-dong.

801
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,695
Do you know anything by any chance?

802
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:22,696
Sorry?

803
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,867
These days, finding trendy things
in run-down areas is all the rage.

804
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,786
I thought you may have heard
some premium information.

805
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,208
Well, we've heard about it too,
but it's just a rumor.

806
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,335
Nothing's really happening.

807
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,254
Yes, we didn't come here for that.

808
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,881
Then, that's disappointing.

809
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,008
I mean, I was hoping

810
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,594
you had a good feel for making money.

811
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:50,140
But it's surprising to hear you came here
simply because you liked the place.

812
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,353
I'm planning to put up a building.

813
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:58,774
I need someone who can deliver
as much value as I invest.

814
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:03,111
But if you're this out of touch
with reality, it'll be a problem.

815
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,573
On my way here,
the commercial area looked tiny.

816
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,825
And there was a shanty town off that way.

817
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,077
This area looked lousy.

818
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,749
I think it's best if you look
for a different architecture firm.

819
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,918
-Hey.
-Is that so?

820
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,045
You were right.

821
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:25,884
I don't think we're equipped
to meet what you're looking for.

822
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,472
It seems you're being like this
because I was a bit blunt.

823
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,807
Still,

824
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,726
you're going to refuse a referral?

825
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,603
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

826
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,105
Turning down a project

827
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,899
won't really impact
our livelihood that much.

828
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,859
-Right?
-What?

829
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,446
We aim to work with clients
who align with our goals

830
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,323
and avoid those who don't.

831
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,075
How was that?

832
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,458
-Myeong-u, is this really okay?
-About what?

833
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:03,839
I mean, it's a building after all.
Won't it be a shame to turn it down?

834
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,800
You're the one who said
you wouldn't do it first.

835
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,510
Well, I wouldn't say that.

836
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,388
Still, how could you end things like that?

837
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,057
I mean, I've always been like this,
but you…

838
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,559
What about me?

839
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,353
What, am I someone who has a knack
for finding ways to make money?

840
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:22,316
Am I some monster born from capitalism,
always crunching numbers on a calculator?

841
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,525
Yeah.

842
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,903
But you're a rational pragmatist.

843
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,658
But what am I going to do?

844
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,078
I mean, I'm becoming more and more
of a romantic these days.

845
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,913
What are you talking about?

846
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,540
After the retirement community project

847
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,084
and the renovated shanty town house,
I started to think a lot.

848
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,544
How can I put it?

849
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,255
Working on something flashy
and extravagant

850
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,591
didn't make my heart feel as full.

851
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,717
That's right.

852
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,010
-Me too.
-Yeah.

853
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,554
Sometimes, I think this is why
I went into architecture.

854
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,056
You little punk.

855
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,266
Is this why you wanted
to build our office here?

856
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,143
You wanted to slowly change me,
didn't you?

857
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,145
Let's say I was looking
at the big picture.

858
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,399
But I need to enroll the twins
to an English academy.

859
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,151
And I want to buy
an apartment in Gangnam.

860
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,029
-Seok-ryu can teach them English.
-Yeah?

861
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,864
-And I'll build you a house.
-What?

862
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,534
Really? Okay, you promised.
A verbal contract is still a contract.

863
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,036
Go and write it down.

864
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,163
-I'll sign it.
-Hey! You reminded me.

865
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,333
I went to the district office
to turn in some documents. Look.

866
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,584
They had this.

867
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,051
"Our Neighborhood's Architect."
What's this?

868
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,303
It's a program at the district office.

869
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,348
They provide free consultations
for residents.

870
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,809
They also improve living conditions
for neglected spaces.

871
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,769
Like how you renovated
the shanty town house?

872
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,562
Yeah.

873
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,941
A lot of shops are closing
and old alleys are being abandoned.

874
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,151
They preserve neighborhood culture too.

875
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,529
Wow.

876
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,323
You'll become the protector
of Hyereung-dong.

877
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,700
I have to be selected first.

878
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,828
Of course, they'll select you.
What do you mean?

879
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,789
I heard construction for the pool
and gym will start soon.

880
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,208
That's pretty cool, Choisseung.

881
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,586
You're like the architect
in charge of Hyereung-dong.

882
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,882
Everyone calls me an architect,

883
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,552
but I'm actually a licensed architect.

884
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,512
The difference between the two is--

885
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,639
I should work harder too.

886
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,724
What?

887
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,310
Seeing you venture out like this

888
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,479
makes me want to do the same.

889
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,276
All I can do is make videos right now,

890
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:34,156
but I want to actually serve people
my food one day.

891
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,285
I want to cook pots of happiness for them.

892
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:52,924
I had no idea sitting with you like this
would become so awkward.

893
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,262
Did you want to see me
about Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo?

894
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,140
It's about our wives.

895
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,434
Right.

896
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,145
It's a full-scale war they're having.

897
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,106
I wouldn't be surprised
if nuclear bombs started falling.

898
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:14,279
As the neutral party,
shouldn't we try to settle them down?

899
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,907
Yes, you're right.

900
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:18,950
Then…

901
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,497
Yes, in situations like this,

902
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,333
instead of being so serious and sober,

903
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:30,712
we need a slightly more relaxed,
peaceful atmosphere.

904
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,840
Regardless of the time or place,

905
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,385
we always need this
for these types of conversations.

906
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,306
They say the truth
comes out when you drink.

907
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,225
Exactly!

908
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,309
Click, clack!

909
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,897
I guess we're having soju
instead of kaoliang today.

910
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:53,068
We can't always drink the expensive stuff!
Come on! My shop's closing!

911
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,111
We're shutting down and you ask for…

912
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,782
Or bring in something nice
to drink too then.

913
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,162
-Hey, did you hear?
-What?

914
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,081
Root Diner is closing.

915
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,209
Business was never good there.
They rarely had customers.

916
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,210
I know.

917
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,712
Flies didn't even touch their food.

918
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,880
Good grief!

919
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,300
Not only is her daughter jobless
but her husband's shop closed too.

920
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,426
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

921
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,554
-I can't believe her luck.
-I know.

922
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,597
-Goodness.
-What's wrong with my luck?

923
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,058
M-Mi-suk!

924
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,978
I put kimchi in the ground the other day.

925
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,354
Today, I'll put you in the dirt!

926
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,231
You can bad-mouth me.

927
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,776
But my daughter and husband?

928
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,196
If you mess with my family, you'll pay!

929
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,073
-Goodness!
-Wait!

930
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:43,159
Hey, why aren't you budging? Darn it!

931
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,162
-What are you going to do about it?
-Goodness!

932
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,624
Hey!

933
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,214
What do you think you're doing? Well?

934
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,674
-Mi-suk, are you okay?
-Hey.

935
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,384
-Are you insane?
-Goodness.

936
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:03,889
-Hey!
-Jeez, why are you butting in?

937
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,432
-Hey!
-My goodness!

938
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,893
-You little… How dare you?
-Hey! I'm okay.

939
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,477
You're dead!

940
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,229
Let me go!

941
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,149
-What's with you?
-Jeez, stop it!

942
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,276
-What?
-You!

943
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,069
-Let go!
-Get out!

944
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,529
Are you insane?

945
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,489
Jeez, all she's good at is studying!

946
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,285
Now, this feels more like it!

947
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,245
-Hey!
-What on earth?

948
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,956
-Let go!
-Hey!

949
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,207
Hey!

950
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,908
HYEREUNG POLICE STATION

951
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,076
I mean, they're the ones…

952
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,535
-Hye-suk!
-Mi-suk!

953
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,162
Mi-suk, who did this?

954
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,665
-What's going on?
-Why did you two come together?

955
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,874
They reek of alcohol.

956
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,626
Wait, were you two together again?

957
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,044
No, not at all.

958
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,505
-No way. Where were you?
-Mom!

959
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,131
-Aunt Hye-suk!
-Hey!

960
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:23,718
-Are you two okay?
-Jeez, they keep coming in pairs.

961
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,719
Were you together too?

962
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,055
-Were you?
-You two pairs should be embarrassed.

963
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,307
You two are in no position
to talk that way.

964
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,893
It's not them, is it?

965
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,687
Hello. What are you doing here?

966
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,356
-Wait…
-Is that blood?

967
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,984
Are you okay? My goodness.

968
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,237
Why did you settle?
They were in the wrong first.

969
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,656
Just think of it as paying
for their treatment.

970
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,575
They were clearly the ones
who got badly beaten up.

971
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,995
That's right.
It'll take them two weeks to recover.

972
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,206
Honey, find a lawyer.
We're going to sue them for slander.

973
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:56,459
Still, seeing some action
after all this time was so refreshing.

974
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,629
Hey, you remember?

975
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,717
When that bully was shaking me down
in that back alley?

976
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,135
-You came.
-Yeah!

977
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,012
-And you saved me.
-That's right!

978
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,389
I took my backpack and lunchbox

979
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,099
and ran in swinging them at her.

980
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,434
That's what I did today.

981
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,019
-Yeah, you copied me.
-I remembered.

982
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,521
You hit the scariest lady
with the green onion.

983
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,440
-Her eye got so swollen.
-So swollen!

984
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,151
-She said she'd kill us.
-Mom, Aunt Mi-suk.

985
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,320
Have you two made up now?

986
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,405
What?

987
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,037
They have.

988
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,458
-Something's on my face?
-Yeah.

989
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,667
What is that?

990
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,968
What's with that basket?

991
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,847
I've never seen you carry
anything like that around before.

992
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,478
I have a lot of time now.

993
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,647
I should try to cook more at home.

994
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,401
It looks like you'll be wasting
ingredients for no reason.

995
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,737
Then, teach me.

996
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,698
I bought some bracken,

997
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,659
but I don't know how to cook it.

998
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,370
There's a bunch of good cookbooks.
Why learn from me?

999
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,082
The food you make tastes the best.

1000
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,709
You can't teach the feel for cooking.

1001
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,965
I'll cook it tomorrow, so just take it.

1002
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,137
I swear…

1003
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,808
I didn't think I'd ever get
to eat it again after we fought.

1004
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,309
Goodness.

1005
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,561
That's such a relief.

1006
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,773
All you could think about
after we cut ties was bracken?

1007
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,692
Of course. That dish is important to me.

1008
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:49,114
You'd always make that dish first
for me whenever I came to Korea

1009
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,490
and every time I left for work.

1010
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,535
You'd always pack
a bunch of it in ice for me.

1011
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,954
Gosh, when did I ever do that?

1012
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,832
Whenever I opened a food container,

1013
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:03,128
it overflowed with your friendship.

1014
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,671
How could I ever forget that?

1015
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,177
Why do you…

1016
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,097
keep making me feel so small?

1017
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:20,395
Fine, I'll be honest. I felt inferior.

1018
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,441
You can speak English and French.

1019
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,194
You communicated with locals
and earned a living abroad.

1020
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,322
But I got paid to look after Seung-hyo.

1021
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,494
It would've been nice to have looked after
your son without taking money.

1022
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,704
Are you insane?

1023
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,623
Why would you not take pay
for such priceless work?

1024
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,962
Seung-hyo grew up well all thanks to you.

1025
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,256
Raising a human being

1026
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,967
is an incredible feat.

1027
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,594
Not anyone can do it.

1028
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,223
You did the same for me.

1029
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,770
When I was eating lunch alone
after starting school,

1030
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,314
you came over to me and said,

1031
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,608
"I heard your name's Seo Hye-suk."

1032
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,236
"We're short a Suk Sister member.
Want to join?"

1033
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,660
That's why I'm not going to
be formal when we're in-laws.

1034
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,792
-Hye-suk.
-Yeah, just call me by my name.

1035
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,879
I'm going to call you by your name too.

1036
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,088
That's what I'll do.

1037
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,345
Even if our kids get married,
our friendship comes first.

1038
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,225
Are you giving them your blessing?

1039
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,309
Jeez.

1040
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,938
I was never against them
in the first place.

1041
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,982
Yeah, right! You looked so displeased.

1042
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,612
Be honest.
It bothers you that Seok-ryu was sick.

1043
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,739
Of course, it does!

1044
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,909
Seok-ryu was sick,
so how could I not be worried?

1045
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,953
She's your precious child.

1046
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,746
The apple of your eye.

1047
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,748
She's the daughter of my best friend.

1048
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,631
You know how much I adore her.

1049
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,802
How could I not care about her?

1050
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,935
Goodness.

1051
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,690
I didn't know you felt that way.

1052
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,402
I was afraid
she'd be devastated if you said no.

1053
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,991
After she was sick and alone
in a foreign land, I had to protect her.

1054
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,541
Mi-suk.

1055
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,754
I'll protect her with you.

1056
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,134
Just like how you raised Seung-hyo,

1057
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,636
I'll love and take care of Seok-ryu too.

1058
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,226
Thanks.

1059
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,062
I'm so grateful.

1060
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,897
I'm more grateful.

1061
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,276
-No, I am.
-You brat.

1062
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,904
I'm so sorry I hit you back then.

1063
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,072
It hurt.

1064
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,783
You silly brat.

1065
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,036
-Goodness.
-What are they doing?

1066
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,079
Hey, we know you're there.

1067
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,331
Come on out.

1068
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,457
Seriously.

1069
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:32,295
-How long have you been back there?
-Goodness, Seok-ryu.

1070
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:38,009
You've always been so smart
and dependable since you were young.

1071
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,011
Maybe we were meant to be.

1072
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,015
Take care of Seung-hyo for me.

1073
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,184
Okay, I will.

1074
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,437
-Seung-hyo.
-Goodness.

1075
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,028
You know you're half my son, right?

1076
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,988
Of course.

1077
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,658
If Seok-ryu hits and bothers you,

1078
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,117
you can tell me.

1079
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,620
-I'll punish her.
-You can tell on him too.

1080
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,955
-Okay.
-Got it? Tell me everything.

1081
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,209
They say as men age,
there's an increase in estrogen,

1082
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,586
and they cry more too.

1083
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,423
Is it true, Gyeong-jong?

1084
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,302
To be precise, testosterone decreases.

1085
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,931
The ratio of estrogen
increases relatively.

1086
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,724
I can't look at them.
Do you have any meds?

1087
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,644
I can't stand them!
What's wrong with those two?

1088
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,479
What happened?

1089
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:35,358
They're always hanging out
and drinking together these days.

1090
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,068
-Yeah, they're weird.
-Sit down.

1091
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,612
Honey, snap out of it. Stop crying.

1092
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,364
Poor Dad.

1093
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,453
Hey. Where are the kids?

1094
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,705
I think they're still sleeping.

1095
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,498
I see.

1096
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,792
-I'm off.
-Okay.

1097
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,337
How does it feel to go
to work for the last time?

1098
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,091
Well, it feels the same.

1099
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,802
Close up and come home early today.

1100
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,970
Let's have some soju.

1101
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,097
Okay.

1102
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,432
Bye.

1103
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,236
Great work.

1104
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,530
Ms. Jung,
the director's looking for you.

1105
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,948
-Me?
-Yes.

1106
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,499
Congratulations.

1107
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:15,958
For what?

1108
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,251
Goodness.

1109
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,421
How will you adapt in such a far-off place
if you're that clueless?

1110
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,215
-What?
-Ms. Jung.

1111
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:27,011
You've been selected as the safety officer
for the South Pole research station.

1112
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,514
-Wow!
-Wow!

1113
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,141
Me? Really?

1114
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,268
I just got the official letter.

1115
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,853
You're the first-ever woman selected.

1116
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,104
Wow.

1117
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,024
In two weeks,
on-site adaptation training will start.

1118
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,901
-Job training and orientation too.
-Yes, sir.

1119
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,570
After that, you'll leave
at the start of next month.

1120
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,240
What? That quickly?

1121
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,950
Yeah, get ready.

1122
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,619
Now, let's give her a round of applause.

1123
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:54,997
Thank you.

1124
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,469
Jeez, my last day's a bust too.

1125
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,596
Goodness!

1126
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,600
-Are you open?
-Of course.

1127
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,143
You can sit wherever you'd like.

1128
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,402
Okay, here you go.

1129
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,862
I didn't order the fish cakes.

1130
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:26,904
What?

1131
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,781
It's on the house.

1132
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,450
Enjoy.

1133
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,912
You gave me an extra fish cake
in the past too.

1134
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:35,913
What?

1135
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,541
I lived in this neighborhood
ten years ago.

1136
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,625
Is that so?

1137
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,128
I came to eat tteokbokki
after bombing my finals.

1138
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:46,340
You gave me fish cakes
and told me to cheer up.

1139
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:50,261
Really? I did that?

1140
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,597
I came to meet a friend and stopped by.

1141
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,057
You and the fish cakes haven't changed.

1142
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,104
-Have one more.
-No, that's okay.

1143
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,316
-Do you want some sundae?
-No, it's fine.

1144
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,860
I want to give you some.

1145
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,947
To be honest, today's my last day.

1146
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,575
CLOSING AFTER SEPTEMBER 13

1147
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:14,952
I see.

1148
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,955
I would've regretted it if I didn't come.

1149
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,459
Thank you for the food.

1150
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,080
-Honey.
-Dad, we're here.

1151
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,331
What brings you here?

1152
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:03,751
What do you think?
We're here to eat your tteokbokki.

1153
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,671
I don't think we're the only customers.

1154
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,257
What? You're all here?
We came for some deep-fried food.

1155
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,968
Honey, what did you say was good?

1156
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,261
The deep-fried peppers.
You still have some left, right?

1157
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:18,474
Gosh, what on earth is going on? Goodness.

1158
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,435
-Hello!
-The shop's too small.

1159
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,354
-Where will you sit?
-We're here too!

1160
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,774
-Goodness.
-Sit down.

1161
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:34,407
Yeon-du, you haven't had
tteokbokki yet, right?

1162
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,324
That's right!

1163
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,618
Yeon-du, you're so lucky.

1164
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:41,998
The first tteokbokki you'll ever have
will be from Root Diner!

1165
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,752
If you put the tables together,
move them back when you leave.

1166
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,587
-All right, already!
-Fine!

1167
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,880
Stop it, Mom!

1168
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,133
I'll do it.
That's why I have these muscles.

1169
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,176
There we go!

1170
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,512
He takes after me.

1171
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:57,847
What's going on?

1172
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,265
Are we the last ones here?

1173
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,017
-We came right after work.
-Hello.

1174
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,436
And you are?

1175
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,314
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Kang Dan-ho from The Chungwoo Daily.

1176
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,483
What's a reporter doing here?

1177
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,193
Well…

1178
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:12,862
He's my boyfriend.

1179
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,113
-Gross.
-Goodness.

1180
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,949
Who knew she was such a cute fool?

1181
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,325
She's so adorable.

1182
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,037
-Thank you for coming.
-No, it's fine.

1183
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,331
I'm preparing a special article
on retirement.

1184
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,002
If it's okay with you,
could I interview you?

1185
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:28,961
Me?

1186
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,093
Goodness.

1187
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,223
This is my first time.

1188
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,266
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1189
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:43,350
First…

1190
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:47,688
You're about to retire,
so how does it feel?

1191
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,106
Well…

1192
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,568
I don't really know.

1193
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:56,530
I cut vegetables and make broth.

1194
01:07:56,614 --> 01:08:00,576
Then, I soak the rice cakes.
I did that every morning.

1195
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,412
Once I stop and become comfortable,

1196
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:07,083
maybe it'll start to sink in then.

1197
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,542
I'm sure it will.

1198
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:13,005
So now that you're about to retire,
what do you regret the most?

1199
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,300
Also, what are you looking forward
to the most?

1200
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,179
Regret?

1201
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,682
To be honest, what I regret is…

1202
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,902
I don't think I regret anything.

1203
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,326
Honestly… Goodness.

1204
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,955
So many things didn't go my way.

1205
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,041
But that's life, you know?

1206
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,544
Yeah.

1207
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,505
Rather,

1208
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:58,384
I have more happy memories of this place.

1209
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,510
Gosh.

1210
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,389
"It tastes good."

1211
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,810
I loved hearing that.

1212
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:15,985
Also, what I look forward to is…

1213
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:19,613
My family.

1214
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:26,036
I've been busy my whole life
and used that as an excuse.

1215
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,080
Finally,

1216
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:29,707
it feels like

1217
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:31,542
I can return

1218
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,128
to my family now.

1219
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:47,308
What would you like to tell yourself
after all the hard work you've done?

1220
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,809
Well…

1221
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:53,814
"Great job."

1222
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,609
"You worked hard,

1223
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:58,986
Bae Geun-sik."

1224
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,796
ROOT DINER

1225
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,386
My goodness!

1226
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:26,388
Hey.

1227
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:29,266
Why are you still here?

1228
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,101
Did you think we'd leave you?

1229
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,395
We said we'd clean up with you.

1230
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,065
I needed some time to myself.

1231
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,233
Yeah, Mom.

1232
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,652
Respect a man's need for solitude.

1233
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:44,031
Dad, did you say farewell
to your beloved shop?

1234
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:47,785
Yeah, it was a passionate goodbye.

1235
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:50,663
Great. Let's go home now.

1236
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:52,873
Let's go!

1237
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,625
And we're off!

1238
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,170
You're really unemployed now.

1239
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,588
-Yeah.
-What will you do tomorrow?

1240
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,132
Tomorrow?

1241
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,885
Hey, son. Let's go play billiards.

1242
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,554
I have to study for my exam tomorrow.

1243
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,140
You punk. One day won't decide
if you pass or fail.

1244
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:11,058
Hey!

1245
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:14,228
Seriously? He wants to study.
Don't interfere with that!

1246
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,063
Dong-jin hasn't studied in so long.

1247
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,607
Look at this.
Did you see your mom, Seok-ryu?

1248
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,943
She's already looking down on me
for being unemployed.

1249
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:24,738
Stop. Let them have each other.
Let's play badminton tomorrow.

1250
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,449
-Badminton? I don't want to play with you.
-Yeah, I get it.

1251
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,244
You're going to keep playing
until you win!

1252
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,371
-That's right!
-No, I don't.

1253
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:36,542
Dad, don't do it. I got stuck playing
board games with her for seven hours once.

1254
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,296
Hey, that was because
you kept buying the best spot!

1255
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,632
Gosh, I'm exhausted
from staying up this late.

1256
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,260
Hold on. Don't be rude
to your sister like that!

1257
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:47,928
-That's right, you punk!
-What did I do?

1258
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,555
-What?
-You punk!

1259
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,432
-What?
-You too!

1260
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,225
-Don't say that to your kid brother.
-Yeah.

1261
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,060
-Don't call him a punk.
-Yeah.

1262
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,146
-He's my child too.
-Yeah, but…

1263
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,857
Okay, fine. Hey, you wimp!

1264
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,803
Seok-ryu.

1265
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:31,430
Choisseung!

1266
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,641
Why are you here alone? It's dangerous.

1267
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,352
I was waiting for you.

1268
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,523
I thought being with family was
the right thing tonight, so I didn't call.

1269
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:45,944
How's your dad? Is he okay?

1270
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,365
He took some soju
to the rooftop with my mom.

1271
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,409
That's nice.

1272
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,121
Having someone
by your side on a day like this…

1273
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,794
I have something for you.

1274
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,713
What? What is it?

1275
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,388
It's sanjeok.

1276
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,515
I tried to give this to you before,
but I couldn't.

1277
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:17,267
I can't believe I didn't eat it back then.

1278
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,685
I ruined my own luck.

1279
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,563
-Can I try one?
-Yeah.

1280
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:35,869
Wow.

1281
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,622
It's so good.

1282
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:40,582
Of course.

1283
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:45,003
I prepared and cooked the tree onions,
bellflowers, carrots, and beef one by one.

1284
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,715
I put them on skewers
and covered them in egg wash.

1285
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,300
It was a lot of work.

1286
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,510
It looks like it.

1287
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,972
And it smelled like oil so much.

1288
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:58,475
I thought I had become
one with cooking oil.

1289
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,311
Gosh, you worked so hard.

1290
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,563
Yeah.

1291
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,857
But still,

1292
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,067
despite that,

1293
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,112
I'll always make it for you.

1294
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:14,992
Unless you tell me you're sick of them,

1295
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:18,036
I'll make sanjeok for you forever.

1296
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,833
I'm so lucky.

1297
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,336
This is my proposal.

1298
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:35,429
I mean, I thought
being proposed to twice was a bit much.

1299
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,683
So I wanted to balance it out.

1300
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:44,771
Does that mean

1301
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,275
I can eat rainbows forever?

1302
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,777
Yeah, all colors of the rainbow.

1303
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,655
Whatever color you want
and as much as you want.

1304
01:14:57,868 --> 01:15:00,078
That's the sweetest proposal in the world.

1305
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,874
So, is that a yes?

1306
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,504
Yes. Gladly.

1307
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,147
Thank you.

1308
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:29,733
For what?

1309
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,527
For everything.

1310
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:35,364
For back then and now.

1311
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:37,491
Everything.

1312
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:33,422
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1313
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:35,966
-My eyes!
-It's not weird stuff.

1314
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,636
We legitimately have official approval
from both families now.

1315
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,223
There's no time to waste if we want to
catch up on 30 years of romance.

1316
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,183
Let's go on a date. Don't worry.

1317
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,144
You'll be safe next to me.

1318
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,979
Why won't she be around?

1319
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:51,148
She was assigned to the South Pole.

1320
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:52,733
Seung-hyo.

1321
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,402
Help me out, Myeong-u.
I want to get married too.

1322
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:57,070
You two are becoming in-laws?

1323
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,905
Let's have the wedding next spring.

1324
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:02,576
Why? Strike while the iron's hot.
Just do it before the year's end.

1325
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,625
