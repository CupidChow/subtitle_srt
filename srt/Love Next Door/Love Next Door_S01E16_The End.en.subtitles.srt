1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,689
-All right, thank you for waiting.
-My goodness.

3
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,318
I made some doenjang stew with clams,

4
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,111
but I'm not sure how it'll taste.

5
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,948
-It looks so good.
-I feel bad we're always eating for free.

6
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,742
Let's grab a drink later.

7
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,202
Well, you're retired now,

8
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,370
so you should sleep in and relax at home.

9
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,874
From now on, he insists
on cooking at least one meal a day.

10
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,667
He's looking for a way to survive.

11
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,046
Can't you say things in a nicer way?

12
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,881
My wife's been through a lot,

13
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,091
so I should take good care of her now.

14
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,426
Goodness.

15
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,262
Why do men act like they come
to their senses when they get old?

16
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,473
He must be scared you'll leave him behind.

17
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,933
I'm terrified.

18
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,519
Aunt Mi-suk, I'll never do that.

19
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,437
I'm ready to prostrate myself right now.

20
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,689
Hey, that's something
you should do quietly.

21
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,484
You can't fawn like that
in the presence of your mom.

22
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,569
Gosh, forget it.

23
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,321
I'm immune to it now.

24
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,824
My goodness.

25
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,704
I'll peel perilla leaves for you forever.
No need for any debates.

26
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,667
Honey, I can't reach
the greens over there.

27
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,418
Which ones? The bean sprouts? Chamnamul?

28
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,503
-Bireum?
-Chamnamul.

29
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,420
-I see.
-Honey.

30
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,547
-I can't stand it.
-Honey?

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,715
-Yeah?
-I want some soy braised beef.

32
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,717
Go ahead. It's right near you.

33
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,262
You're closer than I am.
What are your hands for?

34
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,931
-Is this for me?
-I use them for this.

35
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,517
Do you have hooks for hands?
That hurts so much!

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,935
It's supposed to hurt.

37
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,812
You think it's supposed to tickle?

38
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,859
Why can't you use your chopsticks?

39
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,360
Jeez, all that fuss.

40
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,914
Why have you been so busy lately?
We haven't had a date in days.

41
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,917
I mean, I just have too much work.

42
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,424
Can you wait just one more week for me?

43
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,093
One week is too long.

44
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,847
One week's going to feel
like a thousand years for me.

45
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,434
Did you use my razor…

46
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,687
My eyes! Mom, Dad!
They're doing weird stuff in her room!

47
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,522
Hey, Dong-jin. It's not…

48
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,523
It's not weird stuff.

49
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,736
We legitimately have official approval
from both families now, so get lost.

50
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,070
I can't approve of this.

51
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,947
Seung-hyo,
it's not too late to rethink this.

52
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,158
Who are you to decide if we can or can't?

53
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,118
She's totally like Bigfoot.

54
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,620
She keeps stealing my razor.

55
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,746
Have you lost your mind?

56
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,663
I'll kill you!

57
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,123
I'm telling you for your own good.

58
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,041
It wasn't me.

59
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,084
The blades dull as if she has a beard!

60
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,878
-You better shut up.
-I don't care.

61
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,755
What?

62
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:38,843
I don't care if Seok-ryu
is Bigfoot or an alien.

63
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,803
Choisseung.

64
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,305
I've heard this line before.

65
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,476
That's right.
You must've really enjoyed Coffee Prince!

66
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,188
Seung-hyo, get a grip.
That's a TV show, and this is real life.

67
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,191
Dong-jin, you said your exam
is coming up soon, right?

68
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,946
-Grab something to drink while you study.
-What a waste.

69
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,908
Okay. I'll call you
my brother-in-law from now on.

70
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,952
Sure thing, my brother-in-law.

71
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,203
On second thought, this…

72
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,539
I mean, my sister
isn't that much of a mess.

73
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,085
Even if you put lipstick on a pig,
it doesn't look so bad, you know.

74
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,002
-Get out.
-My razor…

75
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,671
I told you I didn't use it!

76
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
But the hair…

77
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,382
I swear it wasn't me.

78
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,634
I swear I didn't use it!

79
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,511
Are you crazy? I said it wasn't me!

80
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,012
Hey, I didn't do it.

81
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,976
THE END

82
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,020
See you tomorrow.

83
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,730
What should we eat?

84
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,648
Mr. Kang.

85
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,733
What brings you here?

86
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,527
Hello, how have you been?

87
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,778
Not great.

88
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,571
You said you'd come back in the summer,

89
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,614
but you didn't show up.

90
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,699
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,409
I've been busy lately.

92
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,287
I'll reschedule for next month
and definitely come then.

93
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,955
Forget it. You don't have to.

94
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,374
Ms. Jung won't be around by then.

95
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,501
Why won't she be around?

96
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,461
She was assigned to the South Pole.

97
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,215
The research station's…
What was it? Safety officer?

98
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,592
She really wanted to go
and carved out time

99
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,928
to diligently prepare for it.

100
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,640
She achieved her dream in the end.

101
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,058
She's truly amazing.

102
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,223
Dan-ho!

103
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,394
You didn't tell me you were coming.

104
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,565
I wanted to give you a ride home
right when you got off work.

105
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,318
What? I'm so touched.

106
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,278
You must be really tired.

107
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,739
You should go home and get some sleep.

108
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,074
I don't want to.

109
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,992
I'll sleep in your car.

110
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,494
Let's go on a date.

111
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,914
We haven't had a proper date.

112
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,875
What would you like to do?

113
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,556
You weren't joking
about the Wolmido Island amusement rides.

114
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,226
Well, if you don't like this,
how about the pirate ship ride?

115
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,852
I'll stick with this one.

116
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,980
-Let's go.
-No, it's this way.

117
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,732
Okay, let's go.

118
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,942
-Wait.
-We have to line up.

119
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,151
Thank you.

120
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,071
But is this ride actually safe?

121
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,533
I'm worried about my hips,
shoulders, and knees…

122
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,326
Won't my glasses fly off?

123
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,163
Come to think of it,
I've never seen you without glasses.

124
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,124
I'm extremely nearsighted.

125
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,376
Even with glasses on,
my vision isn't good.

126
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,672
Then, you can't see me now?

127
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,883
I can see you, Mo-eum.

128
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,846
No matter how far away you are,
I'll be able to see you.

129
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,601
It's about to start soon.

130
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,103
Hold on tight to the bars.

131
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,271
And…

132
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,565
don't worry.

133
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,276
You'll be safe next to me.

134
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,055
Mo-eum!

135
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,599
Mo-eum!

136
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,316
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

137
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,568
This duck is mine.

138
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,111
-Are you tired?
-Nope.

139
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,988
My gosh!

140
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,952
What? Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo are together?

141
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,037
Yeah.

142
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,749
What? So you two are becoming in-laws?

143
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,544
Hey, why are you laughing so much?

144
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,964
I think rather than
Seung-hyo and Seok-ryu,

145
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,550
Mi-suk and Hye-suk
were destined to be together.

146
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,011
Gosh, if these two had never met,

147
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,971
their kids would've never gotten together.

148
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,184
Hey, maybe you two were married
to each other in your past lives.

149
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,561
Hey! Why would you say
such an awful thing?

150
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,396
I should be the one saying that.

151
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,732
While we're at it,
we don't need wedding gifts.

152
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,484
No designer bags, diamonds, or cash.

153
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,277
Not even a set of silverware.

154
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,780
As long as the kids are happy,
I don't need anything.

155
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,156
I wasn't going to.

156
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Giving away
my precious daughter is enough.

157
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,910
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,079
These days, sons are the ones given away.

159
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,205
That's just what they say.

160
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,582
In reality,
daughters-in-law have it worse.

161
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,626
I won't give her trouble, so don't worry.

162
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,753
I won't interfere in their affairs at all.

163
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,921
Same here.

164
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,006
Hey, let's have the wedding next spring.

165
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,926
Maybe mid-May
with nice weather and flowers?

166
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,346
Why? Strike while the iron's hot.
Just do it before the year's end.

167
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,139
That's not enough time to prepare.

168
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,101
It'll be quick with a wedding planner.
Let's hold it at a hotel.

169
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,185
Are you crazy?

170
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,729
Meals at hotels are expensive!

171
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,856
We can't afford that.

172
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,026
How about a small wedding then?

173
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
A cozy gathering with those close to us.

174
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,071
We can't do that!

175
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,365
We've given so much money.
We need to receive ours.

176
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,076
You don't want this or that!
What do you want me to do then?

177
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,869
-Let's talk about it!
-Come on!

178
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,330
What are you doing in front of Yeon-du?

179
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,665
-Jeez.
-Seriously.

180
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,960
Yeon-du, make sure
you get along with your friends.

181
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,795
Don't fight like these two, okay?

182
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,715
Okay.

183
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,592
At least there's a lesson in this.

184
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,176
We're actually very close.

185
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,553
We're just talking.

186
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,140
CERTIFIED PERSONAL TRAINER WRITTEN EXAM

187
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,690
Hello.

188
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,692
Hello.

189
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,652
Are you studying?

190
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,946
My exam is coming up soon.

191
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,782
I see.

192
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,369
Right. I'm thinking of signing up
for personal training sessions.

193
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,871
Who should I ask about that?

194
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,083
Mr. Go, our client wants
a consultation for personal training.

195
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,501
Hello, Na-yun.

196
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,711
-Come this way.
-Okay.

197
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,671
Have you received
personal training before?

198
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,215
Briefly in the past once.

199
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,888
Wait.

200
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,974
Has he always looked like that?

201
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,855
ROOT DINER

202
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,988
NOTICE
NOISE MAY OCCUR DUE TO CONSTRUCTION

203
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,365
WE ASK FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING

204
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,159
It looks like the next shop
is starting renovations.

205
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,812
Hey, Mo-eum.

206
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,439
I'm outside right now. Why?

207
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,024
What?

208
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,151
Really?

209
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,864
Congratulations, Mo-eum!

210
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,534
What's this?
Are you a peddler or something?

211
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,203
I'm here to celebrate.

212
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,996
You're leaving for the South Pole,

213
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,748
so how could I come empty-handed?

214
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,627
I prepared some things
with a bit of color.

215
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,677
Hey, when did you find out
you were going to the South Pole? Today?

216
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,554
No, last week.

217
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,640
What? Why are you only
telling me this today?

218
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,308
You weren't itching to tell us?

219
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,227
I would've hung a banner
in the street myself.

220
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,729
Look at this. Isn't it so cute?

221
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,856
Should I do that?

222
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,066
Then, Dan-ho would see it too.

223
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,363
I can't bring myself to tell him.

224
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,116
The words just won't come out!

225
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,249
Gosh.

226
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,918
I don't get it.
Even with all this sugar,

227
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,462
why isn't my brain working?

228
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:39,091
I don't know
where to even start or what to say.

229
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,760
I think I know.

230
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,678
Really?

231
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,055
Hey, can you tell me then?

232
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,809
"Do it with sincerity."

233
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,436
Is this your revenge?

234
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,729
That's what I told you.

235
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,647
Well, you were right.

236
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,359
For big things,
be honest and straightforward.

237
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,697
Tell him it's something
you really want to do,

238
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,115
so wait just one year.

239
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,746
Jeez.

240
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,918
I wonder how he'll feel
after hearing that.

241
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,006
Was this how Seung-hyo felt
when I went to study abroad?

242
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,887
CHOISSEUNG

243
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,555
Go.

244
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,599
What do you mean?
I'm sleeping over.

245
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,435
Jeez, just sleep at your own house.

246
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,229
Why are you sending me away?

247
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,648
I want to comfortably sleep alone
in my own bed.

248
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,734
It's more comfortable if I leave?

249
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,694
Seriously?

250
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,488
Yeah, seriously.

251
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,532
Okay, then.

252
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,117
I'll leave.

253
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,203
But this doesn't count.

254
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,038
To me, this isn't a farewell party.

255
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,916
We'll do this again.
I'll throw a huge feast for you.

256
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,209
-Okay.
-I mean it.

257
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,919
I'll make it more extravagant.

258
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,212
-Just you wait.
-Okay. Just go.

259
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,214
-Got it? This doesn't count.
-I got it.

260
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,174
I'm really going.

261
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,551
Bye.

262
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,598
I love you, Mo-eum.

263
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,016
Please, just go.

264
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,741
Choisseung!

265
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,205
Slow down. You're going to fall.

266
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,749
I wanted to see you a second sooner.

267
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,834
Me too.

268
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,628
Just so I could have more time to see you,

269
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,505
I worked like crazy today.

270
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,549
Hurry and praise me.

271
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:47,052
You worked so hard. You did great.

272
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,471
Let's go.

273
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,016
Did you have dinner?

274
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,434
No, not yet.

275
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,603
Want to grab some udon on the way home?

276
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,520
I'd love that.

277
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,939
I feel queasy after eating half a cake.

278
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,316
Cake? Why?

279
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,276
Mo-eum was picked for the South Pole.

280
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,320
-Really?
-Yeah.

281
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,156
Wow, Mo-eum really
follows through on what she says.

282
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,574
She's no joke.

283
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,534
As expected, she's so strong-willed.

284
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,709
Jeez, you suddenly told me to come over.

285
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,337
Was it to show off this bracken?

286
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,838
No.

287
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,798
You promised to teach me how to cook.

288
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,259
-You were serious?
-Of course.

289
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,346
Look. I got dressed
to be fully prepared for this.

290
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,764
Look. Do you see?

291
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,058
Well, I don't think this is a real apron.

292
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,602
Did you go
to the department store to buy this?

293
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,603
Yeah.

294
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,063
Come on. Teach me.

295
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,898
-Quickly.
-Wait. Hey.

296
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,815
What?

297
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,861
I will teach you how to cook.

298
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,946
Right.

299
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,282
So teach me something too.

300
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,784
Teach you what?

301
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,119
English.

302
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,706
English? Why all of a sudden?

303
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,127
Well, I don't know when it'll be,
but I want to travel abroad.

304
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,837
I want to try ordering food

305
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,632
and chat with locals in foreign countries.

306
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,801
Okay.

307
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,387
Then, let's be fair
and teach each other.

308
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,098
I'll save on academy fees.

309
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,599
Come here quick.

310
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,518
What should I do? Where do I start?

311
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,019
We need to soak this.

312
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,106
You have to soak
dried bracken a day in advance.

313
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,607
But if you don't have time,

314
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,735
you can boil it in the rice cooker.

315
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,028
I see.

316
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,740
What are you doing? Press the button.

317
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,159
Right. I'll do it. Okay.

318
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,245
Brown rice, nutritional porridge.

319
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,540
-White… Quick cook.
-What? What do I do?

320
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,624
What's happening?

321
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,084
Hey.

322
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,379
You've never used
this rice cooker before?

323
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,549
I just got it recently.
It's totally brand new.

324
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,890
-Hey.
-Hey, that's scary and dangerous!

325
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,142
You're taking forever.

326
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,271
You've had green onions before.
Cut it right down the middle.

327
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,564
Look at me.

328
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,567
I can chop it without looking
or even while looking at you.

329
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,624
Close the book.

330
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,169
We don't need any of this.

331
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,879
Then, how are we going to study?

332
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,255
Let's jump right into action.

333
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,757
Conversation is key in English.

334
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,551
Converse… What?

335
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,595
Conversation and speaking.

336
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,305
Conversation.

337
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,766
It's been so long
I've forgotten all the words.

338
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,934
You're right. I just need to communicate.

339
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,062
Then, what should we talk about first?

340
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,981
Okay. What are you
going to do in the afternoon?

341
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,983
I'm going to go to the supermarket.

342
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,033
Noon… Can you repeat the last part slowly?

343
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,415
No, it's not "the." It's "the."

344
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,000
With a few exceptions,

345
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,795
the definite article
is pronounced as "the" before vowels.

346
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,842
Right. I knew that.

347
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,594
It's been so long I've forgotten it all.

348
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,263
All right, then.
"I'm going to go to the supermarket."

349
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,935
That's easy.

350
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,562
I used to memorize
old comprehension books well.

351
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,442
No, not "super." It's '"super."

352
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,611
Don't twist your tongue like a pretzel.

353
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,905
Just keep it straightforward. "Super."

354
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,496
Super. You can't do it?

355
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,627
I don't want to go anymore.

356
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,505
Our wives are over at your house.

357
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,506
And we're here.

358
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,508
This grouping worked out pretty well.

359
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,010
Let's do this regularly.

360
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,347
I felt like I'd been leeching off of you,

361
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,516
so I brought something.

362
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,309
My goodness!

363
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,561
Wow! It's blinding!

364
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,521
It's brilliant! My gosh!

365
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,565
Wow, this is…

366
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,985
Gosh, the bottle itself looks so fancy.

367
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,237
It screams, "I'm expensive!"

368
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,073
But…

369
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,826
We only have soju and beer glasses here.

370
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,786
We can just use regular cups.

371
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,204
-Hold on.
-Like those ones.

372
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,915
Well, these are
the prettiest cups we have.

373
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,254
All right. And this too.

374
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,715
Isn't that a camera bag?

375
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,634
It's not new.
It's just something I've had.

376
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,469
But it should be easy to use.

377
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,975
Giving two things at once?
That's not fair.

378
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,435
And isn't the camera

379
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,395
way more expensive than this alcohol?

380
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,564
You said you wanted to learn photography.

381
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,357
You can't go into battle without a weapon.

382
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,902
Well, if you put it that way,
thank you very much.

383
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,779
Then, should we…

384
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,366
Wow, that's great!

385
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,871
You must've done this a lot before.

386
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,873
Okay. All right.

387
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,041
I think I'm done.

388
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,751
I think I have a knack for this.

389
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,377
Again!

390
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,504
You need to have it properly leveled.

391
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,884
Look. How about this?

392
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,345
The subject is tilted! Do it again!

393
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,014
Here.

394
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,601
-All set?
-You can't cut it off at the knees.

395
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,354
-What?
-The legs look short! Again!

396
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,232
Okay.

397
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,442
Look at this!

398
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,736
The proportions are all wrong!

399
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,073
Instead of centering it,
put it slightly off to the side.

400
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,242
To make them look tall and slender,

401
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,036
bend down and lower your point of view!

402
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,913
You take pictures like this?

403
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,706
Lower! Get down more!

404
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,418
Think of it like boot camp!
Didn't you serve in the military?

405
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,296
I did! I was a defense serviceman.

406
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,340
Stick to the floor!

407
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,342
Become one with the camera!

408
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,970
-Hey, this is…
-Stick to the floor!

409
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,639
-Please let me go!
-Stop whining!

410
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,640
One, two…

411
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,113
Hi, Mo-eum.

412
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,490
I stopped by before work.

413
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,492
This is a gift for you.

414
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,827
Come on in.

415
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,413
How did you know it was me?

416
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,624
You're the only one who visits us.

417
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,463
-It's a T-shirt.
-Yeah.

418
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,923
I told you I'd get you one.

419
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,761
Am I still not allowed
to wear the mudflat shirt?

420
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,305
Of course not!

421
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,557
You look the best when you wear that.

422
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,106
I don't look bad in other clothes either.

423
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,651
I can't help it.
Mudflat Man is my first love.

424
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,071
My first love was actually Spider-Man.

425
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:09,870
And then, there's Iron Man, Hulk,
Thor, and Captain whatever.

426
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,875
The competition is so tough,
it makes me lose my fighting spirit.

427
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,878
But my favorite is Mudflat Man.

428
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,421
Try it on and see if it fits.

429
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,505
Okay.

430
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,801
Couple T-shirts?

431
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,221
Well, you're half right.

432
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,599
Check underneath.

433
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,229
Ta-da! This one…

434
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,318
This is for Yeon-du.

435
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,696
And this is for my mom.

436
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,616
Matching group shirts.

437
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,368
No. They're matching family shirts.

438
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,794
I have something for you too.

439
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,920
What?

440
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,051
What? Why is there so much?

441
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,064
They say the temperature at the South Pole
drops to minus 25 degrees in the winter.

442
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,443
Put all of these on,

443
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,656
stay warm, and have a safe trip.

444
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,749
Dan-ho, how did you find out?

445
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,170
When I went to pick you up last time,

446
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,047
I heard it from your colleagues.

447
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,595
I…

448
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,977
I'm sorry for not telling you.

449
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,187
You should be, Mo-eum.

450
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,190
You thought of me as someone too selfish.

451
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,067
I'm…

452
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,529
I'm not some pathetic guy who holds back

453
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,072
his successful girlfriend.

454
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,283
No, it's not like that.

455
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,704
We just recently confirmed
our feelings for each other.

456
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,623
I was worried it would be too sudden.

457
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,837
I also don't know
how to break it to Yeon-du.

458
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,679
Mo-eum.

459
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,848
I heard everything.

460
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,808
Yeon-du.

461
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,857
Send me pictures of emperor penguins
when you go to the South Pole.

462
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,028
Emperor penguins?

463
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:52,157
Yes. While emperor penguin mothers
go off to find food,

464
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,951
the fathers keep
the eggs warm until they hatch.

465
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,997
Just like my dad.

466
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,835
We'll patiently wait for you.

467
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,385
Come here, Yeon-du.

468
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,305
All right.

469
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,808
I'll be sure

470
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,395
to come back in style
with plenty of snacks.

471
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,023
Bring back lots of snacks.

472
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,275
Got it.

473
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,989
What?

474
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,199
Thank you…

475
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,368
for coming into my life.

476
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,704
For coming into our lives.

477
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,791
I can't breathe, Mo-eum.

478
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,043
I can't breathe!

479
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,337
LENTIL VEGGIE SOUP FOR VEGANS

480
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,141
LOTUS LEAF WRAPPED RICE

481
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:06,022
I hadn't been feeling well lately
and was looking for healthy food.

482
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,692
-I'll give it a try.
-Thank you for watching.

483
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,444
I hope you enjoy
a healthy and delicious meal.

484
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,741
The instructions were made
so easy to follow.

485
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,785
The eggplant pizza was really good.

486
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,290
I'm glad you found it helpful.

487
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,919
You can try it with zucchini
or potatoes instead as well.

488
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,633
STIR-FRIED TOMATO AND ACORN JELLY

489
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,431
I'm currently sick, and I saw your video
while searching for healthy food.

490
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,182
It looks so good.

491
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,060
But I don't have the energy to cook,
so I can't make it.

492
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,062
It'd be nice if I could try your food.

493
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,612
Choisseung.

494
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,823
-Want to go out?
-Okay.

495
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,159
I'll get ready.

496
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,083
Choisseung!

497
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,590
Are you done with your work?
Can you be out during the day?

498
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,507
Yeah.

499
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,303
Should we take a walk
around the neighborhood like old times?

500
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,387
Sure.

501
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,840
Remember this spot?
It used to be a stationery store.

502
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,175
Of course.

503
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,969
There was a capsule toy
vending machine here.

504
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,847
And all the junk food
was laid out on the stand there.

505
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,726
Every time I got some money,
I'd spend it all here.

506
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,397
It was mostly from my piggy bank.

507
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,357
I was mostly like that.

508
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,025
Let's go, my baby!

509
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:16,903
My baby!

510
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,615
Call me that one more time,
and you're dead.

511
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:22,992
Hey, baby!

512
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,327
Let's go to sing karaoke!

513
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,496
Hey! I told you not to call me that.

514
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,165
Come on, let's go!

515
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,251
I'll let you sing the entire bonus time.

516
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,335
Forget it.

517
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,921
You always pick duet songs anyway.

518
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,006
I'm for real this time.

519
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,341
I don't want to.

520
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,052
I'm scared someone might see us
go into a room together alone.

521
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,556
I can't let any more misunderstandings
ruin my life.

522
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,142
You little jerk.

523
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,394
You treat me like I'm contaminated.

524
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,896
-My goodness!
-Get back here.

525
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,690
-What's with you?
-Come here!

526
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,691
Stop right there.

527
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,818
-Hey!
-No!

528
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,570
Come on!

529
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,790
They must be finished with renovations.

530
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,709
I guess so.

531
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,046
I wonder what will come in.

532
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:18,923
Want to go inside?

533
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,217
What?

534
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,272
Hey, are we allowed
to just walk in like this?

535
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,746
I wanted to hate whatever came
in place of my dad's store.

536
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,540
But it turned out great.

537
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,755
I guess the new business
will be a restaurant too.

538
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,056
The kitchen looks so cozy and cute.

539
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,977
-Take a look inside.
-No way. It's someone else's kitchen.

540
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,104
Who cares? It's only a quick look.

541
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,565
-You think so?
-Yeah.

542
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,026
Excuse me.

543
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,580
It's your kitchen.

544
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,082
What?

545
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,503
This…

546
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,338
is your shop.

547
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,219
What?

548
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,391
Hello?

549
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,520
-Uncle Geun-sik!
-Hey, Seung-hyo.

550
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,897
You were busy.

551
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,440
Am I disturbing you?

552
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,733
Of course not.

553
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,860
Come in.

554
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,239
Wow, Seung-hyo! This is…

555
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,285
I don't think I've ever been here before.

556
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,203
Feel free to look around.

557
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,288
Okay.

558
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,791
Wow, this place is amazing.

559
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,628
Is there something you need though?

560
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,880
Well…

561
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,384
Seung-hyo.

562
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,055
I have a favor to ask of you.

563
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,354
You want to renovate Root Diner?

564
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,481
Yeah.

565
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:45,653
I want to open a restaurant
for Seok-ryu there.

566
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,908
Uncle Geun-sik…

567
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,912
I haven't been able to do
anything for Seok-ryu.

568
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:58,291
When I was younger,
I thought by the time I retired

569
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:02,211
I'd have a pile of money
to pass down to each of my kids.

570
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,173
But still…

571
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,260
I think I can at least
do this one thing for her.

572
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,973
Seok-ryu will be really happy about this.

573
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,391
You think so?

574
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:22,065
Well, we never had many customers,
and it was in a shabby location,

575
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,776
so I wonder if I'm doing the right thing.

576
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,070
She'll love it more than any other spot.

577
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:30,281
She gets to continue what you started
and begin something new.

578
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,407
Really?

579
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,536
So you'll take charge of it?

580
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,955
Of course.

581
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,459
I'll handle it in complete secrecy.

582
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,920
Okay.

583
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:47,108
So this is why you've been busy lately?
You were secretly preparing all of this?

584
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,234
Yeah.

585
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,279
I couldn't compromise on anything.

586
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:57,243
It's a collaboration between the two men
who love you the most.

587
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,331
Thank you.

588
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,048
Here, you can create dishes
that truly reflect who you are.

589
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,760
And provide comfort and healing to people.

590
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,221
Okay.

591
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,684
You're incredible, Seung-hyo.

592
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,855
You fixed my room,

593
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,191
my heart…

594
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,862
and now, the restaurant.

595
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,950
I haven't even started yet.

596
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,329
From now on, I'm going to create

597
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,456
every space you'll be in.

598
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,835
Wow.

599
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,171
I guess I'm the one who hit the jackpot.

600
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,843
I…

601
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,388
I love this space so much.

602
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,558
What a relief.

603
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,873
Dong-jin.

604
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,167
Your exam's tomorrow, right?

605
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,085
Yes.

606
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,670
Have you prepared well?

607
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,921
This is the first time

608
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,757
I've read this book from start to finish.

609
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,927
I feel so proud of myself.

610
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,637
You'll pass this time.

611
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,431
Here, take this.

612
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,894
What's this? You want me to shine this?

613
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,062
It's for you to keep.

614
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,940
It means

615
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,568
I officially recognize you
as my apprentice.

616
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,111
Shouldn't you ask me first?

617
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,363
Hang it up in your room with sincerity.

618
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,203
Where am I going to put
this smelly and ugly thing?

619
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,164
Just give me a raise instead.

620
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,042
Gosh, this is really heavy.

621
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,467
It looks good on you.

622
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,096
What are you talking about?

623
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,057
-Are you here for a session?
-No.

624
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,560
I decided not to sign up.

625
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,853
Why?

626
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,313
Did you not like something?

627
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,190
I decided to sign up later.

628
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,484
Good luck with your exam.

629
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,280
And after you get certified,
be my personal trainer.

630
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,364
What?

631
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,035
Last time during my run,
you seemed to be a good coach.

632
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,289
So I'll be your first client.

633
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,299
That one doesn't work.

634
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,884
Use the one on the left.

635
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,181
That one's broken.

636
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,395
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

637
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,481
All right.

638
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,651
I'm so upset.

639
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,238
I wanted to have a feast. A farewell party
at a convenience store's ridiculous.

640
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,032
Hey, I'm upset too.

641
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,743
You won't be back for a long time.

642
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,078
This is so underwhelming.

643
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,955
Gosh, it's fine.

644
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,748
Hey, if we prepared something big,

645
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,333
Seok-ryu would go…

646
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:39,173
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?

647
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,050
And she'd obviously cry her eyes out.

648
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,885
Bye, Mo-eum…

649
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,388
Stop! Will you look at her?

650
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,557
Hey, Dan-ho.

651
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,852
They had a lot of these today.
Why are you drinking that?

652
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,439
I wanted to recreate
exactly how it was back then.

653
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,733
It's like our beginnings.

654
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,777
I'm still amazed when I think about it.

655
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,113
We don't have anything in common.

656
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,990
How did we all end up as friends?

657
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,701
I think if our moms weren't friends,

658
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,786
we would've never been together.

659
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,330
I still liked our group.

660
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,794
It felt like I was flanked
by the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger.

661
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,129
Hey, what are you doing?

662
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,006
Then, what about me?

663
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,508
The Vermillion Bird? The Black Tortoise?

664
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,427
You are…

665
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,264
You're my love.

666
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,976
You're my love too.

667
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,520
I love you, Mo-eum.

668
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,688
Hey, let's leave.

669
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,566
I don't think I can sit here
any longer either.

670
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,069
I've watched you two act
like damn idiots for decades.

671
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:42,987
Sit back down.

672
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,157
Yeah, I think I should sit here
since my leg was hurting.

673
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,450
Just wait one year.

674
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,162
We'll get together like this again
and paint the town red.

675
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,663
Cheers!

676
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,123
-Cheers!
-Come back quick.

677
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,834
-Got it.
-Yeah, you better come back.

678
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,003
What do you mean?
My boyfriend will misunderstand.

679
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,547
I think that was a bit harsh.

680
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,799
Hey, why are you two ganging up on him?

681
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,135
-My goodness.
-We're not. It's just what he said was…

682
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,489
You'd always been unique
since you were a kid.

683
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,158
Now, you'll finally set foot
on the South Pole.

684
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,451
Thanks, Mom.

685
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,120
You never put limits on my dreams,

686
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,580
so I grew up well.

687
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,957
You should be getting married instead.

688
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,417
Why go to that cold place--

689
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,252
Again with the marriage talk!

690
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,296
Way to ruin the mood.

691
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,174
When you get there, send me some salt.

692
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,426
In-suk says
Antarctic sea salt is really good.

693
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,552
Seriously.

694
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,096
Yes, ma'am.

695
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,390
I'll give some
to all four Lavender members.

696
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,686
Mo-eum, take care.

697
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:03,025
Watch out so you don't get
laryngitis, tonsillitis, or pneumonia.

698
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,026
Okay.

699
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,030
Yeon-du, I'll video call you
as soon as I get there.

700
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,244
Call your mother too, you brat.

701
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,286
Of course!

702
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,914
As if I'd forget you, Mom?

703
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,750
I'm not sure if I've said this before,

704
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,835
but come here.

705
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,211
What's gotten into you?

706
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,466
I'm proud of you.

707
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,387
Of course.

708
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,223
I'm your daughter.

709
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,272
Dan-ho.

710
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,273
Yes.

711
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,233
Hurry and take her. She'll be late.

712
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,319
Yes, ma'am.
I'll take her safely to the airport.

713
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,656
Have a good trip.

714
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,701
Yeon-du, let's head inside and eat.

715
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,037
Mo-eum.

716
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,583
Bye.

717
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,251
How can I leave her like this?

718
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,128
-Yeon-du, let's go together.
-Hey.

719
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,588
Go on in.

720
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,922
Hurry and take her away.

721
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,597
Should we go now?

722
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,809
Okay!

723
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,942
-Thank you.
-Please get in.

724
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,625
Have I ever told you
how much I like you, Dan-ho?

725
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,542
What?

726
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,795
I love you as much
as all the glaciers in Antarctica.

727
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,924
But the glaciers are melting
because of global warming.

728
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,135
That's why I'm going
to the South Pole! So I can stop it!

729
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,721
I love you as much as all the snowflakes

730
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,724
that will fall at the South Pole
while you're there.

731
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,856
I'M CURRENTLY SICK
IT'D BE NICE IF I COULD TRY YOUR FOOD

732
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,447
I'm opening a restaurant soon.

733
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,282
The name of the place is…

734
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,285
Rainbow Kitchen.

735
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,290
How do you feel?

736
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,085
Your place will open soon.

737
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,878
I can't sleep.

738
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,547
Did you know?

739
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,007
There are over 1,300 stars
on my room's ceiling.

740
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,051
Wow, you counted all of them?

741
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,346
That's insane. It's so you, Seok-ryu.

742
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,058
As the one who stuck each of them on,
you're not exactly ordinary either.

743
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:45,229
My neck got cramps a few times
while sticking those on.

744
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,690
I'm here!

745
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,650
I'm here too!

746
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,859
Hello.

747
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,444
-Hey!
-Wow!

748
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,530
Honestly, when I see this place,

749
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,740
it's like Seung-hyo read my mind

750
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,993
and made it exactly how I imagined it.

751
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,994
Dad.

752
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,080
Thank you. I'll really give it my all.

753
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,917
Seok-ryu.

754
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,460
Don't work too hard.

755
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,713
Just enjoy it as you go.

756
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,175
That would probably
be harder to do though.

757
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,012
Would you like some coffee?

758
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,681
It's okay. I already had a cup at home.

759
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,849
I'd like one.

760
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,310
Fill it with ice, so it's nice and cold.

761
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,477
Iced coffee, not hot.

762
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,854
So hot coffee?

763
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,772
Iced Americano!

764
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,024
Goodness.

765
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,191
It's beautiful.

766
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,112
Getting the ice ready.

767
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,667
Here is your coffee.

768
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,672
It's nice and refreshing.

769
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,344
Seok-ryu, are you sure
you'll be okay on your own?

770
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,845
You have to cook, serve,

771
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,221
take bills, clean…

772
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,473
There's so much to do.

773
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,099
I just have to give it a try.

774
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,018
If you need help,
just call your dad.

775
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,355
Dad, I need to ask you for a favor.

776
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,273
Dad.

777
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,776
Can you be my advisor for Rainbow Kitchen?

778
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,820
You're not going to torture me
with work, are you?

779
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,614
I just need to give advice, right?

780
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,991
Yeah. You have more experience than I do.

781
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,870
I want your know-how on developing
the menu, running a business,

782
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,413
and dealing with risks.

783
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,791
Give me your guidance and support, okay?

784
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,461
Yeah, instead of bugging me while I cook,

785
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,754
get paid to nag her.

786
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,923
Come on, I just retired not too long ago,

787
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,883
and you want to put me to work again?

788
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,427
Don't be like that. Help Seok-ryu out,

789
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,470
Mr. Advisor.

790
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,055
-Mr. Advisor!
-Mr. Advisor!

791
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,392
All right, then.
Because it's not a full-time job.

792
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,310
-He loves it.
-He really does!

793
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,478
Gosh, I'm suddenly thirsty.

794
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,854
Seung-hyo, give me some coffee.

795
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,147
Would you like instant coffee?

796
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,733
What? You think I'd only drink
the instant stuff?

797
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,443
I like Iced Americanos too!

798
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,529
-Iced Americano is the best.
-Okay.

799
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,708
For a moment,
you resembled Steve Jobs… No.

800
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,168
Mark Zuckerberg.

801
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,504
This is who I really was.

802
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,214
I love seeing this other side of you.

803
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,799
I love it, but…

804
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,261
This isn't a date.
This is burning the midnight oil.

805
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:27,266
I have no choice. I need to get
everything ready before the opening.

806
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,644
So this is an app for Rainbow Kitchen?

807
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,312
Yeah, isn't it cool?

808
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,731
Later on, I can take reservations

809
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,150
and custom requests with this.

810
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,569
According to customers' tastes,
preferences,

811
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,071
and most importantly, health conditions,

812
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,615
they'll be able to make
requests or changes to dishes.

813
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,033
My goodness.

814
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,203
A chef who can write code?
I bet no one would see that coming.

815
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,789
I feel pretty proud.

816
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,335
It feels like the life I lived
in the past wasn't in vain.

817
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:59,256
Of course. Every experience you had
on the path you traveled piled up

818
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,883
and made who you are today.

819
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,719
I've lived a pretty good life.

820
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,472
I'm proud of you, Seok-ryu.

821
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,061
By the way, you remember
what we're doing tomorrow, right?

822
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,565
Yeah.

823
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,251
Does it look bad?

824
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,255
Why aren't you saying anything?

825
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,091
I was trying to think of…

826
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,387
the right word to describe it,

827
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,391
but nothing came to mind.

828
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,643
You're just

829
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,602
so beautiful.

830
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,397
I better look good! It's so uncomfortable.

831
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,943
It's tight around my waist,
and it's squeezing my chest.

832
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,861
I can't breathe either.
It's so uncomfortable.

833
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:07,157
Well, with that dress on,
I bet you can't put me in a headlock.

834
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,160
I'll buy you this dress.
Wear it every day.

835
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,537
It'll be expensive.

836
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,413
We'll get our money's worth.

837
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,165
You can wear it at the grocery store

838
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,458
or to the bathhouse…

839
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,544
Choisseung, come here for a second.

840
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,170
Is something wrong?

841
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,881
-What is it?
-It's pinching me here. It's bothering me.

842
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,341
-Let's see.
-Over here.

843
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,720
Hey! You thought I couldn't do it
in a dress, didn't you?

844
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,722
I told you not to put your guard down.

845
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:34,017
You really want to do this
while buying a wedding dress?

846
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,230
So why did you doubt me?

847
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,691
It doesn't matter what I wear!

848
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,710
Mom, are you ready?

849
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,045
Honey, they're ready outside…

850
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,631
How do I look?

851
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,009
A wedding dress at my age?
Isn't it a bit foolish?

852
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,051
You're beautiful.

853
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,096
You're radiant.
I can't look directly at you.

854
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,390
Stop saying nonsense
in front of our child.

855
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,602
Mom, I'm 34 now.

856
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,312
You'll forever be a child to me.

857
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,524
Aunt Hye-suk.

858
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,485
-Hey, Seok-ryu!
-You're so pretty!

859
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,487
Thank you so much.

860
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,489
I get to wear a dress thanks to you.

861
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,533
-It's nothing.
-Thank you.

862
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,369
-I'm so embarrassed.
-You're so pretty!

863
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,996
Right?

864
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,166
Okay! I'll stop!

865
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,251
I'll stop!

866
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,337
Jeez.

867
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,255
I didn't do it that hard.

868
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,966
So is this going to be my life soon

869
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,052
where I'm threatened
like this every day?

870
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,388
Maybe not soon…

871
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,061
Can we…

872
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,480
postpone our wedding by just a year?

873
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,815
What?

874
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,984
I still have so much to do.

875
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,404
I need to build up the restaurant,

876
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:13,283
and it's ridiculous if Mo-eum
can't come to our wedding.

877
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,368
Also…

878
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,036
most importantly,

879
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,249
I want to catch up on the 30 years
of romance we've missed out on.

880
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,710
Please?

881
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,962
Are you upset?

882
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,047
Yes.

883
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,593
Why are your reasons so valid, right,

884
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,803
and highly reasonable?

885
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,889
It's impossible to say no to that.

886
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,974
So you'll wait for me?

887
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,728
But you look so beautiful in that dress!

888
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,066
You're telling me I have to wait a year
to see this again? You're so mean.

889
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,237
There is someone else
who might look better in it than me.

890
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,494
Did you know?

891
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:01,498
I wanted to hold a bouquet
of lily of the valley at our wedding.

892
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,918
Yeah, but since we got married
in the winter, we couldn't find any.

893
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,044
That's right.

894
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,797
But now, I get to hold one
as we renew our vows.

895
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,926
Do you know what this flower symbolizes?

896
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,223
They say it symbolizes
a return to happiness.

897
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,978
We're ready now.
Okay. Look over here, please!

898
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,653
Give us a slight smile!

899
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,908
Seung-hyo!

900
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,161
Yeah, let's get one with our son.

901
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,830
Gosh, you look so nice.

902
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,416
Your son is very handsome.

903
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,711
Right? She has a good eye.

904
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,129
-One step this way, please.
-Okay.

905
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,757
Okay, that's great.

906
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,925
All right, smile!

907
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,221
Amazing.

908
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,558
We finally have a family photo now.

909
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,727
Not yet. Seok-ryu!

910
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,936
-Yes, Aunt Hye-suk?
-Hold on.

911
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,314
Do you need something?
Should I get your lipstick?

912
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,941
No, let's take a photo together.

913
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,359
-What?
-We're family now.

914
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,861
-You're right.
-Right, honey?

915
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,279
-Come over here.
-Stand here.

916
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,908
Gosh, what a beautiful family.

917
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,618
All right, here we go!

918
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,830
Great.

919
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,208
Hey, why is a family picture
taking so long?

920
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,584
-Goodness.
-Come here.

921
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,462
-Yeah, I'm about to pass out from waiting.
-Hey.

922
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,507
She said she hadn't eaten
for two days to take these photos.

923
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,259
This is my first time
wearing a dress at a wedding.

924
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,678
My wedding was
a traditional one at a hyanggyo.

925
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,763
Right, in hanbok.

926
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,474
Hello! I'm here to take your photos.

927
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,059
We should step aside now.

928
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,019
-Right.
-Over here, Lavender!

929
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,940
Honey, pose!

930
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,818
Thank you! We look so good!

931
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,238
-Throw your bouquet!
-Let's yell, "Lavender!"

932
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,656
-Okay.
-Good idea.

933
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,658
Now, look this way.

934
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,784
Ready, set, go!

935
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,995
-Lavender!
-Lavender!

936
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,508
My mom and her friends are so adorable.

937
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,677
They are.

938
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,053
They look so happy.

939
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,681
-You're right.
-They're not 57.

940
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,432
They're like 17-year-old girls.

941
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,433
I know, right?

942
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,356
Seok-ryu.

943
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,733
Thank you.

944
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,153
Without you,
I wouldn't have even thought of this.

945
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,156
Honestly, sons just don't get their moms.

946
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,659
Look at this.
Why did you follow me in here?

947
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,160
You should be by her side.

948
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,372
I've been her son this whole time.

949
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,499
Now, it's time…

950
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,960
to be your partner.

951
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,216
There's no time to waste if we want
to catch up on 30 years of romance.

952
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,303
Like what?

953
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,681
Something like this?

954
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,516
Yeah.

955
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:08,935
That's right.

956
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,437
I've…

957
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,231
thought of another dream.

958
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,819
Just like our parents,

959
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,822
I want to be with you
for as long as I can.

960
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,618
You only thought of that now?

961
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,412
I've felt that way for ages.

962
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,664
No, I probably felt that way
before you did.

963
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:35,962
I'd been ignoring
my feelings for far too long.

964
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,383
Looking back,

965
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,012
I think it was my very first dream.

966
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,061
I'll take good care of you.

967
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,501
Let's take

968
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,337
a picture like that in 30 years.

969
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,216
Yeah, I'd like that.

970
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,261
Affectionate, warm,

971
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,472
and full of love.

972
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,868
10 MONTHS LATER

973
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,593
Don't be ridiculous.
This is more impressive!

974
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,722
What are you talking about?
This was way harder to do.

975
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,349
Seung-hyo was appointed

976
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,811
as a public architect for Seoul
even with his busy schedule.

977
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,937
Jeez.

978
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,440
He said he's working
on an urban redevelopment project.

979
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,234
Even when clients line up
with bags of money,

980
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,361
gosh, he still puts public interest first!

981
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,321
Instead of removing the factory equipment,

982
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,073
it's best to leave them as is.

983
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,577
He said it was an architect's duty
to preserve history and culture.

984
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,746
Seung-hyo should be an elected official.

985
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,873
Hey, what about Seok-ryu?

986
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:38,209
She's already earned an Orange Ribbon
six months after opening.

987
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:42,088
And you all saw the article
about her restaurant

988
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,798
in The Chungwoo Daily.

989
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,343
They said it was a restaurant
that heals both body and soul

990
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,679
with not only delicious
but also healthy food.

991
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,390
She pulled off that difficult feat!

992
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,768
Hey, do you see this scarf?

993
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,812
Seung-hyo brought this back
from his overseas business trip.

994
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,107
It's from a famous luxury brand.

995
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,317
-Hey.
-Hey, what?

996
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,526
-This.
-What about it?

997
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,280
Seok-ryu said this shade suited me
and gave it as a gift.

998
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,492
She says I have a cool summer skin tone.

999
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,827
-Girls.
-I have a warm tone.

1000
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,330
Are you two bragging
about your in-laws now?

1001
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:18,333
You two sure find
creative ways to act like fools.

1002
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,626
Gosh.

1003
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:25,340
Hey, Yeon-du won an award
at her kindergarten coding competition!

1004
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,634
-Wow!
-She wants to work for NASA later.

1005
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,551
NASA?

1006
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,429
My goodness, that's so amazing.

1007
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,432
Right? We don't stand a chance
against bragging about granddaughters.

1008
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,850
Ki-hoon got a job!

1009
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,353
-Really?
-That's great news! What kind?

1010
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,021
He's a sales rep for a copier company.

1011
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,316
-It's been a week now.
-Why didn't you tell us sooner?

1012
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:46,694
At first, I wasn't sure if he made
the right choice. I had mixed feelings.

1013
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,655
But the other day, Ki-hoon told me

1014
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,992
it was always his dream to wear a tie
and take the subway to work.

1015
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,912
When I heard that, it really woke me up.

1016
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,165
Passing exams isn't the only path in life!

1017
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,752
Exactly, he's a people person.
I'm sure he'll do great.

1018
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,046
Of course, he will. That's great news.

1019
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,549
Our copy machine at the office
is on its last legs.

1020
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,175
I should give Ki-hoon a call.

1021
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,177
I'll buy him a tie!

1022
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,555
He got a job,
so his aunt should give him a gift.

1023
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,472
Okay.

1024
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,641
-Buy one for him right away.
-Of course.

1025
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,851
Get him an expensive one.

1026
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,103
Hey, I'm the only one
with just well wishes.

1027
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,771
Tell him I'm so happy for him.

1028
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,859
-What great news.
-Thank you!

1029
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,490
-Should I? A barbecue at my office?
-Do it!

1030
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,076
Fifteen.

1031
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:36,911
Great.

1032
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,621
Sixteen.

1033
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,001
Seventeen.

1034
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,711
BAE DONG-JIN
CERTIFIED PERSONAL TRAINER

1035
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,670
Breathe in.

1036
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,548
Eighteen.

1037
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,552
Nineteen.

1038
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,222
Okay, one last time.

1039
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,975
Push off both feet
and keep the barbell straight.

1040
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,643
Keep your eyes straight ahead.

1041
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,277
Na-yun, your hips keep going too far back.

1042
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,988
Engage your back muscles
to keep it straight.

1043
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:12,989
Let's do ten more.

1044
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,782
Hey, can we take a break?

1045
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,327
We can't. There's still a lot to do.

1046
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,121
Want to grab some chicken and beer after?

1047
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,626
Na-yun, after all this exercise,
you want to drink beer?

1048
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,794
Don't you feel bad for your body?

1049
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,797
-No, I meant…
-All right, grab the barbell again.

1050
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,843
Steady upper body, lower your shoulders,
and engage your lats!

1051
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:34,928
Okay, one!

1052
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:37,889
Two!

1053
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,350
Great. Three!

1054
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,895
Focus! Four!

1055
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,944
Seok-ryu wants to add vegan options.

1056
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,112
So I've been researching vegetables.

1057
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,781
What's good for preventing cancer?

1058
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:59,035
Glucosinolates have cancer-fighting
and antioxidant properties.

1059
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,121
I see. What kind of foods
have a lot of that?

1060
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:06,793
Vegetables like broccoli
and cabbage have a lot of them.

1061
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,588
But they're sensitive to heat,

1062
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,133
so it's better
to eat those raw than cooked.

1063
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,512
I see. Then, she should make a salad.

1064
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,305
That's the best way to do it.

1065
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,349
-No!
-Okay!

1066
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,270
Jeez.

1067
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,563
You're so cheap.

1068
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,565
It's just technique.

1069
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,775
Technique, my foot.

1070
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,490
Then, what should we…

1071
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,451
do tomorrow?

1072
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,288
I have to go to work.

1073
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,873
Come on. Just retire already, will you?

1074
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:50,128
How long are you planning
to work at that hospital for?

1075
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,675
Am I your only friend?

1076
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,139
Gosh.

1077
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,058
Tomorrow, collect samples for research,

1078
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,476
we'll conduct a marine survey.

1079
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,603
Ms. Jung?

1080
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,522
Yes, sir. There will be
a safety briefing beforehand,

1081
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,483
so I'd appreciate it if everyone
could arrive an hour early.

1082
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,651
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1083
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,529
And next week, we'll have fire drills.

1084
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,698
We'll be simulating
a fire outbreak at the base,

1085
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,410
including rescue operations,
first aid, and fire suppression.

1086
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,496
It's going to be super realistic,

1087
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,165
so be ready, everyone.

1088
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,207
-Okay.
-All right.

1089
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,417
-Okay.
-Is that the end?

1090
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,335
That's the end.

1091
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,253
Okay, then. Meeting adjourned.

1092
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,756
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1093
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,479
Dan-ho! Yeon-du!

1094
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,648
-Mo-eum!
-Mo-eum.

1095
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,276
Wait, isn't that my house?

1096
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,361
You're right.

1097
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,196
Where's Mom?

1098
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,947
She's at a Lavender gathering.

1099
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,284
Wow, people might think you live there.

1100
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,578
You're right. I do practically live here.

1101
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,289
I had a sleepover with Grandma last night.

1102
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,667
I see. Is that so?

1103
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,169
She said there was no point
in having separate houses.

1104
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,797
She wants to put ours
on the market right away.

1105
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,968
What? Are you all becoming
a real family while I'm gone?

1106
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,179
I guess so.

1107
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,139
Yeon-du.

1108
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,434
I miss you so much.

1109
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,811
Me too.

1110
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,816
So I'm going to send you a very big gift.

1111
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,943
A gift?

1112
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,695
Dad, hurry and tell her.

1113
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,452
That gift is me.

1114
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,788
I'll be visiting you next month.

1115
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,666
What are you talking about?

1116
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:55,503
I'm officially going to the South Pole
for a feature article about my experience.

1117
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,380
I got the approval.

1118
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,716
Then…

1119
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,427
We'll get to see each other soon?

1120
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,220
Yes.

1121
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:09,016
At the beautiful ends
of the Earth where you are.

1122
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,776
Was the food all right?

1123
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,862
Yes, it was so delicious.

1124
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,280
Thank you for the food.

1125
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,115
I should be thanking you.

1126
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:27,493
And here are the recipes
for the dishes you had today.

1127
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,955
Is it okay to just give
these out like this?

1128
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,957
Aren't these trade secrets?

1129
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,877
I posted them
on my vlogs anyway, so it's fine.

1130
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,796
As long as our customers enjoy good food

1131
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,882
and stay healthy, that's enough for me.

1132
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,551
I'll definitely try making it. Thank you.

1133
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:44,552
Have a nice day.

1134
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,220
-You too.
-Thank you.

1135
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,305
Please come again!

1136
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,264
I'll make it for you.

1137
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,599
-Really?
-Yeah.

1138
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,895
POMEGRANATE TREE

1139
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,490
Mr. Choi.

1140
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,451
You hear that Greip's flagship store
starts construction next week?

1141
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,620
Yeah, I'll keep following up on it.

1142
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:11,537
Don't worry.

1143
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,624
Jeez, you're not even looking at me.

1144
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,375
You're working on that again, aren't you?

1145
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,837
TERRACE, LIVING ROOM, STUDY
OUR HOME

1146
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,132
Hey, you swore
you'd build my house for me.

1147
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,134
But how can you build yours first?

1148
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,053
Seung-hyo.

1149
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,847
Help me out, Myeong-u.
I want to get married too.

1150
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,432
You're right. Welcome to Hell.

1151
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,519
-You mean heaven.
-Okay. I was joking.

1152
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,731
Gosh, look at the time.

1153
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,692
Man…

1154
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,070
HYEREUNG-DONG MUSIC CONCERT
BADMINTON TOURNAMENT

1155
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,239
When you suggested
opening up the first floor,

1156
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,157
I had no clue what you meant.

1157
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,327
I can't tell if this place
is an architectural firm,

1158
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,246
a daycare, or a senior center.

1159
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,914
What? I like it.

1160
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:59,043
We tore down the stereotype
that architectural firms are intimidating.

1161
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:01,712
I think I worked out too much…

1162
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,005
What? Mom!

1163
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,757
-So you were here.
-Aunt Mi-suk!

1164
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,385
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

1165
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,053
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello!

1166
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,181
Wow, you and Seung-hyo
still resemble each other so much.

1167
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,141
-Thank you, Mr. Yoon.
-You're welcome.

1168
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,685
Right.

1169
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,145
I have something for you.

1170
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,232
I heard from Seung-hyo
that you published a book.

1171
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,400
-I did.
-Yes.

1172
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:27,488
It's a memoir about my 30 years
as a diplomat.

1173
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,032
I have a book signing
at a bookstore next week.

1174
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,701
-Really? Can I come?
-Of course.

1175
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,287
-Yes, I'll be there!
-Hey, you should come too if you can.

1176
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,957
How about you treat us first
to celebrate your book coming out?

1177
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,125
To beef, not pork.

1178
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,626
Just sign the card receipt instead.

1179
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,545
-Jeez.
-Hey, Seung-hyo.

1180
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,255
Can I stick this up here?

1181
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,173
Of course. Here, I'll do it for you.

1182
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,091
Over here.

1183
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:50,761
NA MI-SUK'S FAIRY TALE CLASS

1184
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,096
"Fairy tale class"?

1185
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,391
Yeah. You know I'm good
at telling stories.

1186
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:58,227
I want to inspire the young sprouts
in Hyereung-dong.

1187
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,813
I liked it when you read
folk tales for us too.

1188
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,608
I'm still learning English from your mom.

1189
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:05,735
Next year,

1190
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,738
I'm going to hold
an English fairy tale class here too.

1191
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,407
Go ahead.
Chase your dreams, Aunt Mi-suk.

1192
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:18,581
NA MI-SUK'S FAIRY TALE CLASS
EVERY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AT 3:00 P.M.

1193
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,840
Hey, kids.

1194
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:31,177
I'm starting a fairy tale class.

1195
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,345
You'll come, right?

1196
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,512
WE'RE OPEN
WELCOME

1197
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:37,975
BREAK TIME FROM 3:00 TO 5:00 P.M.

1198
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:00,122
STIR-FRIED TOMATO AND ACORN JELLY

1199
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,505
I'M CURRENTLY SICK
I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO COOK

1200
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,465
IT'D BE NICE IF I COULD TRY YOUR FOOD

1201
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:14,637
After battling my illness for a year,
I went to eat at your restaurant today.

1202
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,765
I was too shy to tell you this,

1203
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,726
but your food gave me
warm comfort and encouragement.

1204
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,437
Thank you for the recipe as well.

1205
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,085
Are you coming?

1206
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,253
That's right!

1207
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,422
Choisseung!

1208
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,598
Why are you so late?

1209
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,642
I'm sorry for making you wait so long.

1210
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,396
When I contacted you, I'd already
been waiting for 30 minutes.

1211
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,231
So it was a total of 45 minutes.

1212
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,566
I'm sorry.

1213
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,155
You seem to have changed a bit though.

1214
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:15,740
Back then,

1215
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:18,743
you'd tell me it was okay to be late
and be careful on my way.

1216
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,369
Now, you're getting mad in the street.

1217
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,456
I wasn't mad. I was just asking.

1218
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,583
You're frowning.

1219
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,418
And your voice has lowered too.

1220
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,961
You're the one who's changed.

1221
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,590
You thought our plans were so trivial
that you were nearly an hour late.

1222
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,508
Do you know how important today was?

1223
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,219
I had to cancel the meeting
with our house's contractor.

1224
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,846
You could've gone alone.

1225
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,767
-What?
-I mean, you're the expert.

1226
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,643
You can handle it alone.

1227
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,520
I'd be of no use.

1228
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,939
Seriously, I'm fine with anything.

1229
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:50,775
Wow.

1230
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,196
"Fine with anything"?

1231
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,283
That's how you regard our new home?

1232
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,702
Come on. That's not what I meant.

1233
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:02,620
Hey--

1234
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,664
If a customer walked into your place
and said to you half-heartedly,

1235
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,417
"Just give me anything,"
how would you feel?

1236
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,881
Well, I wouldn't think much of it.
I'd just recommend a dish.

1237
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:17,301
I see. So I'm the only one
being sensitive here?

1238
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,846
You're right. I'm the petty one.
I'm the small-minded one.

1239
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,266
Stop it. Why are you
acting like this? It's tiring.

1240
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,894
As tired as I am after looking
at blueprints all night?

1241
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,896
For crying out loud! Hey!

1242
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,107
Did you always hold grudges like this?

1243
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,109
Do you always nitpick what people say?

1244
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,744
Are we having a fight right now?

1245
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,789
It doesn't seem like we're on good terms.

1246
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:51,418
Then, we should create
some official rules for when we argue.

1247
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:55,131
Whenever we argue,
we should always hold hands.

1248
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,424
If that fails,
add "honey" to each sentence.

1249
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,431
You can only let go
once the argument is over.

1250
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,144
Should we go?

1251
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:10,479
We should.

1252
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,958
What are you thinking about?

1253
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,460
Our new house…

1254
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,796
even though you don't care.

1255
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,508
Just say one more thing…

1256
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,385
Honey.

1257
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,763
You could end up living there
all by yourself, honey.

1258
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,557
After I waited for 30 years

1259
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,102
and another ten months,
how could you even say that to me, honey?

1260
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,604
I have another request.

1261
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,147
Honey.

1262
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,484
-Two single beds in our bedroom, honey.
-No way.

1263
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,486
We have to go with a queen size.

1264
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,447
Not a king either. Make it a queen.

1265
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,699
Just look at this.

1266
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,202
Why even ask for my opinion
on things like this then?

1267
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,121
I'm going to stay right next to you,

1268
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,292
like when I'm sad, hot, annoyed,

1269
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,376
or even when we argue.

1270
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:20,174
We should add another clause
to the rules when we argue.

1271
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:23,219
No separate rooms and no separate beds.

1272
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,015
Give the contractor a call.

1273
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,850
Ask if we could still meet now.

1274
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:34,146
-Really?
-Yeah.

1275
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,983
I'm just as curious and eager
to see our house as you are.

1276
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,114
What if he says we can't?

1277
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,414
Hello, sir. How are you?

1278
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:57,294
If it's not too much trouble,
would it be okay if we stopped by now?

1279
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,338
Yes.

1280
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,924
Really? You're available?

1281
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,593
Okay. Thank you!

1282
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,055
-It worked? What a relief.
-Wow, what a relief.

1283
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,558
Gosh, I thought it was going
to be canceled today.

1284
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,269
I was panicking earlier.

1285
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,313
I know. Things were so hectic today.

1286
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,858
THE END

1287
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:24,989
THE END AND THE BEGINNING

1288
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:55,371
