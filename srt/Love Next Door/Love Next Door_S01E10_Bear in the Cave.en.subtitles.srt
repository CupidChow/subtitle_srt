1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:10,820
What's this?

3
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,365
Hye-suk's things must've got into my bag.

4
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,328
What is this? It's all in English.

5
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,624
Does she carry this around
to show off how she can read it?

6
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,584
She's such a brat.

7
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43,853
Where was Seok-ryu's
old electronic dictionary?

8
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,153
Why does she have so much medicine?

9
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,324
Are they all vitamins? What are these?

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,287
Damn it. These are all in English too.

11
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,002
HYE-SUK

12
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,880
Jeez, you brat. Speak of the devil.

13
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,716
Hey, Hye-suk.

14
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,053
What? Seung-hyo's sick?

15
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,723
Thank you so much.

16
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,600
He's sick.

17
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,645
But how can I make him porridge?
I've never tried.

18
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,315
You made a good decision.
He always gets sick around this time.

19
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,650
-Really?
-Yeah.

20
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,527
Strangely,
it's always in summer, not winter.

21
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,487
He had a fever of 40 degrees once.

22
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,198
Geun-sik and I had to carry him
to your husband's hospital.

23
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,702
By the way, I almost forgot.

24
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,997
You left a magazine
written in English in my bag.

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,039
A magazine?

26
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,041
I never did that.

27
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,459
You probably took it.

28
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,588
Why would I take that? It's useless.

29
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,008
-We need to talk.
-Let's talk later.

30
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,885
I think Seok-ryu's inside.

31
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,512
-Seok-ryu's here?
-Yeah.

32
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,681
How long were you going to hide this for?

33
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,516
Seung-hyo.

34
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,853
This doesn't make sense!

35
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,025
How could you go through something
like that without telling anyone?

36
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,532
Stomach cancer surgery is serious.
How could you not tell anyone?

37
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,618
Who has cancer?

38
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,588
I heard it from outside.

39
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,547
Stomach cancer?

40
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,425
Who has cancer?

41
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,016
Who has cancer?

42
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,112
Is it you?

43
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,621
Is it really you?

44
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,410
Seok-ryu, let's go to the hospital.

45
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,995
-Hye-suk, call your husband.
-Okay.

46
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,038
Tell him we're coming right now, okay?

47
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,415
-Okay.
-Mom, I'm fine.

48
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,624
I don't have to go.

49
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,876
What do you mean? Why not?

50
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,838
Seung-hyo, get the car.
We have to go to the hospital now.

51
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,173
No, Mom. I'm fine.

52
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,175
I already had the surgery. I'm okay.

53
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,139
What are you talking about? When?

54
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,558
Three years ago.

55
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,021
Three years ago?
But that's when you were in the US.

56
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,690
No way.

57
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,359
How could I not know about that?

58
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,825
Is it true?

59
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,952
Really?

60
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,582
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,922
Seung-hyo, did you know?

62
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,051
Did you both lie to me again this time?

63
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,721
No, I didn't know. I just found out.

64
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,349
-Mom!
-Mi-suk!

65
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,101
Mi-suk, are you okay?

66
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,770
-Mi-suk.
-Mom!

67
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,147
-Where are you going, Mi-suk?
-Mom!

68
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,732
-Mom!
-Mi-suk!

69
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,070
Seung-hyo.

70
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,666
Mom! Listen to me!

71
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,085
I can explain everything.

72
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,669
Okay? Mom, please!

73
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,213
-Please, don't.
-Honey.

74
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,133
-What?
-Honey, she has cancer.

75
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,389
What are you talking about?

76
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,601
Hey, what did your mom say?

77
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,564
She had stomach cancer.

78
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,944
She received surgery
three years ago without telling us.

79
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,904
That's ridiculous.

80
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,286
Seok-ryu.

81
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,627
It's not true, is it?

82
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,256
It's not true, right?

83
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,050
This is… No. No way.

84
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,635
What on earth are you saying?

85
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,347
Hey, Seok-ryu. This is a prank, right?

86
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,724
Why would you joke
about something serious like that?

87
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,230
Mom!

88
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,575
Mom!

89
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,893
Is this why you didn't want to
go to the bathhouse?

90
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,769
Mom, this…

91
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,855
It'll fade.

92
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,318
They said it'll hardly
be noticeable later.

93
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,988
What are all these pills?

94
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,823
Why do you have so much?

95
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,617
-Is it because you're sick?
-No, Mom.

96
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,285
I'm not sick at all now.

97
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,120
Then, why do you have so much?

98
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,165
They're just liver supplements,
probiotics, and vitamins.

99
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,918
Don't leave anything out
and tell me the truth.

100
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,003
What happened to you?

101
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,880
Three years ago,

102
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,799
I had a health checkup in the US.

103
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,344
And I was diagnosed with stomach cancer.

104
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,848
I had surgery,
and it turned out to be stage 2.

105
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,519
I underwent chemotherapy as a precaution.

106
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:44,690
But I overcame it.
I'm completely fine now.

107
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,070
Is that why your engagement
was called off? Because you were sick?

108
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:53,199
-I'll kill that bastard!
-No, it wasn't like that.

109
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,535
He stayed by my side while I was sick.

110
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,537
He took time off work
and cared for me.

111
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,913
And…

112
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,542
I didn't want to make him suffer anymore.

113
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,963
-So I called the marriage off.
-Do you think parents are a joke?

114
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,173
How…

115
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,635
How could you hide
something like this from us?

116
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,554
I wasn't trying to.

117
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,932
I was going to get treated in the US.

118
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,811
-You'd only worry if you knew.
-Who cares if it was the US?

119
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,437
If their child is sick,

120
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,023
a parent would go
to the moon or Mars for them.

121
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,361
How dare you be so arrogant
and pretend you did this for us?

122
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,321
Mom.

123
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,239
Listen.

124
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,826
You were once a part of me.

125
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,454
While you were in my womb,
you ate the food I ate.

126
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,832
And you drank the water
I drank as you grew.

127
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,712
I endured 20 hours of labor
before an emergency C-section.

128
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,797
But how could you not tell me
you were sick?

129
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,508
How? How could I not know?

130
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,511
I'm sorry, Mom.

131
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,930
Dad, I'm sorry.

132
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,975
You should've told us.

133
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,687
You should've told us what was happening.

134
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,357
No matter how useless we are
as your parents…

135
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,153
Still, we should've known.

136
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,072
She thinks she's better than us,
so she doesn't see us as her parents.

137
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,700
No, don't say that.

138
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,747
I just couldn't tell you.
I couldn't bear to do it.

139
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,083
I wanted to tell you after I got better.

140
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,712
That's what happened.

141
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,801
I was wrong, Mom. I'm sorry.

142
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,304
Goodness.

143
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,852
Mom.

144
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,940
Seok-ryu.

145
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,450
Are you really okay now?

146
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,869
There aren't any problems, right?

147
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,082
Yeah, I'm healthy now. I'm fine.

148
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,543
You don't have to worry.

149
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,295
Okay.

150
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,756
Then, that'll do.

151
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,634
That'll do.

152
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,527
Mom, drink some water.

153
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,350
Choisseung was going to
bring me something, so--

154
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,643
Talk to him later!

155
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,103
People will talk if they see you here.

156
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,438
Mom.

157
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,899
Are you ashamed of me?

158
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,985
That's right.
I don't even want to see your face.

159
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,154
You're sleeping all day
and fooling around like an idiot.

160
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,532
Didn't it ever occur to you to wonder

161
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,242
how sleep-deprived I must've been?

162
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,995
Or how little fun I must have had
all these years to fool around like that?

163
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,623
Everyone has it hard. You're not special.

164
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,166
Try having kids of your own.

165
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,627
See if you can treat
your sick child that way.

166
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,587
Are you taking his side again?

167
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,632
Is being sick that big of a deal?

168
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,328
Why my Seok-ryu?

169
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,622
Why did she have to get cancer?

170
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,042
Why did she have to get sick like that?

171
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,920
If anyone, it should've been me.

172
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,049
All she ever did was work hard.
She did nothing wrong.

173
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,509
That poor child.

174
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,519
My goodness.

175
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,740
My goodness…

176
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,369
No, my poor girl.

177
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,039
Seok-ryu.

178
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,173
What am I going to do? My poor girl.

179
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,978
Seung-hyo.

180
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,399
What's that?

181
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,151
It's porridge.

182
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,780
You didn't seem well,
so I asked Mi-suk to make it.

183
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,867
I just can't believe what's happened.

184
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,286
Did you come into my room before?

185
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,829
Yeah.

186
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,835
Just leave it here. I'll eat this later.

187
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,587
I heated it. Before it cools, you…

188
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,423
Okay.

189
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,592
Rest up.

190
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,932
But did you really not know?

191
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,018
You went to the US
on a business trip three years ago.

192
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,645
You didn't see her then?

193
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,907
I'm near the church, so I'm almost there.

194
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,033
What's this?

195
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,076
MO-EUM

196
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,078
-Hey.
-Hey, Seung-hyo.

197
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,831
-I heard you're in the US.
-How did you know that?

198
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,374
Aunt Mi-suk told me.

199
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,542
This is great.

200
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,961
Can you go and see
Seok-ryu while you're there?

201
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,921
She's been so busy I can't reach her.

202
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,299
Hey, do you think I have time to waste?

203
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,385
Don't be like that. Go and see her.

204
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,929
You two are in the same world now.

205
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,224
It's a six-hour plane ride
from New York to California.

206
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,894
I see. Well, that's practically
another country.

207
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,897
I guess they're different worlds.

208
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,482
Got it? Good. Bye.

209
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,722
Back then,

210
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,975
I should've run to Seok-ryu.

211
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,353
I should've told her she looked thin

212
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,023
and that she looked tired.

213
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,735
I should've asked her if she was okay.

214
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,243
Could you display the screen in the back?

215
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,412
Please take a look at the documents.

216
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,373
Create new floor plans
to prevent construction errors.

217
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,417
-Okay.
-Also…

218
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,376
BAE SEOK-RYU

219
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,337
Has the CAD work for landscaping started?

220
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,254
Yes.

221
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,548
HEY, YOU'RE IN THE US?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL?

222
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,968
Share the bill of quantities
once the working design is complete.

223
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,471
-No issues with the schedule, right?
-No.

224
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,016
Choi Seung-hyo is a true captain.

225
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,561
You understand? In the sea of life,
we won't get lost with him!

226
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,188
He navigates the way for us.

227
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,566
This is all thanks to him.
Do you all know that?

228
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,652
-You're drunk.
-Hey.

229
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,695
What's that? Who's calling this late?

230
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,781
SEOK-RYU
HOW ARE YOU? YOU MUST BE BUSY

231
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,241
It's nothing.

232
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,243
Hey, you like dried pollock.

233
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,854
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHOISSEUNG

234
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,401
THANKS

235
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,291
But I was a coward,

236
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,835
and while I'd been out of reach,

237
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,589
she was sick.

238
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,842
Without anyone knowing

239
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,095
and alone for a long time.

240
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,894
When I was hurt,

241
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,478
Seok-ryu was the only person

242
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,815
who dragged me out of my cave.

243
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,818
But…

244
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,322
she sent all those signals in the dark,

245
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,115
and I missed them all.

246
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:08,540
BEAR IN THE CAVE

247
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,675
What are you doing?

248
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,844
Hey.

249
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,888
Are you making porridge?

250
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,015
Yeah.

251
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,854
Take these.

252
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,691
How did you think of freezing these?

253
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,569
It'll upset her
if she sees that our eyes are swollen.

254
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,655
Right.

255
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,660
What are you two doing?

256
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,827
Honey, the porridge.

257
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,412
-It's boiling over.
-Goodness.

258
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,957
I almost wasted all this great porridge.

259
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,126
I'm making abalone porridge.

260
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,419
Because of me?

261
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,130
I don't need to eat porridge.

262
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:03,345
You should eat food that's easy to digest.
You almost choked on abalone rice before.

263
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,391
I just had something in my throat then.

264
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,644
I even ate the tteokbokki
you made me last time.

265
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,145
You're right.

266
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,774
Why would you eat that?
You should've said no.

267
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,693
It's good. Why wouldn't I eat it?

268
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,779
Dad, I'm fine. Don't worry.

269
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,155
Still, be careful.

270
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,242
Take me with you
when you visit the doctor next time.

271
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,619
What for? You don't have to come.

272
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,207
Okay, you can come.

273
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,626
Dad, the porridge.

274
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,714
Jeez! I turned down the heat,
but it's still boiling over.

275
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,843
Gosh, I burnt the bottom.

276
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,721
It'll still taste good.

277
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,347
Hey.

278
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,599
What do you mean?

279
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,435
Seok-ryu has cancer?

280
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,104
I heard it myself,
but I still don't believe it.

281
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,231
I don't know how this happened.

282
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,401
Hang up. I'm going to call Mi-suk.

283
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,528
Hey, don't.

284
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,905
Just leave her be
until she tells us herself.

285
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,490
Don't act like you know.

286
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,534
How can I do that?

287
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,621
Hey, you might be able to do that,
but I can't!

288
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,541
I'd rather go and comfort her.

289
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,211
Imagine the hard time
she's going through!

290
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,047
Her daughter has cancer.

291
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,926
Mom, what did you just say?

292
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,308
Seok-ryu, you crazy…

293
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,148
-How could you hide that?
-Yeah, I hid it.

294
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,275
I didn't tell you. I kept it a secret.

295
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,359
What the hell?

296
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,071
You thought I'd go easy on you
if you confessed?

297
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,238
Don't go easy on me.

298
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,618
What are you doing?
Are you turning yourself in?

299
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,037
I know I deserve to get chewed out.

300
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,997
So do as much as you desire.

301
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,085
No.

302
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,378
I don't do anything that's made easy.

303
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,132
You're not qualified to be a hero.
They love getting things handed to them.

304
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,967
You're right.

305
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,261
I'm not qualified.

306
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,847
I couldn't save you.

307
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,308
Why would you suddenly
say something like that?

308
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,144
A tteokbokki fanatic
suddenly can't eat spicy food.

309
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,313
You drank non-alcoholic beer.

310
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,317
When I think about it,
there were so many clues.

311
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,695
I should've figured it out. Damn it.

312
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,948
Maybe I'm good at acting.

313
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,951
Should I pursue acting instead of cooking?

314
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,081
Did your mom cry a lot?

315
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,043
My parents had spoons
on their eyes like this in the morning.

316
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,211
They looked like Ultraman.

317
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,213
I won't cry.

318
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,550
I'll never cry.

319
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,594
If you won't cry or cuss me out,
what will you do?

320
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,720
Well…

321
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,725
I will…

322
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,105
do this.

323
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,485
You should've hugged me
like this at the airport.

324
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,071
You're right.

325
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,617
You've endured so much, Seok-ryu.

326
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,537
Physically and mentally.

327
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,624
Thanks.

328
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,588
Just so you know,

329
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,049
you're really flat.

330
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,636
I don't feel a thing.

331
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,055
What are you talking about?
We're not even touching!

332
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,974
I'm more curvaceous than you think!

333
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,058
I doubt that.

334
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,185
Want me to get undressed?

335
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,895
-Go ahead.
-I'll really do it.

336
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,439
I meant you're too skinny.

337
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,485
Buy me something nice to eat
if you feel sorry for me.

338
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,864
-I'm paid in peanuts.
-I'm unemployed.

339
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,618
-Should we buy lottery tickets?
-How many?

340
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,578
-How about seven?
-No.

341
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,331
Make it an even number.
It's easier to split.

342
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,291
Okay, let's buy ten!

343
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,168
Sounds good.

344
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,169
All right, then.

345
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,554
Professor, we just had people
from a car accident come in.

346
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,974
The car went up onto the sidewalk
and crashed into a building.

347
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,184
How are the patients?

348
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,937
The scans show
a pelvic bone fracture in one patient.

349
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,648
One has a clavicle fracture,
and another has a hip fracture.

350
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,857
Let me see.

351
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,282
Bae Seok-ryu?

352
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,408
What?

353
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,580
This patient was here a few days ago.

354
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,500
She had surgery
for stomach cancer in the US.

355
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,543
I remembered
because of her unique name.

356
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,137
The client requested a new contractor?

357
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,181
Why?

358
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,100
He wants to let an acquaintance do it.

359
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,269
The brother-in-law

360
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,603
of his father-in-law's

361
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,980
high school classmate

362
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,607
has a construction firm.

363
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,234
Isn't that a stranger?

364
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,568
Yeah.

365
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,570
But during construction,

366
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,282
the client thinks we could mess
with material and labor costs.

367
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,200
They said they couldn't trust our choice.

368
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,286
Are they crazy?

369
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,538
Why did they trust us
with the design then?

370
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,998
Switch it for them.

371
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,582
-What?
-What?

372
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,252
We should carry out our client's request.

373
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,089
Get their number, contact them,
and schedule a meeting.

374
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,759
I'll call Mr. Bang
from Sunjong Construction and apologize.

375
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,345
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

376
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,306
Let's wrap up today's meeting.

377
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,975
Keep up the great work.

378
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,233
Wow. Normally,
he would've never allowed this.

379
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,236
He must be in a really good mood today.

380
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,740
No, it's the opposite.

381
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,117
Something's up with him.

382
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,038
I have to ask you something.

383
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,998
Are you free?

384
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,085
So you knew.

385
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,549
I was debating whether to call you or not.

386
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,385
You know about her condition, right?

387
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,806
Even if you're my son,
I can't release a patient's information.

388
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,559
Can you just tell me if she's okay?

389
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,062
Seung-hyo.

390
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,648
I've always liked Seok-ryu.

391
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,194
A lot of people are awkward with me,
but she never was.

392
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,198
I adored that about her. I was grateful.

393
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,327
Bring Seok-ryu to the hospital.

394
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,913
I'll make sure she's okay.

395
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,167
I promise you.

396
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,836
Okay, Dad.

397
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,138
-Mi-suk!
-Mi-suk.

398
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,265
Hey, are you okay?

399
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,518
You look so drawn today.

400
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,062
-You didn't get any sleep, did you?
-Mi-suk.

401
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,231
There's an herbal medicine clinic I know.

402
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,316
I asked them what's good
for the stomach.

403
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,361
Cabbages and broccoli.

404
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,197
-And lotus root. Lotus root is great.
-Did you tell them?

405
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,408
Yeah.

406
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,660
Why did you go
and do something I didn't ask for?

407
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,161
It's not like that.

408
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,790
She told us to pretend
like we didn't know.

409
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,292
We're just worried.

410
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,504
Goodness. You even asked them
to act like they didn't know?

411
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,339
Mi-suk, it's not like that.

412
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,758
We just wanted to comfort you.

413
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,928
Why would you comfort me?

414
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,347
Who said I wanted that?

415
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,224
No one asked you to do this!

416
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,892
Na Mi-suk.

417
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,687
You're in one of the five stages of grief.

418
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,439
You're passing through anger.

419
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,524
But that's expected and natural.

420
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,443
You're really something too.

421
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,696
You want to brag
about how smart you are right now?

422
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,407
Fine, just get angry.
Be as angry as you want!

423
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,326
Just take it out on us!

424
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,578
-What?
-You can do that.

425
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,122
We're your friends.

426
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,290
Friends?

427
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,250
So what?

428
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,920
Are friends allowed
to cross the line like this?

429
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,216
Hey, don't talk to me
if you've never experienced it before.

430
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,051
You're right. We haven't.

431
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,138
But we know. Because we're parents too.

432
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,600
We know how you'd rather suffer
in Seok-ryu's place

433
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,769
and how much you blame yourself.

434
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,520
Yeah, Mi-suk.

435
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,273
You act tough on the outside,
but we know how sensitive you are.

436
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,901
We know how delicate you are.

437
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,152
Goodness.

438
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,696
What am I going to do with Seok-ryu?

439
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,657
I didn't even know she was sick.

440
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,327
I'm no mother.

441
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,163
I'm not qualified to be a mother.

442
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,331
My gosh.

443
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,292
-Hey, Mi-suk.
-Mi-suk!

444
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,173
No, don't blame yourself.

445
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,424
Okay?

446
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,593
It's okay.

447
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:07,055
Just cry, you brat. Cry it all out.

448
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,310
SE-HWAN: WHERE ARE YOU?

449
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:16,856
STOMACH CANCER

450
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,777
SURVIVAL RATE RISES TO 78%

451
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,403
EARLY DETECTION AND PREVENTION ARE KEY

452
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,625
Bae Seok-ryu.

453
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,419
She looks strong enough to eat rocks.

454
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,046
How could she get sick?

455
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,299
Damn it.

456
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,844
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

457
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,930
No, I'm not okay. I almost got hurt.

458
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,932
You're our gym member.

459
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,851
What are you doing here?

460
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,353
Shouldn't you be at work?

461
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,772
I quit.

462
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,109
That place wasn't big enough
for someone like me.

463
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,194
I see. So you were fired.

464
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,904
No, I wasn't!

465
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,489
I left on my own.

466
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,033
You were about to be fired,
so you quit first.

467
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:09,993
No, I didn't!

468
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,873
Take this advice from someone who's had
more experience in the workplace.

469
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,001
Get on your knees
and beg for your job back.

470
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,002
Why would I?

471
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,546
You don't know anything.
Why are you meddling?

472
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,964
Meddling?

473
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,050
That's not something I ever do.

474
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,514
I'm just giving you advice
after what you did with the treadmill.

475
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,685
I was running too fast back then.

476
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,068
Hey, your strides are too long!

477
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,194
I can't hear you.

478
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,530
The optimal cadence
for running is 180 bpm.

479
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,407
So what cadence is…

480
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,867
I think you hear me.

481
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,076
Jeez.

482
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:58,958
Ms. Jung.

483
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,589
Ms. Jung?

484
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,854
Ms. Jung.

485
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,946
Slowly.

486
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,699
-Be careful when you sit.
-Okay.

487
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,372
Are you okay?

488
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,043
Let's just go to the hospital.
I think you need an X-ray.

489
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,628
It's fine.

490
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,589
Who knew I'd end up
feeling the power of a black belt?

491
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,511
You should've known how to avoid it
if you were a red belt.

492
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,222
Do you have pain relief patches?

493
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,227
-No.
-Wait here. I'll go buy some.

494
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,857
It's fine, so just sit for a second.

495
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,989
Maybe I have some at my house.

496
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,991
I'm really okay.

497
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,452
I'm not that weak.

498
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,250
I didn't say anything.

499
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,053
Can I ask why you were crying back there?

500
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:38,016
Why are you asking to ask
when you've already done so?

501
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,351
You're right.

502
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,480
The thing is…

503
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,651
this is actually a very popular place
for listening to people's problems.

504
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,195
I've already had someone here before.

505
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,033
Who? Choi Seung-hyo?

506
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,328
How did you know?

507
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,666
Well, the security maintenance here
seemed like a mess.

508
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,758
No wonder.

509
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,220
You see,

510
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,433
it's about a friend of mine, not me.

511
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,395
My friend has a really close friend.

512
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,524
They've been best friends
since they were kids.

513
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,028
That friend lived abroad for a long time.

514
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,905
I see.

515
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,032
But…

516
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,992
my friend's friend…

517
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,040
had surgery…

518
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,087
for cancer three years ago.

519
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,799
And my friend

520
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,843
just found out recently.

521
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,516
Your friend must be having
a really hard time.

522
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,392
But…

523
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,188
she keeps acting
like she's not having a hard time.

524
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,486
But it's killing me.

525
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,036
I mean, I'm not talking about me.

526
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,998
It's my friend. And my friend's friend.

527
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,292
Why is this so confusing?

528
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,087
It's not about me.
It's my friend's friend.

529
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,381
Don't worry.

530
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,925
I'll make sure
security is tighter this time.

531
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,561
Well…

532
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,857
I can't believe Seok-ryu's sick.

533
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,361
Due to the nature of my job,

534
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,823
I see a lot of sick people.

535
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,410
And people on the verge of death.

536
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,288
But…

537
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,420
I never imagined that Seok-ryu
could be one of those people.

538
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,966
I said I wouldn't cry, but I can't stop.

539
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,887
You can cry here.

540
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,389
What?

541
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,766
Cry a little bit here in secret.

542
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,227
Then, smile even more after that.

543
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,439
Share a drink with her.

544
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,610
Chat, have fun, and just be with her.

545
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,281
Being with someone
who miraculously returned

546
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,035
is a miracle in itself.

547
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,456
It's just like what Yeon-du means to me.

548
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,126
-Yeon-du?
-Yes.

549
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,297
It was two years ago.

550
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,343
I looked at my phone
after finishing an interview.

551
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,180
I'd several missed calls
from the same number.

552
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,433
I called back and they said

553
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,727
it was the hospital.

554
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,415
Is this her?

555
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,854
My child.

556
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,108
I have a child.

557
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,320
Where is she?

558
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,078
KANG YEON-DU
DO HYEON-WOO

559
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,414
IN SURGERY

560
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,757
Yeon-du…

561
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,553
miraculously survived the accident
and came back to me.

562
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,014
Dan-ho…

563
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:34,145
So I know how precious
each ordinary morning is.

564
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,815
Waking her up every morning,

565
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,235
feeding her breakfast,

566
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,321
running to daycare together

567
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,990
so she's not late,

568
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,244
and seeing her wave goodbye to me

569
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,539
as she walks inside.

570
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,999
Ordinary days like that.

571
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,710
So you should also…

572
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,090
You said it was okay to cry.

573
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,928
Why are you holding it in?

574
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,603
I'll keep it secret too.

575
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,872
What's the point of running away?
I live next door.

576
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,070
Sorry.

577
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,615
I forgot we were supposed to
have lunch together.

578
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,950
That's okay.

579
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,494
We can just have dinner together.

580
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,121
I must be getting old.

581
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,457
I've never made such mistakes before.

582
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,000
What? It's cute.

583
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,127
Thank you.

584
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,629
Seo Hye-suk's doing things
unlike her usual self.

585
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,590
What's this?

586
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,717
Chablis wine. Nice, right?

587
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,635
It's so nice.

588
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,928
As for me,

589
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,390
I'm used to hearing adjectives
like "beautiful" and "cool."

590
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,726
But "cute"? That's not bad either.

591
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,523
Cheers.

592
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,281
This really is nice.

593
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,118
What did you need to discuss with me?

594
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,203
Well…

595
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,710
Have you thought about my offer?

596
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,712
I see.

597
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,759
That?

598
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,598
What's this?

599
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,851
Why did you come here?

600
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,188
I had something to tell you.

601
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,321
What do you mean? Take time off?

602
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,283
It's how it sounds.
You've been overdoing things.

603
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,621
I didn't overdo things. I just worked.

604
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,581
Right.

605
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,377
"The Woman of the Wind
who crossed the Sahara Desert."

606
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,295
"The Foreign Ministry's African Tongue."

607
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,715
Jeez. Go get everyone
who gave me those names.

608
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,050
I'll teach them.

609
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,762
You've lived up to your names

610
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,932
by being in the field
for over 20 years now.

611
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,977
Let's take a break.

612
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,814
Let's eat and have tea at our leisure.

613
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,824
I know that you're worried.

614
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,662
But I want to stay on active duty.
I'm years away from retirement too.

615
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,542
I'll speak to the minister myself
and ask him where I should go.

616
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,543
You…

617
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,254
can't go anywhere.

618
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,381
What?

619
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,299
Because…

620
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,843
you won't be reassigned.

621
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,723
I bet there aren't
any suitable positions right now.

622
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,016
I'll wait then.

623
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,642
It doesn't matter which country it is.

624
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,562
-When a spot opens, anywhere is--
-There's no point in waiting.

625
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,566
You understand what I mean, right?

626
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,820
You're telling me to just collect my pay
while on standby with no job?

627
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,491
-Don't tell me…
-You'll hear soon.

628
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,202
You'll be asked to voluntarily resign.

629
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,707
Did you agree with it too?

630
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,544
It was an organizational decision.

631
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,183
Sure.

632
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,605
Then, I'll have to accept it.

633
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,886
You're mad at me, right?

634
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,263
No.

635
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,683
Then, why didn't you call me?

636
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,186
I was busy.

637
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,647
Liar. You were avoiding me.

638
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,528
I know. It's because of my cancer.

639
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,489
It bothers you to look at me.

640
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,993
You don't know if you need to
comfort me or encourage me.

641
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,163
You probably don't know what to say.

642
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,500
Hey, it's like that at my house too.

643
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,836
My mom's crying.
My dad's having a hard time.

644
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,424
Even Dong-jin's become pale with fear.

645
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:22,261
They walk on eggshells around me.
It's so uncomfortable.

646
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,930
I knew this would happen.

647
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,599
That's why I kept it a secret.

648
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,061
But no one understands
how thoughtful I was being.

649
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,147
Yeah, right.

650
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,651
Seok-ryu, you're saying
you kept this a secret for our sake?

651
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,990
No, you only thought about yourself.

652
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,998
You're a coward, and you're pathetic.

653
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,083
What?

654
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,836
You're weak and hypocritical.

655
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,129
Hey.

656
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,213
You…

657
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,551
hurt the people who love you.

658
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,805
You did the unthinkable.

659
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,350
To your mom, your dad, me.

660
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,811
And to yourself.

661
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,772
You…

662
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,067
in your loneliest
and most difficult moment,

663
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,195
left yourself alone.

664
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,114
Seok-ryu.

665
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,784
When things are really tough,

666
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,205
you lean on the people closest to you.

667
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,664
What if I did lean on them?

668
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,376
Would that have changed anything?

669
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,631
If I'm hurting,
you'd all be hurting with me.

670
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,219
If I fall, you'd fall with me
like dominoes.

671
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,430
Who cares if we fall?
Who cares if things crumble?

672
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,390
We can hit rock bottom together.

673
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,059
Then, we can get back up again.

674
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,061
I don't know how to do that.

675
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,021
This is who I am,
so what can I do?

676
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,731
You did it for me!

677
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,276
When my mom left for Africa

678
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,363
and when I had to quit swimming
because I hurt my leg,

679
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,782
you reached out to me.

680
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,242
You stayed with me.

681
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,284
Hey.

682
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,203
That's…

683
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,413
That's different.

684
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,749
But why won't you give me
the chance to do the same?

685
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,627
You did all those things for me.

686
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,464
Why won't you let me do the same for you?

687
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,258
That's enough.

688
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,594
Let's stop.

689
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,473
Seok-ryu. Are you running away again?

690
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,892
Stop!

691
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,186
I said stop!

692
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,836
I should've done the same back then.

693
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,088
Just like you,

694
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,090
I should've shouted and gotten angry.

695
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,384
I should've been more honest.

696
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,929
Back then,

697
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,514
was Seok-ryu…

698
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,935
in a lot of pain?

699
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,190
She endured it courageously.

700
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,302
I thought the alcohol
would be sweet, but it's bitter.

701
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,222
That's good.

702
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,600
We can split this bottle

703
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,852
and go to bed.

704
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,443
Honey.

705
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,365
I keep thinking about all the wrong things
I've done to Seok-ryu.

706
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,743
When Seok-ryu was three,

707
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,537
Dong-jin was crying at night.

708
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,250
She woke up and started to cry too.

709
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,712
So I scolded her.

710
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,467
I said, "You're a big kid.
Why are you crying?"

711
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,261
"Why are you giving me a hard time too?"

712
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,889
You were young.

713
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,850
You didn't know.

714
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,186
Still…

715
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,731
I shouldn't have done that.

716
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,985
I think I made this happen to her.

717
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,533
My excuse was I had to
give Dong-jin extra care,

718
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,370
and I pushed her too much to the side.

719
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,247
But…

720
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,167
she grew up so well on her own.

721
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,253
Yeah, she did.

722
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,089
Our daughter…

723
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,591
never caused us any trouble.

724
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:17,180
That poor girl must've tried
so hard to do that.

725
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,724
She must've been so stressed.

726
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,311
But all I did
was boast about it to others.

727
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,981
I never gave her the support she needed.

728
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,610
She was so worried
that she endured such an awful thing

729
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,779
all on her own.

730
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,993
It's mostly my fault.

731
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,875
Gosh, that restaurant was doomed anyway.
Why did I try so hard?

732
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,921
I wasn't able to focus on my family.

733
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,758
I passed it off onto you.

734
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,555
I feel terrible for what I did to her.
What am I going to do?

735
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,725
I'm so sorry.

736
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,728
I'm sorry.

737
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,065
I'm sorry to you.

738
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,819
And I'm sorry to Seok-ryu.

739
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,740
Honey, what do we do?

740
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,168
I'm so sorry.

741
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,462
I'm sorry.

742
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,422
I'm so…

743
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,011
I'm sorry.

744
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,308
Honey, what are we going to do?

745
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,715
I can't even greet Yeon-du
because of my careless lips.

746
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:21,263
All of this happened
because I had a lot on my mind.

747
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,558
As a result, it short-circuited a little.

748
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,977
Let's put out the fire.

749
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,770
I have to extinguish it.

750
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,486
Why did she hide?

751
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,490
Is she playing hide-and-seek?

752
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:45,036
-What are you talking about?
-Mo-eum just hid after she saw us.

753
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,371
I saw her.

754
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,334
We're late. Yeon-du, should we run?

755
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,461
-Yeah.
-Ready, set, go!

756
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,713
I'm going to beat you!

757
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,260
Hey, Seok-ryu.

758
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,476
Seok-ryu?

759
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,149
She left her phone. Where did she go?

760
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,828
JEONGHEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
BAE SEOK-RYU, YOUR BIOPSY RESULTS ARE OUT

761
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,554
Back then,

762
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,848
was Seok-ryu…

763
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,267
in a lot of pain?

764
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,688
She endured it courageously.

765
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,987
At least,

766
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,783
that's what I thought.

767
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,495
After her surgery,

768
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,580
about a year passed…

769
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,542
and she developed depression.

770
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,297
Depression?

771
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,716
I didn't know.

772
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,889
She was falling apart alone.

773
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,978
Be careful!

774
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:33,895
Yes, sir!

775
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,230
Please be careful.

776
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,650
Mr. Choi, could you come here?

777
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,402
Can you explain this?

778
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,403
Sure.

779
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,656
Here.

780
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,534
So this isn't your average structure.

781
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,703
I thought it'd be hard to implement.

782
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,999
I'll send you a detailed floor plan
and additional materials to explain.

783
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,209
We'd be grateful for that.

784
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,211
As for that area, if you look here…

785
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,755
Just a moment. Sorry.

786
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,093
Hi, Aunt Mi-suk.

787
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,596
What? Seok-ryu?

788
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,877
HYEREUNG COOKING SCHOOL

789
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,685
Seriously?

790
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,695
Hey, Seok-ryu!

791
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:50,740
Choisseung?

792
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,034
What are you doing?

793
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,327
How did you know I was here?

794
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,081
If you're going to go somewhere,
you should let people know!

795
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,999
How could you disappear
without your phone?

796
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,835
Well, that…

797
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,295
interferes with my deep meditation
and self-reflection--

798
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,005
Are you joking?

799
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,466
Do you know how much
I've been looking for you?

800
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,468
Do you know how worried everyone is?

801
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,596
I came here
because I was frustrated, okay?

802
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,098
I need to breathe too.

803
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,307
Hey.

804
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,060
Because of you,
I'm the one who's suffocating here.

805
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,271
How long were you
going to keep it a secret?

806
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,939
How long were you
going to hide it for?

807
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,025
You want to talk about this again?
Aren't you sick of it already?

808
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,528
Your emotional pain,
not your physical pain.

809
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,156
You…

810
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,868
had depression.

811
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,786
Why didn't you tell me?

812
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,955
Where did you hear that?

813
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,542
Did you see Hyeon-jun?

814
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,294
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

815
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,589
Are you a fool?

816
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,299
Why are you so stupid?

817
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,010
How much have you bottled up
in that tiny body of yours?

818
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,136
Stop it. I'm leaving.

819
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:56,806
Hey!

820
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,892
What are you doing?

821
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,518
What on earth are you doing?

822
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,561
Hey!

823
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,022
Wait! What are you doing?

824
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,943
Hey, what are you doing?

825
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,236
Are you insane?

826
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,872
What are you doing, you lunatic?

827
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,291
You said you were frustrated.
Isn't it refreshing now?

828
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,250
Hey!

829
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,794
Yeah. You should shout like that.

830
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,380
You have everything pent up inside.

831
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,466
Let it all out.

832
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,095
What's inside you is bitterness.

833
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,055
So…

834
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,976
don't try to foolishly
carry that burden alone!

835
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,937
Let it all out here.

836
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,482
Why are you yelling at me?

837
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,652
Why do you keep getting angry at me?

838
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,738
I'm the one who was sick.

839
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,449
I'm the one who's having the hardest time.

840
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,160
Why do you keep scolding me?

841
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,872
I wasn't being angry at you.

842
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,334
I'm mad at myself.

843
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,422
After I heard you were sick,
I thought back.

844
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,385
I didn't hear you…

845
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,804
knocking on my door.

846
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,060
You sent me signs
that you were struggling.

847
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,438
But I had my eyes and ears closed.

848
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,571
Even though I knew that…

849
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,283
I said those harsh things to you.

850
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:45,290
I felt so pathetic and frustrated.
I felt like garbage.

851
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,505
Why didn't you text me back?

852
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,341
I'm sorry.

853
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,428
Why did you ignore my calls?

854
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,055
I'm sorry.

855
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:09,522
I wasn't able to tell anyone!

856
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,566
Do you know how scared I was on my own?

857
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,280
Why did you do that?

858
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:24,454
I was so worried my parents
would collapse from shock if I told them!

859
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,874
I had all sorts of thoughts
in my head when I made this decision.

860
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:32,086
I debated if I should tell you or not
over a hundred times.

861
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,049
You don't know anything!

862
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,217
You don't know how I feel!

863
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:21,761
Here.

864
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,555
Nothing beats banana milk
after going for a swim.

865
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:29,310
It's nice. It's like when we'd visit
the bathhouse as kids.

866
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,156
Hey, you haven't answered me yet.

867
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,992
How did you know I was here?

868
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,870
This is where you ran away to before.

869
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,956
It was short-lived though.

870
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,791
You didn't have to say that part.

871
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,210
It's true that I ran away.

872
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,213
It was justified too.

873
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,006
Mom.

874
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,551
How come only he gets a new phone?

875
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:05,471
How come only Dong-jin
gets a new phone?

876
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,307
Gosh, I had no choice. His was broken.

877
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,060
Mine's broken too. It broke twice.

878
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,729
But I had it fixed!

879
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,356
I said I'd buy you one
if you got the highest mock exam score.

880
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,983
But you didn't.

881
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,027
He's the dumbest kid in school,
but you bought him one!

882
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,487
This takes great pictures.

883
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,906
-They're killer!
-Delete them or I'll kill you.

884
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,075
-Goodness. Seung-hyo, are you okay?
-Yeah.

885
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,244
Look, you think I wanted
to buy him one?

886
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,455
I can't reach this brat without a phone!

887
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,249
Also, all gadgets are the same.

888
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,709
Try to be more like Seung-hyo.

889
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,503
He's been using the same phone for years.

890
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,255
But he's never complained once.

891
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,007
-What a sweet boy.
-Mom, listen.

892
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,509
Only his phone is old.

893
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,470
Everything else he owns is expensive.

894
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,096
Look at this. This shirt?

895
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,557
-Let go. Get your hands off me.
-It's over 100,000 won!

896
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,684
And he only wears
foreign-brand underwear. Look!

897
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,602
What are you doing?

898
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,187
-Hey. Stop!
-Seok-ryu, are you crazy?

899
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,813
This is so unfair, Mom.

900
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,566
How come only he gets
a swivel phone and not me?

901
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,194
You always let stuff like this happen!

902
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,278
It's not fair!

903
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,327
Jeez, what is wrong with her?

904
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,833
I want to go back!

905
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,587
You wore your uniform to school,

906
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:22,215
went to all your classes,
and then ran away.

907
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,342
Does that even count?

908
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,637
Absences would lower your grades.

909
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,057
Fine, forget it.

910
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,184
I didn't have much guts.

911
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,353
It's because you're too nice.

912
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,022
What?

913
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,149
You were mad
and felt things were unfair,

914
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,611
but you didn't want to worry your parents.

915
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,238
So that was your compromise.

916
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,825
My brother was always causing problems.

917
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:54,455
But I was the one
who caused the biggest mess.

918
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,379
I'm done.

919
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:10,388
I'd wish for nothing more
than a cold beer to chug right now.

920
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,392
But I can't do that anymore.

921
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,686
That makes me sad.

922
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,735
Make the call.

923
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:26,320
To who?

924
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,530
My dad.

925
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,616
They said you got a text
from the hospital.

926
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,702
Your biopsy results are out.

927
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:37,665
That? Later. I can do that later.

928
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,750
Not later. Do it now while I'm here.

929
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,923
Do you remember when they put
seven metal pins in my leg?

930
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,801
Yeah. Why?

931
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,722
Did something happen when you stubbed
your foot into the bed that time?

932
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,057
What? No.

933
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,479
But once you injure a knee,
it can get hurt again.

934
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,984
If that happens, I'm going to
take you with me to the hospital.

935
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:06,986
Don't I get any say in it?

936
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:10,114
I'm going to make you buy me juice.

937
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,992
And what else? I'll make you
get comic books for me.

938
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,703
And I'll ask you to wash my greasy hair.

939
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,872
That's ridiculous.

940
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:18,956
Who says I'll do it?

941
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,124
I'd do it for you.

942
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,503
That's what I'm going to do
no matter what you say.

943
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,549
So…

944
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,302
don't worry that something might happen.

945
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,724
Call them,
and I'll stay by your side.

946
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:50,488
FATHER

947
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,497
Hello, sir. It's Seok-ryu.

948
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,749
Yes.

949
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,211
I'm sorry I hid it from you.

950
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,047
So…

951
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,217
I heard the biopsy results are out.

952
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,346
Right.

953
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,349
Okay.

954
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,354
Okay, I understand.

955
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:25,606
Okay, bye.

956
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,196
What did he say?

957
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,448
He said it was nothing.

958
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,450
It was just an infection. I'm clean.

959
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:49,463
-Hey, why the hell are you hugging me?
-Just…

960
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,383
Let me give you a damn hug.

961
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,493
Goodness.

962
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,751
Gosh.

963
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,881
Where are you right now?

964
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,553
Professor, are you going to eat?

965
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,471
Yeah.

966
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,807
The cafeteria's serving bibimbap today.

967
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,391
I'm going to have steak.

968
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,893
What? They're serving steak?

969
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:27,561
Professor, where…

970
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:28,896
The cafeteria's this way.

971
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:30,856
Professor?

972
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,668
-What's this?
-It's the vice minister and ambassador.

973
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:55,089
-Didn't they graduate together?
-Yeah, they're really close.

974
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,383
They went to Africa together
in the past too.

975
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,927
What's with the flowers?

976
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:04,306
Who knows?
There are tons of rumors about them.

977
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:08,269
It's well-known. They say
the vice minister isn't married yet

978
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:10,771
because the ambassador still is.

979
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,481
That's insane.

980
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:31,458
Hey, Mo-eum did the same thing too.

981
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,919
Why are you expressing
your friendship with hugs now?

982
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,880
Not me.

983
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,883
I told you we're not friends anymore.

984
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:46,056
We're here.
It's so quick without the traffic.

985
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,857
Where are we going? That was my house.

986
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,737
Wait, where are we going?
Hello? Where are we going?

987
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,156
My legs are falling asleep.

988
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:03,741
-Mom.
-Yeah?

989
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,201
Do we have to do all this?

990
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,452
I know from experience,

991
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,579
but a surprise party requires patience.

992
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,873
-Hang in there.
-When is Seok-ryu coming?

993
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,374
The food's getting cold.

994
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,292
-Aunt Mi-suk.
-Yeah?

995
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,085
This cake didn't come with any matches.

996
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,338
That can't be.

997
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,840
Does anyone have a lighter?

998
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,593
I may drink, but I don't smoke.

999
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,262
Should I start smoking again then?

1000
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,349
How can you not have lighters
in a kitchen?

1001
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,808
Well, yeah. It's a kitchen.

1002
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:31,894
I have a torch. Hold on.

1003
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,437
-I'll shine a light.
-Where was it?

1004
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,356
-Help him find it.
-It's so dark. I can't see.

1005
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:36,357
My legs.

1006
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,443
Hey, wait. Slow down.

1007
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:40,903
-For what?
-Okay?

1008
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:41,904
Hey.

1009
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,530
It works.

1010
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,074
-The door's unlocked.
-Slow down.

1011
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,580
CONGRATULATIONS
SEOK-RYU'S WELCOME HOME PARTY

1012
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,210
My gosh!

1013
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,588
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

1014
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:06,220
Mom, Dad? What's going on?

1015
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,764
Well, so…

1016
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,892
We wanted to throw a party
to welcome you back home.

1017
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:16,272
But I've been home
for some time now.

1018
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,775
This is so cheesy. Whose idea was this?

1019
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,527
It was him.

1020
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,444
Him.

1021
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,072
This is ridiculous.

1022
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:27,241
What are you going to do?

1023
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:31,495
Aunt Mi-suk, I found Seok-ryu.

1024
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,999
Yeah. But I was thinking.

1025
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,584
How about we give her
a welcome home party tonight?

1026
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,461
I know it's a little late,

1027
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,214
but we didn't do anything for her
when she came home.

1028
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,757
What are you doing?

1029
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,052
I mean, I just…

1030
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,887
I just wanted to
have a meal with everyone.

1031
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,557
You prepared a lot, Uncle Geun-sik.

1032
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,351
-Because you told me to.
-Okay, then!

1033
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,936
-Come in.
-Let's sit, everyone.

1034
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,439
-Sit down.
-Yeah, let's sit.

1035
01:11:58,522 --> 01:11:59,898
Goodness!

1036
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:03,610
Chef, please introduce tonight's dishes.

1037
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,699
What's with you all?

1038
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:12,453
It's been a while for me.
I'm a little nervous.

1039
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,538
Wait a second. All right.

1040
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,166
Tonight's main dish is

1041
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:21,170
gungjung tteokbokki, which was served
originally during the Joseon Dynasty.

1042
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:24,923
It has rice cakes made with
organic brown rice fresh from the mill.

1043
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:28,469
They've been cooked and reduced
in the chef's special sauce

1044
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,013
for the person I love the most
in the whole world…

1045
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,144
For my daughter,

1046
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,066
I present this special dish.

1047
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:43,901
A round of applause!

1048
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:46,987
Thanks, Dad.

1049
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:51,241
This is the only type of tteokbokki
you can eat now. Got it?

1050
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,326
Okay.

1051
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,705
Weren't you worried the food
would get cold? What a long speech.

1052
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:57,956
-Let's eat.
-Goodness!

1053
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,625
You should say a few words too.

1054
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,709
-Yeah.
-Hey! No.

1055
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,836
-A speech to welcome her home.
-Hurry up.

1056
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,254
I'll do it sitting down.

1057
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,009
We're a family.

1058
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,513
A family doesn't just share
the good times.

1059
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,893
A family shares the difficult, sad,
and painful times together too.

1060
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:21,730
So…

1061
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,191
from now on,

1062
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,902
no more keeping things to yourself.

1063
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,695
No more.

1064
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,073
That's our family motto now.

1065
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,409
-Our motto!
-Sounds good!

1066
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:35,452
Friends are family too!

1067
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,080
-Family!
-Just join our family.

1068
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,834
We have so many kids.
We have four of them.

1069
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,585
We've always been family.

1070
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,254
That's right.

1071
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,296
Yeah. Hey.

1072
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,924
But what do we do about the cake?
We didn't light it.

1073
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,968
It's fine. Our surprise failed.
Don't do it.

1074
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,345
No, we can have it for dessert later.

1075
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,055
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

1076
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,893
This is fried yam.
Yams are good for the stomach.

1077
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,855
I'm going to grate and fry them
for your breakfast and dinner.

1078
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,023
-You better eat them all.
-Hey.

1079
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,275
Eat up.

1080
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,235
How dare you talk that way
your older sister?

1081
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:09,153
You brat!

1082
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,029
-Her name's not "Hey."
-Be respectful.

1083
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,030
Do it now.

1084
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,701
Seok-ryu, eat up.

1085
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,623
-Let's eat!
-Thank you for the food!

1086
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,791
Thank you for the meal.

1087
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,598
I'm so full.

1088
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:39,057
My stomach might explode.

1089
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,899
-What?
-What?

1090
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,525
No, it's not what I meant.

1091
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,819
That's how good the food was.
I ate a lot.

1092
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,488
That's what I meant.

1093
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:57,451
Seriously, I'm okay. Don't worry.

1094
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:58,952
You scared us.

1095
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,997
-She says she's fine.
-All right.

1096
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,999
Come up to the rooftop tomorrow.

1097
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,375
I'll be your personal trainer.

1098
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,629
Are you insane?
Why would I entrust my body to you?

1099
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:09,630
I'll help you too.

1100
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:12,299
-Honorary paramedic, Bae Seok-ryu.
-So cheesy!

1101
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,384
-Gross.
-Hey, call 119.

1102
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:17,804
I'll come faster than anyone
from the dispatch center.

1103
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,766
I love getting this type of treatment.

1104
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,101
My dad's going to
make me gungjung tteokbokki.

1105
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,686
That's not all.

1106
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,397
I'll make you whatever you want,
three square meals a day.

1107
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,025
-Of course.
-Then, what about you?

1108
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,235
Will you build me a house?

1109
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,945
Don't get your hopes up.

1110
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,530
-That sounds good.
-Seung-hyo.

1111
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:35,864
It was worth a try.

1112
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,533
-Aunt Mi-suk!
-What about you, Mom?

1113
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,036
I'll scrub your back.
Let's go to the bathhouse tomorrow.

1114
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,579
Okay, let's go.

1115
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,708
Want to come too?
Just like old times?

1116
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:50,170
Why would I go with you?
You lunatic. Don't be ridiculous.

1117
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:53,131
I mean, we can just go
to the bathhouse together.

1118
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,467
Then, we'll part ways
in front of the lockers.

1119
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,261
-What were you thinking?
-Yeah.

1120
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,972
I wasn't thinking about anything. Jeez.

1121
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,807
Look at him stuttering.
He was thinking.

1122
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,225
-He's so flustered.
-He did!

1123
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,477
Hey, stop ganging up on Seung-hyo!

1124
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,687
-You did? Why you…
-I didn't!

1125
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,564
-Come here!
-I'm innocent!

1126
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,482
Why is he going in?

1127
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:12,859
You better have that house built!

1128
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,166
You're home late.

1129
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,014
I'm sorry. I couldn't make it to lunch.

1130
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:45,142
No, it's fine.

1131
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:49,062
Things were hectic for me too,
so I forgot.

1132
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,190
Honey.

1133
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,652
I have something to tell you.

1134
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,412
So do I.

1135
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:08,540
Go ahead. Mine might take a while.

1136
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,668
Let's get a divorce.

1137
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,632
What?

1138
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:17,758
I want a divorce.

1139
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:28,769
HYEON-JUN

1140
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:37,319
Hello?

1141
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:38,987
You picked up.

1142
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:41,990
I'm glad.

1143
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,617
I have no reason not to.

1144
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:46,203
Where are you?

1145
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,413
Where else? I'm at my hotel.

1146
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,999
Did you have something to say?

1147
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,126
Yeah.

1148
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,297
I'm going back to the US.

1149
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,425
I think…

1150
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,054
this call might be

1151
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:06,431
the last one I give you.

1152
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:11,978
Seok-ryu.

1153
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,357
I…

1154
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,111
loved you so much.

1155
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,656
But…

1156
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,329
I think the way I loved you was wrong.

1157
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,709
I only focused on
getting you back on your feet.

1158
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,754
I never thought to fall down with you.

1159
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,591
It was only after I came to Korea…

1160
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:47,222
that I realized who the people
you truly needed were…

1161
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,060
and where you needed to be.

1162
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:55,188
I'm sorry.

1163
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,232
Back then,

1164
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,819
I couldn't relate to your pain.

1165
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,405
I couldn't accept you…

1166
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,367
for who you were.

1167
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,453
No, it was my fault.

1168
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,997
I used being sick as an excuse

1169
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,292
and exploited you.

1170
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:18,754
I was so consumed with my own emotions

1171
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,382
that I didn't recognize…

1172
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,386
how lonely you were.

1173
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,724
Seok-ryu,

1174
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,478
let's not regret the time we shared.

1175
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:39,441
Let's remember
how I was everything to you

1176
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,987
and how you meant
everything to me back then.

1177
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,074
That should be enough then.

1178
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,495
Okay.

1179
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,581
All right.

1180
01:19:58,502 --> 01:19:59,336
Take care.

1181
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:02,672
You too.

1182
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,264
Are you going to work?

1183
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:54,057
Are you going to class?

1184
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,017
I asked you first.

1185
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,104
What, you think
I'd be getting off work at this hour?

1186
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:03,900
True. Hey, don't work too late.

1187
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,152
It's pointless to devote yourself to work.

1188
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:08,697
It's my company. I'll take care of it.

1189
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:10,615
That's true too.

1190
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,411
All right, you take care of it,
and have a great day.

1191
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:16,621
You too.

1192
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:19,916
Hey, why are you following me?

1193
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,793
I'm not. I said I'm going to work.

1194
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:25,005
Yeah, I know that. But go a different way.

1195
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:28,383
Before I cook, I need time
to seriously meditate alone.

1196
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:34,973
Hey, you're following me.

1197
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,394
What are you doing?

1198
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:41,980
-Hyeong-chan.
-Yes, sir?

1199
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,231
Come here for a second.

1200
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,318
Why is the proposal so flat?

1201
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,236
Did you finish analyzing
the surrounding area?

1202
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,572
-What about the commercial district?
-Not yet.

1203
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:53,074
After we prepare
the construction procedures first--

1204
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,993
You did things in the wrong order.

1205
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:58,496
If we review regulations and build
according to those sizes, we're done?

1206
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:03,460
You need to work
with the brand in mind from the start.

1207
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:05,712
If we only consider the ratios,

1208
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,589
why would the clients come to us?

1209
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:11,051
I'm sorry. I'll have it redone.

1210
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,889
I don't think
Mr. Choi's in a good mood today.

1211
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:16,806
-No…
-Na-yun.

1212
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:17,933
Yes?

1213
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,977
Did you review Misom's flagship store
and its environmental sustainability?

1214
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,938
No, not yet.

1215
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,523
I asked you to do that a while ago.
You still haven't finished?

1216
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:26,775
I'm sorry.

1217
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,151
-Speed it up.
-Yes, sir.

1218
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,906
He's in a great mood today.

1219
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,283
He's super happy.

1220
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:43,500
It can bear fruit?

1221
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,377
Can it bloom flowers too?

1222
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,419
Of course.

1223
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,006
Our friend has a lot to do this year.

1224
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:51,675
Then…

1225
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:54,552
What should I do to listen to my tree?

1226
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:59,265
First off, it needs a lot of sunshine

1227
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:02,477
for around six to ten hours a day.

1228
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,606
Also, it likes warm temperatures.

1229
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,568
Putting it in a place with a good breeze
will make it feel less humid.

1230
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,738
Don't be withering alone again.

1231
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:17,075
Tell me if you have something to say.

1232
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,910
I promise…

1233
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:21,621
I'll listen carefully.

1234
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:25,709
POMEGRANATE TREE

1235
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:40,849
Get up now.

1236
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:42,350
What? What is it?

1237
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,561
-We have to go somewhere.
-Where?

1238
01:23:44,644 --> 01:23:47,355
-There's no time. Hurry. Get up.
-I can't go like this!

1239
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,732
-It's fine.
-You're in a suit.

1240
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,108
-What?
-I didn't wash my hair!

1241
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:51,109
You don't have to.

1242
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,445
-You lunatic, where are we going?
-There's no time.

1243
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:57,532
Hey.

1244
01:23:58,241 --> 01:23:59,784
-Come on.
-Why are we here?

1245
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,251
Why are we here?

1246
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,211
Song Hyeon-jun.

1247
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:14,591
Choisseung.

1248
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,345
Wait here. I'm first.

1249
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:28,855
Don't tell me you're here to see me off.

1250
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,356
With Seok-ryu?

1251
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,776
Isn't this why you messaged me?

1252
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,363
This is Song Hyeon-jun.

1253
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,241
My flight leaves at 10:00 p.m. tonight.

1254
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,328
Take care of Seok-ryu.

1255
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:46,790
I did hope it might happen.

1256
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:48,792
But who knew?

1257
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,877
How did you get my number?

1258
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,047
I asked Mr. Yoon and he gave it to me.

1259
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:55,465
Myeong-u, seriously?

1260
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:00,470
I'll bring Seok-ryu over.
You can say goodbye.

1261
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:03,973
I can't give you a lot of time though.

1262
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,142
Keep it short and simple.

1263
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,311
Keep your distance too.

1264
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:10,396
I'll keep that in mind.

1265
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,899
Also, thank you.

1266
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,235
For staying…

1267
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:17,445
by her side back then.

1268
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:32,210
Go ahead.

1269
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:34,712
Hey, Choisseung.

1270
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:39,592
I'm more petty, immature,
and impatient than you think.

1271
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:43,805
But I think this is right.

1272
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:46,933
Go ahead.

1273
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:11,166
We've already said our goodbyes.
He went overboard, don't you think?

1274
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,501
I'm grateful he did it though.

1275
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:18,298
I mean, I would've dressed up
if I knew I was coming here.

1276
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:20,633
It's the last time you'll see me,
and I look terrible.

1277
01:26:22,093 --> 01:26:22,969
You're beautiful.

1278
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:26,264
I've never seen you shine so bright.

1279
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:29,184
Thanks.

1280
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:33,521
Also, thank you for everything.

1281
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,107
I'm more thankful.

1282
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,153
Should we shake hands for one last time?

1283
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:44,532
I know someone's watching,
but I think it'll be okay.

1284
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:54,459
Jeez.

1285
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:56,586
Be happy.

1286
01:26:58,421 --> 01:26:59,964
Don't get sick again.

1287
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,635
Yeah, you too.

1288
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,930
I hope you meet someone nice.

1289
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:12,352
It seems like you already have.

1290
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:17,732
I really don't like him.

1291
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:21,486
But he's all right.

1292
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:25,823
I'm off.

1293
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,015
What are you doing?

1294
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:34,726
It's hot in here.

1295
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,102
Can you hold it for me?

1296
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:41,733
What am I, a coat rack?

1297
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,526
Just do it, will you?

1298
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:45,862
Just stay like that for a second.

1299
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,418
BOARDING

1300
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,589
LOS ANGELES

1301
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:15,892
With Seung-hyo's thoughtfulness,
I cried for a long time that day.

1302
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:21,272
After a while,

1303
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:23,691
I emerged with swollen eyes

1304
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:27,403
and walked out that door with him.

1305
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:36,287
BEAR IN THE CAVE

1306
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:43,336
MOUTH OF THE CAVE

1307
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:31,134
