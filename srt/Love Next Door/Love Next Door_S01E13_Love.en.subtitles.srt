1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,001
Why are you staring at me like that?

3
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,044
It just…

4
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,130
This feels just like a dream.

5
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,549
I can't believe it.

6
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,304
-Ouch.
-It's not a dream, is it?

7
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,557
You're right. It's real.

8
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,186
And we're together too.

9
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,688
It's strange.

10
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,026
To be here like this together.

11
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,612
What's strange about it?

12
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,283
It's like a ticklish feeling.

13
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,245
I'm not sure exactly where,

14
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,998
but somewhere deep in my heart,

15
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,418
it feels like bubbles popping.

16
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,628
Me too.

17
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,591
Doesn't it tingle like there's electricity
moving through our bodies?

18
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,176
Right. No, it's like this.

19
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,514
You know when you're about to get a shot
and they're looking for a vein,

20
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,058
so they tell you to clench
and unclench your fist?

21
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,102
It's that feeling.

22
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,354
It's love.

23
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,398
What?

24
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,024
That's love.

25
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,903
Come on. It's too early to say it's love.

26
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,489
It's taken 30 years,
but it's still early?

27
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,366
That is true.

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,162
But something about the word "love"
makes me cringe.

29
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,663
It's a bit embarrassing too.

30
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,499
I love you.

31
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,256
As my family, my friend, and my woman.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,593
The kind of love
might have been different at times…

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,683
but there was never a time
when I didn't love you.

34
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,151
We had a great time, thanks to you.

35
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,736
Bye!

36
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,905
-Aunt Mi-suk?
-I don't remember how we got back.

37
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,825
We all went on a trip, but I don't have
a single picture to show for it.

38
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,077
It's because the camera doesn't lie.

39
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,080
That's how you look.
Take it up with your mother then.

40
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,918
Gyeong-jong turned Hye-suk
into a supermodel.

41
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,794
He made her legs look so long.

42
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,004
But Hye-suk's…

43
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,006
It was the same when we ate crabs too.

44
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,759
Gyeong-jong picked the meat
out of each leg for her

45
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,719
and fed it to her.

46
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,638
And you?
You were busy eating for yourself.

47
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,389
That's because he's a doctor.

48
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,392
He's an expert at dissection.

49
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,228
-So he picked them clean.
-Did you forget?

50
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,938
You're a cook.

51
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,735
I wanted to go for a walk at night,
but you got drunk and passed out.

52
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,320
Why do you snore so much?

53
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,863
I don't snore on purpose.

54
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,824
You're home so early.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,787
Hey, Aunt Mi-suk.
Did you have fun on the trip?

56
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,593
Aren't you two too old to be reading
comic books first thing in the morning?

57
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,636
Seung-hyo.

58
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,846
You like romance comics?

59
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,226
You're such a romantic.

60
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,146
Yes, a little bit.

61
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,648
Right.

62
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,108
-Hey, Seung-hyo.
-Yeah?

63
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,528
You missed a button on your shirt.

64
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,291
Seriously? Are you a kid?
You can't even button your shirt right.

65
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,084
-Come here.
-You're right.

66
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,670
-Why are you so clumsy?
-Gosh, how did this happen?

67
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,130
What a dumb mistake.

68
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,465
Mom! He asked if you had fun on your trip.

69
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,092
Ask your father.

70
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,844
What? Did you do something wrong?

71
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,638
No, she just wants to pick a fight.

72
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,723
Dad, just leave him.

73
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,142
-You didn't touch the soup. Seung-hyo!
-Yeah?

74
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,685
Go home and get your parents.

75
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,894
-We'll eat this.
-Okay.

76
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,521
Hey, go! Hurry.

77
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,398
-Yeah, do the rest.
-Okay.

78
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,735
"Princess" Volume 20 is out!

79
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,740
We had no food at home,
so we were about to order out.

80
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,450
-Thanks for the meal.
-Sure.

81
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,870
We feel so bad.
You didn't even get a chance to rest yet.

82
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,747
-Gosh.
-It's fine with me.

83
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,583
But I don't know
about my hungover husband.

84
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,711
They say you shouldn't even
disturb dogs when they eat.

85
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,048
By the way, gomtang
is pretty good for hangovers.

86
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,591
Yeah, it's great.

87
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,134
How was the trip?

88
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,970
It was nice. It really lifted our spirits.

89
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
-Right, honey?
-Yeah.

90
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,141
You two should come with us next time.

91
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,642
Us two?

92
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,103
Goodness, we can't take just these two.

93
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,397
We need to make it
more lively and fruitful first.

94
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,523
What?

95
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,651
She means we should get the kids married
and all take a trip together.

96
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,653
Married?

97
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,654
-Yeah.
-What?

98
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,699
Hye-suk and I agreed
to find spouses for them.

99
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,245
That's so silly.
Did you sign a blood oath or something?

100
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,041
Honey, find someone suitable
at the hospital too.

101
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,667
-Right!
-Okay.

102
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,544
-Okay?
-I bet there aren't any.

103
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,465
I doubt there's anyone
who'd marry Seok-ryu.

104
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,885
Hey, Seung-hyo! You can't say that.

105
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,678
You ungrateful little brat.

106
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,473
-Why are you criticizing my daughter?
-Yeah.

107
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,810
I didn't think you were like that.
I'm upset.

108
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
-That's not what I meant.
-It's okay.

109
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,523
There's no woman who can put up
with his personality either.

110
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,233
Why would you say…

111
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,652
Seok-ryu, what's wrong
with Seung-hyo's personality?

112
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,195
Yeah, he's neat and polite.

113
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,072
He's nice since he takes after me.

114
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,199
I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.

115
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,744
This is how we usually get along.
We make fun of each other.

116
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,412
Yes.

117
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,208
We're always teasing
and dissing each other like this.

118
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,584
I see.

119
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,628
So that's what it was?

120
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,796
Hey. That's right.

121
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,340
We'll end up feuding
if we fight over our kids. Let's eat.

122
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,716
Okay.

123
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,426
Thank you for the meal.

124
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,388
Gosh, I was so flustered.

125
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,353
Wow.

126
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,148
I thought I'd suffocate to death.

127
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:26,195
I was so nervous I could barely eat.

128
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,741
Well, we got through it,
so let's try harder from now on.

129
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,203
Hey, let's just be honest instead
and tell them we're dating.

130
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,413
No.

131
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,748
Things aren't good right now.

132
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,127
My engagement was called off.

133
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,839
And it hasn't been long
since Hyeon-jun came by.

134
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,718
It'll seem
like I don't take things seriously.

135
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,764
So I guess you have
pretty serious feelings for me?

136
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,641
Jeez, how can you joke right now?

137
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,810
Look, you don't have to worry about that.

138
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,271
I can explain everything really well.

139
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,152
No, it's not just that.

140
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,782
It's going to get
really uncomfortable and annoying.

141
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,953
I mean, if my parents
find out we're dating,

142
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,039
then you can't come
in my room like this.

143
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,124
-What?
-Think about it.

144
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,877
They'll ask what, when,
where, why, and how.

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,546
They'll watch our every move.

146
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,841
They'll impose curfews again.

147
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,968
They'll be scanning
the neighborhood 24 hours a day.

148
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,304
If that happens,

149
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,974
we'll have to have a very wholesome,
innocent, and nice relationship

150
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,392
like little kids.

151
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,812
Let's keep it a secret.
Yeah, let's be strict about it.

152
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,272
We must never get caught.

153
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,608
That's what I'm saying.

154
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,620
Did you do well?

155
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,372
Hey, what are you doing?

156
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,415
Hey, we're in the middle of the street!

157
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,377
-Did you do well?
-Totally.

158
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,094
You're pretty from this side too.

159
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,201
-Okay!
-Okay!

160
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,873
You can do it!

161
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,479
-Let's check out the first floor.
-Let's go!

162
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,566
-There's a claw machine too.
-I love it! Let's try them all.

163
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,321
LOVE

164
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,871
What do I do with all of these?

165
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,457
Should I open group buying again?

166
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,086
No, I haven't promoted enough.

167
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,047
Short-form videos are the trend,

168
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,090
so I'll post one of me
taking it and working out.

169
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,018
Dong-jin, come eat some melon!

170
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,562
Jeez, Mom.
Melon's not important right now.

171
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,273
-I don't want any!
-Then don't, you punk!

172
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,733
I'll eat it all.

173
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,235
Is that punk going to drink
only protein forever?

174
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,075
That brat.

175
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,328
She didn't post any pictures of scenery.
They're all of herself.

176
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,414
Gosh, Hye-suk!
Your pictures came out great.

177
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,377
Wow, look at that figure!
You're like a model.

178
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,464
Yeah, change your profile picture.
It's your best photo ever.

179
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,967
You think so?
I didn't think they did me any justice.

180
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,552
They look better than you in person.

181
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,431
Jeez.

182
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,726
We both went on the trip,
but I don't have a single picture to post.

183
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,522
Are you still going on
about pictures? Good grief.

184
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,566
I'd have to take 100 pictures
to even get one that's decent.

185
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,653
You didn't care if my eyes were open
or if my hair was covering my face.

186
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,654
You didn't even look.

187
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,573
I'm sorry, Mi-suk.
I was wrong, so let's stop.

188
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,325
I think my ears are bleeding.

189
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,702
Look at this. Look at that composition.

190
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,871
He took it from below,
so she looks like a model.

191
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,997
I'm going crazy.

192
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,917
Hey, you punk!
Come and eat some damn melon!

193
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,169
-Just like this.
-What are you doing?

194
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,346
Are you in a staring contest
with broccoli?

195
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,305
Yeah.

196
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,976
Beans, spinach, and eggplants.

197
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,937
I'm in a war of nerves
with food I hate the most.

198
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,023
If you hate them so much,
why did you buy them?

199
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:17,319
My mom says they're good for your health
and keeps trying to make me eat these.

200
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,322
So you're going to buy and get rid
of all the vegetables in the world?

201
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm developing recipes to try
and make them taste good.

202
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,664
You know when athletes
come up with their own moves,

203
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,499
and the moves are named after them?

204
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,754
Yeah, like Kim Yuna's Yuna Spin
and Yeo Hong-chul's Yeo 1 and Yeo 2.

205
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,049
Yeah, so I'm thinking of making
my own signature dish.

206
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,343
So what do you plan on making?

207
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,554
Broccoli and chicken risotto!

208
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:48,017
Yikes. Just hearing it
sounds like the worst combination.

209
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,935
A little bit, right?

210
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,068
Hey, this kitchen is a sacred area.
What are you doing?

211
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,237
Should I stop?

212
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,449
No, keep going.

213
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,536
Why is the light on here?
Is someone in there?

214
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,253
Goodness gracious,
you need to turn these off right away.

215
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,256
Goodness, the lights are on here too.

216
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,218
Young people these days
don't know how to conserve…

217
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,344
What's this?

218
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,888
What is all this?

219
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,641
Mushrooms, spinach, and celery.

220
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,559
Hey, these are going to spoil!

221
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,520
You should put these in the fridge!

222
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,939
Good grief.

223
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:39,777
Jeez. For crying out loud.

224
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,708
You said no one's here at night.

225
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,961
He probably came to get something.

226
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,171
He's always forgetful.

227
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,090
How much longer do we have to wait?

228
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,968
My exam's in two days.
I have to prepare for it.

229
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,679
You should've prepared in advance then.

230
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,931
What? You don't think you'll pass?

231
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,643
The written test was easy.
I'm worried about the practical exam.

232
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,313
They said less than 30% pass.

233
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,275
Are you giving excuses
in case you fail?

234
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,696
Hey, there are three things
that don't exist in my life.

235
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,198
Flunking, failing, and rejection.

236
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,741
All right, then.

237
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,578
Stop standing there like that
and come here.

238
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,122
Hiding and concealing.

239
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,875
My life's a roller coaster these days.

240
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,960
I like it. It's exciting.

241
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,256
You're the one who wanted
to tell the world that we're dating.

242
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,049
It seems you're enjoying this now.

243
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,468
The fun has yet to begin.

244
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,438
There's no end to the fun.

245
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,627
Hurry, you'll be late for work.

246
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,088
-Hello.
-Yeon-du!

247
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,550
-Mrs. Do!
-Yeon-du!

248
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,178
Yeon-du, did you miss me?

249
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,554
I did.

250
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,389
Me too.

251
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:37,311
Goodness, you look so pretty today.

252
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:42,858
Dan-ho, can't you just
let us take care of Yeon-du?

253
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,027
I'll watch over her well.

254
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,112
Thank you for the words,
but that's okay.

255
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,739
Her new babysitter's coming next week.

256
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,284
But I could help you until then.

257
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,786
It's really okay.

258
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,288
If I kept imposing like that,

259
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,540
I'd feel very uncomfortable about it.

260
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,834
Yeon-du.

261
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,046
You're not imposing at all, though.

262
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,590
-We'll get going.
-All right.

263
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,635
-Bye, Yeon-du!
-Bye.

264
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,554
Have a nice day, Mrs. Do.

265
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,433
-Bye, Yeon-du.
-Bye, Mo-eum.

266
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,353
This won't do.

267
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,982
I must have a granddaughter.

268
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,275
Okay, ask your older daughter for a third.

269
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,528
Hey, go on a blind date.

270
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,239
Okay, ask your older daughter to…

271
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,074
I don't think she should do that.

272
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,784
It's a great opportunity.

273
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,537
I thought of asking Seok-ryu,
but it'd be a waste to miss out,

274
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,496
so you should go.

275
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,583
Seok-ryu will never go.
Of course, neither will I.

276
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,919
Why not? Why won't you go?

277
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,338
Is there someone you already like?

278
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,215
Wait.

279
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,011
Wait! You do have someone!
Who is it? Someone from work?

280
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:52,970
-Mother.
-What?

281
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,430
-I'll get going.
-Okay, but…

282
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,931
Hey! Who is it?

283
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
Hey, tell me! Mo-eum!

284
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
What's wrong, Yeon-du?

285
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,279
You suddenly don't want to go
to kindergarten?

286
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,989
No, I don't.

287
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:16,326
If I go, I'll have to wait until evening
for you to come and pick me up.

288
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:23,125
-How about I pick you up earlier instead?
-I don't want that either.

289
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,587
Then, you won't be able
to work because of me.

290
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,676
It breaks my heart
to keep you there all day too.

291
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,890
But couldn't you understand
for just a little while?

292
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,768
Can't I stay at Mo-eum's house?

293
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,146
I like it there.

294
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,982
Mrs. Do makes me yummy food.

295
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,943
And Mo-eum always plays with me.

296
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,322
I'll play with you and make it more fun.

297
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,160
How about we go bike riding
at the Han River this weekend?

298
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,246
-Really?
-Yeah.

299
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,166
So let's go to kindergarten, okay?

300
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:42,788
Students, please don't touch
the ingredients.

301
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,374
Just examine them with your eyes.

302
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,293
See if anything's missing
or if you need more of it.

303
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,087
Please check now.

304
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,799
We won't fulfill any requests
once the exam has started.

305
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,051
Any questions?

306
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,469
Then, we'll start the exam.

307
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,935
NATIONAL TECHNICAL QUALIFICATION
PRACTICAL EXAM

308
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,845
-Are you eating that again?
-Yeah.

309
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,231
-Are you seeing someone? Right?
-Yeah. What?

310
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:56,153
I mean, you used to
eat lunch slowly like a French noble.

311
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,113
Now, you've only eaten this for days.

312
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,869
And you leave work exactly at 6:00 pm.
It's suspicious. It's not like you at all.

313
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:08,874
That's because I want to have
more of a life at night now.

314
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,419
Also, everything
is already mixed together here,

315
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,962
so I can save time.

316
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,506
And most importantly, it's good.

317
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,180
You know me. Once I'm hooked
on something, I stick with it.

318
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,266
Yeah, that is true.

319
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,311
Should I try that too?

320
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,771
Yeah, go ahead. Try some.

321
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,399
Which one should I pick?

322
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,780
The bulgogi one is good
if you can't eat spicy food.

323
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,490
Bulgogi? Okay.

324
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,744
Goodness, there's a spoon too.

325
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,504
Choisseung! What are you doing here?

326
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,507
What do you think?
I'm here to congratulate my girlfriend.

327
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,217
Here.

328
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,013
The results aren't even out yet.
Why are you congratulating me?

329
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,515
What's with the bouquet?

330
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,727
Unlike you, I believe the process
is more important than the result.

331
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,354
I'll kill you.

332
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,816
Even if you killed me,
that would be a happy ending too.

333
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,069
It feels like you're becoming
more and more naughty.

334
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,905
What? I'm updating
my firmware to boyfriend mode.

335
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,824
The newest version includes flowers.

336
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,575
You talk so smoothly.

337
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,577
I'll let it slide
since the flowers are pretty.

338
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,125
-You're prettier.
-Don't push it.

339
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,545
I can't tell you apart from the flowers.
It's so confusing.

340
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,714
Stop or I'll factory reset you.

341
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,799
No, I don't want that. I'll stop.

342
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:48,724
Hey!

343
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,727
It's been a while.

344
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811
Yeah.

345
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,314
Did you go somewhere?

346
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,815
A business trip.

347
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,067
I have to go straight to work,
so excuse me.

348
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,195
I can't believe you have to go
to work on such a nice day.

349
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,781
This is why it's bad
to be tied down by a job.

350
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,950
Look at me. I'm so free and happy.

351
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,328
It must be nice to be unaffiliated
and unemployed.

352
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,871
I'm not unemployed anymore.

353
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,081
I've started on new work too.

354
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,625
This is a product I'm selling.

355
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,627
-I'll give one to you.
-No, thanks.

356
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,212
Don't refuse. Just take it.

357
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,299
-I said it was fine.
-I'll get that for you.

358
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,803
By the way, you work here?

359
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,555
This is my friend's company.

360
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,933
Who? Mr. Yoon?

361
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,810
No, his name's Choi Seung-hyo.

362
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,688
-Seung-hyo!
-Hi, Dong-jin.

363
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,398
Gosh, did I get something on me?

364
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,608
Why are you so sloppy?

365
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,152
-You're here too?
-What?

366
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,112
I knew you couldn't be nice forever.

367
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,614
You're dead when I get home.

368
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,450
But what's with the flowers?

369
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,786
-They're mine.
-They're his.

370
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,245
A client gave them to me.

371
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,081
-But she stole them.
-I held them for him.

372
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,666
Your stealing flowers from people now?

373
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,045
Don't worry. I'll tell my mom on her.

374
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,339
No, you don't have to do that.

375
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,633
Mom? Sister?

376
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,136
Wait. Are you two siblings?

377
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,014
Yes, I'm embarrassed to say
he's my younger brother.

378
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,684
But how do you two know each other?

379
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,728
She goes to my old gym.

380
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,854
I see.

381
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,524
Who knew we'd be connected like this?

382
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,985
Is the world that small,
or is this fate?

383
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,864
Seung-hyo, since I'm here,
can you show me around your office?

384
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:32,035
What? Sure. Do you want to see?

385
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:39,126
Wow, it's so nice. It's so cool.
It looks so expensive.

386
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,419
Why did you bring him here?

387
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,547
What else could I do?
I couldn't tell him to leave.

388
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,923
Why not? Hey!

389
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,967
Go! If you're done looking, get out!

390
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,927
Is this your company?
He didn't say anything.

391
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,305
-Why are you telling me to go?
-He wants you to leave too.

392
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,306
Excuse me?

393
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,060
You said you were selling this, right?

394
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,313
Did you know this caused a stir
on social media recently?

395
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,985
This is a very popular item
that's really hard to get your hands on.

396
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,737
But you got one thanks
to your connections.

397
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,614
Are you kidding? He didn't give me any.

398
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,241
That's not what I meant.

399
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,661
It caused a stir,
because it was moldy protein.

400
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,329
You didn't know?

401
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,372
What?

402
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,918
That can't be possible.

403
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,263
Mom!

404
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,308
What's going on?
Why are you dragging him by the ear?

405
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,435
Dad's here too. Mom, Dad.

406
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,979
This punk messed up again.

407
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,359
Mom, I told you not to lend him money.
But you did, didn't you?

408
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,486
Not only did he lose all of that money,

409
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,905
but he could get sued too.

410
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,156
Sued?

411
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,283
You know those boxes in his room?

412
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,534
I wondered what they were.

413
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,705
He's been selling moldy protein
that hasn't been approved by the MFD.

414
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,540
What? Mold?

415
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,504
What are we going to do with this bum?

416
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,216
Hey, you punk!

417
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,802
I should've disowned you a long time ago.

418
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,305
But I've put up with you
because of your mother, you punk!

419
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,932
Is that true?

420
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:21,061
-I didn't know either.
-Hey.

421
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,772
Not knowing doesn't fix anything.

422
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,565
Let's try to deal with this first.

423
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,651
How many did you sell?

424
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,112
Tell me! How many did you sell?

425
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,366
Ten.

426
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,952
For all that big talk,
it's a pretty modest number.

427
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,371
No, it's for the best.

428
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,956
Before this gets out of hand,

429
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,209
call the buyers and apologize.

430
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,377
Refund all of their money.

431
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,464
-Okay.
-Good grief.

432
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,840
That little…

433
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,343
I'm the one who was scammed.

434
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:59,391
Even after being deceived
for over a decade, I thought to myself,

435
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,561
"Things will work out this time."

436
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,272
"He'll do well this time."

437
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,067
"He's in his thirties and jobless,
but I can't be too harsh."

438
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,902
"What if he goes astray?"

439
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,490
"Still, he's got a good heart
and he's my son, so I should trust him."

440
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,786
But I've reached my limits now.

441
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,373
If you have eyes, go out and take a look.

442
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,583
Go see how hard people work.

443
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,920
But what about you?

444
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,923
Did you think making money off
of others would be easy?

445
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,552
How could you be so careless
and sell a product without checking,

446
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,804
especially one
that's meant to be consumed?

447
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,889
You're hopeless.

448
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:44,894
The way you think
has already become completely corrupt.

449
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,981
No, it's not.

450
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,569
I really wanted to do well this time.

451
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,946
I know it too.

452
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,699
I know I'm a burden on you both.

453
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,534
I'm not smart,

454
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,370
I didn't study well like Seok-ryu,
and I'm weak-willed.

455
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,582
I know you never expected
anything from me.

456
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,083
I know that too.

457
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,545
That's why I hated being a nobody.

458
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,214
I wanted to succeed!

459
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,217
I wanted to make a lot of money
to buy Mom a nice bag

460
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,844
and buy Dad a new car!

461
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,637
Me too!

462
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,478
I wanted to be special too.

463
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,776
Hey, Dong-jin.

464
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,199
Goodness.

465
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,008
Hey, Dan-ho.

466
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,349
Let's at least still greet each other.

467
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,019
I did greet you.

468
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,938
Not something formal like that nod.

469
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,274
You know, "How was your day today?"

470
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,528
"How have you been?"
Nice greetings like those.

471
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,322
I'm not going to do that anymore.

472
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,448
Wow.

473
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,450
That's so cheap.

474
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:27,038
I have something for you though. Ta-da.

475
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,873
Here, take it.

476
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:44,597
I kept going back to what you said
at the campgrounds.

477
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,560
No, we can't. Never.

478
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,605
Yeon-du can't become your daughter.

479
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,482
And what happened that day was a mistake.

480
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,651
It has to be.

481
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,571
Why?

482
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,825
Because it can't happen.

483
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,327
But…

484
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,914
doesn't it sound awkward?

485
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,709
What do you mean?

486
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,586
I told you I liked you,

487
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,089
and you said it was something
that can't happen.

488
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,761
You didn't say you didn't like me.

489
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,179
I don't like you.

490
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,307
-What?
-You said you liked me.

491
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,101
So there was no need to be harsh.
I was being indirect.

492
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,229
You're putting me in a tough spot.

493
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,732
Then, what was that?

494
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,277
All of those ointments you gave me.

495
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:45,241
Wasn't that big bag your way
of showing how you felt about me?

496
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,826
You read too much into it.

497
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,662
The ointment was just ointment.

498
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,165
I see.

499
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,543
So that's what it was.

500
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,629
Still, take this
since I'm embarrassed.

501
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,136
Well, then. I'll get going.

502
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,473
I forgot. We're going
in the same direction.

503
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,602
I'll go first.

504
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,481
Take your time.

505
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,410
There are so many things
I have to stop liking now.

506
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,209
This is bad.

507
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:46,928
Come in.

508
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,558
Are you busy?

509
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,644
No, I was finishing up
a dissertation I'd been reading.

510
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,441
Is it important?

511
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,654
Not really. Reading it is just a habit.

512
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,824
-What is it? Did you need something?
-No.

513
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,451
I was just seeing what you were up to.

514
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,662
Wow.

515
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,291
I didn't know you had so many books here.

516
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,835
The window is huge too.

517
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,044
Yeah.

518
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,718
But don't you think this bed is too small?

519
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,344
I bet it's uncomfortable.

520
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,638
Since I sleep alone,
so a full-size bed is enough.

521
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,725
I sleep alone on a queen-size bed.

522
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,605
So I was wondering.

523
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,357
How about coming back
into the master bedroom?

524
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,359
What?

525
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,445
-You don't want to?
-No, I want to!

526
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,572
Goodness!

527
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,952
Gyeong-jong!

528
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,997
Gyeong-jong, wait for me.

529
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,957
Yes, I'm sorry.

530
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,668
I'll refund your money right away. Okay.

531
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,506
What do you want?

532
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,092
Why are you entering my room
without knocking?

533
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,970
You can do the same.

534
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,391
You once hung a sign on your door
saying you'd kill me if I came in.

535
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,811
-Because I hated you.
-Now, you're just openly saying that?

536
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,399
I thought Mom loved you more.

537
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,278
No matter how hard I tried
to be number one in things,

538
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,156
you were always number one to her.

539
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,324
No, I wasn't.

540
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,743
You were her everything.

541
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,870
She adored and was proud of only you.

542
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,664
You were the reason why she lived.

543
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,541
It's all pointless.

544
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,627
Hey, Dong-jin.

545
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,045
What?

546
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,256
I've lived for 13 months longer than you,
so I'm speaking from experience.

547
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,885
Not everyone can be special.

548
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,473
Most people just live ordinary lives.

549
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,017
And the same goes for me.

550
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,815
So don't be too obsessed
with becoming someone great.

551
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,780
Just find what's valuable
to you in your life.

552
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,949
That's more than enough.

553
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,452
Take it from someone
who's been sick before.

554
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,372
That's so cheap.
You used your illness while lecturing me.

555
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,667
While I'm at it, here's one more thing.

556
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,130
I'm telling you since it seems
like you don't know,

557
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,382
but you're not weak-willed.

558
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,384
What?

559
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,262
You'd fight me to the death
over drumsticks.

560
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,390
Whenever we went to buffets,
you ate all the food and left devastation,

561
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,766
like a swarm of locusts.

562
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,186
But you survived a year
on just protein shakes and chicken breast.

563
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,690
That's what will is.

564
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,572
It was nice to see you work as a trainer
since you seemed so dedicated.

565
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,161
I wasn't a trainer.
I was working to be one.

566
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,831
So why did you fail the exam?

567
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,750
You should've worked harder.

568
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,252
You just said I did work hard.

569
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,588
-But all you did was just try.
-What are you doing?

570
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,757
Everyone tries.
You should've done better.

571
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,759
-It's Seok-ryu.
-I wanted to pass too.

572
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,470
-She's with Dong-jin.
-What about Dong-jin?

573
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,638
-You think I want to be dumb?
-What are you doing?

574
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,765
-Be quiet.
-What?

575
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,328
What's wrong? Did you fail?

576
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:46,375
Hey, that's okay.
You can always take it again.

577
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,171
You can't just pass things
like that on the first try.

578
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,299
You won't seem human.
You're already like a fairy as it is.

579
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,634
From now on,

580
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,138
just call me Tinker Bell.

581
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,641
What?

582
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,477
Well,

583
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,940
this fairy passed the exam
on her first try!

584
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,694
I got my Korean Food
Craftsman certificate!

585
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,613
Holy cow!

586
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,657
Hey! That's insane!

587
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,909
Wait right there! I'm coming over.

588
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,327
Wow!

589
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,621
Hey, that's not a door! You'll get hurt!

590
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,249
This won't work. I'll go around.

591
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,292
I'll see you later.

592
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,963
Go!

593
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,881
What's with him?

594
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,356
Did anyone follow you?

595
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,400
Am I in Hyereung-dong or Hawaii?

596
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,987
Don't you think
that makes you look more suspicious?

597
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,031
We should be more careful
around the neighborhood.

598
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,453
You and I have
been hanging out together for decades.

599
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,623
We could be hugging each other,

600
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,168
and no one would find it strange.

601
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,714
That's true.

602
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,639
Hey! What if someone sees us?

603
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,932
I told you.

604
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,310
No one will find it strange.

605
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,233
Congratulations.

606
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,528
You passed on your first try.
That's so like you.

607
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,614
I really am happy.

608
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:44,202
Much more than when I got into college
or when I got hired by Greip.

609
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,708
I'm happy that you're happy.

610
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:54,295
Now that I have my certificate,

611
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,505
I'm going to prepare for real and start.

612
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,299
I'll look for a job too.

613
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,594
You have to be careful in the kitchen
when you start working.

614
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,263
Water, fire, and knives.

615
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,016
Other men.

616
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,602
I'll think about the last one.

617
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,480
Men who cook have nice forearm muscles.

618
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,065
Unbelievable.

619
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,237
Architects have better forearms, you know.

620
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,865
Wow, you're right! What on earth?

621
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,034
Your veins are popping out.

622
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,119
Take a look. Look at these tendons.

623
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,746
Yeah, I'm looking.

624
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,873
Look at my adductors and abductors.

625
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,214
Goodness. Great work today.

626
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,633
You too. Rest up. We'll see you tomorrow.

627
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,552
-Okay.
-What's with the suit, Ms. Jung?

628
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,096
Where are you going now?

629
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,891
I'm going somewhere. Bye.

630
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,105
Jeez, why are you so clueless?

631
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,064
What did I do?

632
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:58,609
Look at the color of her clothes.
She's in mourning.

633
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:04,323
THE LATE YEO JU-EUN

634
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,616
Hi, Ju-eun.

635
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,451
I'm here.

636
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,745
It's been a while, right?

637
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,375
Well, life's been so hectic.

638
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,337
No.

639
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,008
To be honest, that's an excuse.

640
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,968
I just…

641
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,971
kind of…

642
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,520
forgot about you.

643
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,691
THE LATE YEO JU-EUN

644
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:42,945
NOVEMBER 20, 1988 - AUGUST 2, 2021

645
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,822
You said there still could be kids inside.

646
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:52,580
And I still vividly remember
how you ran into that building.

647
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,877
Whenever I think about that,

648
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,674
I have a really tough time.

649
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,767
Right. We're the same age now.

650
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,146
I'll be older than you next year,
so I'm going to speak casually.

651
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,316
I'll get going.

652
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,528
I'll come back again.

653
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,736
Yeon-du.

654
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,405
Say hi.

655
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,700
Hello,

656
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,828
Mom.

657
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,377
Hello,

658
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,630
Dad.

659
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,681
THE LATE KANG IN-HO, SEO JI-YEON

660
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,392
Mom.

661
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,352
Dad.

662
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,688
THE LATE KANG DONG-JU, LEE MI-JEONG

663
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,730
Ji-yeon.

664
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,150
THE LATE KANG IN-HO, SEO JI-YEON

665
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,067
And In-ho.

666
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,738
Have you all been well?

667
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,743
Yeon-du's grown a lot, hasn't she?

668
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,539
She's taller now and put more weight on.

669
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,876
She eats her carrots and paprika now too.

670
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,047
I know the alphabet too.

671
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,632
That's right.

672
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,344
She sings the alphabet song so well.

673
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,515
So don't worry about Yeon-du.

674
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,729
I'll always stay by her side.

675
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,774
I learned…

676
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,820
how to fold origami flowers.

677
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,783
I brought these for you, Mom and Dad.

678
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,912
Dad already…

679
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:45,461
I mean, Uncle Dan-ho already got one.

680
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:51,383
Want to put it on
your mom and dad yourself?

681
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,651
We'll visit again.

682
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,570
Goodbye.

683
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,732
I didn't know I'd run into you here.

684
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,405
My first mentor was laid to rest here.

685
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,287
There was a fire at a school gym.

686
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,957
She went in to help.

687
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,919
She saved the day
and went to Heaven by herself.

688
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,129
She's so cheap.

689
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,215
I bet that was hard.

690
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,098
I bet it was harder for you.

691
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,519
I'm sorry I eavesdropped.

692
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,150
It happened so suddenly.

693
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,695
It was a family trip.

694
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,324
I had to cover a story last minute,
so I promised to join them after.

695
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,284
But…

696
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,789
Is this her?

697
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:47,958
Yes.

698
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,461
She's my sister-in-law.

699
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,324
Sir.

700
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,496
There's a child!

701
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,040
Where is she?

702
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,502
She's my niece.

703
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,547
She's still so young.

704
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,050
Sir…

705
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,097
They said my sister-in-law

706
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,933
had held onto Yeon-du until the end.

707
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,603
It's just Yeon-du and me now.

708
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,816
Is that why you decided…

709
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,777
to become her dad?

710
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,696
Yes.

711
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,827
To me, Yeon-du was a miracle.

712
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,871
But I guess she wasn't to others.

713
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,250
Our old neighborhood

714
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,003
was a place where our family
had lived for a long time.

715
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,341
But one day, a strange rumor
started to go around at her daycare.

716
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,263
She was the only one to survive
at the expense of her parents.

717
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,391
What? How could anyone say that?

718
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,857
Before Yeon-du could figure out
what that meant, I got us out of there.

719
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,984
We came to Hyereung-dong.

720
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,825
Would you like a hug?

721
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,457
I really want to comfort you right now.

722
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,335
But I don't know any moving words to say.

723
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,217
You must've been so lonely
this whole time.

724
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,804
-So I want to hug you.
-No.

725
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,558
I don't think we should.

726
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,894
Why not?

727
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,355
Because you still don't like me?

728
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,027
Because it still can't happen.

729
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,932
RESUME

APPLICATION SUBMITTED

735
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,872
Knock, knock. Mr. Choi.

736
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,416
-A letter came for you.
-What letter?

737
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,085
"This letter originated in England."

738
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,420
"Send this to seven people
or you'll have bad luck."

739
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,799
-The invitation to Architecture's Night.
-Right. It's around this time every year.

740
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,716
Yeah.

741
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,469
Are we allowed to bring
a plus one this year too?

742
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,430
I knew it. You have someone to bring.

743
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,473
I called it.

744
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,060
-Well, I didn't exactly say that.
-Bring her. You'd better bring her.

745
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:38,230
It's your chance to show off
how amazing you are.

746
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,898
Would that be necessary?

747
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,191
I'm always amazing.

748
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,402
Gosh, you're always so quick and smart.

749
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,071
But you'll be
even more amazing this time. Why?

750
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,615
The Jayeong-dong restaurant
you designed last year

751
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,035
was selected by architects
as Architecture of the Year.

752
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,036
Really?

753
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,664
You've won so many awards
you're not even happy.

754
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,873
This is no fun. I'm leaving.

755
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,083
I'm going home.

756
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,501
Okay, bye.

757
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,424
By the way, Seung-hyo…

758
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,217
Yeah?

759
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,137
I must've sat for too long.
I was feeling stiff.

760
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,099
Yeah, sure. You know what? Never mind.
Just continue what you were doing.

761
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,809
You look so healthy.

762
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,811
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

763
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,403
Holy cow!

764
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,662
Now, based on what we've practiced,

765
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,664
let's write down your favorite quotes.

766
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,625
-Okay!
-Okay!

767
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,461
Let me see…

768
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:58,310
HAPPY FAMILY, HAPPY LIFE

769
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,565
"Wander alone like a cow." Right.

770
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,317
That suits you perfectly, Jae-suk.

771
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,238
Come to think of it, you resemble a cow.

772
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,032
-Moo.
-Wow.

773
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,992
Your eyes are as clear as a calf's.

774
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,453
-Look at me.
-Seriously?

775
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,623
-Hey, girls.
-I do have pretty eyes.

776
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,375
Hey, girls. Listen.

777
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,087
It's not a cow.
It's supposed to be a rhinoceros.

778
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,756
That expression is from Buddhist text.

779
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,549
Stop trying to show off again, you brat!

780
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,636
You wrote in French at the temple,
and you're doing it again?

781
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,059
I don't even want to know!

782
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,352
Madame, be quiet!

783
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,269
I swear.

784
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,313
Hey. What did you write, In-suk?

785
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,858
"You were born to pass."

786
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,236
I'm going to put it on Ki-hoon's wall.

787
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,738
Now, that's love.

788
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,367
-That was so fun.
-Wow.

789
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,286
Look at what's posted on the wall.
There are so many courses.

790
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,204
Yeah.

791
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,415
Let's take another one together next time.

792
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,583
Yeah, Spanish class sounds good.

793
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,335
Art history class seems good too.

794
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,545
And coding class sounds fun.

795
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,714
-Wow.
-Jeez, you take that.

796
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,798
Hey, how about yoga?

797
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,383
Hey, ukulele class. That sounds good.

798
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,802
-You take that.
-They all sound good.

799
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,638
Hey, it's so nice
now that Hye-suk's retired.

800
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,682
We can hang out like this all the time.

801
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,809
I did live a busy life before.

802
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,520
-I'm going to enjoy my time now.
-Really?

803
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,772
Then, in that case, let's go on a trip.

804
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,065
-What?
-A trip?

805
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,985
-Yeah.
-I already went to Seoraksan with her.

806
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,612
Not for just you two.
A trip with all four of us.

807
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,448
Let's go abroad.

808
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,741
-Abroad?
-Yeah.

809
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,326
Hey, let's go on a cruise!

810
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,203
I've wanted to go on one so badly!

811
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,622
Yeah, let's go on a cruise
around the Mediterranean.

812
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,416
That would be pretty good.

813
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,043
How much does going on a cruise cost?

814
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,587
About five to six million won?

815
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,006
Try to upgrade that idea a bit.

816
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,216
-It's that expensive?
-Let's wear dresses!

817
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,426
-Do they have parties?
-Yeah.

818
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,720
-Like the Titanic? What?
-Don't bring that up!

819
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,013
-Let's go.
-It sunk!

820
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:58,930
-Right.
-It did?

821
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,056
Did you watch the movie?

822
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:05,896
Even if I work out
The raging winds of life

823
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,522
Honey.

824
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,983
Why did you come here
instead of going home?

825
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,694
I just stopped by.

826
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:17,157
You had an arts and culture class
at the district office today. Was it fun?

827
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,074
Yeah.

828
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,452
It's lunchtime,
but there aren't any customers.

829
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,662
Well, you have days like this.

830
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,500
Hey, honey?

831
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,668
My friends want to go on a trip--

832
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,170
-Delivery!
-Hey!

833
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,047
How are you?

834
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,257
-Good. Here's your order.
-Thank you.

835
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,427
You've been ordering
less and less these days.

836
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,263
Gosh, it's been rough
because of the poor economy.

837
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,432
Has your revenue dropped
a lot too, Mr. Jo?

838
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,434
Well, I thought so too,

839
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,188
but a big chain snack shop opened
in front of Hyereung Middle School.

840
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,358
They've taken all the customers
in this neighborhood,

841
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,693
and they've been ordering a ton.

842
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,825
I shouldn't have said that.

843
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,701
I'll get going.

844
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,869
Okay, bye.

845
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,708
Honey, what were you saying?

846
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,335
No, it was nothing.

847
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,631
Gosh, why would he mention that?

848
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,602
UNFORTUNATELY, WE WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD
WITH YOUR APPLICATION AT THIS TIME

849
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,354
WE WISH YOU WELL IN YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS

850
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,322
I got hired at Kang's Restaurant!

851
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,200
Holy cow! That's a Michelin restaurant.

852
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,535
I was lucky.

853
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,287
Let's celebrate soon. It's on me!

854
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,006
Where should we meet today?

855
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,720
Well…

856
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:05,640
Even if I go on dates,
I guess I can't escape my office.

857
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,559
I'm sorry.

858
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,896
But in return, I'll give you some of this
once I'm done making it.

859
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,862
Why are you taking pictures of that?

860
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,323
I'm going to have it notarized
for when you make it big.

861
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,116
Gosh, you're a money-grubber.

862
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,411
Before then, I'll taste this first.

863
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,084
Hey. It's good.

864
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,589
I hate broccoli.

865
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,341
But I can't smell it. And it's so smooth.

866
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,552
I think it could be better.

867
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,013
It's missing something.

868
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,891
No, it's perfect now. It's really good.

869
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,186
No, aside from the oats and brown rice,

870
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,439
it needs something
to make the texture more fun.

871
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,403
Seok-ryu,

872
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,657
do you have time next week by any chance?

873
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,200
Next week? Why?

874
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,953
There's an annual event for architects.

875
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,664
-Yeah.
-And there's a building I designed.

876
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,792
They said it won
for Architecture of the Year.

877
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,419
Really? Congratulations!

878
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,504
Thanks.

879
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,798
There's an awards ceremony that night.

880
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,885
My research advisors
and fellow architects will be there.

881
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,512
-Myeong-u's coming too.
-Nice.

882
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,888
Yeah, so…

883
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,474
I wanted to go with you.

884
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,854
I don't think I can go.

885
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,273
-What?
-Well…

886
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,986
I don't think I belong there.

887
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,323
Why not?
Are you worried it'll be too awkward?

888
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,620
Or is it because you're still
not sure how we'll turn out?

889
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,622
No, it's not that.

890
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,040
Then, what is it?

891
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:58,128
I was willing to give in
and understand not telling our families.

892
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,088
But do we have to hide it from others too?

893
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:03,258
I mean, it's such a small world.

894
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,929
Even Dong-jin and Na-yun know each other.

895
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,182
Who knows where we'd run into someone?

896
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,142
So just for now…

897
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,564
Are you mad?

898
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,607
No.

899
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:23,820
I'm sorry.

900
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,450
No, I'm sorry
for suddenly raising my voice.

901
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,993
I'm not mad.

902
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,662
-Really?
-Yeah.

903
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,542
I respect your decision, so…

904
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,378
don't take what I said too seriously.

905
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,380
Okay.

906
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,136
GYM

907
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,614
What are you doing? Come on.

908
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,574
What?

909
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,585
Mr. Go, I was wrong.

910
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,302
I went on a fool's errand.

911
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,137
I wasted my time
with my head in the clouds.

912
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,106
You're not full of hot air anymore,
so it wasn't a waste of time.

913
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,067
Wipe it clean.

914
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,695
Yes, sir! I will.

915
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,457
Do it with sincerity!

916
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,959
Yes, sir!

917
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:08,091
Wow, Kang's Restaurant. It must be nice.

918
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,803
The food there is so good.

919
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,429
I can't believe it either.

920
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:17,559
But you're even more incredible, Su-jin.
You're opening your own place.

921
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,687
Well, it's why I wanted
to get the certification.

922
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:25,775
I signed a preliminary contract
with a real estate agent the other day!

923
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,944
Wow, congratulations!

924
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,029
You're all so amazing.

925
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,783
I didn't hear back
from any of the jobs I applied for.

926
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,994
Maybe it's because I'm too old.

927
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,372
Maybe it's because your resume
is too impressive.

928
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,707
-What?
-That's right.

929
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,084
If an ex-Greip employee applied
to be a kitchen porter,

930
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,544
I wouldn't hire you either.

931
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,547
It'd so be intimidating to give you work.

932
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,673
You think so?

933
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:53,678
We're just saying
that's how incredible you are.

Gosh, did you wait long?

938
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,380
-No, it's fine. Hello.
-Hi.

939
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,592
Thank you for letting us feature
your building in the magazine.

940
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:33,968
It was nothing.

941
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,638
Our restaurant won an award,
so I'm grateful.

942
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,264
It'll help with business too.

943
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,557
I hope so.

944
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,267
I'll come here to eat next time.

945
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,102
Your lasagna was so good.

946
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,897
Would you like me to make some now?

947
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,440
No, not at all.

948
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,776
You're on break.
I couldn't ask you to do that.

949
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,195
I'm making it,
because I want to taste it.

950
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,864
Then…

951
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,450
can I have some to take with me?

952
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,621
Goodness. What is all of this?

953
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,957
It's lasagna, ravioli, and gnocchi.

954
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,209
I got it from a very famous restaurant.

955
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,796
This is great. I didn't want to cook.

956
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,674
By the way, is Seok-ryu home?

957
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,133
Yeah, she's upstairs.

958
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,218
I see.

959
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,013
This is great. He's so thoughtful.

960
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,654
Wow, I can't believe
I find even this cute.

961
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,823
I must be out of my mind. I'm sure of it.

962
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:41,661
Gosh.

963
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,871
I've completely lost it.

964
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,420
Yeah, I'm insane.

965
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,859
She must've found what was missing.

What are you doing?

969
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,554
When did you get here?
Why didn't you tell me?

970
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,224
I would've cleaned up
if I knew you were coming.

971
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,518
What's this?

972
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,107
It's nothing.

973
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,401
Is this the culinary school
Hyeon-jun mentioned?

974
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,278
Why do you have this?

975
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,114
It doesn't mean anything. I just have it.

976
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,039
You say that,
but you've researched a lot.

977
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,546
Let's talk outside. My mom will hear us.

978
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,142
Are you going to leave me
to study abroad again?

979
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,312
I just looked into it just in case.

980
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,023
Right, but why would you look into it?

981
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,612
Do you know how hard it was
for me to let you go before?

982
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,199
We're finally together now,
but how could you…

983
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,828
How could you think about that
without telling me?

984
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:53,459
The time I spend with you
passes so quickly that it kills me.

985
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,922
Even being next door
feels so far away for me.

986
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,632
How could you carelessly…

987
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,095
How could you think of being apart
without even batting an eye?

988
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,638
It does bother me.

989
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,767
It's hard for me to be away from you too.

990
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,186
It's not easy. It's tough for me too.

991
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,529
Don't you think
you're being contradictory?

992
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,991
You don't want to be away from me,

993
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,828
but you looked into schools abroad
behind my back.

994
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:34,208
I wanted to let you do
whatever you wanted to do.

995
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,713
Because you're still hurting.

996
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,341
You have no choice but to be more careful.

997
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,597
So I tried to understand
when you wanted to keep us a secret.

998
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,433
I told myself I'd wait.

999
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,272
But I think I was mistaken.

1000
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,152
This is all I am to you.

1001
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,995
I was rejected
by every place I applied to.

1002
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,795
Out of all those restaurants,

1003
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,590
not a single one asked me
to come in for an interview.

1004
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:29,096
I thought, "I'm still young
since I have a dream."

1005
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,224
I wanted to start fresh.

1006
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,310
I think I was too naïve.

1007
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,395
I think…

1008
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,483
being 34 is an awkward age
to start something new.

1009
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:43,945
Also, I just got certified.

1010
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,824
I was sick too.

1011
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,829
Still, I wanted to keep cooking.

1012
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,835
I thought maybe it would be better
if I got a degree.

1013
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,671
I was looking for a breakthrough.

1014
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,801
Maybe I was avoiding the problem.

1015
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,431
Seok-ryu.

1016
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,517
I didn't want to be embarrassed
in front of you.

1017
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,021
I wanted to be confident
and graceful in front of you.

1018
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,775
That's why I declined to go to your event.

1019
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:31,951
Seok-ryu.

1020
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,913
I'm not embarrassed by you at all.

1021
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:40,668
There's no one more dedicated
and honest in life than you.

1022
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:43,838
And for me,

1023
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:47,550
I don't care what you do
or how you may appear.

1024
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:51,012
I like you just as you are.

1025
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,766
Thanks for saying that.

1026
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,727
It makes me happy.

1027
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:03,357
But I don't think that's enough for me.

1028
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,235
I…

1029
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,405
can't live off of love.

1030
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,039
I'm sorry. I'll get going.

1031
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,792
I don't want you to follow me.

1032
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,756
I just need some space for a bit.

1033
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:27,965
Just for a few days.

1034
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,010
No, just one week.

1035
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,262
Why?

1036
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,891
I won't hide away in a cave,

1037
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,727
but I'm embarrassed.

1038
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:43,564
So I just want to disappear for a while.

1039
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,983
Will you do that for me?

1040
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,417
Ms. Jung, are you okay?

1041
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,043
What?

1042
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,046
It's the reporter.

1043
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:55,177
The most determined
and firm reporter in the world.

1044
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,931
The reporter, Kang Dan-ho.

1045
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,726
-Wow!
-I think you're drunk.

1046
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,144
You should go home.

1047
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:04,979
I'll walk you.

1048
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:15,489
That's strange.

1049
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,288
You have to transform into Mudflat Man
when your glasses come off.

1050
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,748
Why are you still the same?

1051
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,460
Where's your cape?

1052
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:29,920
Where?

1053
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,548
You seem very drunk.

1054
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:34,842
I'll buy a hangover drink.

1055
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:44,060
Why are your words
and actions so inconsistent?

1056
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:50,483
Why do you act the opposite
of what you wrote?

1057
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:53,819
I mean,

1058
01:07:54,695 --> 01:08:00,910
you write your articles with righteousness
and courage like Mudflat Man.

1059
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,079
But to me,

1060
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:07,333
why do you act
like a timid and petty villain?

1061
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,345
You're right.
I'm the villain in your life.

1062
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,681
It'll be hard on you if you're with me.

1063
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,309
I won't be able to protect or rescue you.

1064
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:27,645
So things like Mudflat Man…

1065
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,858
just forget it
like a midsummer night's dream.

1066
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,238
That's funny!

1067
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,157
-Hey, Dan-ho.
-What?

1068
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:45,037
To you, do I look like a pure
and innocent heroine

1069
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:49,375
who wants to be rescued by Mudflat Man?

1070
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,255
I'll take care of myself.

1071
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:59,677
You, Mudlfat Man,
should take care of your own feelings.

1072
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,556
And this time,

1073
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,975
it's not an accident. It's intentional.

1074
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:10,521
Avoid it if you want. Damn it.

1075
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,112
Did you avoid it?

1076
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:32,877
No, put me down!

1077
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:37,089
Stop moving.
You'll fall if you keep moving like that.

1078
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,634
The Earth is spinning.

1079
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:44,430
I can feel the gravity.

1080
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,560
The ground is trembling.

1081
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:53,272
Like Baekdu Mountain…

1082
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,107
The eruption.

1083
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:03,407
Do you think there really is
a monster that lives in the crater?

1084
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,036
Where shall we go?

1085
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,081
-Put me down.
-Hello.

1086
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,708
Hello.

1087
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:13,792
By any chance…

1088
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,588
Is that Mo-eum on your back?

1089
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:24,136
Goodness. Where on earth
did you go to get drunk like this?

1090
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,764
You're such an embarrassment!

1091
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,682
Who are you?

1092
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,268
Who are… Mom?

1093
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,396
It's my mom!

1094
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,444
She wanted to be
Spider-Man when she was a kid,

1095
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,488
so she even put glue on her hands.

1096
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:46,116
Now, she's all grown up
and putting shame on my face.

1097
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,455
Pew, pew!

1098
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,501
-For crying out loud.
-Pew.

1099
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,881
-Why are you so drunk?
-That hurts.

1100
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,218
Dan-ho, thank you.

1101
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,345
I'm sorry.

1102
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,555
I didn't raise my daughter right.

1103
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,017
I wonder who on earth
would take this reckless girl.

1104
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,186
You raised her very well.

1105
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,439
Also,

1106
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,692
I'd like to take Mo-eum.

1107
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,571
Excuse me? What do you mean?

1108
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,699
I know she's too good for me.

1109
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,200
I know you'll worry too.

1110
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,287
So I tried all I could
to cut ties with her…

1111
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,456
but I don't think I can anymore.

1112
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,042
Dan-ho.

1113
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:18,625
I miss you, Seok-ryu.

1114
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,757
BAE SEOK-RYU

1115
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:28,052
I just need some space for a bit.

1116
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,386
Just for a few days.

1117
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,972
No, just one week.

1118
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,850
I won't hide away in a cave,

1119
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,269
but I'm embarrassed.

1120
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:40,856
So I just want to disappear for a while.

1121
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,442
Will you do that for me?

1122
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,002
It's not good.

1123
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,477
This is bad too.

1124
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:21,897
Why is everything awful?

1125
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:42,978
What are you doing?

1126
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:48,734
Along with the moldy protein,
I'm throwing out my pathetic past.

1127
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,320
You're paying a steep price.

1128
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,197
You better pay Mom back.

1129
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,407
I'm going to pay her back
as soon as I get paid.

1130
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,368
I'm working at the gym again.

1131
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,412
I'm going to take
the certification exam too.

1132
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,788
Really?

1133
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,540
What's gotten into you?

1134
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,669
I felt something after what you said.

1135
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:12,549
I thought really hard
about why I was so delusional.

1136
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:14,593
And…

1137
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,138
it was all because I felt inferior.

1138
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,767
I felt small and embarrassed,

1139
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,061
so I didn't listen
and resisted for nothing.

1140
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:25,938
I wanted to do better than you too.

1141
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,733
But we're family.
None of that's important.

1142
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,864
It's so corny,
so I wasn't going to mention it.

1143
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,076
I'm going to throw these out.

1144
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,578
There we go.

1145
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,213
For the Cheongyu-dong commercial facility,

1146
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:54,049
the boundary restoration
and subdivision survey schedule is out.

1147
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,301
You'll have to go
survey the site next week.

1148
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,388
Seung-hyo?

1149
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:05,018
-Mr. Choi?
-Yeah? What?

1150
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:07,771
Sorry.

1151
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,690
What did you just say?

1152
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,321
Are things not going well
in your love life?

1153
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,909
What? Do you see cracks?
Is it about to fall apart?

1154
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,829
Are you asking
because you actually know or not?

1155
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,456
I don't know, but I want to,
so I'm asking.

1156
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:31,753
I don't think I can go
to the Architecture's Night event.

1157
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,089
What? Why not all of a sudden?

1158
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:35,716
It's just…

1159
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,344
Can't you accept the award in my place?

1160
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,764
Look, I know I'm made for the stage,

1161
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,725
but you need to accept that yourself.

1162
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:45,976
Please help me out.

1163
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,563
Also, I have to go right now.

1164
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:51,440
Can we continue this meeting later?

1165
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:52,899
Where are you going?

1166
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,234
The site at Sehyeon-dong.

1167
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:57,195
Isn't the frame construction
in the finishing stages?

1168
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,155
Yeah.

1169
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,241
-Take care.
-Bye.

1170
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,787
Darn, I've gained so much weight though.

1171
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:08,957
I better detox to accept that award.

1172
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:13,378
So the reporter wants
to work with us all day.

1173
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,672
-And he wants to stay on-site?
-Yes.

1174
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:18,592
He writes his articles
after experiencing things himself.

1175
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,969
How much work can I give him?

1176
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,138
Just let him go through the motions?

1177
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:24,222
No.

1178
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,684
He'll work just like the other workers.

1179
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,854
Just think of him
as a new, young employee.

1180
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,064
Teach him.

1181
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:33,982
I better not go easy on him.

1182
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:35,692
Bring him here.

1183
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,029
Okay.
Did the finishing materials arrive today?

1184
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:40,864
Yes, the insulation materials came in.

1185
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:42,824
We're installing them now.

1186
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,243
-I'll check since I'm here.
-Sure.

1187
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,834
SEOK-RYU

1188
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,594
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

1189
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:12,020
Seung-hyo!

1190
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,022
Seung-hyo, where are you?

1191
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,107
Over here.

1192
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:30,330
Hey.

1193
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:32,916
Why are you crying?

1194
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:37,129
Didn't someone call you
to say I wasn't hurt much?

1195
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,048
I should've just called you.

1196
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,633
I just had to sprain my right arm--

1197
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:42,634
I love you.

1198
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,347
What?

1199
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,224
I said love you.

1200
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:55,897
Seok-ryu.

1201
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,360
I was such a fool.

1202
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,197
I shouldn't have felt inferior
in the face of love.

1203
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,995
Even if I can't live off of love,

1204
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,872
it made me lose my appetite.

1205
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,000
Everything I made tasted terrible,

1206
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,295
so I couldn't practice at all.

1207
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,881
I told you not to call me,
but I kept waiting for you to call.

1208
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,632
Everything was a mess.

1209
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:25,969
And that was just today too.

1210
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,555
Do you know how scared I was?

1211
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:30,724
I almost fainted from shock!

1212
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:32,267
I almost passed out!

1213
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,061
I'm sorry.

1214
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,480
Why are you smiling?

1215
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:40,275
If you scare me like this again,
I swear I'm going to kill you!

1216
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,447
I told you I'd be happy
even if you killed me.

1217
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,948
Don't say that.

1218
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,497
Stop crying. Why are you crying?

1219
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,709
Hey, I won't get hurt. I won't die.

1220
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,048
No matter what happens to me,

1221
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:05,884
I'll always be by your side.

1222
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,596
-Got it?
-Yeah.

1223
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:11,807
So…

1224
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:15,060
say it one more time.

1225
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:16,895
What?

1226
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:20,690
Tell me you love me.

1227
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,027
I said it earlier.
Why are you asking for it again?

1228
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,407
I love you, Seok-ryu.

1229
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,205
I missed you so much,

1230
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,999
but I wanted to listen to you,
so I didn't call

1231
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,001
and waited as long as I could.

1232
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,006
As soon as I got hurt, I thought,

1233
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:50,095
"I'll be able to see Seok-ryu today."

1234
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,771
It feels unfair that there isn't
an expression better than "I love you."

1235
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,194
Because that's how much I love you.

1236
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:30,886
LOVE

1237
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:37,934
THE GREATEST HAPPINESS
IS TO LOVE OUT LOUD

1238
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:44,274
ANDRÉ GIDE

1239
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:21,311
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1240
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:23,939
You won an award for
a cooking competition. I entered for you.

1241
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,941
I'm sorry I entered it
without your permission.

1242
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:26,942
So I won an award?

1243
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,777
What about doing what you did before?

1244
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:32,155
You made cooking videos in the US.
You can start again here.

1245
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:34,032
-I'm ready.
-Then, we'll start.

1246
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,035
You can never date him!
I don't care if the sky falls!

1247
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,703
Mo-eum and I like each other.

1248
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,749
I don't know what to do.

1249
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,542
-I'm going to get married.
-With who?

1250
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,212
I have to propose.

1251
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,838
Do you know any good ways to do it?

1252
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,466
Today's the day.

1253
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,891
