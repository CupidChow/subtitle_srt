1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,910
Just wait, my baby.
I'll make it look nice for you.

3
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,300
What am I going to do now?

4
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,638
Don't worry. It'll be all gone
when you wake up tomorrow.

5
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,932
What if it's not gone?

6
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,725
Then…

7
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,312
I'll take responsibility.

8
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,399
I, Bae Seok-ryu, will take responsibility
for you, Choi Seung-hyo.

9
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,359
I promise.

10
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,903
Seal it.

11
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,741
Good. Great job.

12
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,536
PUPPY LOVE

13
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,995
Okay. Let's eat this.

14
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,592
I said I didn't need the banana milk.
Why did you buy it?

15
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,469
That was that, and this is this.

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,179
What?

17
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:23,726
What is "that"?
What do you mean by "that was that"?

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,603
What do you think? It's "that."

19
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,231
In English, it's called "that."
It's a demonstrative pronoun.

20
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,692
Yeah, I know. That's what that is.

21
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,194
But what I meant… was that…

22
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,321
Jeez.

23
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,407
This word's losing all meaning.

24
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,994
Hey.

25
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,162
What?

26
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,247
What are we now?

27
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,040
I don't know.

28
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,294
Whatever a relationship after a kiss is?

29
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,211
Hey!

30
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,380
That kiss…

31
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,133
Can you not say that word
so suddenly like that?

32
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,094
I don't kiss my friends.

33
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,763
I said stop doing that!

34
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,891
We're not kissing now. We did before.

35
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,183
No, what I meant was…

36
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,353
Stop saying that word itself.

37
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,981
-The word? Kiss?
-Stop!

38
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,613
Also, I don't do that
with my friends either.

39
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,656
Then, it's settled.

40
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,034
We're not friends anymore.

41
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,122
How can 30 years of friendship
end just like that?

42
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,542
It was the hardest thing
I've done in my life.

43
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,046
Winning an Olympic medal
would've been easier.

44
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,675
Seung-hyo! Seok-ryu!

45
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,346
-Mr. Yoon.
-What? You two already met up?

46
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,931
You were looking frantically for him.

47
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,016
I thought he owed you money
or something.

48
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,267
-Really?
-Yeah.

49
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,605
Goodness, Mr. Yoon!
When did I ever act like that?

50
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,190
-You did…
-Jeez.

51
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,484
Then, why did you come here?

52
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,363
I mean, why would you come
all the way from Seoul to see him?

53
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,114
-Well, actually--
-Hey!

54
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,824
-Hold on!
-You scared me.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,369
Do you really think
I came here to see him?

56
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,122
I just came and was in the area,
so I thought I'd call him.

57
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,832
Right.

58
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,168
Yeah, so why did you come?

59
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,921
I just came here!

60
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,006
I just came here, so I called him.

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,508
Okay, great.

62
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,511
But it's still a pretty far drive.
So what brings you here?

63
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,721
No, I'm telling you it's personal!

64
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,891
It's personal, so why do they keep asking?

65
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,228
-I didn't take him for the type.
-Wait, are you crying?

66
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,730
Did I do something wrong?

67
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,399
-I feel like I was scolded.
-Is she mad?

68
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,530
This is what I believe.

69
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,241
If you're someone who cooks,

70
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,660
you have to try food
from Gangwon Province,

71
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,705
which subtly enhances
the original taste of the ingredients.

72
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,376
So you came all the way here to eat?

73
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,878
See? I knew you wouldn't believe me,

74
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,548
so I wasn't going to tell you.

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,550
It's true.

76
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,094
This gajami sikhae
is especially good. Seriously.

77
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,179
Gajami sikhae? What?

78
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,889
They made sikhye with fish? No way.

79
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,766
It's red too. I can't eat spicy food.

80
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,435
-It's not what you think.
-What?

81
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,603
It sounds like sikhye,
but it's not the drink.

82
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,147
-It's spelled differently.
-Is it?

83
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,315
-It's flounder.
-Okay.

84
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,233
They add rice and salt to it
and ferment it.

85
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,319
-That's how the dish is made.
-Fermented?

86
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,864
He's messing with you.
He loves fermented fish dishes.

87
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,240
What?

88
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,950
You're a total food connoisseur!

89
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,369
Well, I wouldn't say "connoisseur."

90
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,039
He's marked
over 100 restaurants on the Greip map.

91
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,541
No, it was 328 as of yesterday.

92
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,419
Can you share those with me?

93
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,420
No way!

94
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,547
I'm going to hand them down to my twins.

95
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,466
-Please!
-Still…

96
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,551
You've helped us out a lot.

97
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,470
So I'll give them all to you.

98
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,264
Thank you! This meal is on me then.

99
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,099
Thank you! Let's eat!

100
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,185
I bet you're hungry. Eat this.

101
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,942
Me.

102
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,487
You like marinated raw crabs, right?

103
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,155
-Eat this.
-I do?

104
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,116
No? What about Na-yun?
What did you like?

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,327
You. I like you.

106
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,953
Okay, you can eat whatever you like.

107
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,539
I want to eat that. It looks so good.

108
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,291
Eat up.

109
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,209
Okay.

110
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,549
The gajami sikhae has great texture.

111
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,886
I could absolutely destroy it.

112
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,891
-Eat up.
-Okay.

113
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,906
Yes?

114
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,949
Can I come in?

115
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,991
Sure.

116
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,995
Hey, is it really okay to stay here?

117
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,581
Seriously, I can find another place.

118
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,375
There are plenty of empty rooms.

119
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,293
Also, here.

120
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,295
I thought you'd need more clothes.

121
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,964
Right, thanks.

122
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,424
Gosh, I've been borrowing clothes
a lot lately.

123
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,762
The bathroom's at the end
of the hall, so you can wash up.

124
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,888
Okay, I got it.

125
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,355
Were there any bugs?

126
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,149
-No.
-Okay.

127
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,489
-You're not leaving?
-What?

128
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,824
Aren't you going to go?

129
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,452
-Just for a moment--
-Seung-hyo!

130
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,287
Seung-hyo, where are you?

131
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,623
Go on. She's looking for you.

132
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,542
Are you sure you want me to go?

133
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,085
What?

134
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,337
Back then and now.

135
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,631
Why do you keep giving me dirty looks?

136
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,799
What are you talking about?

137
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,718
My gaze is so gentle right now.

138
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,179
You should look in the mirror
when you say that.

139
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
Wait a second.

140
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,018
Are you jealous?

141
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,438
Don't be ridiculous. Hurry and get out.

142
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,522
Stop laughing. Go.

143
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,649
Fine, I'm leaving. Why are you pushing?

144
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,942
Just go.

145
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,793
Seung-hyo.

146
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,212
What?

147
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,589
My wife's not here, so I can't sleep.

148
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,945
-Are you asleep?
-No.

149
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,325
Want to come out for a bit?

150
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,743
Yard in 10 minutes. By the tree.

151
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,132
It's late. Why weren't you asleep?

152
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,217
What about you?

153
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,303
I was reading.

154
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,891
Mokminsimseo?
The book Jeong Yak-yong wrote?

155
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,309
Yeah.

156
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,895
Who reads those kinds of books these days?

157
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,230
I do.

158
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,401
It's been a classic since long ago
that transcends time.

159
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,239
It teaches integrity, responsibility,
and how to lead by example.

160
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,491
It tells you how to live.

161
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,827
This book provides enlightenment
about life.

162
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,496
Okay, don't get worked up.

163
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,498
Did I get worked up?

164
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,167
Well, it just seemed like
you didn't know the value of this book.

165
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,713
By the way, it's really nice here.

166
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,216
It's too bad I'm only staying for a day.

167
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,594
You can come again next time.

168
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,138
I'll go back with you tomorrow.

169
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,681
What about your work?

170
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,474
I finished earlier than expected.

171
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,521
I was going to leave the day
after tomorrow, but I can go a day early.

172
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,273
Let's go together.

173
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,067
How? You drove here.

174
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,944
I need to drive Mo-eum's car back.

175
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,196
For my car…

176
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,450
-I'll call a designated driver.
-Are you insane?

177
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,661
Do you know how expensive that would be?

178
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,956
Yeah, that does sound crazy to me too.

179
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,792
But when I thought about it,

180
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,086
I realized spending time with you
was worth more.

181
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,505
Please. You've got to be kidding me.

182
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,884
You like me that much?

183
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,970
-Yeah.
-I see.

184
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,142
Well, how much do you like me?

185
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,688
Even after 30 years together,
I'm still not sick of you.

186
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,774
Wow, that's a bit of an exaggeration.

187
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,319
Have some shame
and take out the times we were apart.

188
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,905
But there weren't any.

189
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,785
I've always been with you.

190
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,085
Here.

191
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,254
When we were eight,

192
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,800
you splashed paint all over me.

193
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,891
When we were seven,

194
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,646
you put sticker tattoos
on my face while I was asleep.

195
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,195
When we were six,

196
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,990
you gave me magic candy

197
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,661
that turned my lips purple
so you could tease me.

198
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,010
And when we were five,
I spat bubble gum on your hair.

199
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,429
Jeez.

200
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:10,062
Wow, how could you still like me
after enduring all that suffering?

201
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,731
See?

202
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,317
I told you I was a femme fatale.

203
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,237
-Get off me.
-No.

204
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,824
You said we've always
been together like this.

205
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,914
I'm a bit sleepy now though.

206
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,000
You are?

207
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,419
Yeah.

208
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,421
Maybe it's because of that long drive.

209
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,344
We can't have someone
come out and see us though.

210
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,060
Ms. Jung Mo-eum?

211
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,937
Yes.

212
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,568
INTERVIEW ROOM

213
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:44,949
INTERVIEW FOR SOUTH POLE
RESEARCH STATION PARAMEDIC POSITION

214
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,742
Ms. Jung Mo-eum.

215
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,205
You have a high TOEIC score
and a recreational watercraft license.

216
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,499
You're also a certified Level 1 paramedic.

217
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,252
You're well-prepared.

218
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,797
Yes, sir. Not only did I do my best
to excel in fire safety management,

219
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,466
but I also worked hard
to perform my duties in the field.

220
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,344
Why do you want to go to Antarctica?

221
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,640
To be honest, my dream
was to become Superman when I was a kid.

222
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,185
Then, I wanted to be Spider-Man.

223
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,815
I realized I couldn't be either,
so I joined the Korea Fire Service.

224
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,110
And I've been very satisfied with my job.

225
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,614
Because I'm still able to help people.

226
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,951
Yes, I guess you're right.

227
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,454
I'd like to go to Antarctica
to experience an unknown world

228
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,498
and to help preserve world peace.

229
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,294
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

230
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,238
Thank you for telling me
about Hye-suk last time.

231
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm glad she's safe.

232
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,575
But…

233
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,786
this is as far as my gratitude
for Hye-suk will go.

234
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,916
-Excuse me?
-Seo Hye-suk is my wife.

235
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,917
She's my woman.

236
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,837
I know that.

237
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,881
Then, that's more reason
to not behave like this.

238
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,091
Don't try to sway her anymore.

239
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,594
I think there's a misunderstanding.

240
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,347
I heard your nickname is Alain Delon.

241
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,973
Why suddenly bring that up?

242
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:37,436
-Yes, you're handsome.
-Excuse me, Dr. Choi.

243
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,272
However, my feelings for her won't change.

244
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,274
The reason for that is

245
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,567
I love Hye-suk!

246
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:44,985
Darling.

247
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,697
What's going on?

248
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,871
What are you doing here? Well?

249
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,122
Well…

250
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,125
Hye-suk and I are just friends.

251
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,378
She just called you "Darling"!

252
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,463
What kind of friends call each other that?

253
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,716
-We do, because we're close.
-We're really just friends.

254
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,177
I've never once harbored
feelings for her.

255
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,804
That's why it's so ridiculous!

256
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,348
She's such a beautiful
and intelligent woman.

257
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,267
How could you not fall for her?

258
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,560
Are you a robot?

259
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,733
I'm gay.

260
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,694
-Gosh.
-Excuse me?

261
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,072
I like men.

262
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,044
You're such a beautiful
and intelligent woman.

263
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,505
Stop it. Jeez.

264
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,134
I'm sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

265
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,343
Don't be sorry.

266
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,137
It was actually nice.

267
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,598
He can declare his love for you
with such confidence.

268
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,727
Gosh, he's such a fool.

269
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,354
Seeing that made me envious.

270
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,732
What's there to be envious about?

271
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,819
I'm pretty old now too.

272
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,364
Maybe I should be braver as well.

273
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,910
Whatever you choose to do,
I'll support you.

274
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,328
You know that, right?

275
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:25,544
I know. Always and forever.

276
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,656
I'm so embarrassed by you right now.

277
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,784
-Stay two steps behind me.
-Okay.

278
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,748
I mean, how could you…

279
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,420
-How could you doubt me?
-I didn't doubt you. That bastard…

280
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,340
I mean, I was afraid
he might've had bad intentions.

281
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,884
Regardless of the reason, I'm sorry.

282
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,843
Unbelievable.

283
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,892
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
I wouldn't have misunderstood if you did.

284
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,145
My friend trusted me with that secret.
How could I tell you?

285
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,357
He must've been so uneasy living
in this conservative and rigid society.

286
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,071
That's so cool. You're so cool.

287
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,115
Jeez.

288
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,451
-What are you doing? Let's go.
-Coming.

289
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,291
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

290
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,128
That was so embarrassing.

291
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,463
Goodness. What do you think you're doing?

292
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,799
SEND YOUR NAME,
ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER

293
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,384
ORDERS WILL BE PROCESSED UPON PAYMENT

294
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:02,391
Yeah! I did it!

295
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,310
You scared me. What are you yelling for?

296
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,104
Mom, are you ready?

297
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,148
Yeah, the food's ready. Help yourself.

298
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,317
No, not food.
Are you ready for the good life?

299
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,403
-You know the money you lent me?
-Yeah?

300
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,196
I'll multiply it by a hundred. A thousand!

301
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,740
Are you an influenza now?

302
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,701
No, not influenza. An influencer.

303
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,035
Right, influencer.

304
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,913
No, wait. Like a virus,
I'm going to be deadly.

305
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,623
And I'll become more infectious.

306
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,208
Just try to break even.

307
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,296
Mom, trust your son!
It's for real this time.

308
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,882
Also, don't carry around
things like this anymore.

309
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,466
-Let's throw it out.
-Hey!

310
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,219
Why would I toss out a perfectly fine bag?

311
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,181
Mom, this won't do.

312
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,434
Have a bag picked out.

313
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,768
I'll buy it for you soon.

314
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,605
Even if I had a bag like that,
I have nowhere to bring it to.

315
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,524
All I want is for you to be a success.

316
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,651
That's all.

317
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,779
Bye.

318
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,533
Mom, go to the mall. Okay?

319
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,285
Pick one out!

320
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,120
-In-suk, eat this first.
-Okay.

321
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,332
-Hey.
-What?

322
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,044
How much does
a designer bag cost these days?

323
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,796
-Prices vary greatly.
-Right.

324
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,882
But they're at least
two to three million won.

325
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,175
Goodness, that's insane.

326
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,220
With that kind of money,
you could buy 30 kg of Hanwoo!

327
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,471
Gosh, that's expensive.

328
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,014
But why do you suddenly ask?

329
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,558
Is Geun-sik buying you one?

330
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,520
It'd be faster to be reborn than
to expect something like that from him.

331
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,191
No, Dong-jin…

332
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,734
Never mind. Later.

333
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,736
-What?
-No, it's nothing.

334
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,196
It's just…

335
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,114
-Hey, Mi-suk.
-Yeah?

336
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,992
I don't know
if it's right to ask you this or not,

337
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,411
but it's about Seok-ryu.

338
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,747
Would she be interested in a blind date?

339
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,458
A blind date?

340
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,547
Why is the dog barking so much?

341
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,134
Don't you think you were a bit harsh?

342
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,469
About what?

343
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,889
How could you drive all the way back
without stopping at a rest area?

344
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,975
Did you want to go to the bathroom?

345
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,645
It's not that.
It was supposed to be a date.

346
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,355
I should've just driven my car.

347
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,816
I need to give Mo-eum her car back.

348
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,651
I told you
we should drive back separately.

349
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,610
-Seok-ryu!
-But…

350
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,487
-Mom.
-Hey, Seung-hyo.

351
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,989
-Aunt Mi-suk.
-Why are you…

352
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,157
Mom, the reason why we're together is--

353
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,743
No, I was just about to call you.

354
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,787
Do you want to go on a blind date?

355
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,705
A blind date?

356
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,415
Goodness! Why are you the one surprised?

357
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,458
Jeez, Mom. Don't be ridiculous.

358
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,045
Your Aunt Jae-suk wants to
set you up with someone.

359
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,257
I'm not forcing you either,
but he seems decent.

360
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,216
No, she can't.

361
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,719
She's in no position to do that.

362
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,887
-Mom! Let's talk at home.
-No, not later. Now!

363
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,514
I have to tell her quick.

364
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,267
Jae-suk wants to introduce him to Mo-eum,

365
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,768
but she won't listen.

366
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,686
Me?

367
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,979
There's that disobedient girl.

368
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,607
Give me an answer now.

369
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,608
What?

370
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,446
Wow.

371
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,366
I was busy eating that night
I didn't look around properly.

372
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,370
Goodness. Company benefits are good here.

373
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,372
There's a massage chair too.

374
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,168
Yeah, we're trying our best.

375
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,377
Right.

376
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,174
Even the massage chair
is different at an architecture firm.

377
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,342
It's so pretty.

378
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,682
All right, then.
How about we hear the report now?

379
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,392
-What report?
-Come on.

380
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,688
My car came back today,

381
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,649
which means Seok-ryu spent the night out.

382
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,110
Are you two…

383
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,197
dating now?

384
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,115
I did spend the night out,

385
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,826
but it's definitely not
what you're thinking.

386
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,037
Yeah, we were at our lodgings.

387
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,414
We slept separately in separate rooms.

388
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,833
Yeah, sure. Let's say that happened.

389
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,795
But why won't you answer my question?

390
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,338
What?

391
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,756
Are you two dating?

392
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,969
Yeah, we are.

393
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,434
Finally! At long last!

394
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,436
I feel so refreshed.

395
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,563
Seriously, you two!

396
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,610
This feels like my body
and soul's been massaged!

397
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,320
Gosh, this feels good!

398
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,866
Why are you so happy about us dating?

399
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,869
Because I almost died of frustration.

400
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,373
I bet everyone who's watched you two
feels the same way.

401
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,752
However, I knew you two
would end up together.

402
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,797
Hey, how would you know
something even we didn't know?

403
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,508
There's power in words.

404
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:02,357
Seung-hyo and Seok-ryu sitting in a tree

405
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,444
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

406
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,487
First comes love

407
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,573
You're all dead!

408
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,119
Then comes marriage

409
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,706
Then comes baby in a baby carriage

410
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,208
Seung-hyo and Seok-ryu

411
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,668
Get back here!

412
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,961
Sitting in a tree

413
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,972
Hey, why do you two
always go home together?

414
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,682
We live next door.

415
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,310
Still, boys and girls
shouldn't hang out with each other.

416
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,063
Seung-hyo and Seok-ryu sitting in a tree

417
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,151
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

418
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,654
That's not true! He's just my sidekick!

419
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,116
First comes love

420
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,202
Then comes marriage

421
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,496
Then comes baby in a baby carriage

422
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,040
Seung-hyo and Seok-ryu

423
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,876
Hey, Choisseung.
Give me your history textbook.

424
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,045
What am I, the library?

425
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,505
Hey, what's with you two?

426
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,965
-Are you two dating?
-Nope.

427
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,134
Seeing him naked wouldn't faze me at all.

428
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,011
Just think of her as a guy.

429
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,512
Hey, you two.

430
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,935
You heard the same thing
over and over again,

431
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,939
so whether you liked each other or not,
it was subconsciously ingrained in you.

432
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,235
So I was a victim of gaslighting?

433
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,528
Do paramedics carry air rifles?

434
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,822
-I want to shoot him.
-What?

435
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,824
Maybe I should've become a cop.

436
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,034
No, you're fine as is.

437
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,120
Hey, but the thing is

438
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,916
all three of us hung out together,
so why did people put us two together?

439
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,877
That's because I'm way out of his league.

440
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,006
Yeah, it's okay.

441
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,718
Her sights have always been
out of this world.

442
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,221
Her standards of beauty
are different from ours.

443
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,222
That is true.

444
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,227
By the way, you look cool today.
Why are you in uniform?

445
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,937
-Good question.
-Well…

446
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,147
I had an interview today.

447
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,276
The South Pole position?
Your application passed?

448
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,069
Of course!

449
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,404
Wait a second.

450
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,447
Are you really going to go
if you pass this too?

451
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,074
Wow!

452
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,327
Then, does that mean
you'll get to see penguins in person?

453
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,829
Penguins right before your eyes?

454
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,913
That's right.

455
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,290
-Take a lot of pictures--
-No.

456
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,794
In Antarctica, the penguins are in danger
due to the climate crisis.

457
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,504
Polar bears are in danger too.

458
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,506
I'm home.

459
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,550
-Hi.
-Mo-eum!

460
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,594
Yeon-du!

461
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,723
What were you up to?

462
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,891
What were you doing, Yeon-du?

463
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,520
What have you been doing all day?

464
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,731
We read books together.

465
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,358
-Okay.
-And we removed the guts from anchovies.

466
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,693
You did?

467
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,449
Mom, did you make Yeon-du
remove the guts from anchovies?

468
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,327
Are you Cinderella's stepmother?

469
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,370
Seriously?

470
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,041
No. It looked fun,
so I said wanted to help.

471
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,834
Really?

472
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,880
Jeez. Did you think your own mother
would abuse a child?

473
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,841
No. I just wanted to make sure.

474
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,426
Yeon-du.

475
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,013
I'll take the anchovies
we prepared together,

476
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,973
and I'll stir-fry them nice and well!

477
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,433
Okay, thank you!

478
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,517
That sounds so good.

479
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,227
It sounds so good!

480
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,650
Hey, if you're not going to get married,

481
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,071
go somewhere and bring back
a daughter like Yeon-du.

482
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,155
What?

483
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,200
That's how badly I want
a grandchild of my own. Okay?

484
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,785
Go and stir-fry the anchovies.

485
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,620
I swear…

486
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,420
Yeon-du, aren't you bored
from just reading books all day?

487
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,423
I don't know.

488
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,263
Is there anything else you want to do
besides reading books?

489
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,015
Want to go ride bikes?

490
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,767
I don't know how to.

491
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,768
Really?

492
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,188
Then…

493
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,982
-How about scooters?
-I can't ride those either.

494
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,736
You don't like to play outside?

495
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,491
It's not that, but my dad says
it's too dangerous outside.

496
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,952
I see.

497
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,291
It's you!

498
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,670
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Minus one!

499
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,796
Ribbit, ribbit!

500
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,340
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Minus one!

501
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,716
-Yeon-du.
-Ribbit!

502
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,343
Dad!

503
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:47,809
Yeon-du, I missed you so much today.

504
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,477
Did you miss me too?

505
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,729
Well…

506
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,897
Yeah, I'd say so.

507
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,780
Thank you. I owe you a lot.

508
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,867
No, it's fine. Do you have work tomorrow?

509
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,160
-Yes.
-I see.

510
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,871
-Take a day off.
-Sorry?

511
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,914
Let's meet here at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

512
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,832
But…

513
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,167
-No refusals.
-Wait.

514
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,293
No questions.

515
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,335
But…

516
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,921
And no mudflat shirt.

517
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,884
-Yeon-du, see you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow!

518
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,135
-Ribbit!
-Ribbit!

519
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,388
Dad, let's go.

520
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:32,020
Hey, isn't this the tree I gave to you?

521
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,731
Did you kill it and buy a new one?

522
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,982
That's right.

523
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:36,941
How did you know?

524
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,027
That's the secret of its origin.

525
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,324
It's grown so much. This is so neat.

526
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,992
How did it grow so much?

527
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
-Seok-ryu.
-Yeah?

528
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,663
Are you…

529
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,791
Are you going to go on that blind date?

530
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,795
Are you crazy?
I'll make something up and turn her down.

531
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,840
This won't do.
Let's just tell her we're dating.

532
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,758
What?

533
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,968
Who knows? This might happen again.

534
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,554
Let's also tell your dad.

535
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,225
We'll tell my parents too.
Let's officially get their approval.

536
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,144
We should tell the entire neighborhood.

537
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,437
We can't.

538
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,148
-Why not?
-I mean…

539
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,234
We've just started to date.

540
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,111
Telling everyone seems a bit too much.

541
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,406
It's pretty obvious that it'll be chaos.

542
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,411
It's a little bit of an issue.
Our moms are friends.

543
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,372
And we're all so close.

544
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:37,168
And to be honest, you don't know
what could happen to us.

545
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,131
Let's keep it a secret for now.

546
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,178
All right. If that's what you want…

547
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,974
Let's keep our relationship a secret.

548
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,058
Top secret.

549
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,227
We have to be diligent. No one can know.

550
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,770
No one will know.

551
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,327
Is he up?

552
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,003
Choisseung.

553
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,216
Bonjour, Seok-ryu!

554
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,968
-Aunt Hye-suk!
-Hi.

555
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,096
Seung-hyo went to work early today.
Is it urgent?

556
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,348
No, it's nothing.

557
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,476
Hey, I didn't know your windows
were this close.

558
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,395
You could trip and kiss each other.

559
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,482
I bet you two hardly ever spent
any time apart.

560
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,984
That's right.

561
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,571
That's why I'm so sick of it!

562
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,323
I bet Choisseung feels the same.

563
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,117
But still, don't fight
and try to get along, okay?

564
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,744
Okay.

565
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,495
-I have something on the stove.
-Go ahead!

566
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,331
Sorry. I'll see you next time. Bye!

567
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,919
Gosh, that scared me.

568
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,510
BAE SEOK-RYU

569
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,436
BAE SEOK-RYU

570
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,485
-Na-yun.
-Yes?

571
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,903
What did you just do?

572
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,656
Well…

573
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,873
You know what you did
was excessive, right?

574
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,708
Yes.

575
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,419
I've allowed your actions to slide

576
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,922
because I thought of you
as just a cute former classmate.

577
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,132
But I can't anymore.

578
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,385
I'm sorry for what I just did.

579
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,221
But, Seung-hyo,

580
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,223
you know that I like you.

581
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,642
I thought it was half crush, half joking.

582
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,812
No, it's not. I'm serious.

583
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,231
Then, I think I need
to be perfectly clear.

584
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,067
There's someone else I like.

585
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,903
Is it someone I know?

586
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,658
She's someone I found
after a long and difficult journey.

587
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,787
I don't want to do anything
that would make her feel uncomfortable.

588
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,432
I'm sorry I didn't pick up.
Want to see a movie later?

589
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,601
What is this? Is he officially
asking me out on a date?

590
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,686
Sounds good.

591
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,150
I have to wash my hair.

592
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,904
-Mo-eum!
-Yeon-du!

593
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,742
My sweet Yeon-du!

594
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,619
Did you sleep well?

595
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,371
Any dreams about being
an alien's friend?

596
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,373
No, I dreamt of something else.

597
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,541
What was it?

598
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,335
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

599
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,545
Okay.

600
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,382
You're very punctual.

601
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,925
It's the basics of being a reporter.

602
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,511
I came because you asked me to, but…

603
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,014
I don't need to say
where we're going, right?

604
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,810
Let's go!

605
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,771
Dad, bring that stuff and follow us!

606
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,064
-What?
-What?

607
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,066
-We're not going to help?
-The car's over there.

608
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,983
Ms. Jung?

609
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,052
I'll just do it.

610
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:56,969
No, it's fine.

611
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,805
-I'll do it.
-Dad.

612
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,432
-Dad?
-Yeah?

613
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,166
You can do it, Dad.

614
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,628
Careful, it's hot.

615
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,172
Try some.

616
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,924
-I'll eat it on my own.
-Okay.

617
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,474
-Is it good?
-You're pretty good at grilling!

618
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,561
What are we doing next, Mo-eum?

619
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,688
What we're going to do next is…

620
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,484
-Wow!
-Wow!

621
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,074
Don't shoot Yeon-du!

622
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,044
I give up!

623
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,846
You're drenched.

624
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,100
I was able to borrow this.

625
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,188
But we don't have any electricity.
How can we use that?

626
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,814
Just a second.

627
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,833
Wow!

628
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,627
Wow!

629
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,836
I'll dry your hair, Yeon-du.

630
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,546
Let's dry your hair.

631
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,925
What was most fun for you?

632
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,885
I liked playing
with the water guns the most.

633
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,178
Me too.

634
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,357
All done.

635
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,527
Yeon-du!

636
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,030
I'll tie your hair nice and pretty later.

637
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,824
-Okay.
-Your hair's wet too.

638
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,284
I'll dry it myself.

639
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,369
What?

640
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,956
I see! Right!

641
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,812
I thought you might be cold.

642
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,732
Yeon-du, how about we go over there?

643
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,278
Where?

644
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,351
Hey, Choisseung.

645
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,769
Hey.

646
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,107
I'm here and you won't even look at me?

647
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,443
I did look.

648
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,241
What are you so busy with?

649
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,661
I was tasked with remodeling
a movie theater.

650
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,705
I thought of something when I got here,

651
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,373
so I wanted to draw it before I forgot.

652
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,168
Will it take long?

653
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,545
No, I'll be done
before the movie starts.

654
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,053
So this is what a blueprint looks like.

655
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,638
Yeah.

656
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,228
Do you want popcorn? I'll buy some.

657
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,064
No, I'm fine.

658
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:22,651
Really? Then, I'll just buy a drink.

659
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,153
Okay.

660
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,807
What? Do you want more?

661
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,731
Sorry.

662
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,317
What do we do?

663
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,404
They said they'd analyze the photos
and bring them here in 30 minutes.

664
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,988
-Mi-ja.
-Okay, stop there.

665
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,573
Just a moment. One second.

666
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,500
The sun is already setting.

667
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,546
Should we go before it gets too late?

668
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,005
No.

669
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,510
Yeon-du just fell asleep.
Let's stay for 30 more minutes.

670
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,594
Okay.

671
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,728
She must be heavy. Give her to me.

672
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,400
Yeon-du, let's sleep on the bed.

673
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,070
It was fine though.

674
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,291
So how was camping?

675
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,085
Not bad, right?

676
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,628
Yeah.

677
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,506
I've never thought about it,

678
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,468
but Yeon-du really liked it.

679
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,722
Yeon-du said she couldn't ride a bike.

680
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,018
She can't ride scooters
or rollerblade either.

681
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,566
It's because of the accident, right?

682
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,196
It wasn't on purpose.

683
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:36,494
I just keep getting so worried.

684
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,579
I understand how you feel.

685
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,043
I know I have no authority
to tell you what to do either.

686
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,045
But…

687
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,050
if you keep a miracle
hidden away like that,

688
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,928
it'll never really be a miracle.

689
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:02,311
I want Yeon-du to feel the wind
and stomp her feet.

690
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:07,733
And sometimes, she'll fall down.

691
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,446
That's how I'd want her to grow.

692
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:19,495
I want her to see and hear
all the good things in this world.

693
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:25,417
I hope she can take it all in
like a sponge and grow healthy.

694
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,799
Wouldn't that be a real miracle?

695
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,095
I'm so sorry to Yeon-du.

696
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,350
It would've been nice
if I was as brave as you.

697
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,321
Sometimes, I think it would be nice
if I was Yeon-du's mom.

698
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,914
Come on. Still, that's a bit much.

699
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,499
I can't?

700
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,630
I know I'm moving really fast right now.

701
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,801
It's like I've just traveled to Andromeda
over 2.5 million light-years away.

702
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,885
But…

703
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,014
that's how I feel right now.

704
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,225
Ms. Jung…

705
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,103
My heart races whenever I see you.

706
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,191
It beats rapidly like a drum every time.

707
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,614
I even see you in my dreams too.

708
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,785
So I was wondering.

709
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,996
About our kiss…

710
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,750
Can't we cancel our agreement?

711
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,919
I don't think it was a mistake.

712
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,183
No, we can't. Never.

713
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,187
Yeon-du can't become your daughter.

714
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,022
And what happened that day was a mistake.

715
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,274
It has to be.

716
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,194
Why?

717
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,865
Because it can't happen.

718
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,586
From now on,
I won't leave Yeon-du at your house.

719
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,840
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't hang out with her anymore.

720
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,801
-Dan-ho…
-We should go.

721
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:41,929
Yeon-du.

722
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,973
Wake up. We have to go home.

723
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,144
Let's sleep in the car, okay?

724
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,552
Go on in first.

725
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,553
What? Why?

726
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,222
What if we run into
your mom again like last time?

727
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,058
Come on. We've hung around
with each other for years.

728
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,144
-She won't be suspicious of this.
-But still…

729
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,147
To keep this secret, we need to be careful
around the neighborhood.

730
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,858
I'll take a lap around the block.
Go on in first.

731
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,484
Okay, then.

732
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,829
Since when did he start
listening to me so well?

733
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,039
Ridiculous.

734
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,178
Alzheimer's…

735
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,974
-It's not that.
-Really?

736
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,392
-Yes.
-Really?

737
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,603
Take a look for yourself
if you don't believe me.

738
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,647
Hey, you're going to break it!

739
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,608
There's nothing wrong with her brain.

740
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,859
Of course,

741
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,778
we'll have to see if your symptoms
reoccur in the future.

742
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,740
Then, why did I keep forgetting things?

743
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,493
You could say
it's a type of short-term memory loss.

744
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,036
I see.

745
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,373
Have you experienced any shock
or a significant amount of stress lately?

746
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,129
Yes.

747
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,840
Then, it could be from that stress.

748
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,176
It could be due to heightened anxiety.

749
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,137
If you rest and take care of yourself,
you'll be fine.

750
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,139
Thank you.

751
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,482
I'm so relieved.

752
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,693
No, "relieved" isn't enough
to describe how I feel.

753
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,822
I've been in an emotional hell
for the past two weeks.

754
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,200
You said it would be okay,

755
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,203
but I thought of the worst-case scenarios.

756
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,081
Are you listening to me?

757
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,416
Honey!

758
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,585
Honey, what's wrong?

759
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,132
Honey, what's the matter? What is it?

760
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,261
What? Honey, don't cry. What's wrong?

761
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,847
I thought something bad
was going to happen to you.

762
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,477
I just learned the truth not too long ago,

763
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,023
and I was finally able to express
my true feelings.

764
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,444
But I was afraid I was too late.

765
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,700
I was afraid you'd forget me.

766
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,830
I was scared I'd lose you.

767
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,041
Honey.

768
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,003
I can't live without you, Hye-suk!

769
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,925
For goodness' sake.

770
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,471
I swear.

771
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,474
You've been embarrassing me
a lot these days, you know.

772
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,687
But this isn't so bad either.

773
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,190
Honey.

774
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,945
He said I didn't have Alzheimer's!

775
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,741
Stop crying, Gyeong-jong!

776
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,035
Why didn't you say
anything like this before?

777
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,370
You big dummy!

778
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,364
See you next class!

779
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,740
-Bye!
-Bye!

780
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,164
-Hello?
-Hey, Choisseung.

781
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,918
So I made neobiani in class today.

782
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,795
It's so good. Want me to bring you some?

783
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,963
I had work to do outside,
so I'm not at the office.

784
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,049
Do you want to come by later at night?

785
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,593
-At night?
-Yeah.

786
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,969
Seung-hyo!

787
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,306
I have to go. I'll see you later.

788
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,771
At night?

789
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,899
If it's at night…

790
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:51,988
Then, it'll be dark
and no one will be around.

791
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,664
ORDER DETAILS

792
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,084
What? I made the post days ago,
but why are there only ten orders?

793
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,047
Damn it.

794
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,722
Were my abs not defined enough?

795
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,934
I should've worked out a bit more.

796
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,562
JAE-YEONG

797
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,814
Hey, Jae-yeong.

798
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,899
What? Haeundae Beach?

799
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,485
I'm in no position to go now…

800
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,905
Really? I don't have to pay?

801
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,284
You're paying?

802
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,702
Choisseung!

803
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,580
I made a lot of good food…

804
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,541
for us.

805
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,629
You're all here.

806
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,965
It's been a while, Seok-ryu.

807
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,049
Hi.

808
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:04,019
My goodness! This was made with such care!

809
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,979
Why did you bring so much food?

810
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:10,233
You must've come
to congratulate Seung-hyo.

811
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,234
Congratulate him?

812
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,279
Yes. To celebrate the launch
of the collaboration with Fresco,

813
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,363
they interviewed him.

814
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,157
Hey, that article should be out now.

815
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,450
-Show it to her.
-Right.

816
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,161
I've been looking at it for a while.

817
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,206
The picture came out well too.

818
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:28,210
I was going to leave right after,
but Myeong-u told me to stay.

819
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,879
Aren't you glad I did?
You get to try all this good food.

820
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,297
Whatever.

821
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,341
I've finished my coffee, so I'll go.

822
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,926
What? You're leaving and not eating?

823
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,219
I'm busy.

824
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,639
-You're going to go?
-Yes.

825
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,600
I did want to congratulate you,

826
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,352
so I'm glad I can.

827
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,607
Congratulations
on your official start to cooking.

828
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,944
It was thanks to your advice. Thank you.

829
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,154
It was thanks to your delicious kalguksu.

830
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,242
Great job today. I'm off.

831
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,244
All right, get home safe.

832
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,412
-Thanks.
-Good night.

833
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,289
Bye. Thanks. Great job.

834
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,958
-Get home safe.
-Thanks.

835
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,797
It would've been nice if she stayed.

836
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,781
I texted you and said I'd call you later
since tonight wasn't a good night.

837
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,453
I saw it just now.

838
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,500
Why didn't you tell me
you had an interview with Fresco?

839
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,794
Was it because of Tae-hui?

840
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:56,131
They said it wouldn't take long,
so I was going to tell you after.

841
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,133
-But it ended up like this.
-What?

842
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,093
You thought I wouldn't understand?

843
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,053
No, it's not that.

844
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,684
I'm sorry. I have no excuse.

845
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,396
It was nice seeing her
after all this time.

846
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,148
She's still pretty.

847
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,609
Tae-hui didn't come
because she wanted to either.

848
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,694
Myeong-u kept insisting.

849
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,113
Did you tell her we're dating?

850
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,031
No.

851
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,493
You told me not to tell anyone.

852
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,703
But an ex-girlfriend

853
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,413
is different…

854
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,419
Okay.

855
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,089
Also, we didn't have time
to talk about anything personal.

856
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,050
It was an official event.

857
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,554
Now that I think about it,
you two are like Hollywood actors.

858
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,934
I could never work with my ex-boyfriend.

859
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,186
I mean, think about it.

860
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,855
Even if you try,
feelings don't just disappear.

861
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,981
And things were once good.

862
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,025
It's all in the past.

863
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,736
I want to stop talking about this.

864
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,989
What's wrong? I know everything anyway.

865
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:07,327
Hey, when you told
Tae-hui earlier to get home safe,

866
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,662
your voice was no joke.

867
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,497
-It was so deep.
-I never did that.

868
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,541
You did. You were so worried about her.

869
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,169
I mean, why didn't you just take her home?

870
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,087
Seok-ryu.

871
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,297
How were you around her
when I wasn't here?

872
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,842
Were you mature
and understanding around her?

873
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,015
I don't want to answer that.

874
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,022
I'm not obligated
to tell you things like that.

875
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,803
What's wrong with me?

876
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,690
You have some nerve, Choi Seung-hyo.

877
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,783
Are you heading out now?

878
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,410
Yes. Where are you going?

879
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,120
I'm going to Seoraksan Mountain.

880
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:35,123
Your father and I are taking
an overnight trip with Seok-ryu's parents.

881
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,043
I forgot to tell you.

882
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,172
You're staying one night.
Why did you pack so much?

883
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:46,551
No. The thing is, your dad…

884
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,678
What is all this?

885
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,430
Compression bandages and heat packs.

886
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,974
Your ankle hasn't fully healed yet,
so it's just in case.

887
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,643
I have acupressure patches
if your feet hurt from walking a lot.

888
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,021
Why not bring crutches
and a wheelchair too?

889
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,189
You think I should?

890
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,315
I'll call the hospital.

891
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,108
No, honey. It's fine.

892
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,736
Come here! We're late. Let's go. Jeez!

893
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,073
So that's what Dad's really like.

894
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,868
I said hurry up!

895
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,329
Honey, you washed my pants wrong.
They shrank!

896
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,956
-You should've washed them right.
-Honey, they're mine.

897
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,126
-They're not mine?
-Seriously?

898
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,544
I see. It has a lace trim.

899
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,421
I told you to pack earlier!

900
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,216
I don't have any tank tops!
Is there a black hole in the drawer?

901
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,967
I can't find anything in this house.

902
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,220
Seok-ryu, your dad
would be a perfect slug.

903
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,305
-A slug!
-Is that how you talk of your husband?

904
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,765
You turn me into a slug?

905
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:34,933
When are you leaving?

906
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,352
-It's been 30 minutes!
-Why are you looking for that now?

907
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,270
We'll probably go tomorrow
thanks to your dad!

908
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,189
My tank top. My sunglasses are gone!

909
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,192
-Find my sunglasses.
-Dad, they're on your head!

910
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,777
There they are!

911
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,987
Jeez! And where are you going?

912
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,864
What? I'm going to Busan with my friends.

913
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,784
-Wow, you're all going without me?
-Here it is. Here!

914
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,036
Jeez, it was right there!
How could you not find it?

915
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,371
-I caught it.
-Good grief.

916
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,331
-Let's take these!
-Where's Dong-jin going?

917
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,416
-Busan with his friends.
-All of a sudden?

918
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,001
Dad, could you not wear those?

919
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,545
-No, I need these.
-Goodness.

920
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,256
-Don't wear those at Seoraksan.
-That's a fashion crime.

921
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,884
Sorry! He kept on dawdling.

922
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,219
It's okay. We didn't wait much.

923
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,097
Gosh, you took forever
in front of the mirror picking scarves!

924
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,473
-"This or that?"
-Let's go!

925
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,474
-Okay!
-Okay!

926
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:18,434
-Get in.
-Here.

927
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,602
Thanks, honey.

928
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,273
-Here.
-Honey, get in.

929
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,315
Honey?

930
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:29,028
The car looks so sleek and shiny.
I've always wanted to go for a ride in it.

931
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,282
Wow!

932
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,950
Is this your first time in our car?

933
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,869
-Yes.
-I see.

934
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,080
GANGNEUNG DAEGWALLYEONG SERVICE AREA

935
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,165
Are we almost there?

936
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,291
-Yeah.
-Honey!

937
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,543
-The water's so cold.
-Here. Dry your hands.

938
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,004
Thanks. The water was so cold.

939
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,464
-Really? No hot water?
-No.

940
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,548
That's terrible.

941
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,889
Honey! Man, these have
entire walnuts in them!

942
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,056
My hands feel frozen.

943
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,476
-That's cold. Hey!
-Hey!

944
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,144
-You're so rude.
-Come on.

945
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,396
I think it got on my face. Look.

946
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,898
-Geun-sik!
-Goodness.

947
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,442
-Just lightly pat it.
-Do you have a handkerchief?

948
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,735
A handkerchief?

949
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,529
Yeah. But I used this
to blow my nose. Is that okay?

950
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,490
You're so rude.

951
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,366
-What's wrong?
-I want those walnut pastries.

952
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,118
Do you want some of these?

953
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,913
Wow! Let's take a picture here!

954
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,540
Mi-suk, let's take
our individual pictures first.

955
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,583
-Individual ones?
-Yeah.

956
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,043
Take a picture of me.

957
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,211
-Just a second.
-Okay.

958
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,962
Honey, take a picture of me with this.

959
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,756
-Just take it yourself.
-No, with the bear!

960
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,216
For goodness' sake.

961
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,759
-With the bear?
-Yeah.

962
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,302
-Okay.
-But…

963
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,970
That's how you get the bear in it.

964
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,680
No, take some more.

965
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,349
-Jeez.
-This weather is amazing.

966
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,391
It's unbelievable.

967
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,603
Goodness.

968
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,982
Should I stand here? How do I look?

969
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,651
That's good, honey.

970
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,444
Who carries around something like that?

971
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,113
-It is heavy.
-Goodness. What is he doing?

972
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,657
Now, that's funny.

973
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,325
Goodness.

974
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,535
He's going crazy now.

975
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,371
You two have both gone crazy.

976
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,373
-Is that okay?
-Let's see that jawline!

977
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,832
-I feel embarrassed.
-Goodness.

978
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,000
-Nice!
-What's with you?

979
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,544
-Good!
-What are you doing?

980
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,546
-Great!
-Let me see.

981
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,881
-I'm next!
-No, let's look.

982
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,217
Honey.

983
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,886
Since when did you take
such great pictures?

984
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,723
I went online and studied how to take
good pictures of your girlfriend.

985
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,851
Do you like it?

986
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,020
I love it. You did great. It's amazing.

987
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,524
You idiot. You made me look like a dwarf.

988
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,442
It looks just like you.

989
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,236
Hey, Gyeong-jong.

990
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,029
Can you take a picture
of me with that too?

991
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,156
-Yeah, okay!
-Make my legs look long.

992
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,449
Take your own.

993
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,202
-Mo-eum.
-Yeah?

994
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,829
Can you call my phone?

995
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,747
Okay.

996
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,714
It works.

997
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,091
It works very well.

998
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,553
It was so quiet I thought it was broken.

999
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,224
SEOK-RYU

1000
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:12,859
Come in.

1001
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,197
-Dan-ho.
-Mr. Choi.

1002
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,950
-I mean, Mr. Kang.
-Seung-hyo.

1003
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,164
Didn't we go back to being formal?

1004
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,499
Right, we did.

1005
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,002
Take a seat.

1006
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,253
-Thank you.
-Of course.

1007
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,099
-You can sit anywhere.
-Right.

1008
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,065
I'm sorry for interrupting if you're busy.

1009
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,568
Mr. Yoon said you were in your office
and it was okay to go in.

1010
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,987
No, it's okay. I'm glad you came.

1011
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,281
But what brings you here?

1012
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,575
I have a favor to ask of you.

1013
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,453
I've been writing articles
about my experiences lately.

1014
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,416
For my next feature, I want to highlight
the lives of construction workers.

1015
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,045
I was wondering if you could
introduce me to a construction site.

1016
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,590
Of course, I can.

1017
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:21,344
We have a few sites under construction.
I'll call them and let you know.

1018
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,762
Thank you.

1019
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,306
I owe you a lot.

1020
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,852
Gosh, there's no need to say that.
You've helped me out a lot.

1021
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,938
You helped me catch those scammers too.

1022
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,816
-And you provided advice last time.
-I see.

1023
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,070
About your friend…

1024
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:42,532
May I ask how things turned out
with your friend's friend?

1025
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,785
They just recently started dating.

1026
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:47,829
Congratulations.

1027
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,582
I mean, congratulate your friend for me.

1028
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,628
Congratulate. Right.

1029
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,463
What's wrong?

1030
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,174
Is something not working out?

1031
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,093
No, it's just…

1032
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,471
He says dating is hard.

1033
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,727
Love is quite hard.

1034
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:20,445
How could he take
Tae-hui's side in front of me?

1035
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,321
I don't think he took her side.

1036
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,573
Whose side are you on?

1037
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,533
Seung-hyo, that bastard!

1038
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,538
Also, I asked him how he was
when he dated her,

1039
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,249
and he didn't want to answer.

1040
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,376
He said he wasn't obligated to tell me.

1041
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,589
Then, what answer did you want to hear?

1042
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,842
-What do you mean?
-Think about it.

1043
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:46,512
You'd be upset if he said
things were great with her.

1044
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,890
If he said things were awful…

1045
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:53,269
Would you want him to be a scumbag
who bad-mouths his ex-girlfriends?

1046
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:55,980
No.

1047
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,983
Right? So why would you
ask about his past?

1048
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,610
That's self-harm.

1049
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,278
You're right.

1050
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,156
I know that too.

1051
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,157
You know but what?

1052
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,576
But it makes me jealous!

1053
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,167
Hey, from now on,
I'm going to be Seung-hyo's friend.

1054
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,044
Seok-ryu, you brat!

1055
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:22,381
He was kind enough to let you say goodbye
to Hyeon-jun, so you can't do this to him.

1056
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,842
I know. I know that too.

1057
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,429
But I can't control how I feel,
so what can I do?

1058
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:43,027
She's right. You can't control feelings.

1059
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,823
Hello.

1060
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,583
There was only one left.

1061
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,001
Take this.

1062
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,254
No, it's fine. You can have it.

1063
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:05,383
Really, it's okay. You take it.

1064
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,595
No, I want you to have it.
It's my feelings for you.

1065
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:11,973
What?

1066
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,768
The fire in my heart

1067
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,940
won't be extinguished
until it's completely burned out.

1068
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:26,028
So, enjoy.

1069
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,709
I think I have to stop drinking this.

1070
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,797
But I don't know if I can.

1071
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,888
Stop laughing.

1072
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,514
-Do you enjoy teasing me?
-Hey.

1073
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:57,476
If those were signs of dementia,
we'd all be in a nursing home right now.

1074
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,396
It was really serious. I mean it.

1075
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,773
I told you. I couldn't remember anything.

1076
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:07,278
Hye-suk, I forgot what we had for lunch.

1077
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,195
What did we eat?

1078
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,781
Sweet and spicy chicken.
We had chicken, remember?

1079
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,199
-Sweet and spicy chicken.
-Right!

1080
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,618
-Chicken!
-Get a grip, Mi-suk.

1081
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,328
It was so crunchy and delicious!

1082
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:18,080
Hey, this is how we are now.

1083
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,416
Anyway, I'm so relieved that you're okay.

1084
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:25,463
Yeah. I learned so much
after going through this incident.

1085
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,090
Family, friends.

1086
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:31,010
Knowing I have people
I can lean on in my life

1087
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,221
was so reassuring.

1088
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:37,475
I thought that too

1089
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,561
after learning
about what happened to Seok-ryu.

1090
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,732
I wanted her to meet someone who's willing

1091
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,026
to embrace all of her pain.

1092
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,904
Someone reassuring and generous.

1093
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,075
I want to find
a nice partner for Seung-hyo too.

1094
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,870
He was lonely
for a long time because of me.

1095
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:02,083
Hey, let's introduce them
to good people if we find any.

1096
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,168
Let's do that.

1097
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,252
-For real!
-For real!

1098
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,421
-For real, okay?
-Yeah, for real!

1099
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,757
-Find good ones at the foreign ministry!
-For real.

1100
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,675
Okay.

1101
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:14,261
Hey, they left to buy alcohol,
but why aren't they back?

1102
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,681
Good question.
Are they brewing it themselves?

1103
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,849
-Did they go to karaoke?
-Those lunatics.

1104
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:22,478
They must be crazy.
Geun-sik mentioned his favorite song.

1105
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,188
He was talking about it earlier.

1106
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,357
-Where is it?
-That fool.

1107
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,775
-The basement!
-Basement?

1108
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:28,734
Let's hurry!

1109
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:32,655
What's that?

1110
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,657
Tae-hui kept her word.

1111
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,450
Time for the unboxing!

1112
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,246
Right. You sold me for a bowl.

1113
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:45,751
Seung-hyo, I might be a traitor to you,
but this was worth it. Look.

1114
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:46,961
Ta-da!

1115
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,633
Wow, it's beautiful.

1116
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,927
-Benedict Yoon?
-Yes?

1117
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,471
-You like it that much?
-Yes, of course.

1118
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,682
I'm going to hand this down
as a family heirloom.

1119
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,351
My future descendant will be
on Authentic Masterpieces with this,

1120
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,520
and it'll be valued at 100 billion won!

1121
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,106
I should take a picture and show my wife.

1122
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,358
Take this too.

1123
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,609
That's yours.

1124
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,195
Gosh. Mine's bigger.

1125
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,419
In a traditional wedding ceremony,

1126
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,964
the bride and groom use
a hollowed gourd split in two

1127
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,674
to share ceremonial wine.

1128
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:38,596
They say it symbolizes how one
is the perfect match for the other.

1129
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,433
It's my gift to you and Seok-ryu.

1130
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,935
I wish you both happiness.

1131
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,025
PRINCESS

1132
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:00,618
Boring.

1133
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,344
Hey.

1134
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,597
What are you doing?

1135
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:24,266
You have eyes. What do you think?

1136
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,644
Were you always this kind?

1137
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,857
Did you think
your boyfriend was cold-hearted?

1138
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:36,237
Boyfriend, my foot. Are you crazy?

1139
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,365
Wait.

1140
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,701
If I'm not your boyfriend, then what am I?

1141
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,956
I mean, you are. But…

1142
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,624
I don't know.

1143
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,669
It's just awkward to say that word.

1144
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,051
Did you make that house too?

1145
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,137
Yeah.

1146
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:11,522
No, stay away.
He's hurt, so he's still sensitive.

1147
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,233
I think you're the one who's sensitive.

1148
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,406
Why did you bring in a cat
if you're allergic to them?

1149
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,700
It was hurt. I couldn't just abandon it.

1150
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,452
You said you were
out of money for the snack bar.

1151
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,829
Was it for the medical expenses?

1152
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:30,332
Yeah, my hands are shaking
from chocolate withdrawal.

1153
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,835
But what do I do?

1154
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,172
It has nowhere to go after it heals.

1155
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:39,133
The weather's getting hot. Don't touch.

1156
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:43,387
I'm so worried.

1157
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,705
Hey, you sure you're doing it right?

1158
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:12,958
The roof has to be sturdy
to keep the rain and snow out.

1159
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:15,294
Do you want to make it?

1160
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,514
Hey, the walls have to be sturdy too.

1161
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,642
Winter will come right after summer.

1162
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,562
You'll get diabetes that way.

1163
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,440
I'll worry about myself.

1164
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,282
Wow!

1165
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,701
-Great job!
-Hey!

1166
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,456
Hey! Why you…

1167
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,582
Come on!

1168
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,002
I'm sorry! Sorry!

1169
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,463
MADE BY CHOI SEUNG-HYO

1170
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,842
I'm continuing to reconstruct it.

1171
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,516
I think the cats that use this
are descendants of the one we knew.

1172
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,394
-They have the same coat pattern.
-Really?

1173
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,813
-Yeah.
-I want to see.

1174
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:18,023
Forget it, okay?

1175
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,276
Your allergies are about to flare up.

1176
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:22,861
Isn't it a tragedy?

1177
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:26,031
I love cats, but I can't touch them.

1178
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,701
The cat house I made back then

1179
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,829
was the first house I ever made.

1180
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,833
I built it so poorly.

1181
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,086
But I was proud of it.

1182
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,633
I created a home
for a living thing with my own hands.

1183
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,344
I think…

1184
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,849
that's when I wanted
to become an architect.

1185
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,352
That means that cat was your first client.

1186
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,729
No.

1187
01:11:59,106 --> 01:11:59,940
It was you.

1188
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,444
I made it for you.

1189
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,779
You were worried about the cat.

1190
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,866
I wanted you to be happy.

1191
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,301
Let's go eat.

1192
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,471
Let's go.

1193
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:33,932
I'm starving.

1194
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,435
Why haven't you eaten anything so late?

1195
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:37,811
Where should we go?

1196
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,438
My home.

1197
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,903
Your mom made a whole pot of soup
before going on the trip.

1198
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:48,614
It's either this or curry. Eat up.

1199
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,040
I'm sorry about before.

1200
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:02,169
What are you talking about?
I'm the one who caused the problem.

1201
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,463
I'm sorry.

1202
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,298
No, I was too harsh.

1203
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:12,888
Seeing you two together turned me
into someone petty and cheap.

1204
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,849
I'm the one who's done
more unpleasant things though.

1205
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,397
It's not great sharing
our past relationships with each other.

1206
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,317
Not knowing is one thing,
but knowing makes it hard.

1207
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,611
No wonder it's an unwritten rule.

1208
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,657
From now on,
I won't hide anything from you.

1209
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,493
I won't get involved with her
like that again.

1210
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,954
No, I won't leave any room for it.

1211
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:42,918
But…

1212
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:46,755
I was honestly happy to see you jealous.

1213
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,174
-What?
-Not a lot.

1214
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,927
Just a little bit.

1215
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,684
Still, let's not fight.

1216
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,437
It felt awful to fight with you.

1217
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:03,981
I couldn't focus at work,
and I was frustrated.

1218
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,024
This was a first for me.

1219
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,943
It was?

1220
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:09,736
Yeah.

1221
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,740
I didn't want to be someone
who was consumed by a relationship.

1222
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:18,078
It felt so unfamiliar.
I didn't feel like myself.

1223
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:21,957
Hey, that's normal.

1224
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,251
How long have you been pretending
to be cool?

1225
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,919
I don't know.

1226
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,673
I'm sure of one thing.

1227
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,635
You make me feel warm on the inside.

1228
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:46,482
Hey, I borrowed a lot of comic books.
They're in my room.

1229
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:49,443
Let's eat this quickly and read them.

1230
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,153
Yeah, sure.

1231
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,084
What are you doing?

1232
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,171
Why are you looking around
like it's your first time in here?

1233
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:10,756
No, it's just…

1234
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:17,012
Ta-da! I borrowed a whole series for you.

1235
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,597
What is this?

1236
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,309
What do you think?
It's Princess. It's your favorite.

1237
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:25,020
Well… Here it is. This is what I wanted.

1238
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,356
The book you wanted…

1239
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,066
was Princess?

1240
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,821
I just made that up.

1241
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:35,906
What?

1242
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,492
To be honest,

1243
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:44,081
I went to the comic book room to see you.

1244
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,542
What?

1245
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,587
Well, after being like that back then,

1246
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,423
why do you treat me this way now?

1247
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,425
What did I do?

1248
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,345
You don't seem that interested in me.

1249
01:15:58,971 --> 01:15:59,930
Me?

1250
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:03,392
You can't look me in the eyes,
and you act indifferent.

1251
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,729
You treat me worse than how you did
before we started dating.

1252
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:13,110
Well… I mean, that's because…

1253
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:14,861
Well…

1254
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,451
I was just really nervous.

1255
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:26,832
It was because I was nervous.

1256
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,271
How can you sleep
in this kind of situation?

1257
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,949
Why am I so nervous? This is so strange.

1258
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,007
So this is what a blueprint looks like.

1259
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:18,717
Yeah.

1260
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,974
Really? Then I'll just buy a drink.

1261
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,059
Okay.

1262
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:09,351
I'd waited for so long.

1263
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,314
But when you're actually next to me…

1264
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,196
My mind goes blank,
and I don't know what to do.

1265
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:26,827
I thought…

1266
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:28,829
you were being…

1267
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,873
so calm.

1268
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:35,502
Now that we're dating,

1269
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,714
maybe you didn't see me as attractive.

1270
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,841
That's what I thought.

1271
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:45,762
I got anxious and worked up by myself.

1272
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,472
That's not it at all.

1273
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,267
It's the opposite.

1274
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:56,481
I like you so much.

1275
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,279
I don't know how to treat you.

1276
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:20,046
Let's take these downstairs.

1277
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,300
You don't want to read them here?

1278
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,307
I don't think we should stay here.

1279
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,224
Why not?

1280
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:34,311
I'm having bad thoughts.

1281
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:36,938
What bad thoughts?

1282
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,319
Thoughts I shouldn't be thinking.

1283
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:46,406
Cheap and crude thoughts.

1284
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,867
Unhealthy thoughts.

1285
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,454
I used to like unhealthy junk food.

1286
01:19:56,374 --> 01:20:01,254
Powdered candy, taffy, and dalgona.

1287
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:06,176
-Crunch balls, corn nuts, and slushies.
-Yeah.

1288
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:09,763
So go ahead.

1289
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:12,140
Think bad thoughts.

1290
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:20,065
What about bad deeds?

1291
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,529
You can do those too.

1292
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:29,361
PUPPY LOVE

1293
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:33,823
REAL LOVE

1294
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,413
