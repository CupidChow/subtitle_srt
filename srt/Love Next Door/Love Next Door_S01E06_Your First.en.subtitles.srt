1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,152
HYEREUNG KINDERGARTEN
BAE SEOK-RYU

3
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,950
I lost a tooth today.

4
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,789
My tooth is cute,
so I think the Tooth Fairy will like it.

5
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,665
Open your mouth.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,959
There. It's tied.

7
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,671
I remember all of Seok-ryu's firsts.

8
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,135
-Look!
-Wow.

9
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,013
Look at this. Isn't it cute?

10
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,186
Why are you crying? It's not your tooth!

11
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,813
It's mine!

12
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,272
Seung-hyo!

13
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,733
The first time she lost a tooth.

14
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,529
You can't even keep up, dummy!

15
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,696
You're so slow!

16
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,365
You dummy!

17
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,911
How dare they call me a dummy?

18
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,706
I'm going to blow by all of you!

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,626
Hey!

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,547
Hey, Seok-ryu!

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,173
That's dangerous!

22
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,183
The first time she rode a bicycle.

23
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,715
I want to go back!

24
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,387
Jeez, what is wrong with her?

25
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,183
The first time she ran away from home.

26
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,394
Hey!

27
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,314
This is how I feel about you.

28
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,858
-Please take it.
-Don't.

29
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,651
Look, I'm a senior.

30
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,862
Don't give this to me.

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,656
Don't have feelings for me.

32
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,533
Okay?

33
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,368
Sorry.

34
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,623
The first time she asked someone out.

35
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,878
Hey, you're getting it everywhere!

36
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,338
What's he doing?

37
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,598
I've known her for so long.

38
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,768
I thought I knew everything about her.

39
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,526
My dad used to work as a chef at a hotel.

40
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,404
Then, he worked at a restaurant.

41
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,740
Now, he runs a tteokbokki shop.

42
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,826
My dad's tteokbokki
is the best in the world!

43
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,828
Seok-ryu!

44
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,996
Hey, Seok-ryu!

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,956
Coming!

46
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:25,848
YOUR FIRST

47
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,101
Seok-ryu!

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,605
You've been calling me
since the crack of dawn.

49
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,941
What is all of this? It smells good.

50
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,859
What else? They're side dishes.

51
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,736
Take these to Seung-hyo's house.

52
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,031
I don't want to. Did you make this
with the soy sauce I brought?

53
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,827
Yeah, I think its quality
really brings out the savoriness.

54
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,584
You're right! It's so good.

55
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,919
What did you put in here?

56
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,921
I made broth with anchovy stock,

57
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:01,175
and I mixed it with chopped green onions,
garlic, sesame oil, and soy sauce…

58
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,343
As if you'd know.

59
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,803
I might know.

60
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,971
Enough nonsense.

61
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,639
Deliver these before they cool.

62
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,349
Okay.

63
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,104
Geun-sik!

64
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,607
Come have breakfast.

65
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,624
I'm eating breakfast.

66
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,877
Do you want some too?

67
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,255
It's okay.
Rice is too heavy for breakfast.

68
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,599
It's Seok-ryu.

69
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,977
Seok-ryu!

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,145
-Aunt Hye-suk!
-Hi.

71
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,147
-It's been so long.
-I know!

72
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,858
I haven't seen you
since Seung-hyo's opening.

73
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,276
Let's meet often while I'm here.

74
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,360
-Okay.
-What is this?

75
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,488
-Mr. Choi!
-What brings you here this early?

76
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,822
I'm here to deliver food.

77
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,491
You happened to be eating too.

78
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,701
Perfect timing! My mom said to give these.

79
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,328
She did?

80
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,499
Yeah, she made so much.
You know how she makes tons of food.

81
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,209
She's always making food for us.

82
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,877
Tell her we said thank you.

83
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,128
Yes, sir!

84
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,338
Is Choisseung upstairs?

85
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,799
Yeah, of course.

86
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,842
-I'll just say hi before I go!
-Okay.

87
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,594
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thanks.

88
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,929
-Okay, go on!
-All right!

89
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,223
Why did she send so much?

90
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,727
Goodness, stir-fried zucchini
with salted shrimp.

91
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,606
Marinated perilla leaves
and pickled chili peppers.

92
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,737
Wow! It's seasoned bracken!

93
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,616
Bracken…

94
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,456
You're making toast,
but these smell too strong, right?

95
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,083
No, it's fine!

96
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,335
Eat up.

97
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,600
Jeez, he's so clueless.

98
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,645
Wow!

99
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,608
Hey, Choisseung!

100
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,823
Is he in the bathroom?

101
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,411
His room hasn't changed at all.

102
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,455
Did I get in a time machine?

103
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,542
The time capsule!

104
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,422
I'm sure he hid it in here.

105
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,301
Did you hide it here?

106
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,679
I found it!

107
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,765
This time, I'm going to
reveal your dark past.

108
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,807
YOU PROBABLY TOLD SEOK-RYU
HOW YOU FELT, RIGHT?

109
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,101
WE'VE BEEN INSEPARABLE SINCE KIDS

110
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,576
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,079
I wasn't trying to secretly read it.

112
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,124
I mean, you got to read my letter,
so it didn't feel fair.

113
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,043
That's why I read it.

114
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,093
Why would you throw it away?

115
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,553
Did you read it, right?

116
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,222
-I did.
-It was a joke.

117
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,307
A joke?

118
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,393
I guess I was serious
about teasing you back then,

119
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,353
seeing how far my pranks went.

120
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,148
Yeah! It's just a joke, right?

121
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,527
Hey, you startled me!

122
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,906
I thought it'd be funny, but it's not.

123
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,159
I have to change. Can you get out?

124
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,579
Yeah, sure! Sorry. Get dressed.

125
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,168
JANG TAE-HUI

126
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,175
What was with that letter?

127
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,722
Did he like me? But it was a joke?

128
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,559
Why would he plan a joke for 10 years?
What are they, economic reforms?

129
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,562
He could've just said it wasn't true.

130
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,772
Why did he crumple it up and toss it?

131
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,446
What? Dad hasn't come in yet.

132
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,409
ROOT DINER

133
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,340
This place hasn't changed either.

134
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,764
Wow, my girl's so good!

135
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,266
I wonder who you take after
to be this good.

136
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,685
-You.
-Me?

137
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,191
Should I taste your food
and see how good it is?

138
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,317
Okay?

139
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,527
Let's see…

140
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,655
Is it good?

141
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,991
My goodness.

142
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,785
What? Is it bad?

143
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,787
It's so good!

144
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,082
It's so good!
My precious girl, it's so good!

145
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,254
Goodness, I'm so proud of you.

146
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,889
Hey. Seok-ryu!

147
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,140
Dad.

148
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,976
What are you doing here?
Did you pick the lock to get in?

149
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,228
I entered the key code.

150
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,354
Was no one else here?

151
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,106
Why are you so flustered?

152
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,191
Are you worried there might be a thief?

153
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,443
There's nothing to steal here.

154
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,613
No, I was just worried
because the door was open.

155
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,075
Why would you come here
without telling me?

156
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,160
Dad, do you remember?

157
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,995
I used to hang around here a lot as a kid.

158
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,373
You practically lived here.

159
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,211
You'd always follow me
into the kitchen and mess around.

160
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,755
You're right.

161
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,052
In the past, you used to work at a hotel
and even worked at a big restaurant.

162
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,930
But I loved it the most
when you worked here.

163
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,683
When you worked at the hotel,

164
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,352
you wore that tall hat
and I only saw you in photos.

165
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,062
I never actually saw you work.

166
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,022
And the restaurant was too busy.

167
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,192
But I loved
that I could come here all the time.

168
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,197
It's strange,
but I still remember how I felt back then.

169
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,117
The sound of the knife cutting.

170
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,995
The low and steady warmth of the air.

171
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,747
The sound of people.

172
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,541
Seeing you work from the back.

173
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,044
And the tastiest tteokbokki
in the world.

174
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,382
That's good to hear.

175
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,427
-Dad?
-Yeah?

176
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,595
What if…

177
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,015
What if I became a cook like you?

178
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,892
What are you saying?

179
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,351
It's a relief you didn't!

180
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,770
Why?

181
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,938
I made you study hard

182
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,275
so you wouldn't have to get your hands wet
or stand in front of a hot stove.

183
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,277
Leave this kind of work to me.

184
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,656
-Seok-ryu.
-Yeah?

185
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,035
-Want some tteokbokki before you go?
-Sounds good.

186
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,412
Wait right there.

187
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,127
THE CHUNGWOO DAILY

188
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,922
Wait a second!

189
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,674
Goodness. Thank you.

190
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,598
I would've pressed "Close"
if I knew it was you.

191
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,142
That would've hurt
your performance review.

192
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,687
How's Yeon-du? Is she okay?

193
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,691
Yes, she was discharged.
She went to kindergarten this morning.

194
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,235
What a relief.

195
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,739
Kids always get sick
when the seasons change.

196
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,449
It's to worry their parents.

197
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,493
Could you transfer me
to a different department?

198
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,412
-What?
-I know you did a lot to accommodate me.

199
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,832
But the social affairs team
will be fine even without me.

200
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,920
My daughter needs me the most right now.

201
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,966
I had three kids as I stayed on this job.

202
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,052
I know. That's why I respect you.

203
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,762
I'm not trying to brag.

204
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,600
I probably would've left
if my husband weren't a freelancer.

205
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,603
It must be hard raising her on your own.

206
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,566
But kids grow up fast.

207
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,071
Give it another thought.

208
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,533
And if you still want to leave then,
I won't try to stop you.

209
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,493
The samgyejuk.

210
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,865
-Hey, Seok-ryu. It's been a while!
-Hello!

211
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,121
-Why aren't you saying hi?
-Why? I see her every day.

212
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,375
-You took your cast off.
-Yeah.

213
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,675
Thank you so much
for the soy sauce the other day.

214
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,511
It tastes absolutely amazing.
My family loves it.

215
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,596
Let me know if you need more.

216
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,932
Do you have time to come in for tea?

217
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,392
Tea?

218
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,854
We have work to talk about.
Why are you inviting her?

219
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,689
We need to go over Fresco.

220
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,733
We need to decide
on the direction and schedule.

221
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,235
Yeah, okay.

222
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,864
I was busy anyway.

223
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,033
I'm sure you're busy. You should go.

224
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,660
I'm sorry, Seok-ryu. Let's meet up later.

225
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,046
He went nuts when I said
to work things out with her.

226
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,298
Now, I'm an unwelcome guest?

227
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,217
Like me? Yeah, right.

228
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,762
Forget it.
I don't care about that letter either.

229
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,479
What's the reason?

230
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,649
I see you still ask random questions
without any context.

231
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,859
Make it so I can understand.

232
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,987
Tell me why you agreed to work with me.

233
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,115
It seemed like a good opportunity.
I thought it'd be fun to try.

234
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,910
How predictable.

235
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,578
What did you expect?

236
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,246
POMEGRANATE TREE

237
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,917
I don't know. Something more honest.

238
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,504
I know you used me as an excuse today.

239
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,132
You were silent the whole time,

240
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,219
but in front of Seok-ryu,
you said on purpose we had to work.

241
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,221
Sorry if it seemed that way.

242
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,769
Since it's turned out this way,
how about just using me?

243
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,107
-What?
-Use me the best you can.

244
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,652
It'll be nice.
I'd get to go on dates with you,

245
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,529
and you can face your feelings.

246
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,615
Do you want to be thrown out?

247
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,158
Come on.

248
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,618
I think Seok-ryu's cute.

249
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,162
Of course, you're cuter.

250
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,415
Can't I hang out
with you two cuties a bit longer?

251
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,085
You can tease me all you want,

252
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,586
but don't say anything to Seok-ryu.

253
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,510
I think you already told her
something important.

254
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,220
What?

255
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,849
But there's something you left out.

256
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,518
I should ask her to grab a bite later.

257
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,103
What did I tell her?

258
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,980
I mean, what are you going to say?

259
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,857
I'm not telling you.

260
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,774
What did I say?

261
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,943
-If I tell you, you'll let me join in?
-Tae-hui!

262
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,529
I love it when you call my name.

263
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,531
What did I say?

264
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,283
What are you going to tell her?

265
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,374
Accelerate and maintain cruising speed.

266
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,917
Proceeding to cruising speed.

267
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,175
I wondered
what you were doing at the river.

268
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,635
Who knew you'd be on a boat?

269
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,890
I passed the written test, so I need
to practice for the in-person exam.

270
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,350
You're about to overtake
the land, air, and sea.

271
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,020
What's next?
A light aircraft pilot license?

272
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:48,937
Next is…

273
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,148
-The South Pole.
-What?

274
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,277
There's a paramedic who was sent
to the research station there.

275
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,988
This license will earn
extra points for it.

276
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,908
Wow, that's so like you.

277
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:05,662
You'd walk in puddles,
mud, and wet cement as a kid,

278
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,165
always picking paths
others wouldn't travel.

279
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,709
You're finally venturing
into uncharted territory.

280
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,877
Come on.

281
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,755
Hey. Don't count your chickens
before they hatch.

282
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,468
Documents, interviews,
and personality and aptitude tests.

283
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,720
I have a long way to go to be selected.

284
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,556
I'm the one with a long way to go.

285
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:25,807
What?

286
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,310
I registered for a cooking class.

287
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,479
Holy cow.

288
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,481
I thought long and hard about it.

289
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,651
I think I want to do it.

290
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,072
No, I want to do it.

291
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:45,619
In the past, I thought studying
was your favorite thing to do.

292
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,704
But I was wrong.

293
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,542
You just liked the praise and attention
that came from studying well.

294
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,795
You went crazy for the extra stuff.

295
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,964
You've been brutally honest a lot lately.

296
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,257
Yes, but…

297
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,550
You loved to cook.

298
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,762
It was a pure and selfless love.

299
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,227
I should've known you were destined for it
when I saw you make perfect dalgonas.

300
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,314
-Are you cheering me on?
-Of course.

301
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,777
Let's celebrate today.

302
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,780
Let's call Seung-hyo over
and have a party.

303
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,031
Hey.

304
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:23,949
Hello?

305
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,617
Seung-hyo!

306
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,743
-Hey, don't.
-Wait.

307
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,206
Seok-ryu said she registered
for cooking classes today.

308
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,126
She registered for cooking classes?

309
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,586
Yeah…

310
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,049
Well, on that note,
let's have a party to celebrate tonight.

311
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,677
I can't go. I have plans.

312
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,596
Really? Okay.

313
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,808
Then, come after you're done.
I'll text you the location later.

314
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,560
Bye.

315
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,195
Why say that if he can't make it?

316
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,905
Don't you know him at all?

317
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,159
He always says he can't come but he does.

318
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,827
He really won't come today.

319
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,454
What's this?

320
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,540
Did you two fight again?

321
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,883
Mr. Choi?

322
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,596
It's nice to run into you
around the town like this.

323
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,556
I feel the same. Are you going home?

324
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,934
No, I'm thinking of getting a drink.
Do you want to join me?

325
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,440
Well…

326
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,028
This is it.

327
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,202
You live next door to Jung Mo-eum?

328
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,288
Yes, I just learned that recently.

329
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,543
Try to be understanding
if things get loud.

330
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,878
She's a good person.

331
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:00,962
I know.

332
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,425
But I feel bad about making you come here.

333
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,927
It was due to circumstances.

334
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,136
Daddy!

335
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,721
Yeon-du.

336
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,642
My girl, did you wait a long for me?

337
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,851
Yeah.

338
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,271
This is my daughter.

339
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,023
Yeon-du, say hi.

340
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,526
Hello, I'm Kang Yeon-du.

341
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,361
But who are you?

342
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,199
I'm Choi Seung-hyo.

343
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,784
I am…

344
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,829
your dad's…

345
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,539
neighborhood friend.

346
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,632
I'm sorry.

347
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,803
I'm sure misugaru wasn't the drink
you were talking about.

348
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,807
No, this is exactly what I wanted.

349
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,016
With a lot of ice too.

350
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,235
I haven't had any alcohol,
but I oddly feel like I'm getting drunk.

351
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,363
I guess this neighborhood does that?

352
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,200
It's my first time here,
but I feel like I've lived here forever.

353
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,494
It's strangely relaxing.

354
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,289
And it makes me excited.

355
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,461
I've experienced that too,
and this place is like that.

356
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,589
You're adjusting well.

357
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,176
Yes, thanks to my neighborhood friend.

358
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,143
Can I ask you why
you wanted to drink tonight?

359
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,645
-Sorry?
-Well…

360
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,274
I guess it's a habit from work.

361
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,068
I read people's faces.

362
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,362
I ask incessantly
if I'm curious about something.

363
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,908
Maybe that's why people hate reporters.

364
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,161
Well, it looks like you already knew.

365
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,872
Of course.

366
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,334
However, I'm good with the opposite too.

367
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:07,422
I'm a good listener. I can be neutral.
And I can guarantee anonymity.

368
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,843
I just thought I could be of some help.

369
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,394
It's about my friend, not me.

370
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,316
There's someone he liked a long time ago.

371
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,905
He thought he'd moved on
from his feelings for her.

372
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,575
But he's a bit confused
after seeing her again.

373
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,578
That's understandable.

374
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,875
He doesn't know what to do,
so he keeps avoiding her.

375
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,377
I think he's having a hard time.

376
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,005
Is it something that can't happen?

377
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,299
For example, is she seeing someone else?

378
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,680
She's in love with someone else.
They almost got married.

379
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,934
In any case, she's single now, right?

380
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,979
As for this woman,

381
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,897
does she know how your friend feels?

382
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,941
No.

383
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,569
But he's scared she might find out.

384
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,616
He's never confessed
his feelings to her before.

385
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,618
Why not?

386
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,996
They've always been together,

387
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,499
so he didn't know the true nature
of those feelings at first.

388
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,459
After that…

389
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,463
he was cautious
to not ruin their friendship.

390
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,133
When he did decide to tell her…

391
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,802
the timing was off.

392
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,306
And now…

393
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,645
he can't even dare to try.

394
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,483
He had a hard time
for a while because of that.

395
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,029
He'd get nauseous and dizzy.

396
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,575
He's finally settled down now

397
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,080
and doesn't want to go back to that time.

398
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,589
No wonder he didn't come today.

399
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,935
I'm so curious. How can I wait 10 years?

400
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,317
All right. Let's see here.

401
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,113
Whose letter is this?

402
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,948
It must be Seung-hyo's.

403
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,709
I knew it!

404
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,670
Just tell her that you like her.

405
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,631
Why does he make it so hard on himself?

406
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,008
I swear…

407
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,928
Jeez, he's so pathetic.

408
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,847
He's still as dumb as ever.

409
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,728
Did you hear that strange noise?

410
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,523
Not really.

411
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,024
I don't know.

412
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,652
Was I mistaken?

413
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,697
Then, is your friend going to continue

414
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,325
to pretend like he doesn't like her

415
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,411
and push her away?

416
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,956
He says he's trying for now.

417
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,625
If he were my friend,

418
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,878
I'd tell him about a swimmer I know.

419
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,757
There once was an athlete
in the 200-meter event

420
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,552
whose weakness
was being slow off the blocks.

421
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,888
But despite this, he overcame it
through his tireless efforts.

422
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,101
Even if it's a bit late,

423
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,230
I'd tell him to muster up the courage,
just like the swimmer did.

424
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,328
Get up!

425
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,496
I said get up!

426
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,458
I'm up.

427
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,545
You should wake up early in the morning
and get ready for work.

428
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,213
We're not even ready to retire.

429
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,340
What have you accomplished
to afford to be lazy?

430
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,259
Okay, stop it.

431
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,802
Stop what?

432
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,639
Thinking about all the money we've lost
is enough to keep me up at night.

433
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,434
Why are you bringing up
things from the past again?

434
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,644
The past? Things are still the same now.

435
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,899
And when did you come home last night?
I woke up to you sleeping next to me.

436
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,151
I told you. I went to a funeral.

437
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,154
Gosh, you went to a funeral
the other night and the night before.

438
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,573
You're just going around giving money.

439
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,451
This is why I hate coming home.

440
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,204
What? You have no right to be shouting!

441
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,288
Whatever.

442
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,291
Look! You're running away
because you have nothing to say!

443
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,628
-I'm not done yet! Come home early.
-I have a class reunion today!

444
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,670
Again?

445
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,047
Are you kidding me?

446
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,842
Unbelievable…

447
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,681
Why are there insufficient funds?

448
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,310
Is this a new voice phishing scam?

449
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,034
Hey, I'm saying this in advance to avoid
any misunderstanding. I'm just passing by.

450
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,453
My cooking class is near here.

451
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,788
I didn't say anything.

452
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,291
I'm trying to get
my Korean Food Craftsman certificate.

453
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,878
Don't tell my parents yet.

454
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,630
I won't.

455
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,217
Today's my first class.

456
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,388
I looked over the curriculum,
and there's a written and in-person exam.

457
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,474
And once class is over,
I get to take home whatever I make--

458
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,059
I have a meeting.

459
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,435
I'm off.

460
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,234
What was that?

461
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,612
He's the one who insisted
that I find my dream.

462
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,660
KOREAN FOOD CRAFTSMAN

463
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,125
WHAT DO KOREAN FOOD CRAFTSMAN DO?

464
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,506
-The beef and deodeok look good.
-Jeez!

465
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,258
Why did you suddenly close the window?

466
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,051
What are you doing there?

467
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
What are you doing?

468
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,220
What?

469
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:34,392
-Look at the time. Let's have the meeting.
-Isn't that for a certificate?

470
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,643
Why are you looking at that?

471
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,606
Na-yun, tell Hyeong-chan and Jeong-min
to come to the meeting room.

472
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,316
Are you learning to cook? Korean food?

473
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,567
I like Western cuisine.

474
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,777
HYEREUNG COOKING SCHOOL

475
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,702
Welcome
to the Korean Food Craftsman class.

476
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,620
Hello.

477
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,788
-Hello!
-Hello.

478
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,292
Today's our first class together.

479
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,254
The first one's always memorable
and exciting.

480
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,298
With that in mind, I'll make sure

481
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,718
to give you a very raw
and memorable first experience.

482
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,305
We'll be learning the basics
of knife skills today.

483
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,223
You'll first learn basic techniques.

484
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,352
Then, you'll start cutting radishes,
carrots, and other vegetables.

485
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,772
All right, let's pick up
the knife that's in front of you.

486
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,649
Okay, good.

487
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,027
First, place the non-slip pad
on the counter

488
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,779
and put the cutting board on top of it.

489
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,867
Good. When putting knives down, make sure
the blade always faces away from you

490
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,494
to not accidentally cut yourself.

491
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,620
That's good.

492
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,539
We're going to julienne the radish.

493
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,001
First, peel the radish.

494
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:47,173
Okay. Then, cut them into slices
about 0.2 centimeters thick.

495
00:32:55,556 --> 00:33:00,812
When preparing an omelet,
remove the chalazae from the yolk.

496
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,940
Then, strain the egg whites
through a sieve.

497
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,234
Whisk it smooth to avoid creating bubbles.

498
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:11,155
Next, coat the pan with a thin layer
of oil over low heat.

499
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,301
Hey, Mr. Choi!

500
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,554
-Over here!
-Come sit down!

501
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,974
Have you all been well?

502
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,684
Not at all.

503
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,936
Work sites have been a mess these days.

504
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,063
It was great when we worked with you.

505
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,441
What do you mean?
You hated me for being strict.

506
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,109
I'd rather have someone strict.

507
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,654
These people can't do their jobs
and always abuse their power,

508
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,614
so it's been miserable working for them.

509
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,618
Come on. You're not the type
to let a client walk all over you.

510
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,829
Hold on. Are you mocking me?

511
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,873
Well, prepare yourself.

512
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,668
I'm going to punish you
with alcohol tonight!

513
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,089
I drove tonight. I can't.

514
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,008
Call a designated driver.

515
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,302
Ma'am, can we get some soda
and another glass?

516
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,219
Okay!

517
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,263
In return, dinner's on me tonight.

518
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,890
What? Really?

519
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,477
Okay!

520
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,396
Then, instead of alcohol,

521
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,775
I'll punish you with meat instead!

522
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,109
-Open up!
-Gosh.

523
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,614
Isn't it good?

524
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,074
What is this? Why is it so good?

525
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,742
I'm quite the gourmet.

526
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,161
The taste of the meat here
is different from other places.

527
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,247
It's so juicy!

528
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,625
You know our chief's philosophy.

529
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,669
"Grease the wheels with delicious meat

530
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,922
to keep the job running smoothly."

531
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,965
-Huzzah!
-All right!

532
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,553
It's so good.

533
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,102
I don't think this will be enough.

534
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,814
Excuse me, could we have
more pork belly and short rib, please?

535
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,107
And more beef brisket too!

536
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,486
Gosh, what's this?

537
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,488
What's this? Take it.

538
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,656
Thank you very much.

539
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,116
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

540
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,701
I can't believe
you didn't have a single drink.

541
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,203
You're so dogged!

542
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,247
I'm sorry. I still have work left to do.

543
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,916
You're drunk.
Don't go for another round of drinks.

544
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,459
Make sure you go home, okay?

545
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,294
Gosh, stop your nagging!

546
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,422
Leave your car at home next time
and come on foot.

547
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,007
Like this.

548
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,008
Yes, sir.

549
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,343
Okay, see you next time.

550
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,346
-Goodness.
-Chief! This way!

551
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,557
I looked just like you when I was young!

552
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,269
-See you later! Bye!
-Bye!

553
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,353
Thank you for the meal.

554
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,855
-Sure. Good night.
-Bye.

555
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,824
-Sweetie, you're so cute!
-Yes?

556
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,492
Over there.

557
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,870
Do you want to come over?

558
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,872
Where do you live?

559
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,054
Mom, don't go!

560
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,517
Seung-hyo?

561
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,480
What are you doing here?

562
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,241
Thanks for the drink.

563
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,200
It's nothing.

564
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,952
I'm sorry I surprised you.

565
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,538
Yeah, you startled me to death.

566
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,209
Why were you sitting
outside our house at this hour?

567
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,337
I didn't know what to do,
so I was thinking.

568
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,421
What?

569
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,633
To be honest, I saw you.

570
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,927
You were with some woman.

571
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,152
Is that what you've decided to do?

572
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,864
Yeah, it is.

573
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,742
It'll put me at ease.

574
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,623
Goodness…

575
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,626
I'm ashamed you had to see me like this.

576
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,716
I know it's shameless to ask…

577
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,721
but keep it a secret from my wife for now.

578
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,472
And Seok-ryu.

579
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,768
She'll cause a riot if she finds out.

580
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,187
Yeah…

581
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,571
-How does it look?
-Bring it down.

582
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,488
-Down?
-Yeah.

583
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,823
It has to be seen from here.

584
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,742
-That looks nice.
-Yeah.

585
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,661
Who is it?

586
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,956
Is she serious?

587
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,624
Chantto Baegi

588
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,168
You don't know Lee Chan-won?

589
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,378
I haven't been in Korea for that long.

590
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,340
-I guess he's cute.
-He's not just cute.

591
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,760
Seriously, this one poster
really brightens up the place!

592
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,969
My eyesight's improving too!

593
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,804
It's practically her religion now.

594
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,097
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

595
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,974
Merciful Buddha!

596
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,559
I get it.

597
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,270
This piece of paper is much better
than my actual husband.

598
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,688
-Of course.
-Why?

599
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,899
-Did you fight with your husband again?
-Yeah.

600
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,651
You know what? Only fight
if there's a chance of rehabilitation.

601
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,863
I can't expect someone who never clears
his own dirty dishes to do anything.

602
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,990
Does he eat all three meals at home?

603
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,658
-Yeah!
-Goodness.

604
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,744
-All three meals?
-That's right.

605
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,870
-My goodness.
-Hey.

606
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:36,540
I said, "Let's go out to eat," and he said
he hated the smell of foods with MSG.

607
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,918
You know how much MSG I put in his soups?

608
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,546
He's lucky it wasn't rat poison!

609
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,464
I know!

610
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,049
Husbands don't know that.

611
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,384
They all don't.

612
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,843
Maybe you don't add enough.

613
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,720
I add a whole bunch in!

614
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,846
Really?

615
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,516
Gosh, I'm the most envious of Hye-suk.

616
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,892
Why me?

617
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:59,063
You both independently do your own work.
You live apart and are cool about it.

618
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,898
It's so cool!

619
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,317
-It is.
-I bet you two don't even fight.

620
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,152
No, we don't fight.

621
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,239
Hey, her family is
in a different world altogether.

622
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,574
It's been hard
to even see my husband around lately.

623
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,076
-Why?
-I don't know.

624
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,911
I don't know. Who knows what he's up to?

625
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,538
He always comes home at dawn.

626
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,997
What? Dawn?

627
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,666
He's staying out all night!

628
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,752
Mi-suk, some men stay out
late enough to see the morning dew.

629
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,712
-That's a serious problem!
-Of course!

630
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,591
Why are you being so serious?
Forget it. It's not like that.

631
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,427
-He has business--
-What business?

632
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,178
Funerals, class reunions, and what else?

633
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,639
-Yeah, those are the best excuses.
-Yeah!

634
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,682
My goodness.

635
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,935
Mi-suk, you need to be careful!

636
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,271
He could be having an affair!

637
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,231
What are you talking about?

638
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,901
-Hey! What's wrong with you?
-Are you okay?

639
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,486
-It got everywhere!
-Unbelievable.

640
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,490
How many funerals did he go to?
One, two, three…

641
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,033
He went to three funerals.

642
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,326
Wipe your mouth.

643
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,661
No, wait! Is that okay?

644
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,288
-Is that a rag?
-It's a cloth.

645
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,789
It doesn't smell. Wipe your mouth.

646
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,334
That's right. Is your shop taking a break?

647
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,044
What?

648
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,671
It hasn't been open for days.

649
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,672
What?

650
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,300
Hey, look into it quick. Okay?

651
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,719
What are we going to do?

652
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,958
SHORT-TERM CREDIT LOAN
REVOLVING CREDIT

653
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,434
Hello.

654
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,102
Hi.

655
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,231
Wait.

656
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,152
There are two seats here.
Would you like to sit?

657
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,160
Thank you.

658
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,038
Not at all.
It wasn't my chair to begin with.

659
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,261
Excuse me,

660
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,721
I usually try not to interfere.

661
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,600
But you shouldn't be here
while Yeon-du is home alone.

662
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,269
Yeon-du…

663
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,314
went to an overnight camp
for kindergarteners.

664
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,774
I see…

665
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,320
-She went to camp.
-Yes.

666
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,323
I'm sorry.

667
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,827
It's fine.

668
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,954
But…

669
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,665
you're having dinner pretty late.

670
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,749
Yes.

671
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,211
I was out on a call and had to
go around looking for hospitals.

672
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,047
Did the hospital refuse a patient?

673
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,507
Yeah.

674
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,842
I'm sure you know,

675
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,595
but there's a lot of patients
and a shortage of medical staff.

676
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,430
That's the current situation.

677
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,390
What happened to the patient?

678
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,893
I made sure the patient
was examined and admitted.

679
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,479
I'm relieved to hear that.

680
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,777
You're really impressive.

681
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,737
Excuse me?

682
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,072
What gives?

683
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,283
Is this a "love your enemy" type of thing?

684
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:45,164
It's not that. You know how to give
honest criticism in a kind way.

685
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,419
I hope you'll continue
to look after Yeon-du.

686
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,256
Tell her to give me another chance.

687
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:58,510
If you've said anything bad about me,
I ask that you take it back.

688
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,430
I didn't do anything like that at all.

689
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,390
Okay, then.

690
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,685
By the way…

691
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,855
If you don't mind me asking,

692
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,900
but does Yeon-du have any other family?

693
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,696
Yeon-du's mom is very far away.

694
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,540
I think you're a really good dad.

695
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,544
Me?

696
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,629
Yes.

697
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,715
You raised your daughter well.

698
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,177
Look at how smart and cute she is.

699
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,223
Right?

700
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,101
Isn't she cute?

701
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,022
She's the most precious person
in the world to me.

702
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:59,738
I could give everything up for her.

703
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,490
Everything.

704
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,368
Don't give anything up.

705
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,042
My dad passed away when I was young.

706
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,712
So I know what it's like.

707
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,049
If my mom ever sacrificed
anything for me,

708
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,176
I hated that the most.

709
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,223
I'm just saying.

710
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,688
Then, can I play with Yeon-du
from time to time again?

711
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,649
Of course,

712
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,234
as long as it's okay with her.

713
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,152
Really?

714
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,905
Thank you. Can you tell me what she likes?

715
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,282
I want to win her back.

716
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,660
-What does Yeon-du like?
-Yes.

717
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:51,373
She liked ghosts and zombies in the past.

718
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,834
What? You're starting to slur…

719
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,545
Isn't good pronunciation
important to news reporters?

720
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,175
Yeon-du likes aliens. She likes aliens.

721
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,347
Dan-ho?

722
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,186
How much can you usually drink?

723
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,395
What?

724
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,027
One can of beer.

725
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,779
What he's saying and doing don't line up.

726
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,824
Goodness.

727
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,328
Dan-ho? What do I do?

728
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,163
Goodness!

729
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,374
Assisting a drunk person home.

730
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,752
This is off-the-clock work!

731
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:42,466
If he weren't Yeon-du's dad,
I would've just left him.

732
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:48,263
Dan-ho, I don't think
you should drink for a while.

733
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,391
Just stick to the Pine Ear Drink! Got it?

734
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,658
I'm sure he won't freeze to death, right?

735
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,821
Are you insane?

736
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:49,408
Is this how you treat someone
after a hard day's work?

737
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,411
A hard day's work? You were working?

738
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,955
Where did you go off gallivanting
after closing the shop?

739
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,791
What on earth have you been up to?

740
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,296
You applied for revolving credit?

741
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,839
You took out a cash advance?

742
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,552
Hey, you have eyes. Look at this.

743
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,096
The bean sprouts were on sale
for 1,500 won.

744
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,848
The pork belly cost 9,900 won.

745
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,725
The gas bill is 3,180 won!

746
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:21,481
I keep track of these trivial details
as we've tightened our belts.

747
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,900
How could you?

748
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,570
How could you mess up again?

749
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,030
I'm home.

750
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,203
-Mom, what's wrong?
-I can't put up with your dad anymore.

751
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,288
I'm at my limit.

752
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,624
What's wrong? Dad, what is it?

753
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,167
No, it's nothing.

754
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,836
You close the shop
and stay out all night.

755
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,756
And you messed up with money again!

756
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,635
Tell me why.

757
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,179
Did you co-sign another friend's loan?

758
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,930
No.

759
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:54,848
Wait…

760
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,017
Were you gambling?

761
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,435
No, it's not like that.

762
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,478
Then…

763
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,230
-Are you having an affair?
-Honey!

764
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,275
You really don't trust me?

765
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,277
How can I trust you
when you act like this?

766
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,154
How could you say…

767
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,992
How can you back me
into a corner like this every time?

768
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,412
I had no choice…

769
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,916
I had no other choice but to do that.

770
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,379
Dad, what is it? What's going on?

771
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,173
There was an accident.

772
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,473
Excuse me, sir?

773
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,850
Yes?

774
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,436
What is it?

775
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,397
I think something's in the food.

776
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,691
I think it's a hair.
You should take a look.

777
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,194
That's not possible.

778
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,073
-I'm so sorry!
-Seriously?

779
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,074
Were you burned?

780
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,619
Let me see.
You should've been more careful!

781
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,456
-I'm sorry. Let's go to the hospital.
-Let go of me!

782
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,378
I'm just worried you're really hurt.

783
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,255
Of course, I'm hurt!

784
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,173
I'm hurt, and my watch…

785
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,636
My watch stopped.

786
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,764
-Watch?
-Come on!

787
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,726
The watch… I'm sorry.

788
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:26,148
Are you trying to brush this off
with just an apology?

789
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,609
That watch costs 30 million won!

790
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,194
It does?

791
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,239
No. It costs way more, mister.

792
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,451
Do you think you can buy
this watch with just money?

793
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,495
To buy this, you need
to build a purchase history

794
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,581
by buying several items from this brand.

795
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,958
It's a top-of-the-line luxury brand.

796
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,794
That means

797
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,381
even if I sold you off, I still
won't be able to afford this watch.

798
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,258
Don't try to touch it.

799
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,388
Okay, I understand.

800
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:04,102
I'll cover the cost of repairs then.

801
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,689
Hey, he kills my precious watch
and wants to cover the cost of repairs.

802
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,359
Look, the thing about this watch is

803
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,153
he bought it less than a week ago.

804
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,614
It's totally brand new.

805
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,532
Then, what should I…

806
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,743
Reimburse the full amount
before I sue you!

807
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,286
-You're so frustrating.
-Gosh.

808
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,497
Sir…

809
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:44,434
DESIGNATED DRIVERS

810
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,151
You have been assigned.
Proceed to the pickup location.

811
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,867
Sir, did you call for a designated driver?

812
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,118
Yeah.

813
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,955
I'm sorry.

814
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,623
This way, sir.

815
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,801
Sir, we're at the location you provided.

816
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,887
Sir, we're here.

817
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,099
Sir!

818
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,353
Sir!

819
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,231
-Sweetie, why are you so cute?
-Yes?

820
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,067
-Where's your car?
-Car? Is it here?

821
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,443
Over there!

822
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,405
Do you want to come over?

823
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,532
-Where do you live?
-My house?

824
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,203
Ma'am, we're here.

825
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,455
Here's your key.

826
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,542
You're so annoying.

827
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,252
Take care, ma'am.

828
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,812
Hello, it's me.

829
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,398
I deposited 20 million won just now.

830
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,150
Please accept this for now.

831
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,819
I'll try to get the rest somehow.

832
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,363
Just give me a few more days.

833
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,620
So to pay them, you took money
from our living expense account?

834
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,747
You took out a credit card loan

835
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,457
and worked as a driver?

836
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,627
To handle that alone…

837
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,128
Are you a fool?

838
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,756
Do you have any sense at all?

839
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,008
You do think I'm a fool.

840
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,512
You look down on me for being incompetent.

841
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,390
When did I ever?

842
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,726
Well, all the time.

843
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,562
With me, it's always money.

844
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,274
All you ever talk to me about is money.

845
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,487
But gosh,
if I were to tell you about this,

846
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,072
what would you think of me then?

847
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,742
What if I got sued
and had to close the shop?

848
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,745
If I lost even the tiny bit of income

849
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,622
that I'm earning now,

850
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,166
what would that make me?

851
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,670
The only thing I know how to do…

852
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,177
All I know how to do
is just make tteokbokki.

853
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,889
If I can't even do that,
then what does that make me?

854
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,602
Well? What can I contribute
to this family?

855
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,688
There's nothing else in my life.

856
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,523
Dad…

857
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:41,027
I'll do whatever I can
to pay that money back.

858
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,779
Who asked you to?

859
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:48,451
-That's not what's important right now--
-Please, Mi-suk. Stop scolding me!

860
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,706
It hurts when I'm hit too, you know.

861
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,000
Okay? It hurts me too.

862
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,293
I'll be home later.

863
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,265
Mom.

864
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,159
Dad!

865
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,535
Hey, why did you…

866
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,787
Are you okay?

867
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,553
Dad.

868
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,971
I'm okay.

869
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,973
I'm all right.

870
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,354
You always did this for me
when I was a kid.

871
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,524
Now, I'm doing it for you.

872
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,152
I've grown up a lot, haven't I?

873
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,869
I'm sorry, Seok-ryu.

874
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,913
Why would you be sorry?

875
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,873
They're the bad guys.

876
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,167
Let's just go to the cops.

877
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,753
Full compensation is ridiculous.

878
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,338
We can't report it.

879
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:28,301
They could close our shop
for violating the Food Sanitation Act.

880
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,600
I have no right to be a father, do I?

881
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,353
Gosh, I have a beautiful daughter,

882
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,731
but I've never bought you a nice outfit.

883
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,277
I couldn't even send you any allowance
when you were studying overseas.

884
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,489
And I'm still…

885
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,784
causing you to worry over money.

886
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,498
How can you place value on that
with money? It should be with love.

887
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,835
What about me? I'm unemployed.

888
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,795
I don't have the right
to be your daughter?

889
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,839
What are you talking about?

890
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,257
Hey! You're…

891
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,177
You'll always have the right
to be my daughter.

892
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,389
No renewal is needed,
and it can't be cancelled.

893
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,268
You'll always be my daughter, okay?

894
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,603
It's the same for me.

895
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,441
Bae Geun-sik will always be my dad.

896
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,501
BLACKMAILERS
POLICE STATION

897
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,754
BAD GUYS

898
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,553
We can't report it.

899
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,891
They could close our shop
for violating the Food Sanitation Act.

900
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,852
Damn it, I can't do this or that.

901
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,687
I'm going to lose my mind.

902
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,571
"Fish cake soup, hair, watch."

903
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,536
If only we had security cameras
in the shop…

904
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,291
Security camera!

905
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,588
BEST CLEANERS

906
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,510
Hello!

907
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,221
Hey, Seok-ryu!

908
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,306
-Are you dropping off clothes?
-No.

909
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,559
Can I see some footage
from your security camera?

910
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,229
-You want to see too?
-Did someone else come by?

911
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,813
Seung-hyo already came by for it.

912
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,857
What's going on?

913
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,820
BAE SEOK-RYU

914
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,368
-Are you the son of Root Diner's owner?
-Yes.

915
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,496
Is the burn on your hand okay?

916
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,789
Of course not.

917
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,125
Let's resolve the watch issue first.
We'll discuss this later.

918
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,210
Okay.

919
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:11,130
First, take the remaining money.

920
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,969
Your father said
he couldn't get the money.

921
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,429
You must've worked hard for this.

922
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,099
I'm sorry, but before you take it,

923
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,851
could I see the watch my father broke?

924
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,729
The watch? Why?

925
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,565
Since we're covering the full cost,

926
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,191
I'd like to at least see

927
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,318
what this expensive watch looks like.

928
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,861
I'm sure he does.

929
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,030
Yeah, okay.

930
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,950
He'll never be able
to afford it himself.

931
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,037
So this is the watch. Wow.

932
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,040
This is an Audemar
Constantine Philip Mills.

933
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,834
He must've heard of it before.

934
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,087
Of course. It's one of the top
luxury watches in the world.

935
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,297
Wow…

936
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,841
I have the same watch.

937
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,759
What?

938
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,637
How interesting.

939
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,473
I received an award recently.

940
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,893
This watch company sponsored the awards
and gave me one as a gift.

941
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,814
This is a new model that just came out.

942
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,442
The serial number starts with 245D.

943
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:17,488
But… this one doesn't.

944
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,574
It starts with 215D.

945
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,118
-It's different?
-I don't know.

946
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,413
This chronograph is so crude.

947
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,957
And why does the blue dial look so dull?

948
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,878
The stainless steel
should've been brush finished.

949
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,130
Why is it so shiny?

950
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:39,093
Goodness.
This is just a cheap knock-off.

951
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,179
Where did you get this?

952
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,597
What would you even know?

953
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,397
Do you know where that is?

954
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,860
It would be nice
if we could zoom there a little.

955
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,112
Yes. Just like that.

956
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,449
Hey, what is this? Who are you?

957
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,451
No, let's keep watching. It gets better.

958
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,577
Okay.

959
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:09,123
I see. That's how?

960
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,253
Wow.

961
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,883
You prepared the foreign object
and put it in the soup.

962
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,010
You called the owner over

963
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,471
and deliberately spilled
the soup on your watch.

964
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,722
Wow.

965
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,141
You must've practiced a lot.

966
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,185
And?

967
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,563
That video isn't proof
that we put something in the food.

968
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,481
Yeah.

969
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,401
We recorded everything.
The hair and the damaged watch!

970
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,485
Proof?

971
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,821
I'm glad you said that.

972
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:42,990
You see the time stamp on the footage?
It says 11:59 a.m.

973
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,200
Take a look.

974
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:49,789
This means when you went into the shop,
it was at least after 12 p.m.

975
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:56,421
So why is your broken watch
stopped at 11:45?

976
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,338
Why is that?

977
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,006
You should've checked it.

978
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,049
Shut up.

979
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,593
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

980
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,721
What took you so long? I was waiting.

981
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,431
Who's this guy?

982
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,807
Are you working with him?

983
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,309
Let me introduce myself.

984
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,688
I'm Kang Dan-ho
with The Chungwoo Daily.

985
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,733
THE CHUNGWOO DAILY
KANG DAN-HO

986
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,443
I've really wanted to meet you two.

987
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,738
I received a tip from someone.

988
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,200
Why is the quality
of this footage so good?

989
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,078
A lot of thieves have stolen clothes
from the dry cleaner.

990
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,539
-So he installed the best camera model.
-I see.

991
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,875
But that's not what's important.

992
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,461
I used this photo to try
and identify these two.

993
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,378
Right.

994
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:41,048
They claimed they had NerTube channel
with 100,000 subscribers.

995
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,175
But that was a lie.

996
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,971
Here. They have an empty channel
with 30 subscribers.

997
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,724
They likely use it as bait for blackmail.

998
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,935
Yeah, I'm sure there are
other victims of the same con.

999
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,062
I think so too.

1000
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,148
They're probably older…

1001
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,650
Unfamiliar with NerTube…

1002
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,194
Small business owners.

1003
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,243
What are you doing? Hey!

1004
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,161
See? I knew it.

1005
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,079
The burn on your hand was a lie too.

1006
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,709
The owner spilled soup on his hand too,
but he was fine.

1007
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,296
I looked into it,
and there were similar incidents nearby.

1008
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,340
Despicable crimes that prey

1009
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:25,468
on the weak and powerless
because they can't touch big franchises.

1010
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:30,807
Most recently, I heard a watch
stopped working at a gomtang restaurant.

1011
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:36,187
I think I can smell ox bone soup
from the strap.

1012
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,314
Ma'am?

1013
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,274
Yes, Seung-hyo?

1014
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:44,612
I'm sorry. I should call you
President Choi now, right?

1015
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,531
Thanks for lending us the projector.

1016
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,535
Their faces
are being recorded on camera, right?

1017
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,579
Of course!

1018
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,584
We're screwed.

1019
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,672
Dan-ho!

1020
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,050
Wait for me!

1021
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,095
-Call me later!
-Okay!

1022
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,236
Let go of me!

1023
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,958
Why is he so fast?

1024
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,006
Hey, you expect to get a story
at this rate?

1025
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:48,718
Goodness.

1026
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,055
Watch out.

1027
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,478
Are you okay? Hey.

1028
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,483
Hey.

1029
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,912
Damn it.

1030
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,838
Hey.

1031
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,178
How dare you do that to my dad?

1032
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,141
Who in the world are you?

1033
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,268
Damn it.

1034
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,358
Hey, is your head okay?

1035
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,610
-Are you hurt?
-I'm okay. I'm not hurt.

1036
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,196
Hey, your nose is bleeding…

1037
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,740
That bastard.

1038
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,076
Hey, this isn't because of him.

1039
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,411
I overdid it the past few days.
I'm just tired.

1040
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,624
Hey, stop the blood with this.

1041
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,584
You'll get blood on it.
Isn't it expensive?

1042
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,835
That's not important.

1043
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,004
Why would you come here? It's dangerous.

1044
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,382
What about you?
You just got your cast off

1045
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,968
and you're out here doing flying kicks.

1046
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,260
Seriously?

1047
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,350
Jeez!

1048
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:23,270
-You the jerk who took my dad's money?
-Yeah, that's him.

1049
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,982
Uphold our family's honor
and get revenge.

1050
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,275
No! I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

1051
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,235
Kill him!

1052
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,283
What?

1053
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,286
You caught them?

1054
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:46,419
Okay, I'll be right there.

1055
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,337
Yes, I'm coming right now.

1056
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,047
Who was it? What did they say?

1057
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,466
They caught the men who blackmailed me.

1058
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:56,887
They were con artists.

1059
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:02,184
Honey, I'm going to the police station.

1060
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:04,437
What are you doing?

1061
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,648
Why are you hitting me?

1062
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,692
Does it hurt? Does it?

1063
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:11,777
You deserve more!

1064
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:13,779
Honey…

1065
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,156
What was that?

1066
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,283
Just tteokbokki?

1067
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,244
The only thing I know how to do…

1068
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,375
All I know how to do
is just make tteokbokki.

1069
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,004
If I can't even do that,
then what does that make me?

1070
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:34,341
Well? What can I
contribute to this family?

1071
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,053
There's nothing else in my life.

1072
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,680
Don't you know
how special that tteokbokki is?

1073
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,557
You've spent decades in front of a stove.

1074
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,311
We raised our kids on that precious food.

1075
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,979
What do you mean it's just tteokbokki?

1076
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,230
How could you say that?

1077
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,232
Mi-suk…

1078
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,526
There's nothing in your life?

1079
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,861
Then, what about us?

1080
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,990
Do I, Seok-ryu,
and Dong-jin mean nothing to you?

1081
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:01,786
No, you all mean everything to me.

1082
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,622
You're all too good for me.

1083
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:08,542
I'm not even wishing for anything big now.

1084
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:13,547
I just want to take care
of our family and make them happy.

1085
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,136
But it's so hard.

1086
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,389
Why is it so hard
to live an ordinary life?

1087
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:24,725
That's the greatest dream of all.

1088
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,728
It's the most meaningful
and valuable dream.

1089
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,358
But you know dreams come true, right?

1090
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,528
Mi-suk, I'm sorry.

1091
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,697
And thank you.

1092
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,574
Come here.

1093
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,411
As long as you get it, it's fine.

1094
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,956
So stop crying now.

1095
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,750
Let's go to the station.

1096
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:50,793
You're going too?

1097
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,462
Of course. Wherever we go,
we'll go together.

1098
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,465
We'll go on picnics
and see flowers on nice days.

1099
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,801
If we're sick,
we'll visit the hospital.

1100
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:01,262
Whether it's Heaven, Hell,

1101
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:03,305
or wherever the heavens send us,

1102
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,599
we'll go together in the afterlife.

1103
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,687
Because I'm your wife.

1104
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:11,939
And we're a family.

1105
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:15,317
Okay. Let's go together.

1106
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,486
-Okay. Let's go.
-Wait.

1107
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,697
Let me take this. I'll kill those jerks.

1108
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,698
-Honey.
-What?

1109
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,449
You'll end up in jail.

1110
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,243
You won't go with me?

1111
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,619
Honey, I love you.

1112
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,415
-I need those!
-There's no time. Let's go.

1113
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,752
HYEREUNG POLICE STATION

1114
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,757
My dad's coming.

1115
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,676
Okay.

1116
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:47,141
I'll have this dry-cleaned
and give it back to you.

1117
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,767
Forget it. Just throw it away.

1118
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,854
You have money to burn?
You can't throw it away.

1119
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,856
It won't take long.

1120
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,566
Do whatever you want.

1121
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,611
Thanks for today.

1122
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:02,448
I didn't even know
that was happening to my dad.

1123
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:05,826
I was so happy
about finding what I wanted to do.

1124
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,661
You're better than me.

1125
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:11,248
I've always been better than you.
And your dad's not a stranger.

1126
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:15,753
What about me?

1127
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,382
Am I a stranger to you?

1128
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:24,178
-What?
-You've been distant lately towards me.

1129
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:26,555
Are you avoiding me?

1130
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,352
It bothers me when you act like this.

1131
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:34,605
You're distant and awkward.
It's not like old times.

1132
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,234
It can't be like old times forever.

1133
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,819
We're adults now.

1134
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:45,074
You have your life and I have mine.

1135
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,285
Let's stop staying stuck in the past.

1136
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,622
Stop doing childish things
like knocking on my window.

1137
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,333
Let's respect each other's privacy.

1138
01:10:58,879 --> 01:10:59,713
I'll get going.

1139
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:04,695
Stop doing childish things
like knocking on my window.

1140
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,156
Let's respect each other's privacy.

1141
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:34,099
If I could crumple up feelings
like a mere letter,

1142
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,478
then could I have been
more comfortable around you?

1143
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,487
HYEREUNG COOKING SCHOOL

1144
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,073
Since cooking is my profession,

1145
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:53,494
people always ask me
how to make their food taste better.

1146
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,372
I always give them the same answer.

1147
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,291
If you think about the person
you're cooking for,

1148
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,710
it becomes more fun
and the food tastes better.

1149
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:06,799
The dish we'll make more fun
and taste better today is

1150
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,301
jijim nureumjeok.

1151
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,302
What?

1152
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,013
KOREAN FOOD CRAFTSMAN CLASS
JIJIM NUREUMJEOK

1153
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,028
Jeez, you scared me.

1154
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:29,947
What?

1155
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,450
-What were you doing here?
-I was waiting for you. What?

1156
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,995
-Why?
-I mean, you helped my dad.

1157
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,540
And I wanted to repay
the favor for this and that.

1158
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,668
Here, take this.

1159
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,545
What is it?

1160
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:46,630
It's the first dish I made
in my cooking class.

1161
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,051
Why are you giving it to me?

1162
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,351
You like these.

1163
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,441
Seung-hyo, how about some japchae?

1164
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:07,067
Do you want…

1165
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,027
Gosh, what do we do?

1166
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:12,948
He won't eat any Korean food.

1167
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:15,742
I made all the holiday dishes,
but he doesn't like any of them.

1168
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:18,912
So he ate eggs
and toast again today. Yeah.

1169
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,038
He's just not used to it.

1170
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,500
I should've done what I could
to make Korean food for him in France.

1171
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,714
Eat this. It's good.

1172
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:30,674
No.

1173
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:34,595
Doesn't this look like a rainbow?

1174
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:39,475
A rainbow?

1175
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,351
Yeah, a rainbow.

1176
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,103
A rainbow.

1177
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,730
He keeps saying "rainbow."

1178
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,649
Goodness! Hye-suk!

1179
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,652
Seung-hyo's eating!
The rainbow! He's eating it now!

1180
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,071
My gosh! He's eating now!

1181
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,782
You brat, you should've fed him
different foods!

1182
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,995
Pan-fried skewers that look like rainbows.

1183
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,625
This was the first Korean dish
you ate here.

1184
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,752
Why did you remember that?

1185
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,962
I didn't remember it. I just…

1186
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:10,756
It came to mind.

1187
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,549
We've been friends for years.

1188
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:17,304
I bet I know more about you
than your parents do.

1189
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,225
You know me?

1190
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,519
You?

1191
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:25,896
-What?
-Seok-ryu…

1192
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:29,775
Your memories don't mean anything.

1193
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,443
They're all in the past.

1194
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,112
So stop bothering me
by reminding me of them.

1195
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,573
Why do you have to say it like that?

1196
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,075
Do you think I'm a pushover?

1197
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:42,287
I told you. We're not kids anymore.

1198
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,373
We're in our thirties now.

1199
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,125
We're not five anymore.
So why do you keep following me?

1200
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,128
Why do you keep lingering around me?

1201
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,547
I didn't linger.

1202
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,798
I'm begging you.

1203
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,176
Just leave me alone.

1204
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,929
Stay out of my life from now on.

1205
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,097
No!

1206
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,975
I'm going to butt in all I want!

1207
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:07,104
Did you ask for my permission
before coming to my house back then?

1208
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:09,314
I'm going to keep
sticking my nose in your life.

1209
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,819
Because we're close.
I'm allowed to do that!

1210
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,113
Stop driving me crazy!

1211
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,367
Back then and now,

1212
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,786
you keep doing this…

1213
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:26,915
so I feel like…

1214
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,086
I'm going to lose my mind because of you!

1215
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,714
I know all of Seung-hyo's firsts.

1216
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,382
Here.

1217
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,176
You go to a bathhouse.

1218
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:20,677
-Then, you drink this.
-Yeah!

1219
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,473
Seung-hyo, try it. It's good.

1220
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,941
The first time he had banana milk.

1221
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,234
Good, right?

1222
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,614
No! I won't do it! I don't want to!

1223
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,949
The first time he started swimming.

1224
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:49,289
What the hell?

1225
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,378
-Choisseung?
-Why are you staring at the ground?

1226
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,588
What's with you?
How are you suddenly taller than me?

1227
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,549
What have you been eating
in France during the break?

1228
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,803
The first time he became taller than me.

1229
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,763
How annoying.

1230
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,518
My turn?

1231
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,897
You're on a deserted island.

1232
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,649
What three things would you take?

1233
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:18,735
Fire-making tools, a water distiller,
and a Swiss Army knife.

1234
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:21,363
She answered so seriously.

1235
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:23,198
It's my turn now.

1236
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,827
Choisseung?

1237
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,287
Do you have a crush on anyone right now?

1238
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,256
He does.

1239
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,466
He does! He likes someone!

1240
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,509
He does.

1241
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:43,802
Who is it?

1242
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,596
Hey! Does she study architecture too?

1243
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,473
I think I know.
Does she go to your school?

1244
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,726
Is she in the same class?

1245
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:51,768
I don't know.

1246
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:54,563
What do you mean?
Who else would know if you don't?

1247
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,858
The only thing I didn't know

1248
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,026
was who his first love was.

1249
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:30,766
Hey.

1250
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,644
Stop right there.

1251
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:35,854
Hey!

1252
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:58,835
What you said earlier…

1253
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,215
what did you mean?

1254
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,359
YOUR FIRST

1255
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:28,532
YOUR FIRST LOVE

1256
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,569
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1257
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,613
Why did you even show up here?

1258
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,156
And why now of all times?

1259
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,909
We have to kill that jerk.

1260
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,452
I want to kill him more.

1261
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,746
I'll kill this bastard and go to jail.

1262
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,956
Hey, you bastard!

1263
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,875
You came to eat at a hotel for work.

1264
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,543
You're a great businessman.

1265
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,461
Don't say her name anymore.

1266
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,797
Don't keep showing up either.

1267
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,341
It's already over between you two.

1268
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,720
Seung-hyo, you have to
save yourself from unrequited love.

1269
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:33,555
Even I can't rescue you.

1270
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:35,515
I won't delay it any longer.

1271
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:37,225
I'm going to say it this time.

1272
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,690
