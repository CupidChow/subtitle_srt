[Mi-suk humming]

180
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,815
A hundred rolls of kimbap.

181
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,526
Where did this incredible order come from?

182
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,987
I don't know.
They're snacks for some TV shoot.

183
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,406
They'll pick them up at 6:00 p.m.

184
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,325
Is that so?
I'll ask what they're shooting later.

185
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,371
So you've decided to leave Seok-ryu be?

186
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,124
-Yeah.
-Really?

187
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,167
What for?

188
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,045
It's called the Romeo and Juliet effect.

189
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,799
They say love becomes more intense
the more the parents interfere.

190
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,843
[laughingly] What does that
have to do with this?

191
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,802
Keep listening.

192
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,597
It's an absolute truth that applies
to other areas as well, not just love.

193
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,933
The more parents oppose
and try to control their child,

194
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,726
the more the child rebels.

195
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,937
Yeah, you're right.
You made a good choice.

196
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,107
You should be as gentle
when rolling kimbap too.

197
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,818
If you try to keep things in by force,
the sides…

[Mi-suk humming]

199
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,450
Seok-ryu won't last long.

200
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,951
How do you know that?

201
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,120
Not just anyone can be unemployed.

202
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,330
She's been diligent her whole life.

203
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,627
She'll end up caving in on her own
with a slight nudge.

204
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,046
I'm waiting for that moment.

205
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,049
It'll come soon.

206
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,927
We need to make 100. How can you eat that?

207
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,847
It's so good. I'm just tasting it.

208
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,098
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

209
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,016
Hurry up!

WATCH TV

222
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,735
They're not doing it right.
You can't do it like that.

-What's up?
-I'm busy. Bye.

229
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,609
Wait. I didn't even tell you why I called.
What if it's important?

230
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,319
What is it?

231
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,114
The one with straight hair was the ghost.

232
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,031
I'm hanging up.

233
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,992
[Seok-ryu] Wait! It's important.

00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,287
-Let's go read comic books.
-You may not know this.

235
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,372
But people with jobs work on weekdays.

236
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,124
Hey, I didn't mean now.

237
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,794
I plan to be there
from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.

My best friend.

247

My very close and long-time friend!

248
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,237
What's with all the flattery?

249
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,823
I didn't even get most of it.

250
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,827
Mo-eum, you're so gloomy.
Did you have a hard day?

251
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,205
Seok-ryu, you're so cheerful.
Did you have fun doing nothing?

252
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,123
Of course.

253
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,083
What do you want to read?

254
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,835
I got something from every genre.

255
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,378
Romance? Martial arts? Shonen manga?

256
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,964

We're in a public space
in my neighborhood.

I've never seen anyone so brave.

263
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,647
Right?

264
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,733
I took a peek earlier.

265
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,277
See Rose of Bliss?
It looked pretty good.

266
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,571
Grab it when no one's watching.

267
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,323
Pass it to me when you're done.
Okay? Go.

00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,574
Now. No one's watching.

-Right now.
-Seok-ryu?

270
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,162
That's not the "red" I was talking about.

271

Things like that.

00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,168

You came. You said you wouldn't.

280
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,029
I didn't come for you.
There's a book I wanted to read.

281
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,407
Really? What book is it?

282
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,201
Well… Here it is. This is what I wanted.

283
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,036
The book you wanted…

284
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,621
was "Princess"?

[faint laughter]

286
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,878
Wow.

287
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,006
What?
You have a problem with my tastes?

288
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,842
No, I have no prejudices.

289
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,430
But you liked tragic love stories

290
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,389
and sad endings?

291
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,890
Yeah, he does.

292
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,851
How do you know that?

293
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,935
I just do.

294
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,938
[sighs] A weirdo next to an oddball.

295
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,942
You two should stick together.
You'll bother less people that way.

00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,903
He picks a fight as soon as he comes.
So annoying.

[chuckles softly]

298
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,005
-What should we do now?
-[Seung-hyo groans]

299
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,923
What do you think? Let's go home.

300
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,885
No, I have free time outside
from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

301
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,305
You planned out your free time too?

302
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,682
Old habits die hard. What a tiring life.

303
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,225
What? What's wrong with that?

304
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,145
I might as well have fun
in a planned and systematic way.

305
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,315
On that note, how about some board games?

306
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,902
Next time. I have to go home and study.

307
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,737
Study for what?

308
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,864
Powerboat certification.

309
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,784
A boat license? You want drive a boat?

310
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,037
No, I developed an interest
in something recently.

311
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,080
But it's required.

312
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,708
I still have work left.
I have to get back to the office.

313
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,755
What is this?
Are you saying you're both leaving me?

314
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,298
Is this really the end?

315
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,674
Bye. Call me tomorrow.

316
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,634
Don't call me.

317
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,551
Come on.

318
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,347
Yeah, fine! You loyal citizens.

319
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,807
You pillars of industry!

320
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,602
The future of Korea depends on you!
Keep up the great work!

321
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,105
What do I do by myself?

[mellow music playing]

323
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,081
Okay. Here's your morning coffee.

324
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,124
Thank you.

325
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,918
Sure. There you go. It's better with that.

326
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,002
That's right.

327
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,340
The sweetness is really getting
my blood pumping.

328
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,342
Don't you have a coffee machine

329
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,385
or a pour over set?

330
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,595
If she did,
this wouldn't be a real estate office.

331
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,139
-My back hurts.
-[Mi-suk] Jeez.

332
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,058
-Jae-suk, give me that cushion.
-Just take it yourself.

333
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,184
She doesn't lift a finger.

334
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,978
Good morning! [chuckles]

335
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,105
-Hey.
-[Jae-suk] What's with the flowers?

336
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,774
I bought them from a flower shop
after taking the subway.

337
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,692
Pretty, right?

338
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,609
-Gosh.
-They are!

339
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,237
My husband never buys me anything
this pretty.

340
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,615
Nor do my kids. So what can I do?
I'll buy them for others.

341
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,492
-Thanks so much.
-[In-suk] Pretty, right?

342
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,953
I can't remember
the last time I got flowers.

343
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,581
-Wait, I want to take a picture.
-[Jae-suk] Sure.

344
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,374
-Send it to me.
-They're lavenders.

345
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,625
-[In-suk] Okay.
-So fragrant.

346
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,086
-[Mi-suk] Move your face, Jae-suk.
-This smells so nice.

347
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,004
[In-suk] Right?

348
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,463
Move your face, Jae-suk.

349
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,132
Listen while you look at these.

350
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,010
-[Mi-suk] There!
-I have a matter to bring up.

351
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,762
Let's change the name of our group.

352
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,056
-Why?
-You want to change our group's name?

353
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,726
Yeah. You remember how nasty
the Hee Sisters were?

354
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,352
-[Jae-suk] Yeah.
-The worst.

355
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,606
I don't want to be associated with them,
and our name doesn't help.

356
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,109
Let's change it
to something really nice this time!

357
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,110
Like what?

358
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,278
You know,

359
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,780
something refined and elegant.

360
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,616
Should we translate Suk to English?

361
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,492
Hye-suk, what's "suk" in English?

362
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,328
I don't know.

363
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,330
You're a diplomat. You don't know?

364
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,790
-How can I know the names of plants?
-Seriously?

365
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,709
-[Hye-suk] To ask that…
-Search on your phone.

366
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,461
Wait. Let me search it.

367
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,630
Wait. They don't eat it outside of Korea?

368
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,882
-I don't think so.
-I've never heard of it.

369
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,259
Hey, I found it.

370
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,677
-What is it?
-Mugwort.

371
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,596
-Mug… What?
-Mugwort.

372
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,473
Wort. Like this.

373
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,390
Are you barking?

374
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,808
-It's worse.
-[Hye-suk] What?

375
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,769
No, it doesn't roll off the tongue.

376
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,563
But isn't mugwort a type of herb too?

377
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,731
-Yeah.
-[Mi-suk] Yeah.

378
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,316
And what's the ultimate herb?

379
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,318
Lavender!

380
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,486
You have to be quick!

381
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,112
It's settled! Lavender.

382
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,240
NA MI-SUK
LIVE WITH FRAGRANCE

383
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,116
-Hey, Dad?
-[Geun-sik] Yeah?

384
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,619
How do you live with fragrance?

385
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,622
I don't know. [chuckles]
Ask your mom when she gets here.

386
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,916
She must be getting old. Take a look.

387
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,502
She put flowers as her profile picture.

388
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,838
-[Geun-sik] Lavenders.
-Saying your mom's old behind her back?

389
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,092
This is why I can't leave you two alone.

390
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,093
You're so violent.

391
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,387
I wasn't talking behind your back.
I just stated a fact.

392
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,138
We're growing old together.

393
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,057
Just keep quiet.

394
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,850
Why are you making so many?

395
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,978
We still have a way to go.
We need to make 100.

396
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,771
-A hundred?
-[Geun-sik] Yeah.

397
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,107
A TV production crew came
and bought them before.

398
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,566
They liked them and ordered again.

399
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,151
Really?

400
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,569
I guess I have no choice.

401
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,612
I should help out.

402
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,905
[Mi-suk] Hey!

403
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,865
Forget it. What can you do?

404
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,201
Don't get in the way.
Just eat some kimbap.

405
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,369
Or have tteokbokki.

406
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,204
-Do you want some?
-No, you're busy.

407
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,789
-[bell chiming]
-Welcome…

408
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,040
-[Mi-suk] Welcome!
-Hello.

409
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,375
Ms. Yu!

410
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,129
[gasps] Goodness. Is that you, Seok-ryu?

411
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,048
Wow! You haven't changed at all.

412
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,719
I knew it was you
as soon as you walked in. Wow!

413
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,596
Mom, my homeroom teacher from high school.

414
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,432
-Goodness!
-Hello, Ms. Yu!

415
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,727
I'm so sorry I didn't recognize you.

416
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,978
No, it's fine.

417
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:57,524
I only realized after seeing Seok-ryu.
I forgot her parents ran this shop.

418
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,276
What brings you here?

419
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,028
I came to order food.

420
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,489
Can I get 20 orders of tteokbokki
and 20 orders of sundae?

421
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,741
-Of course.
-Goodness.

422
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,242
We'd be so grateful.

423
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,995
But it's so much.
Can you take them by yourself?

424
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,539
-[Geun-sik] I'll help her.
-No, I'll go. You're busy.

425
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,166
-You will?
-Just a moment.

426
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,167
-Okay.
-[Mi-suk] Honey.

427
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,418
-I'll do that.
-Just a moment.

428
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,587
-[Geun-sik] Hurry.
-[Mi-suk] Hey. Get Ms. Yu a drink.

429
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,673
Thanks for delivering this for me.

430
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,592
Of course.

431
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,843
[Jin-ae chuckles]

432
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,347
Wow, the school hasn't changed at all.

433
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,558
It's always the same here.

434
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,937
Maybe that's why I keep forgetting
that time's passing. [chuckles softly]

435
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:40,150
It's amazing. I can't believe
you're the principal now. [gasps]

436
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,068
You too.

437
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,031
You were so childish.
I can't believe you're all grown up now.

438
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,784
Are you visiting Korea
for a short while? A vacation?

439
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,701
What?

440
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,037
I heard you work at Greip.

441
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,663
Yeah…

442
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,250
I was so happy when I heard that.

443
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,668
And I wasn't the only one.

444
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,879
All the teachers still talk about you.

445
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,547
You were so capable and smart.

446
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,884
A renowned figure
of Hyereung High School. [chuckles]

447
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,388
Look, another renowned figure
of Hyereung High School.

448
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,598
[indistinct chatter]

449
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,850
[Seok-ryu] What?

450
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:25,237
You applied for the gym remodeling
and new building design competition?

451
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,490
Yeah, today's the site briefing
for the participating companies.

452
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,785
[Jin-ae] I had my doubts
when I saw a familiar name on the list.

453
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,247
This is great.
It would mean so much if you did it.

454
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,666
Ms. Yu.

455
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:42,003
Doesn't that mean he shouldn't
be sitting here with you right now?

456
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,089
He technically has academic ties.

457
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,382
It violates fairness.

458
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,550
[laughs]

459
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,843
You haven't changed.

460
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:52,264
Experts from the education department
will do the evaluations.

461
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,765
I have no authority.

462
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,725
Nice try.

463
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,435
Rats.

464
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,230
It's been so long.
Are you free this afternoon?

465
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,731
Of course.

466
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,649
I'm sorry.

467
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,027
I missed a few things
from the site visit earlier.

468
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,737
I need to look more thoroughly.

469
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,074
Is that so? That's too bad.
I'll have to ask Seok-ryu then.

470
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,160
Since you're here, talk to the students.

471
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,203
A chat with an alumnus.

472
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,123
Excuse me? Me?

473
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,084
I think you'll set a good example.

474
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,629
I bet the students will be excited
to hear you work at Greip.

475
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,424
But I…

476
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,384
I'll get going then.

477
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,429
[Jin-ae] Okay, I know you're busy.
Thanks. I'll wish you luck.

478
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,346
Thank you.

479
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,141
Are you okay with meeting the students?

480
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,351
Sure.

481
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,983
This is Bae Seok-ryu.
She's a graduate of our school.

482
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,819
-She works at Greip in the US.
-[all gasping]

483
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,196
-Greip?
-That's cool!

484
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,490
I hope her energy rubs off on you.

485
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,701
This old boomer will leave,
so talk freely.

486
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,119
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

487
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,329
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

488
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,211
Hello, I'm Bae Seok-ryu.

489
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,295
[all cheering]

490
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,925
This was actually came together
very suddenly,

491
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,801
so I didn't prepare anything.

492
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,263
You can ask me questions if you want.
I'll answer them.

493
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,973
What college did you go to?

494
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,977
I got accepted to Hanguk University
after I graduated high school.

495
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,980
After attending for a year,
I studied abroad in the US.

496
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,400
I enrolled at UC Berkkeley and graduated.

497
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,237
Does that mean your family's rich?

498
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,447
Not at all.

499
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,783
A friend was preparing to study abroad.

500
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,911
I wanted to study English too,
so we prepared together.

501
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,496
After I was accepted,

502
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,499
I received a scholarship for four years.
That's how I went.

503
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,834
-That's nuts.
-Wow.

504
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,961
-Wait…
-[Seok-ryu] Yes?

505
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,545
What do you do at Greip?

506
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,881
It's called a product manager.

507
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,426
I'm responsible for overseeing
and managing projects

508
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,263
from their planning stage
to the end result.

509
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:01,184
Was being a product manager
always your dream?

510
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,022
I don't know. I don't think so.

511
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,649
Then, what was your dream?

512
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,859
-My dream?
-Yes.

513
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,280
When you were in high school,
what did you want to be?

514
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,367
[mellow music playing]

515
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,299
[water splashing]

516
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,635
[water dripping]

517
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,237
[Seung-hyo] Hey, Seok-ryu.

518
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,199
There you go ignoring me again.
Have you had lunch?

519
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,785
Don't talk to me. I want peace and quiet.

520
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,454
Then, quietly come with me.

521
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,955
Later.

522
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,790
We have to go now.

523
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,834
Says who? I don't want to go.

524
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,545
Come with me!

525
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,757
Are you insane?
How dare you grab a woman by the neck?

526
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,467
How could you be so thoughtless?

527
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,344
Speak for yourself. Are you insane?

528
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,095
You're no woman.

529
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,805
Of course, I'm a woman.

530
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,099
Am I a man? What am I then?

531
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,934
You are…

532
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,562
almost gender neutral.

533
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,022
Do you want to die today?

534
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,359
-You want to be buried behind the school?
-Let's go then.

535
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,487
-What?
-Let's go.

[quirky music playing]

537
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,953
I'm sure it was around here.

538
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,748
You've been saying that for 30 minutes.

539
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
Why are we looking for this?

540
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,505
We agreed to take it out after ten years.
It's way past that deadline.

541
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,298
I know.

542
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,802
We forgot about that time capsule.
What's so important about it?

543
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,221
I don't even remember what I put in there.

544
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,473
Hey, you're the one who wanted to do it.

545
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:07,394
I think it was a letter.
"A letter to me in ten years."

546
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,773
I must've been crazy.
That millennial sentiment is awful.

547
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,152
Forget it. Don't look for it.
Let's keep it deep in there.

548
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,823
Let's hope it's found a billion years
from now like a dinosaur egg!

549
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,491
No, it'd still be embarrassing.

550
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,120
The Seok-ryu I know would let curiosity
overcome her embarrassment.

551
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,580
Aren't you curious about it?

552
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,501
I'm sure it's full
of dazzling and innocent words.

553
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:36,256
But so what? The reality is
we're just digging really hard.

554
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,468
Hey, anyone can tell
that you're digging half-heartedly.

555
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,014
[exhales] It was around here.

556
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,476
Why did you do that earlier?

557
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,186
Do what?

558
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,689
I acted like I still worked at Greip.

559
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,942
Why did you play dumb too?

560
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,403
I shamelessly gave a lecture too.

561
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,612
You did work at Greip.

562
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,781
Was that a sham too?

563
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,366
Shut up.

564
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,328
That's good enough.
Your experience there was real.

565
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,665
I think that's enough
to give the kids good advice.

567
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,551
Why won't this dirt come off?

568
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,804
Stop pretending to be clean.
Just wash it off later.

569
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,598
[rubbing hands] I want to go home.

570
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,392
Hey, let's dig a little more.
I have a good feeling.

571
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,228
We're almost there.
I think it was between these trees.

572
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,521
You look for it.

573
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,690
Are you really going?

00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,139
What's all of this?

584
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,391
Gift boxes.

585
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:15,104
It's the neighbor's side job,
I asked for some.

586
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,398
Why would you do this?

587
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,235
What's wrong with your hand?
What's with the pain relief patch?

588
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,404
I think it was all the kimbap.
My wrist hurts.

589
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,573
I said I'd help.

590
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,618
You help by doing nothing,
you little brat.

591
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,079
I can put 100 more of these patches on.

592
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,207
I hope I can sell 1,000
or 10,000 more kimbap.

-Give it. I'll do it.
-Why would you do this?

00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,837
This is my work.

595
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,965
Don't interfere with my pocket money.

and came for my stuff.

-Mom!
-[Mi-suk] Yeah?

Dong-jin has his act together lately.

607

I didn't think
he'd do anything with his life.

He's living like a human being now.

609
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,457
It's a part-time job, but he gets paid.

610

The gym owner's helping him
become a personal trainer or whatever.

611

Is it still used today?

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,804
Sometimes, during PE class.

626
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:17,852

don't make money and are full of red tape.

It may seem like you have a reputation
and we're doing well on the outside,

but you know this industry
isn't that easy.

A slight downturn
can even affect major corporations.

I know.

00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,585
So turn off the pool,
and turn on the retirement community.

00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,922

No, suggesting.

This is why there are so many
strange rumors about you at work.

They say you have spiritual energy
or a third eye on your forehead.

698
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,169
It'll be a place that not just anyone
can have access to or even look at.

699
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,339
For example, the elderly who ride
the subway for free.

700
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,258
I love the subway.

701
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,344
I drove my car today,

702
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,804
but I ride it often
when I have to travel a lot.

703
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,514
I'll enjoy it in the future too.

704
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,018
I'm in favor of welfare policies
that provide transportation benefits

705
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,228
to the elderly.

706
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,104
[Myeong-u chuckles nervously]

707
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,898
That's great.

708
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,691
[both laughing]

709
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,819
We weren't trying to be demeaning.

710
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,446
It was just a comparison.

711
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,198
-Yes, of course.
-Right.

712
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,785
But if it's going to be at a level
where people can't even look at it,

713
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,037
how high are you planning to build it?

714
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,956
People's necks will hurt.

715
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,709
[Myeong-u] Well,
what Mr. Choi is trying to say

716
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,713
is what kind of concept
are you looking for?

717
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,592
Are you thinking of something
luxurious and extravagant?

718
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,763
Yes, that's why we prepared some drafts.

719
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,975
I'd like to mix in some of these designs.

720
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,601
Excuse me?

721
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,562
As you can see, these are works
by renowned international designers.

722
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:58,276
Our potential clients have spent
a lot of time overseas before.

723
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,486
Their tastes and standards are quite high.

724
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,407
So, ordinary domestic designs
won't be able to satisfy them.

725
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,867
So you're saying…

726
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,787
you don't trust our capabilities

727
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,915
and want us to replicate
verified designs, right?

728
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,583
Is that what you're requesting?

729
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,002
Excuse me, Mr. Choi?

730
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,503
[Hong-jin] It's an homage.

731
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,422
All artistic creation
is a form of imitation.

732
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,132
Nothing's ever really new.

733
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,010
No, this is clearly plagiarism.

734
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,512
[Kyu-hyung] You don't have
to worry about that.

735
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,639
Everyone cries about plagiarism lately.

736
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,768
But when it's debated in court,
it's difficult to enforce penalties.

737
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,522
I can't do this.

738
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,941
Don't try to talk me into it.

739
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,693
I'll never change my mind.

740
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,113
Just hear me out first. I have a plan too.

741
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,156
What plan?

742
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,283
First, we pretend to play along.

743
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,994
Then, we change the design as we proceed.

744
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,495
We offer a new design.

745
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,206
Come on. The dates and budget are all set.

746
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,792
They can't stop midway either.

747
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,712
We'll gradually make changes
and integrate our style.

748
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,755
Sounds good, right?

749
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,799
So you want to retouch
a plagiarized design!

750
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,594
Think of it as a reference.

751
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,720
Are you joking?

752
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,221
Myeong-u.

753
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,184
I know that architecture can't be done
without a client,

754
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,896
I can't work with people
who have that mindset.

755
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,737
With that kind of attitude,
we won't be able to do anything.

756
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,240
We'll have to deal with all sorts
of dirty, disgraceful things.

757
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,492
Is this how you'll act?

758
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,954
We built our office on a mountain of debt.
We have employees to take care of.

759
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,790
For their sake, I won't do it.

760
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,168
I want to preserve their pride
as architects.

761
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,671
You fool!
Do you know what they really need?

762
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,799
They don't need this abstract sentiment.

763
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,718
They need practical incentives.
Salary increases!

764
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,347
-If we want to do that, we need money.
-[Seung-hyo sighs]

765
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,140
The company must do well.

766
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,019
So you want to sell your soul for money?

767
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,772
Is that really what's best
for our company?

768
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,190
Then, what about you?

769
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,275
Are you doing anything for the company?

770
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,112
You didn't care
about the retirement community!

771
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,489
-You're always looking at that pool!
-What?

772
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,451
A retirement community worth hundreds
of billions and a simple gym renovation!

773
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,578
One can't even compare with the other!

774
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,789
You brought personal feelings into work!

775
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,499
Myeong-u.

776
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,626
That damn pool reminded you of the past…

777
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,588
[groans]

778
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,510
I mean… Look, Seung-hyo…

779
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,473
I'm heading out.

780
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,142
Wait…

781
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,273
[sighs]

782
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,818
[Min-ho] Great job.

783
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,944
Great work.

784
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,779
[Jeong-u] Great work!

785
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,366
I'm glad Do-hyeon is doing better.

786
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,702
This is all thanks to you, Mr. Yeon.

787
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,661
[exclaims]

788
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,246
It's my area of expertise.

789
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,458
When Se-yoon was first diagnosed
with epilepsy,

790
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,002
I thought my world was ending.

791
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:07,298
I guess it was a task given by the heavens
to turn us into better paramedics.

792
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,759
-Se-yoon's a gift from the heavens.
-Of course.

793
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,760
[both chuckle]

794
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,346
Who's the savior
that cleared the road for us?

795
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,140
-My ideal type.
-[Jeong-u] What?

796
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,852
I usually preferred people
who were like action stars.

797
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,812
But not anymore.

798
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,690
I like someone
who's stoic but full of drive.

799
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,358
The silent but determined type.

800
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,737
Wow. That's what's really sexy.

801
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,866
It's the first time she's describing
someone who's not Iron Man as sexy.

802
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,910
No, she said Spider-Man was sexy too.

803
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,661
The muscles through the tights…

804
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,206
What did it say on the back of his shirt?
Mud something?

805
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,290
"I love you, mudflats."

806
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,958
-Yeah, that's right.
-[Min-ho chuckles]

807
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,922
That means he's Mudflat Man.
Iron Man, Spider-Man, Mudflat Man.

808
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,174
Mudflat Man.

809
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,012
Did anyone see
Mudflat Man's license plate number?

810
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,224
Sorry. I should've checked.
Things were so hectic.

811
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:02,102
You should've checked.
How will I find him now?

812
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,648
Ms. Jung, this came for you.

813
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,275
I see. Thank you so much.

814
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,277
-What is this?
-What is it?

815
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,240
[Min-ho] Rice cakes? I was getting hungry.

816
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,407
Can we eat some?

817
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,244
Just a second.
Let's see who sent them first.

818
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,328
[Jeong-u] Here it is.

819
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,038
-There's a card.
-[Mo-eum] There it is.

820
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:21,956
[Jeong-u] Okay.

821
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,166
Come on. Wait.

822
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,253
[Dan-ho] Thank you so much for last time.

823
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:32,258
I promised I'd reach out, didn't I?
Paramedic Jung Mo-eum.

824
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,926
What?

825
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,137
How did he know my name?

826
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,808
[both] Mmm.

827
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,769
But why did he have to send rice cakes?
It's making me thirsty.

828
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,729
Give me some.

829
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,440
It's good.

830
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,859
[jazz music playing in background]

831
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,779
-[Jin-young] Ms. Bae Seok-ryu?
-Ah.

832
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,449
-Hello.
-Hello.

833
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,369
It's nice to meet you. I'm Lee Jin-young.

834
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,287
Thank you.

835
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,330
[Jin-young] Were you surprised by my call?

836
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,373
Not at all.

837
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,629
I could've come to meet you.
Thank you for coming to my neighborhood.

838
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,047
It was nothing.

839
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,092
I should come to meet someone
as esteemed as you.

840
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,176
[chuckles softly]

841
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,346
But how did you get my number?

842
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,141
I've got a great radar.

843
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,686
I heard a talented person
came back to Korea,

844
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,146
so I started to ask around.

845
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,398
You flatter me. Thank you.

846
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,858
[Jin-young] I mean it.

847
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,234
If you don't mind,

848
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,864
may I ask you why you quit Greip

849
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,240
and came back like this?

850
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:43,162
I had a personal reason to come home.

851
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,121
I see.

852
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,541
Then, how long did you work at Greip?

853
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,586
I joined the company in 2015,

854
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,464
and I officially quit last month.

855
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,758
[Jin-young] So ten years?

856
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,845
No, I took a year off in the middle.

857
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:01,847
[Jin-young] You did?

858
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,641
Yes, when I was 30.

859
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,392
Was that for personal reasons as well?

860
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,894
Yes.

861
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,188
Being 30 is like that.

862
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,149
I transferred jobs at that age.

863
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,361
Your career and portfolio
are very impressive.

864
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,154
I don't think it'll be a problem.

865
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,408
The position I want to offer
is at Serendipity…

866
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,835
[clicks tongue, sighs]

867
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,223
Bae Seok-ryu.

868
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,810
Why are you dressed like that?

869
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:48,936
What's this?

870
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,730
Why do you keep showing up like this?

871
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,149
Because we live in the same neighborhood.

872
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,567
I'm not happy about it either.

873
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,444
Looks like we're on the same page.

874
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:58,904
Just be on your way.

875
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,281
Where are you going?

876
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,283
To wake up and smell the coffee.

877
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:05,536
[sighs]

878
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:11,792
[slurping]

879
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,505
-[exclaims]
-How have you become even more carefree?

880
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,673
You sure are bold.

881
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,259
-Want some?
-You drank from that.

882
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,094
-At least rinse it.
-You think I'm dirty?

883
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,137
You don't look clean.

884
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,888
-Come on.
-Sorry.

885
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:25,889
[Seung-hyo] Seriously?

886
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,600
-Did you spray water on me?
-No, my hand slipped.

887
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,394
Just you wait.

888
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,397
To spray on me?
Our country has a water shortage.

889
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,233
This is for the Earth.

890
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,195
[slurping]

891
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,200
Where are you going now?

892
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,292
Why are you so unpredictable in everything
that you do?

893
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,920
I've lost muscle mass
lying around all day.

894
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,130
I have to regain it.

895
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,132
Do you have any muscle mass to lose?

896
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,259
You also never dress right
for any occasion.

897
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,136
It was right until now.

898
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,971
I met with a job recruiter earlier.

899
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,892
-Why?
-[Seok-ryu] I don't know.

900
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,727
I don't know how she got my number.

901
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,230
But you know how capable
and talented I am.

902
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,566
What did she say?

903
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,276
She offered me a few positions.

904
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,653
GLO Korea and Serendipity.

905
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,615
The conditions were pretty good.

906
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,452
It's not as much as before,
but the pay is decent too.

907
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:29,995
Really?

908
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,122
It's similar to the work I did before.

909
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,082
I'll adjust quickly.

910
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,792
Great, right?

911
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,420
Do you want to do it?

912
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,424
-What?
-You want to do that kind of work again?

913
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,843
Work is just work.

914
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,554
-Does it matter if I want to do it or not?
-That's not right.

915
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,098
It's your work,
so you should do what you want.

916
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,519
How can people only do
what they want to do?

917
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,645
Why not?

918
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,023
Why does everyone compromise with reality?

919
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,360
You said you overheated and shut down.

920
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,571
-You said you wanted to reboot.
-Yeah, but…

921
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,199
This is the courage you mustered?
Returning to your old life?

922
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:11,370
-So what if I do? What's it to you?
-You think I don't know you?

923
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,164
When you want to do something,
your eyes light up

924
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,209
and stomp with excitement,
but I don't see any of that now.

925
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,587
Do I still look like a teenager to you?

926
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,006
Don't act like you know me
because we were friends as kids.

927
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,842
I just wish you'd find your real dream.

928
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,761
Dream? Hey! Dreams?

929
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,846
Do you think dreams can just be had?

930
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,016
Only those who have the luxury
to search for them can dream.

931
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,020
Those who get the chance to rise again
after failure can pursue their dreams.

932
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,024
You wouldn't know. You've always lived
in a Mediterranean climate.

933
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,736
A clear, mild, and perfect environment.

934
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,241
Me? Warmth is only momentary.
I'm stuck in Siberia most of the time..

935
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,203
The winds are biting cold.
It snows, rains, and hails.

936
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,372
-Do you know what that's like?
-I do know.

937
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,709
I've had winters like that too.

938
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,918
[leaves rustling]

939
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,009
I thought you'd remember.

940
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,141
[mellow music playing]

941
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,342
You scared me.

942
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,762
-Why are you here?
-I was waiting for you.

943
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,764
Are you in puberty?
What's with your voice?

944
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,892
It's your first day on the national team.
I'll let it slide.

945
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,605
What are you doing?
Did you do something weird again?

946
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,023
It's a gift.

947
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,321
This towel's a gift?

948
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,572
Yeah, open it up.

949
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,494
CHOI SEUNG-HYO, 2008 BEIJING OLYMPICS
GO FOR GOLD

950
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,497
Are you joking?

951
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,414
Isn't it cool?

952
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,458
I asked them to embroider it like that.

953
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,919
-Take it to the training center.
-No way.

954
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,087
What if someone sees?

955
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,592
Fine, I'll take it. Okay?

956
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,638
Take care of yourself.
Bring honor to your country.

957
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,766
It's not like I'm going
to the Olympics tomorrow.

958
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,685
Good luck! You got this!

959
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,270
Good luck!

960
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,608
You can do it!

961
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,568
WE'LL REPAY YOUR SUPPORT WITH MEDALS

962
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:55,909
[chuckles softly]

963
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,420
[car accelerating]

964

00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,840
[tires screeching]

00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,133
-[thud]
-[glass breaking]

967
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,265

[gasping]

969
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,445
[continues gasping]

970
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,533
[male anchor] We bring you
some unfortunate news.

971
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:40,704
Choi Seung-hyo, who secured his ticket
to the Olympics after winning

972
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,873
the 2007 National Swimming Championships,

973
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,083
has been involved in an accident.

974
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,710
-Seung-hyo's okay.
-Seung-hyo…

975
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,464
Seung-hyo… [whimpering]

976
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,549
-[Mi-suk] It's okay.
-[Seok-ryu sobbing]

977
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,761
[Mi-suk] It's okay. It'll be okay.

978
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,557
It's okay, all right?

979
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,814
[Gyeong-jong] With rehabilitation,
you'll be able to walk again.

980
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,276
But I don't think
you'll be able to continue…

981
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,490
your career as an athlete.

982
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,743
[pop song playing]

983
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:26,500
[door opens]

984
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,668
[door closes]

985
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:35,717
[exhales]

986
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,768
[whimpering]

987
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,130
[Seung-hyo] I do know.

988
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,759
I've had winters like that too.

989
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,263
I thought you'd remember.

990
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,180
[exhales]

991
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,810
[sighs]

992
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,414
[inhales]

993
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,430
[birds chirping]

994
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,901
I left my phone in my office.

995
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,490
-[door slides open, closes]
-[sighs softly]

996
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,039
[Na-yun] I heard you two fought.

997
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,583
Mr. Yoon told me.

998
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:36,129
Why would he tell you about that?

999
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,423
I have some talent in counseling.

1000
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,718
I've heard both sides.

1001
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,762
I think you're right.

1002
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,641
Covert plagiarism? That's so insulting!

1003
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,601
Moreover, a person should look ahead.

1004
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,479
We're going to succeed in the future.

1005
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,856
We can't have plagiarism issues
bring us down.

1006
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,776
-Are you taking my side?
-You should let me finish.

1007
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,528
However, Mr. Yoon's right too.

1008
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:05,200
I want to work nine-to-five
and get paid well.

1009
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,619
To do that, the company must do well.

1010
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,162
We have to hire more people too.

1011
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,959
Due to the nature of architecture,
we're always beholden to the client.

1012
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,671
But you don't know how to do that.

1013
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,714
Maybe you're too content.

1014
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,594
I heard something similar yesterday.

1015
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,388
Whoever they are, they were right.

1016
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,556
-You know it's true.
-What?

1017
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,016
Seung-hyo,

1018
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,101
you're marvelous.

1019
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,979
You speak beautifully like poetry.

1020
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,523
You're an idealist
who loves dreams more than reality.

1021
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,443
You're always so full of pride.

1022
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,863
But do you know
where all of that comes from?

1023
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,992
It comes from privilege.

1024
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,494
[Seok-ryu] Hey! Dreams?

1025
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,414
Do you think dreams can just be had?

1026
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,333
Only those who have the luxury
to search for them can dream.

1027
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:59,713
Those who get the chance to rise again
after failure can pursue their dreams.

1028
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,006
[pleasant music playing]

1029
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,799
[Na-yun] So in conclusion,

1030
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,969
for the development
and glory of Atelier In,

1031
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,972
I hope you two CEOs
can work together beautifully.

1032
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,433
Just so you know,

1033
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,935
Mr. Yoon stood outside
your door for a long time.

1034
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,775
-You're a great counselor.
-[Na-yun] I know.

1035
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:26,948
[sighs]

1036
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:30,869
[groaning]

1037
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,580
[knock on door]

1038
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,665
Come in.

1039
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:44,716
It looked like you didn't take your coffee
because of me earlier.

1040
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,220
Yeah, thanks.

1041
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,891
I'm sorry… [clears throat]
…about yesterday.

1042
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,143
I put you in a tough spot.

1043
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,395
No, it's fine.

1044
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:02,358
I know it was a bad call,
but I pretended otherwise.

1045
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,236
I'm so ashamed.

1046
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,449
Stop it. What are you saying?

1047
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,411
I was being selfish for personal reasons.
You were right.

1048
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,498
I wanted to work on the pool more.

1049
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,836
I thought it was my chance
to turn the page there

1050
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:26,716
I get it, and I gave it some thought.

1051
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,387
I thought about how you must've felt
when you quit swimming.

1052
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,599
I can't even imagine.

1053
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,643
[chuckles softly]

1054
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,564
Na-yun just told me…

1055
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,984
we'd both fail
if we ran separate companies.

1056
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,402
What?

1057
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,739
Unless we want to starve,
she said we should stick together.

1058
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,991
[laughs]

1059
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,370
She really does say whatever she wants.

1060
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,372
Millennials and Gen Z sure are different.

1061
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,748
-[Myeong-u laughing]
-[chuckles]

1062
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,085
Look, you're great and all,

1063
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,296
but don't talk about
millennials and Gen Z like that.

1064
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,381
[Myeong-u] What?

1065
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,467
Only old people do that.

1066
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,844
The kids don't care.

1067
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,180
So don't group them
as a generation like that.

1068
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,723
So you don't like me?

1069
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,184
You won't work with me?

1070
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,894
I'll do it. Why wouldn't I?

1071
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,814
[laughs] Yeah, I knew you would.

1072
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,482
You're too close.

1073
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,151
-I can't work like this.
-Okay.

1074
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,236
[chuckles]

1075
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,531
-I'm really sorry about yesterday.
-No, I'm sorry.

1076
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,283

[pleasant music playing]

1080
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,002
There you go!

1081
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,422
[boys exclaiming, cheering]

1082
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,553
[indistinct chatter]

1083
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,939
[girl] Then, what was your dream?

1084
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:06,900
My dream?

1085
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:11,446
[girl] Yes. When you were in high school,
what did you want to be?

1086
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,743
Now that I have to answer,
I don't really know.

1087
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:22,290
Back then, just coming in first
in everything was my dream.

1088
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,710
I wanted to be a daughter
my mom could be proud of.

1089
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,087
I wanted my teachers to praise me.

1090
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,798
I wanted everyone to recognize me.

1091
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:35,720
Looking back now,
I feel a bit sorry for myself.

1092
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,514
Why?

1093
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,016
I cared about how others saw me,

1094
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,895
and I don't think I paid attention
to myself.

1095
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,146
[phone vibrating]

1096
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:54,072

[Jae-suk] Is our family's knucklehead hero
finally up?

1102
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,328
I'm hungry.

1103
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,038
Are you hungry? [gasps]

1104
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,292
I just started the rice cooker.
It'll take some time.

1105
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,836
Eat some rice cakes on the table.

1106
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:50,753
[Mo-eum] What?

1107
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,801
[yawning] I've been eating rice cakes
so often lately.

1108
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,636
Who are they from?

1109
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,097
[Jae-suk] The new neighbor
who just moved in.

1110
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:05,018
Hey, I was the broker for that house.

1111
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,687
It was on the market for ages
with no prospects.

1112
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,148
I was so worried. Isn't it great?

1113
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,065
[Mo-eum] Mmm.

1114
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,318
[Jae-suk] Is it good?

1115
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,527
It's good.

[both screaming]

1120
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,157
Is that you, Seok-ryu?

1121
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,534
Ms. Yu?

1122
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,331
[Jin-ae] It's a pear and bellflower tea.
It's good for your throat.

1123
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,749
Thank you.

1124
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,418
I'm sorry about earlier. Did I scare you?

1125
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:18,841
It's okay. I'll stay cool for summer
with the chill you sent down my spine.

1126
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,301
[both chuckle]

1127
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,137
Speaking of which,
what were you looking for?

1128
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,556
[sighs] A time capsule.

1129
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,767
I buried it with Seung-hyo and Mo-eum.

1130
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,019
You all did something that cute?

1131
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,480
But you couldn't find it.

1132
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,315
It's for the best.

1133
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,860
I thought I'd find the answers
if I saw it.

1134
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,446
I think it'll just confuse me more.

1135
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,323
What?

1136
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,408
Ms. Yu,

1137
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,743
I lied to you.

1138
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,247
I don't work at Greip anymore.

1139
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,250
I quit.

1140
01:01:53,543 --> 01:02:00,174
To be honest, I don't know if I quit
or got chased out.

1141
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,302
[Jin-ae exhales]

1142
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,141
Seok-ryu, you've always done well.

1143
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,851
That's why I worried about you.

1144
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,397
What if you couldn't do something well?

1145
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,023
What would you do then?

1146
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,316
[mellow music playing]

1147
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,986
I don't think I taught you how to do that.

1148
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,865
But I realized something
after being a teacher for so long.

1149
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,617
Children keep growing.

1150
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,537
Even if I don't teach them,

1151
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,832
they all find the answers
on their own somehow.

1152
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,172
Was there an answer you thought about
when you quit?

1153
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,217
Then, don't change your mind.
Trust your choice and move on.

1154
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,053
Changing it always ends up wrong.

1155
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,054
[both chuckle]

1156
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:47,972
You're right.

1157
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,976
Go to the pool when you're done.

1158
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,186
I think Seung-hyo's there.

1159
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,313
Okay.

1160
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,323
Hey, Seung-hyo!

1161
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,867
Did you find the time capsule?

1162
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,077
You scared me. What are you doing here?

1163
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,621
I should be asking you that.

1164
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:16,501
Hey, what's that in your hand?
Is that my letter?

1165
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,592
"To Bae Seok-ryu ten years from now."

1166
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:25,593
"Hi!"

1167
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,512
-"I'm the best and most beautiful…
-Hey!

1168
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,388
-"Bae Seok-ryu!"
-Don't read that. Hey!

1169
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,474
-"What am I like in the future?"
-I'll kill you!

1170
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:34,602
"I'm imprisoned in a classroom
due to the crime of being a student."

1171
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,395
-Hey, don't run! You'll slip!
-No!

1172
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,232
-Don't read my letter!
-"My school uniform's a prison uniform."

1173
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,567
I was crazy. What did I write? Hey!

1174
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,569
[Seung-hyo] "I'm punished
with school work."

1175
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,988
-"I'll be released with graduation."
-[Seok-ryu] Give it!

1176
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,824
"The best and the first."

1177
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,867
-"Do you know they're similar?"
-Are you kidding?

1178
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,619
-"If you've done your best,
-Hey!

1179
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,162
"And you'll probably come in first."

1180
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,580
I told you to stop!

1181
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,499
We should've kept this buried.

1182
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:59,043
They'll put this in textbooks
if they find this later.

1183
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:02,463
A statement that will go down in history.
It's truly a gem!

1184
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,507
Gem, my foot! Give it to me.

1185
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,342
Give it to me!

1186
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:07,760
Are you crazy?

1187
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,098
Wow, that's low.

1188
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,768
Did you jump knowing I can't swim?

1189
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,478
Come in and take it from me then.

1190
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,522
No, I'm scared of the water.

1191
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,149
Did you know?

1192
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,485
After I quit swimming,

1193
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,029
this is my first time in a pool.

1194
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,784
Wow, why didn't I come in until now?

1195
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,077
It's so nice.

1196
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,874
Hey, I didn't mean what I said before--

1197
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:38,833
Do you remember?

1198
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,586
When I couldn't swim anymore

1199
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,922
and I was cooped up in my room?

1200
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,549
[mellow music playing]

1201
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,134
[Seok-ryu] Hey, what are you doing?

1202
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,346
I brought some comics.
Let's read them together.

1203
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,974
Then, I'll make you some ramyun instead.

1204
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,059
No eggs, just how you like it.

1205
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,606
What are you doing? Hey!

1206
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,858
Why are you pushing me?
I have to read that.

1207
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:08,154
-Seung-hyo, at least give me my comics.

[Seung-hyo groans]

1212
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,585
Did you think I couldn't come in
if you locked your door?

1213
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,671
I knew the keys were
in the top shelf of the shoe cabinet!

1214
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,427
Okay, instead of ramyun,
I'll buy you barbecue!

1215
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,512
I'll buy you meat! How does that sound?

1216
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,806
[groans softly]

1217
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,727
Hey! Wait! Hey!

1218
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:42,313
[locks door]

1219
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:46,901
Hey! Do you think I'll give up like this?

1220
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,778
[objects clattering]

1221
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,588
What are you doing?

1222
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,715
[yelling] My gosh!

1223
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,802
-Seriously?
-[Seok-ryu] You really scared me.

1224
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,345
[Seung-hyo] What are you doing?

1225
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,513
[Seok-ryu] Move over.

1226
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,807
-[Seung-hyo] Come on!
-[Seok-ryu] Move out of the way.

1227
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,141
[both grunting]

1228
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,228
-[Seok-ryu sighs]
-[Seung-hyo groans]

1229
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,813
[Seok-ryu laughing]

1230
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:29,902
You're insane.

1231
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,656
Are you really laughing right now?

1232
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,700
Why would you climb up here like that?

1233
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,243
-You almost died!
-[laughing]

1234
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,454
Yeah, so why would you lock
your doors, you jerk?

1235
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,872
I almost died because of you.

1236
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,250
I just saved your life.
You're so ungrateful.

1237
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,293
You're such a lunatic.

1238
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,546
If I'm a lunatic, what are you? A bear?

1239
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:51,549
Did you think you'd turn into a human
after 100 years in your cave?

1240
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,885
You fossilized trilobite-looking fool.
You've regressed into a baby.

1241
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,804
A baby?

1242
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,973
You're the one who's like a Neanderthal.

1243
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,267
Do you lack the brain capacity?

1244
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,645
You can't distinguish between
what you can and can't do, can you?

1245
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,646
[quirky music playing]

1246
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,607
[sniffs] What is this smell?

1247
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,277
Is it mugwort and garlic? No.

1248
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,737
It smells like a lonely old man!

1249
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,030
I don't smell anything.

1250
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,365
Shut up and get lost.
Go back to where you came.

1251
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:20,244
If I get lost, are you going to stare
at the wall like a loser again?

1252
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,623
-Loser?
-Yeah, you stupid dumbass loser.

1253
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,250
-Stop it.
-No.

1254
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,461
Dummy. You're the biggest loser
in the world, bitch.

1255
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,463
-Don't cuss.
-What are you going to do about it?

1256
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,507
Go and eat from your dog bowl,
you bastard.

1257
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,968
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to cuss!

1258
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,971
You damn loser. You're so dim-witted.

1259
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,973
I told you not to cuss.

1260
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,434
-What are you, five years old?
-[Seung-hyo groans]

1261
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:44,393
You stupid… [bleep]

1262
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,520
Damn it, I said stop!

1263
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,022
You think you're cool, don't you?

1264
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:50,107
You're frustrating and meek, you bastard.

1265
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,234
Damn it, I already feel like crap.

1266
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,863
-Why are you here bitching at me?
-You're the one acting like a damn fool.

1267
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:58,074
Damn it, I'm hurt and can't do anything.

1268
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,535
Why are you here bitching at me?
Do you even know how I feel?

1269
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,580
Do you even know what I'm going through?

1270
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:06,457
[sighs]

1271
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,292
Do you feel better now?

1272
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:16,383
[sighs] It's my first time
hearing your voice in a month.

1273
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,720
So what?

1274
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,769
Hey. Why do you have that in your bag?

1275
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,354
Lock your door again,

1276
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,773
and I'll break it down.

1277
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,536
[grunts] Damn it.

1278
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:46,664
[exhales]

1279
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,709
[pleasant music playing]

1280
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,420
[chuckles softly]

1281
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,631
That's who you were.

1282
01:08:56,715 --> 01:09:01,137
A damn lunatic wielding an ax
at a bear who trapped himself in a cave.

1283
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,682
That's your identity.

1284
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,517
Stop cowering. It doesn't suit you.

1285
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,979
-You call that words of comfort?
-It means you stink.

1286
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:10,938
What?

1287
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:13,524
The old Seok-ryu was lively and energetic.

1288
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,735
But you're so bland now.

1289
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,071
-[scoffs]
-You're no fun. You're boring.

1290
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,866
You'd better take that back.

1291
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:26,954
[footsteps]

1293
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,138
[yelps] Hey!

1294
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,474
-Hey…
-[Seok-ryu groaning]

1295
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:49,643
[Seung-hyo] Hey…

1296
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,687
Wait! Hey!

1297
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,692
[Seok-ryu] Help me!

1298
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,611
[screaming]

1299
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,112
Help me!

1300
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,240
-[screaming]
-I got you! You won't die. It's okay.

1301

[grunts]

1302
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:06,827
Damn it!

1303
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:11,248
Why would you jump in if you can't swim?

1304
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,792
Why would you piss me off like that?

1305
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,836
-Do you know why you're sinking?
-No!

1306
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,382
It's because your body's tense!
Relax a little! Relax!

1307
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,928
I can't relax when I get a shot
at the doctor's! How do I do it now?

1308
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:26,680
Wait, just… Yeah.
Pretend you're a jellyfish.

1309
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,141
Sway your limbs.
Yeah, just let the water take you.

1310
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,019
-Sway? Like this?
-Yeah.

1311
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,854
There you go. Like that.

1312
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:37,733
What? I think pretending
to be a jellyfish is working.

1313
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,818
-It's working. Yeah.
-It's working.

1314
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:43,155
It's not working! It's not! [screaming]
It's not working!

1315
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,324
My head!

1316
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,785
Hey! I drank some water!

1317
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:49,203
[Seung-hyo coughs]

1318
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:51,205
Don't grab my hair. Please.

1319
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,797
Am I really floating right now?

1320
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:03,801
This is so cool! Wow. I feel so strange.

1321
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,763
Do you want to keep talking
even in this moment?

1322
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,974
Feel the stillness in the water.

1323
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,476
[pleasant music playing]

1324
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,313
Hey, Seung-hyo?

1325
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,107
[Seung-hyo] What?

1326
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:20,818
I was actually nervous.

1327
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,363
I wanted to quit because I was exhausted.

1328
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:27,491
I wanted to rest and dream of a new life.

1329
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,410
But…

1330
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:35,124
I felt like nothing
without my Greip background.

1331
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,712
Everyone is moving forward,

1332
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,048
but I'm the only one who's stopped.

1333
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:46,593
That's how I felt after I quit swimming.

1334
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,431
The start signal had sounded,

1335
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,601
but I felt like I was standing alone
at the starting line.

1336
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:56,854
I thought,

1337
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:03,986
"It's going to be hard to find a place
where I can swim freely again."

1338
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,739
But you found it.

1339
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:07,823
I know.

1340
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,743
I found it, so why can't you?

1341
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,789
I hated going into bathwater,
but I'm able to jump back in again.

1342
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,500
You think so?

1343
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,879
Can I swim somewhere new too?

1344
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:23,922
Of course.

1345
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:27,634
Hey, I'm just curious.

1346
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,347
Hypothetically.

1347
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:36,018
Let's say you could swim again.

1348
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:38,937
If that were to happen,

1349
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,274
would you still be an architect?

1350
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,903
Yeah.

1351
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:47,905
-Really?
-Of course.

1352
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,532
What about you?

1353
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,242
-What?
-Hypothetically.

1354
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:54,912
Let's say you go back to before you quit.

1355
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,332
If you can go back to Greip,

1356
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,250
will you go back?

1357
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,545
No.

1358
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,630
One more.

1359
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,591
Hypothetically.

1360
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,678
Let's say you go back to before
your engagement was broken,

1361
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,681
what would you do?

1362
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,479
No. I wouldn't go back.

1363
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,438
[yelps]

1364
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,694
Okay, then.

01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,409
[pleasant music playing]

1366
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,787
We'll write letters to our future selves
ten years from now.

1367
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:37,913
[Mo-eum] Okay.

1368
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,581
Do we have to?

1369
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:40,958
Shut up and write.

1370
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,336
Let's open it in ten years.

1371
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,507
If anyone opens it before then,
they'll have bad luck for 1,000 years!

1372
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,259
Pinky swear! No take backs!

1373
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,898
Hi, Bae Seok-ryu ten years from now.

1374
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,734
It's me. The best and most beautiful.
Bae Seok-ryu!

1375
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,905
[Mo-eum] What if I can shoot webs
with the advancement of technology?

1376
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:15,367
There's a rumor you climb on the ceilings.

1377
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,318
[Seung-hyo] Ten years from now
feels so far away.

1378
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,947
By then, you probably told Seok-ryu
how you felt, right?

1379

01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:56,843
Those feelings have long since expired.

1386
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,804
You finally opened it after all this time?

1387
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,056
I dug it up that night. I was curious.

1388
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,351
Greip contacted us!

1389
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,521
I moved here recently.
It's so nice to run in to you.

1390
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:08,605
Really?

1391
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,524
It's the reporter again.

1392
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:12,276
Have our tastes overlapped again?

1393
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,695
[Seok-ryu] No matter how hard you try,

1394
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:15,988
it's a waste of time.

1395
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,490
Don't talk about my hard work like that.

1396
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,575
Seok-ryu?

1397
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:22,578
Seung-hyo!

1398
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,121
What the hell did you just say?

1399
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:30,460
