Hey.

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,611
Stop right there.

00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,237
Hey!

What you said earlier…

9
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,887
what did you mean?

10
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,886
[man] Seok-ryu.

11
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,394
Hyeon-jun?

12
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,982
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,819
I got on a plane to see you.

14
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,780
I've missed you.

15
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,578
What are you doing?

16
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,706
Can't you see I'm talking with her?

17
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,751
I know you.

18
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,630
You're Choi Seung-hyo, right?
Seok-ryu's childhood friend.

19
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,301
I think you know me too.

20
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,928
It's nice to meet you. I'm Song Hyeon-jun.

21
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,056
I can't say the same.

22
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,351
We're not on greeting terms either.

23
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,437
Oh, is that so?

24
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,606
Why did you even show up here?

25
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,067
And why now of all times?

26
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,156
Why, what was going on?

27
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,450
I don't think I need to
give you an answer.

28
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,078
Let's go, Seok-ryu.

29

-Hey.
-I have something to say.

30
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,916
A lot too.

31
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,792
[Geun-sik] What do you think you're doing?

32
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,047
-Sir. Ma'am.
-What the hell are you doing?

33
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,051
How dare you come here?

34
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,220
Let go.

35
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:41,971
Let go of me.

36
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,474
Mi-suk, don't try to stop me.

37
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,227
Even if it kills me,
I'm going to destroy this bastard tonight!

38
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,478
[Mi-suk] I won't stop you.

39
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,189
But you can't do it here.

[Mi-suk] Are you coming home
from work, Seung-hyo?

45
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,797
Yeah.

46
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,757
Well done.
I'm sure you're tired. Go on home.

47
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,011
And Seok-ryu, you come home.

48
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,015
You too, Hyeon-jun.

49
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,894
[Seok-ryu] Mom,
why would you invite him home?

50
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,855
This is between us.

51
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,399
I'll take care of it.

52
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,360
It's a family matter. There should be
etiquette in relationships too.

53
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,612
You two called things off
without our consent!

54
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,824
Is marriage a game?

55
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,286

-[Geun-sik exhales]
-Why is Mom so calm?

60
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,021
Why is she being so generous?

61
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,232
She's possessed by a ghost
who can't let people starve.

62
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,528
Jeez, do I need to call a shaman?

63
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,407
Then, what about my brother-in-law?
Was he always this shameless?

64

-Brother-in-law? Don't call him that.
-[grunts]

65
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:31,247
I thought he was just trying
to be friendly then.

66
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,458
Was it two years ago?

67
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,502
He came to our house for vacation
because Seok-ryu was busy.

68
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,463
Oh, right.

69
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,007
He gave me a bunch
of pocket money back then.

70
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,884
Shut your mouth.

71
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,886
[Mi-suk] Do you want more soup?

72
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,638
Yes, I'd appreciate it.

[Geun-sik scoffs] My goodness.

74
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,434
He doesn't know when to refuse, does he?

75
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,769
That little punk.

76
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,146
Goodness.

77
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,940
-Dad, where are you going?
-[Geun-sik] The rooftop.

78
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,444
I can't stand being
in the same room as that bastard!

79
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,529
Just give him everything!

80
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,156
Just eat until you explode!

Hey, why aren't you going in?
Aren't you here to see Seok-ryu?

88
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,852
Forget it.
There's an unwelcome guest inside.

89
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,522
Unwelcome guest? Who?

90
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,982
Seok-ryu's ex-fiancé.

91
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,067
What?

92
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,362
Is this bastard high?

93
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,073
How dare he appear in front of Seok-ryu?

94
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:47,990
I'll kill him.

95
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,909
Don't do anything.

96
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,495
Why? We have to kill that jerk.

97
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,622
I want to kill him more.

Did you get enough to eat?

100

Yes, it was delicious. Thank you.

101
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,813
That's good.

102
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,901
I feel like I've done my duty,
so I'll say what's on my mind now.

103
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,196
Mom, why are you talking like that?
Are you shooting a historical drama?

104
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,201
From what I hear,

105
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,330
Seok-ryu cheated on you. Is that true?

106
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,416
Excuse me?

107
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,668
No, of course not…

108
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,088
Unless you did?

[sighs]

110
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,260
Then…

111
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,262
did you cheat?

112
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,805
No, I didn't.

113
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,809
But it was my fault.

114
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,189
I take full responsibility
for breaking off our engagement.

00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,486
Hyeon-jun, that's enough.

118
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,322
It's not like that, Mom.

120
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,619
I had a feeling my daughter
wouldn't have done that.

121
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,788
Still, I wanted to ask to make sure.

122
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,458
If it were true, I wanted to apologize.

123
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,293
But since that's not the case…

124
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,921
You bastard.

125
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,506
Come get this beating.

126
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,049
-Wait, honey.
-[Seok-ryu] Mom!

127
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,219
-Mi-suk!
-Mom! I said it wasn't his fault.

128
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,554
You can't hit people with this!
You'll kill him!

129
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,473
Fine. I'll kill this bastard
and go to jail.

130
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,225
Hey, you bastard!

131
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,143
How dare you break my daughter's heart?

132
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,311
How dare you?

133
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,439
-I told you I can't go to jail with you!
-Mom, please!

134
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,858
Hyeon-jun, let's go.

135
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,068
I've seen this before.

136
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,945
It's totally déjà vu.
This is so immersive!

137
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,072
-[Seok-ryu] Come on.
-Hit me until you feel better!

138
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,240
That's why I came here.

139
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,367
-You're going to die.
-Good.

140
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,618
You think I won't?

141
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,370
Mom! Jeez!

142
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,163
-Mom, stop!
-[Geun-sik] Not too much!

143
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,082
Wow! This woman's so strong!

144
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,584
[Seok-ryu] Come on. I said let's go!

145
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,127
Come on.

146
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,879
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

147
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,840
You punk! I can't let that bastard
leave in one piece!

148
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,968
I'll come back again, sir.

149
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,928
Don't come ever come back, you bastard!

150
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,721
If I ever see you here again,

151
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,057
I'll knock your head off, you prick!

152
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,476
My son works out, punk!

153
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,271
[groans]

154
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,358
This burning sense of justice
is rising from my core.

155
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,652
Beer's not enough to cool it.

156
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,988
Want another one?

157
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,949
Let's go and cause a scene instead.
I'll cover the costs.

158
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,159
Whatever.
You won't even pay for the beer.

159
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,954
You said you wanted to
kill him even more.

160
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,247
I was just saying.

161
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,540
-Who am I to do that?
-What?

162
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,501
What do you mean?

163
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,879
You're the son of Seok-ryu's mom's friend.

164
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,549
You've been her best friend
since childhood.

165
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,092
Exactly.

166
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,137
-We're just friends.
-Hey!

167
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,556
Being friends is an incredible thing.

168
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,185
One definition of a friend says it's one
who carries my sorrows on their back.

169
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,146
How cool is that?

170
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,524
What if I get involved
and dig up more of her sorrows?

171
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,027
-I don't even know how she feels.
-[Mo-eum scoffs]

172

You're so frustrating.
How much longer will you keep this up?

00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,991
When I think of all the time
you've wasted already,

174
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,037
you could've dug
until you reached the Earth's core.

[mellow music playing]

176
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,873
Mo-eum, did you…

177
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,751
That's right. I saw the time capsule.

178

Hey. You should've buried just the letter.

179
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,424
If you hide your feelings in there too,

180
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,551
how would anyone know?

181
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,887
-Look.
-[Seung-hyo clears throat]

182
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,598
You're the only one who's suffering.

183
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,893
You didn't tell her, did you?

184
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,810
Are you insane?

185
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,231
Seung-hyo, you have to
save yourself from unrequited love.

186
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,691
Even I can't rescue you.

187
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,820
-[sighs]
-[Mo-eum] But…

188
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,407
I will root for you.

189
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,868
[slurps]

190
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,954
I'm off.

191
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,039
[grunts]

192
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,543
Darn, I should've teased him
about it some more.

193
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,670
[chuckles softly]

194
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,257

195

[crushes can]

197

LOVE IS ALL ABOUT TIMING

[lounge music playing in the background]

199
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,490
Why did you come?

200
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,744
Did you come to be beaten to death
by my parents?

201
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,247
No, I came to live.

202
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,584
I came because I wanted to
breathe, eat, and sleep again.

203
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,380
-[sighs]
-[Hyeon-jun] Without you,

204
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,551
I can't do those basic things.
I can't live.

205
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,136
That's not because of me.

206
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,055
It wasn't because we were special either.

207
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,309
It would've been the same with anyone.

208
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,979
We dated for years.

209
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,314
-It's an obvious feeling.
-Don't say that.

210
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,317
No matter how much you hate me,

211
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,362
don't say it as if we were nothing.

212
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,866
-Seok-ryu…
-[Seok-ryu exhales]

213
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,534
I came to get you back.

214
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,871
I still love you.

215
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,459
Hyeon-jun, it's over between us.

216
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,211
It's not love you feel anymore.

217
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,922
It's just a habit.

218
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,717
A bad habit you've yet to fix.

219
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,224
Don't come back here. Please.

220
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,825
I'm sleeping over. Give me some clothes.

221
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,076
[Mo-eum] What?

222
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,078
My goodness.

223
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,873
-Did you run away from home?
-Probably.

224
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,711
I bet it was interesting to see
Hyeon-jun inside your house.

225
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,004
How did you know?

226
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,130
I ran into Seung-hyo.

227
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,382
-You did? Where?
-In front of your house.

228
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,134
He was pacing back and forth,

229
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,511
like a dog that needed to pee.

230
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,555
[Jae-suk] Mo-eum! Come here.

231
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,974
Jeez, why now? In a bit!

232
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,436
[Jae-suk] Hey, my carpal tunnel
or whatever is hurting my wrist,

233
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,189
-so I can't open this jar of jam!
-Jeez.

234
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,150
Hold on! Hey, give me a second.
I need to help my mom.

235
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,944
-I'll be right back.
-[Seok-ryu] Sure.

236
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,987
[Mo-eum] Mom, I told you
if you eat that at night,

237
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,489
your blood sugar will spike!

238
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,573
[footsteps descending]

239
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,379
[inhales, exhales]

240
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,131
Are you asleep?

241
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,384
No.

242
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,094
[Mo-eum] Okay.

243
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,429
Are you sleepy?

244
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,639
[chuckles]

245
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,267
No, say what you want to say.

246
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,603
How does it feel to see Hyeon-jun again?

247
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,729
[scoffs]

248
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,064
Took you long enough.

249
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,649
I mean,

250
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,362
I just remembered
what we talked about last time.

251
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,740
Don't eat until I get back. Wait for me.

252
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,158
Don't you dare lay a finger.

253
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,787
[mellow music playing]

254
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,125
[Mo-eum] Hey.

255
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,168
You still love him?

256
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,590
-Your ex?
-That's half-right and half-wrong.

257
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,093
What does that mean?

258
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,097
I loved the time we spent together.

259
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,309
Everything he gave me.

260
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,185
I still love that.

261
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,564
But for some relationships,

262
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,150
I know it's better to end them.

263
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,737
So I'm doing my best to forget him.

264
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,697
And he needs to do the same.

265
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,369
Has there been
any changes in your feelings since then?

266
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,665
Nope. I'm much more calmer
than I thought I'd be.

267
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,669
Even when I was getting on
the flight for Korea,

268
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,047
just the thought of seeing him again

269
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,508
made my heart feel like it would burst.

270
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,552
[exhales] Okay.

271
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,972
Well then, I guess there's no need
for me to get involved, right?

272
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,390
[Seok-ryu] What?

273
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,516
I mean,

274
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,894
if you wanted,
I was going to beat him up for you.

275
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,396
I would've waited right behind you.

276
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,273
As long as I don't kill him, it'd be fine.

277
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:45,903
[chuckles] Hey, isn't it illegal
to aid and abet in assault?

278
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,529
[chuckles]

279
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,908
Look, a true hero

280
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,620
can put aside their lifetime job
in the name of friendship.

281
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,748
Forget it. [chuckles]
Just worry about your civil service job.

282
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,668
Your wish is my command.

283

[inhales]

284
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,507
All right. To ensure the safety
of our citizens tomorrow,

285
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,092
I shall proceed to sleep.

286
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,094
Good night.

287
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,391
Don't fight for world peace
in your dreams and get some rest.

288
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,268
[chuckling] Okay, I'll try.

289
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,146
Goodness.

290
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,023
Still, I'm relieved.

291
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,987
It seems your feelings have dulled a bit.

292
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,906
The feelings for your ex.

Honey, it's time for breakfast.

300
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,382
You want me to kill you this early?

301
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,509
You expect me to make breakfast?

302
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,636
No, come and eat.

303
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,272
Why did you make
tteokbokki for breakfast?

304
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,108
Spicy food is the perfect remedy
for stress.

305
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,697
Experience the privilege of being the wife
of a tteokbokki shop owner. [chuckles]

306
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,910
Yeah, it's better to have
my stomach hurt than my heart.

307
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,455
By the way, did Seok-ryu come home?

308
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,791
I think she's in her room.

309
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,543
Speaking of which,

310
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,423
do you think she was trying to protect him
by taking him out like that?

311
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,508
What are you saying?

312
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,427
He was about to get knocked out,

313
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,931
so she took him out of the ring
before you could land a haymaker.

314
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,599
In any case… [chuckles]

315
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,519
…it's as if you were Mike Tyson
or Manny Pacquiao.

316
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,771
You went wild on him. [chuckles]

317
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:28,899
You did great.

318
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,862
It made me feel better
to see you hit that punk like that.

319
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,823
God.

320
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,659
Maybe I shouldn't have hit him though.

321
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,036
-[Geun-sik] What?
-You know.

322
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,205
You think he came here to get hit?

323
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,750
-He must still have feelings for her.
-What are you trying to say?

324
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,586
I know it's late, but if they want to,

325
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,630
I'd be okay if they got back together.

326
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,135
Her life will return to normal
if she goes back to the US with him.

327
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,053
You think that makes any sense?

328
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,138
Come on, why not?

329
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,849
A person's feelings
aren't always logical or consistent.

00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,933
No!

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,227
What are you… Absolutely not!

332
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,108
That punk hurt Seok-ryu. I hate him.
And I don't want her to go to the US!

I mean… I don't want it either…

You're going out dressed like that?

Yeah. Why?

345
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,033
Get changed. Wear something else.

00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,300
Who'd wear this around the neighborhood?

354
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,971
You. Look at those bags under your eyes.
And why are your lips so pale?

355
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,474
-Did you even wash your face?
-Seriously?

356
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,434
[Mi-suk] Look at me.

357
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,561
You look so lifeless.

358
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,938
Are you aging now?

359
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,232
Put some makeup on.

360
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,692
-[Seok-ryu] What's with you?
-Add a little blush too.

361
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,154
Apply some red lipstick.

362
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,950
What's suddenly gotten into her?

363
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,413
Who goes to class dressed like this?

364
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,467
You look pretty today.

365
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,511
[quirky music playing]

366
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,640
[chuckles softly]

367
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,725
I'LL BE THERE SOON
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY

368
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,354
You need rocks to smack
into each other to see if sparks will fly.

369
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,900
I guess Mom had an ulterior motive.

370
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,402
[Hyeon-jun] What?

371
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,695
It's nothing.

372
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,863
What brings you here?

373
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,991
I clearly told you not to come back.

374
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,285
I told you I came back for you.

375
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,369
[door opens]

376
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,251
So we meet again.

377
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,460
[sighs softly]

378
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,378
Come on. Get on.

379
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,130
-What?
-Aren't you going to class?

380
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,339
You'll be late.

381
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,799
That's right.

382
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,843
Seok-ryu.

383
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,013
Grab on tight.

384
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,307
[pop song playing]

385
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,949
What's with the bike?

386
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,410
The Earth is sick.

387
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,663
It's an environmentally-friendly approach
for an architect who's concerned

388
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,915
about the climate crisis
and carbon neutrality.

389
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,585
Also, the extra weight
makes for a good workout.

390
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,295
You told me to get on.

391
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,548
What's with the dress?
It doesn't suit you.

392
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,884
-And what did you do to your cheeks?
-Hey.

393
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,636
If you're talking about my blush,

394
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,139
it's Peach Fuzz,
and it's this year's color of the year.

395
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,307
As if you knew!

396
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,560
Goodness, I guess
you were expecting to run into him

397
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,145
since you're dressed up like this.

398
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,229
That's not true!

399
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,774
This was my mom's doing.

400
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,277
I'm not going to eat
her side dishes anymore.

401
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,279
I can't hear you. What was that?

402
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,740
I said you look ugly.

403
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,577
I couldn't hear you again.
Can you repeat that?

404
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,288
You look ugly-- [exclaims]

405
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,167
Hey! That's dangerous. We could crash!

406
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,086
Then, stop messing around!

407
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,630
Jeez, what a lunatic.

408
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,342
[song continues playing]

409
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,834
-Last night--
-About last night--

410
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,711
-Go ahead.
-No, you first.

411
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,255
No, you go.

412
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,549
[gulps]

413
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,843
What did he say last night?

414
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,427
What?

415
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,639
He wouldn't have come here
from the US because he was bored.

416
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,975
He must have come for a reason.

417
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,436
Don't tell me…

418
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,481
-Does he want to get back together?
-What?

419
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,733
Well…

420
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,445
Well, so…

421
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,322
I must be right.

422
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,492
What? Did you start to waver
after hearing that?

423
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,494
[sighs softly]

424
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,580
I don't blame you.

425
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,791
It must've felt nice again
to see him after so long.

426
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,878
Hey, is that the only way you can talk?

427
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,089
It's true.
It's not like you two were just dating.

428
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,216
You were engaged.

429
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,467
Seung-hyo!

430
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,760
Still,

431
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,721
how could you be swayed by that?

432
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,598
Don't you have any self-respect?

433
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,099
Stop the bike.

434
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,186
-I said stop!
-Damn it.

435
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,145
[grunts]

436
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,357
-[quirky music playing]
-[sighs]

437
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,694
You said stop.

438
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,487
Jerk.

439
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,614
[Seung-hyo exclaims]

440
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,657
Hey.

441
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,786
[groans softly]

442
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,793
[sighs]

443
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,089
[slicing]

444
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,309
What is it? Did I do something wrong?

445
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,727
[chuckling] No.

446
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,521
You look full of energy today.

447
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,815
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

448
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,414
[door closes]

449
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,919
-Hey, Seung-hyo. Want some coffee?
-Should I make some for you?

450
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,463
[Seung-hyo] We have the
Misom project meeting this afternoon.

451
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,674
We'll review
the Jeseon-dong coffee shop plans too.

452
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,218
And we need to start preparing
for Greip's flagship store,

453
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,344
so get ready.

454
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,015
Na-yun, is that white mark on his back
a ghost or something?

455
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,892
-It's foundation.
-[Myeong-u] What?

456
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,352
-[door closes]
-Shade 21.

457
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,937
No. Shade 19?

458
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,691
Makeup? Seung-hyo must've had
a passionate morning!

459
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,694
It was intense enough
to leave a mark of a hug on his back!

460
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:14,739
-Those facial features look familiar.
-[Myeong-u] What?

461
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,951
Who is it? No way. Was it Tae-hui?

462
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,246
Were you two talking about me?

463
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,914
[Myeong-u] Yeah. I mean, no.

464
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,666
-What?
-It's not her.

465
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,252
It's not? Then, who is it?

466
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,962
It's obvious.

467
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,506
-Jeez.
-Who is it?

468
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,259
-What's wrong?
-What? Well…

469
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,386
It's not you.

470
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,470
-Me?
-[Myeong-u] No.

471
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,639
Hey, who is it?

472
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,558
What was that? [chuckles softly]

473
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,270
TEMPERATURE OF TIME - ONGGI KETTLE

474
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,525
What are you doing?

475
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,819
I gave you some Botox
so you'd stop scowling.

476
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,488
I must've been too focused.

477
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,574
You sure that's all?

478
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,160
And not scowling about something else?

479
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,911
Stop trying to find out.

480
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,165
You caught me.

481
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,502
But didn't we agree to make a coffee pot?

482
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,504
It says "kettle" here.

483
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,842
Yeah, I changed it.
I've spoken with the person in charge too.

484
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,178
You didn't even tell me.
But why change it?

485
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,014
There's no romance
if things heat up too quickly.

486
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,643
Turn on the heat
and carefully bring the water to a boil.

487
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,480
I believe in the importance
of taking time.

488
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:30,899
Like an onggi?

489
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,526
Like love.

490
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,154
[Tae-hui] In my twenties,

491
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,657
I hoped too much
for things to heat up quickly.

492
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,953
But now, I want to focus
on warm and subtle things.

493
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,914
Slowly and for a long time.

494
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,459
You've changed a lot.

495
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,128
It's because of you.

496
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,882
No, it's thanks to you.

497
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,639
Stop being scared.
I won't ask you to take responsibility.

498
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,893
Let's just wait and see.

499
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,148
I'll follow my heart.
You follow yours.

500
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,653
And Seok-ryu will follow hers.

501
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,906
Why would you suddenly bring her up?

502
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,158
It's so easy to get you worked up.

503
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,704
Where did my cool, calm ex-boyfriend go?

504
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,291
You turn into a teenage boy
at the sound of Seok-ryu's name.

505
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,584
It's not that.

506
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,088
-You keep going off-topic, so--
-You're trying way too hard.

507
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,506
This is cute too though.

508
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,093
[exhales]

509
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,762
[smacks lips]

510
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,097
[indistinct chatter]

511
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,348
[amusing music playing]

512
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,725
[Dan-ho] Yeon-du!

513
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,354
Dad.

514
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,481
Did you take the afternoon off again?

515
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,654
Yeah. You had a mild fever this morning.
Let's go home early and rest.

516
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,282
Unbelievable.

517
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,953
What will your company think of me
if you keep acting like this?

518
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,872
What?

519
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,790
They'll think of me as a weak child

520
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,834
who's prone to crying for her dad.

521
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,088
Yeon-du, having days off
is an employee's fundamental right.

522
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,966
Did you forget
I'm a social affairs reporter?

523
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,801
If they treat me unfairly over this,

524
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,137
I don't care who they are.
I'll confront them.

525
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,097
Dad.

526
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,602
Just keep your job until I go to college.

527
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,564
Okay.

528
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,525
Wait for me.

00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,695
Goodbye. [exclaims]

530
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,323
[sighs]

531
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,451
Why am I the one
who always loses games and pays for lunch?

532
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,414
Hold on. Are they rigging them
behind my back?

533
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,209
That's mine.

00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,092
[man] Are they drunk?

538
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,385
What?

539
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,720
[dramatic music playing]

540
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,765
Just a moment!

541
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,435
Sir?

542
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,857
Cardiac arrest.

543
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,151
-Someone call 119!
-I'll do it!

00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,031
[line ringing]

545
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,534
Hello? I'm at the intersection
near Hyereung Kindergarten.

546
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,410
A car just ran into a streetlight.

547
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,870
Do you have a hammer?

548
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,373
Yes, but I think the driver's unconscious.

549
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,416
Yes, I understand.

550
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:38,962
Please move!

551
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,680
[grunts]

552
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,558
Sir.

553
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,601
Sir?

00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,771
[seatbelt unlocks]

559
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,060
Are you okay? Don't get up.

560
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:36,978
Stay down.

561
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,564
I know it's uncomfortable,
but let's turn to your side.

562
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,815
Okay.

563
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,819
It'll be okay.

564
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,323

[exhales]

569
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,265
Jae-suk! What are you looking for?

570
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,600
-My sunglasses.
-[In-suk] What?

571
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,936
I had them on just a second ago.

572
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,605
-Goodness. Hands on your head.
-[In-suk laughing]

573
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,233
-My goodness. I don't believe it.
-[laughing]

574
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:29,155
Hey, it wasn't right under my nose.
It was right on my head!

575
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,700
Jeez, is it my age?
Why am I so forgetful these days?

576
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,035
Don't get me started.

577
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,579
I needed to go to the post office
to send a package yesterday.

578
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,873
I put my shoes on and left
but forgot the box.

579
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,835
-Goodness. That's so sad.
-What's wrong with you?

580
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,796
I can't trust myself anymore.

581
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,173
I can't even remember words when talking.

582
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,342
I called the washer a vacuum
and the vacuum a fridge.

583
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,843
And I call Dong-jin Seok-ryu.

584
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,639
Hey, this gastrodia root extract
is supposed to be a gift from the heavens.

585
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,975
They say it contains neurotransmitters,

586
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,477
so it improves blood flow
and helps prevent dementia.

587
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,145
-Really?
-Try it.

588
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,730
-Give me one.
-Another extract?

589
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,941
Don't rely on these things.
Open it for me.

590
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,192
-Open it for you? Okay.
-Yeah.

591
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,404
Get in the habit of writing notes
if you're worried about dementia.

592
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,407
-[In-suk] Notes? Okay. Here.
-[Hye-suk] Read books and newspapers too.

593
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,242
You still haven't fixed that habit?

594
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,243
-[Hye-suk] What?
-What?

595
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,745
You can't go a day without showing off.
That bad habit.

596
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,288
-Hey.
-[In-suk] What's with you?

597
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:23,251
You two are the closest
but are so harsh when you argue.

598
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,169
Yeah, Mi-suk.

599
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,006
You're irritated
because Seok-ryu's fiancé's here.

600
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,258
Don't be sensitive
and take it out on us…

601
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,469
Where did you hear that?

602
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,014
-Dong-jin. I went to the gym this morning.
-[In-suk gasps]

603
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,224
I'm going to kill that punk!

604
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,392
Damn it.

605
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,436
-[Jae-suk] Hey!
-Can't keep a secret in this town.

606
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,397
I heard he was begging to get her back!

607
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,565
And why wouldn't he?

608
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,442
-She's so beautiful!
-That's right.

609
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,445
Seok-ryu looks just like you
when you were young!

610
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,863
She does take after me.

611
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,449
Yeah, Mi-suk was so popular
in high school.

612
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,743
-[Jae-suk] That's right.
-You remember too, right?

613
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,536
I don't know. I don't remember.

614
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,038
What?

615
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,206
Right. That's how you were back then.

616
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,625
-[Jae-suk] Yeah.
-Mi-suk was so pretty.

617
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,543
-Hey.
-So pretty.

618
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:09,088
[Jae-suk] She's popular like her mom.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

619
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,467
Don't take him back
no matter how much he begs!

620
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,178
-He's a despicable bastard!
-[In-suk] Right.

621
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,388
He's not that bad.

622
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,433
Yes, he is! He disgraced her
with a canceled engagement!

623
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,350
That's right!

624
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,895
Crushing him into a pulp
wouldn't be enough punishment.

625
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,314
Hey, what do you mean,
"crush him into a pulp"?

626
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,067
My son-in-law's not some herb extract!

627
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,985
You're all so crude!

628
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,237
-Forget this!
-[Jae-suk] Hey!

629
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,823
-That's not what I meant, Mi-suk.
-[Hye-suk] My gosh.

630
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,409
-What on earth were we supposed to say?
-[Jae-suk] I swear.

631
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,660
She's in menopause.

632
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,621
-Mood swings.
-[Hye-suk] We all are.

633
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,874
-[Jae-suk] This is so hard.
-Pomegranate juice is good for that.

634
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,919
-Open that for me.
-Wait just a second. Mi-suk!

635
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,421
She's not going to get over it.

636
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,882
-Stop drinking that.
-Just leave her.

637
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,221
[Hyeon-jun] Seok-ryu.

638
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,391
Wait…

639
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,229
[exclaiming in pain]

640
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,149
Hyeon-jun, what's wrong?
Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

641
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,901
-[whinces]
-[Seok-ryu] Are you okay?

642
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,945
I got you.

643
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,866
-My acting's improved a lot, hasn't it?
-What on earth are you doing?

644
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,785
I'm sorry.

645
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,496
You wouldn't have turned around otherwise.

646
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,833
Seok-ryu,

647
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,001
I messed up back then.

648
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,838
I know I wasn't good enough.

649
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,882
I should've tried harder
to be more understanding.

650
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,884
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

651
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,887
I know you did your best.

652
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,767
I was too overwhelmed.
I only thought about myself.

653
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,519
You had no other choice--

654
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,562
I'll get going.

655
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,148
Let's get something to eat.

656
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,526
If it's for the last time,
I'm fine with that. Just once.

657
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,862
Let's grab a meal together.

658
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,787
Dan-ho?

659
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,497
Yeon-du!

660
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,252
She said she had something to give you.

661
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,628
-What?
-[Dan-ho] Go ahead.

662
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,175
Stoop down a little.

663
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,634
Like this?

664
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,391
[chuckles softly]

665
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,354
-[pleasant music playing]
-[exclaims]

666
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,862
Does it sting?

667
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,741
No, it doesn't sting at all.
It feels so warm.

668
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,286
It shouldn't feel warm.
That means bacteria got in it.

669
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,455
-Just a second.
-[Mo-eum] Okay.

670
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,010
[Yeon-du] There.

671
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,803
Wow, Yeon-du.

672
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,640
I'll get better in no time
because of your ointment.

673
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,891
Thank you.

674
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,102
-You know what?
-What?

675
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,647
You were so cool today!

676
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,608
Even though you didn't have webs
coming out of your hands,

677
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,194
you were way cooler than Spider-Man.

678
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,946
[Mo-eum] Really?

679
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,698
Hearing that gives me so much strength.
Thank you.

680
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,452
Come with us if you're getting off work.
We'll give you a ride.

681
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,788
What do you think? Should I come?

682
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,789
Let's go.

683
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,998
[chuckles]

684
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,932
Are you feeling hot?

685
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,893
Yeon-du has a cold,
so I can't turn on the AC right now.

686
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,311
Yeah, I'm fine.

687
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,272
But it looks like you're hot.

688
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,773
A little bit.

689
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,945
-Do you mind if I take off my jacket?
-Sure, you don't have to ask.

690
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,833
-[exhales]
-[engine accelerating]

691
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,589
I think Yeon-du has completely fallen
for you today.

692
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,469
At last! I finally did it.

693
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,722
I'm not taking this off tonight.

694
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,516
Do you get hurt often like that?

695
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,728
It's not often. Just sometimes.

696
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,063
Because all sorts of incidents happen.

697
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,649
Don't you get scared?

698
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,276
Like what happened earlier?

699
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,821
No way. None of that scares me.

700
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,823
Other things scare me.

701
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,244
"What if I can't save the patient?"

702
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,915
"What if I'm too late
and can't do anything?"

703
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:59,628
You're so brave. I admire you.

704
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,675
You're glorifying me
because of what I said.

705
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,760
It's true though.

706
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,930
When I saw you, I realized
we don't have to look far for heroes.

707
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,599
They're close to us.

708
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,226
I was just doing my job.

709
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,063
Oh.

710
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,315
But I did meet a real hero once.

711
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,067
-Really?
-Yes.

712
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,777
-Who was it?
-Well…

713
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,405
Once, we were rushing
a child to the hospital.

714
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,824
-Right.
-At that time, the roads were blocked.

715
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,077
We couldn't move forward at all.

716
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,623
That's when someone got out of his car,

717
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,584
and he directed traffic to clear the road.

718
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,295
There was like a superhero.

719
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,049
It felt like I had met
the man of my dreams.

720
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,260
I don't know who he is,
but I call him Mudflat Man.

721
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,096
Mudflat Man?

722
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,182
Yes, he had the funniest T-shirt on.

723
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,810
It said, "I love you, mudflats."

724
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,061

726
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,899
Are you okay?

727
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,819
-[Dan-ho] I'm sorry.
-Did the lights…

728
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,445
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

729
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,656
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

730
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,785
[Dan-ho groans]

731
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,788
Dan-ho, where did you get this shirt?

732
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,793
Well, the thing is…
while I was covering a story,

733
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,255
I met an environmental group called
the Mudflat Guardians who gave one to me.

734
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,548
Mudflat Guardians?

735
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,216
[Dan-ho] Yes.

736
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,634
Holy cow.

737
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,846
So you might know him then.

738
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,557
Who else is in that group?

739
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,518
I don't know.
They're mostly older men and women.

740
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,270
[Mo-eum] Not them. I mean, young guys.

741
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:44,191
So I didn't see his face,
but he seemed to be about our age.

742
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,486
I think he was as tall…

743
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,780
as you…

744
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,828
[horn honking]

746
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,420
Good night!

747
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,421
[Dan-ho] Wait…

748
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,173
What? Why are you following me?

749
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,468
Well, I had something to give you.

750
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,219
Just a moment.

751
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,513
So…

752
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,393
[groans softly]

753
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,603
[Mo-eum] Seriously?

754
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,107
Why do you have
so many medical supplies in your bag?

755
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,984
They're all for you.

756
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,111
The pharmacy said

757
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,822
you need different medications
for each healing stage.

758
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,367
This one prevents infection.

759
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,037
This prevents scabs from forming.

760
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,623
This one's for scars.

761
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,548
Please don't get hurt again.

762
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,721
I have to go park my car.

Why is my heart pounding?

770
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,042
What is it, a drum or something?

PERFECT MATCH

773
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,053
I knew it.

774
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,597
Those pale, squashed facial features.

775
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,432
I'm sure it's Seok-ryu.

776
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,935
I knew this would happen!

777
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,980
I was worried about her from the start.
Damn it!

-What are you doing?
-Miss.

782
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,741
You are not a cheetah.

783
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,077
Of course, you're not a puma
or a jaguar either.

784
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,912
What are you talking about?

785
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,748
You should run at a speed
that's appropriate for humans.

786
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,167
I didn't sign up for a personal trainer.

787
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,087
I'm in the middle of my own workout,
so can you go away?

788
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,131
You're making me uncomfortable.

What do I do?

796
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,482
I can't allow that.

797
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,276

You can run straight
to the Serengeti at this speed.

-Eyes on the road!

00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,369
Okay, go.

I'm watching my show.

Why do you have to stand
in front of the TV?

808
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,092
Today wasn't a coincidence, was it?

Hyeon-jun came here,
and you suddenly had me dress up.

Gosh, I applied lotion,
but why are my heels so cracked?

812
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,269
Look at this. You're changing the subject.

813
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,439
I can clearly see
what you're trying to do.

814
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,651
Don't do this anymore.
It won't change anything.

815
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,736
This won't do.
Let's go to the sauna tomorrow.

816
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,989
-No, I'm not going.
-Why not? It's nice.

817
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,283
We can soak in hot water and exfoliate.

818
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,869
Right.
Hasn't it been years since you exfoliated?

819
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,998
-Gross. I can't associate with you.
-Body scrubs can handle that, okay?

820
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,417
What's so great
about scrubbing your flesh off?

821
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,337
Above all,
I hate getting in the water with others.

822
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,672
-Why?
-It's uncomfortable.

823
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,049
Why would you sit around naked
with other strangers?

824
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,093
Who cares? We're all women.

825
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,345
Also, you're my daughter.

826

Isn't it nice to go with your mother?

827
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,973
Maybe when I was younger,

828
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,768
but we're independent
and separate entities now.

829
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,729
You still have that kind
of outdated fantasy?

830
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,023
Yeah, I'm old-fashioned and from the '80s.

831
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,401
You're modern and sophisticated.
Good for you, you brat.

Don't you watch the news?
The world's a scary place.

It's making
the whole neighborhood noisy. Jeez.

-Quiet! This is a residential area.
-That's not what's important!

848

Why the hell did you follow me
and scare me like that?

849
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,567
Why did you suddenly run like that?

850
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,861
Because I thought someone was chasing me.

851
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,529
You could've called my name.

852
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,574
Well, you could've looked back.
Why were you only looking straight?

853
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,993
You should've called out and reassured me.

854
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,370
You should've checked first
before blindly running.

I think this is our problem.

858
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,427
We pass things off on each other,
make excuses, and shift the blame.

859

We don't say what we need to say,

860
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,308
so we go around in circles
and end up fighting,

861
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,519

wasn't that.

865

That day,

867
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,411
you asked me what I meant.

Stop driving me crazy!

869
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,417
Back then and now, you keep doing this…

so I feel like…

871
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,923
I'm going to lose my mind because of you!

872
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,680

-Don't.

00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,896
…I have a bunch of error messages
popped up in my head.

876
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:43,318
It's overloaded and has stopped working,
so I can't perform any new tasks.

877
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,529
So, later.

878
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,322
Tell me later.

879
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,161
-Later when?
-Just later.

880
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:57,374
Things are pretty complicated
for me right now.

881
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,336
Because of Hyeon-jun?

882
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,922
No, it's not because of that.

883
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,384
There's just a lot of other things.

884
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,511
[smacks lips]

885
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,846
[inhales]

886
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,683
Yeah, okay.

887
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,478
I'll hold off on answering you.

888
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,690
I'll postpone it
until your error messages are gone.

889
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,695
I'll wait until things
aren't complicated for you anymore.

890
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,531
-Seung-hyo, I--
-[Seung-hyo] Later.

891
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,659
You say it later too.

892
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,167
But let me ask you one thing.

893
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,421
Are you going to keep seeing that jerk?

894
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,425
No, I don't plan on it.

895
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,053
You mean it?

896
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,391
All right, then.

897
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,062
[mellow music playing]

898
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,690
I think we've done plenty
of walking and running now.

899
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,609
Let's go home.

900
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,319
Okay.

901
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,113
[clears throat]

902
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,831
[Seung-hyo] Go on ahead.

903
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,876
I'll definitely be behind you this time,

904
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,379
so you don't have to look back.

905
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,383
Don't be scared.

906
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,865
[music continues playing]

907
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,769
[Hye-suk inhales]

908
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,901
[groans softly]

909
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,707
Mmm.

910
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,508
[phone chimes]

911
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,719
MY BIRTHDAY
TODAY

912
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,220
[amusing music playing]

913
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,232
-Where are you going?
-It's an emergency.

914
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,942
There was a 17-car pileup this morning.

915
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,319
Is that so?

916
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,820
Then, when do you get home--

917
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,700
[door closes]

918
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:21,953
[knock on door]

919
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,121
Seung-hyo?

920
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,969
He must've left early.

921
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,076
I'll be there soon. I'm almost there.

922
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,465
What's wrong?

923
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,634
Why did you call me at dawn…

924
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,603
[Tae-hui] I wanted you
to be the first to see it.

925
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,855
It's our first sample.

926
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,358
You told me to come
for something big. This was it?

927
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,778
This is something big.
It came out beautifully.

928
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,322
It does look nice.

929
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,658
The body is round like an onggi.

930
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,077
The spout is like the eaves
of a traditional roof.

931
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,705
You wanted to preserve
the subtle curves of Korean design.

932
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,083
Isn't it nice?
Isn't it similar to your sketches?

933
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,168
I told you it was nice.

934
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,170
Are you longing for praise these days?

935
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,255
No.

936
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,467
I only long for praise from you.
I'm starved for it.

937
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,136
Let's keep things professional.

938
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,680
Do you usually get a lot
of broken jars like that?

939
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,016
[Tae-hui] Oh, those?

940
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,392
Of course.

941
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,312
-And it's not due to a lack of skill?
-[Tae-hui scoffs]

942
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,858
Look here, Mr. Architect.

943
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,195
Do things always go according to plan
on site just because you design them?

944
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,947
A wise answer to a dumb question.

945
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,825
No matter how carefully I shape the clay,

946
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,578
no one knows
how it'll come out from the fire.

947
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,874
Will it become a perfectly formed vessel?

948
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:34,461
Or will it crack and shatter to pieces?

949
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,755
You won't know
until it goes into the kiln.

950
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,256
[mellow music playing]

951
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,470
That sounded
like such a great quote. Right?

952
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:49,851
Not only am I beautiful
and make onggi well but I'm also eloquent.

953
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,688
You're so great at praising yourself
that you don't need my help.

954
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,398
I said I'm still starved for it.

955
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,486
Let's get something good to eat in Seoul.

956
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,113
I'll go and change.

957
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,299
-[Hye-suk] Hello.
-Hello, Ambassador.

958
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,802
Is the vice minister inside?
We're having lunch.

959
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:28,348
I'm sorry, but the minister
called for him today, so he's gone.

960
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,811
Goodness. He did tell me to let you know.

961
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:36,147
It's going to take a while,
so he asked for a rain check on lunch.

962
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,733
Is that so? Okay.

963
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,776
Have a nice day, ma'am.

964
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,111
-You too.
-Thank you.

965
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,960
[Hye-suk] What are you all doing tonight?

966
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,920
LAVENDER

967
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:04,759
[exclaims]

968
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,349
Please don't get hurt again.

969
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,685
[heart thumping]

970
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,769
What's going on?

971
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:19,733
Why is my heart thumping?
Are you kidding me?

972
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,860
Why is it beating faster?

973
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,571
Why did it skip a beat this time?

974
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,657
[Min-ho] Why are you
grumbling to yourself?

975
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,744
-I thought you were with someone.
-No, it's nothing.

976
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,330
[Jeong-u] Ms. Jung,
why is your face so red?

977
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,291
-It's red?
-[Jeong-u] Yeah.

978
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,668
-[Min-ho] Do you have a fever?
-No.

979
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,129
Are you sure your cut isn't infected?

980
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,089
No, it's not that.

981
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,633
I've applied an excessive amount
of ointment.

982
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,052
Okay, let's go.

983
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,637
Let's go.

984
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,514
[pop song playing in the background]

985
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,560
CONDITIONS IN THE FIELD FOR PARAMEDICS

986
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,853
ASSAULTS ON EMTS RISE

987
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,740
What are you looking at so seriously?

988
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:14,412
Yeong-in, did you know
almost 14% of firefighters suffer

989
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:18,666
from PTSD, depression,
and sleep disorders?

990
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,210
I'm sure they do.

991
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:25,340
Their job exposes them to a higher risk
of danger than the general public.

992
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,885
There are about 300 cases of assault
on paramedics each year.

993
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,721
Most offenders avoid punishment
because they were drunk.

994
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:37,352
Dan-ho, you've suddenly become
very interested in firefighters.

995
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,311
Oh.

996
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,688
There's a paramedic I know.

997
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,650
I've seen her be treated badly before.

998
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,569
I've also seen her risk her life
to rescue others too.

999
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,739
So you're going to write an article?

1000
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,407
What?

1001
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,368
Give it your best, okay?

1002
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:54,869
Good luck!

1003
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,872
We might cover a story,

1004
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:01,751
but we can't truly understand it
without firsthand experience.

1005
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:07,590
It really becomes your story
after you go through it yourself.

1006
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,594
I didn't know being a working mom
would be this hard.

1007
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,723
-I got a call from the school today.
-Yeong-in, I just thought of a new story!

1008
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,101
Can you excuse me… I mean, I have to go.

1009
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,272
[chuckles softly]

1010
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:26,067
I don't know what it is,
but the spark in his eyes is back.

1011
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,073
[Tae-hui] This place is really good.
The food's clean and the view's nice.

1012
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,784
Oh?

1013
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,705
[groans softly]

1014
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,416
-Hello.
-Hello.

1015
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,505
Seok-ryu, we came to eat too.
Fancy running into you here.

1016
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,299
I know.

1017
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,758
[Tae-hui] It's nice to see you.

1018
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,053
But since we each have company,

1019
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,598
I think it'll be uncomfortable
for us to sit here.

1020
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,224
Would you like a new table?

1021
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,435
-Yes.
-No, it's fine. We'll sit over there.

1022
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,188
-Let's just sit.
-Yeah, sure.

1023
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:18,912
[inhales]

1024
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,706
[mellow music playing]

1025
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,048
How is it? Is the food okay?

1026
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,758
Yeah, it's fine.

1027
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:35,845
I'm glad. I put some effort into this.
It's been a while since our last date.

1028
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,723
I've been curious about something.

1029
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,100
What is that?

1030
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,978
It's the japchae I made.

1031
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,481
I've been taking cooking classes.

1032
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:50,026
When it comes to cooking,
you're good enough to start an academy.

1033
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,362
I'm studying
for a Korean Food Craftsman certification.

1034
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,573
I want to do it professionally.

1035
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,784
Really? That's great.

1036
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,787
But are cooking classes enough?

1037
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,540
How about going to cooking school?

1038
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,002
The CIA is nice.
They have a campus in California.

1039
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,254
[Seok-ryu] I don't know.

1040
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,631
Tuition wouldn't be cheap.

1041
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,591
I haven't thought that far ahead yet.

1042
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,802
[Hyeon-jun] You can take your time.

1043
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:20,181
But can I try your japchae?

1044
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:24,686
[Seok-ryu] What? I don't think you can eat
food from the outside here.

1045
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,688
Excuse me?

1046
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,608

01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,719
Do you have lily of the valleys?

1217
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,555
I need lily of the valleys.

1218
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,185
[phone vibrating]

1219
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,065
[Hye-suk] Thank you, my son.

1220
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,947
[Seung-hyo] Oh? Ms. Yu!

1221
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,448
How did you know I was here?

1222
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,159
The other teachers told me.

1223
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,746
They said an unrealistically
handsome young man was at the pool.

1224
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,998
I thought it was a water spirit,
so I came.

1225
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,542
[both chuckle]

1226
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,419
Congratulations on winning
the design contest.

1227
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,881
Thank you.
I was surprised to get the call.

1228
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,884
What do you mean?
It went to the rightful winner.

1229
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,305
This place is special to you.

1230
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,267
It is.

1231
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,854
Oh, did you tell Seok-ryu too?

1232
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,857
-No, not yet.
-Hurry and tell her. She'll love it.

1233
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,650
She won't remember.

1234
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:15,776
Of course, she will.

1235
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,779
She called to ask if the results
were out a few days ago.

1236
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,158
[pleasant music playing]

1237
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,618
Hi, Ms. Yu. It's Seok-ryu.

1238
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,955
Are the results
for Choisseung's contest out yet?

1239
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,208
Not yet?

1240
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,461
Okay. I'm sorry to keep calling you.

1241
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,046
[groans softly]

1242
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,765
Are they out now?

1243
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:48,601
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION

1244
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,518
ANNOUNCEMENTS

1245
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:56,609
What's taking so long?

1246
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,152
Hello!

1247
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:02,531
Are the results of Hyereung High's
gym remodeling and design contest out yet?

1248
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,117
Yes, Hyereung High School.

1249
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,912
Not yet?

1250
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,706
Okay, thank you.

1251
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,795
[Jin-ae] I think she thought
I'd find out sooner.

1252
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,589
She's asked me several times.

1253
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,466
[exhales audibly]

1254
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,176
[exhilarating music playing]

1255
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:23,469
I'll get going now.

1256
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,804
Have some alone time with the pool.

1257
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,934
You have to create a new future.

1258
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,144
Make sure it's a nice goodbye
to the past.

1259
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:36,815
Seung-hyo, good luck!

1260
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,109
-[chuckles softly]
-[Jin-ae chuckles] Bye!

1261
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,494
[Tae-hui] No matter
how carefully I shape the clay,

1262
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,330
no one knows
how it'll come out from the fire.

1263
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:54,041
Will it become a perfectly formed vessel?

1264
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:58,003
Or will it crack and shatter to pieces?

1265
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,507
You won't know
until it goes in the kiln.

1266
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:04,426
Seung-hyo,

1267
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,971
you have to save yourself
from unrequited love.

1268
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,014
Even I can't rescue you.

1269
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,643
[Dan-ho] There once was an athlete
in the 200-meter event

1270
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:15,938
whose weakness was
being slow off the blocks.

1271
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:19,191
But despite this, he overcame it
through his tireless efforts.

1272
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,901
Even if it's a bit late,

1273
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:24,446
I'd tell him to muster up the courage,
just like the swimmer did.

1274
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:32,955
[phone vibrating]

1275
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:36,583
CHOISSEUNG

1276
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,501
[Seok-ryu] What?

1277
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,837
-Where are you right now?
-[Seok-ryu] Why do you care?

1278
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,921
Where are you?

1279
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:43,215
I'm at my dad's shop. I'm practicing.

1280
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,134
Wait right there. I'm on my way now.

1281
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,510
[pleasant music playing]

1282
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,196
[Hye-suk] What's this? [chuckles]
Why did you come here?

1283
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,574
[dramatic whoosh]

1284
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,959
[dramatic music playing]

1285
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,383
[breathing heavily]

1286
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,801
[mellow music playing]

1287
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:33,724
[Seung-hyo] Looking back, I had plenty
of chances to tell her how I felt.

1288
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,976
-[Geun-sik] Smile!
-Honey, me too!

1289
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,104
-[Geun-sik] Get out of there!
-Okay

1290
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,648
-Take it! Smile!
-Okay! One, two, three!

1291
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:42,858
[camera shutter clicks]

1292
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:45,069
-[Geun-sik] Okay, now!
-Get out for a second.

1293
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,696
[Seok-ryu] Let's take one together.
Take one of us!

1294
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,574
[Geun-sik] Okay! One, two, three.

1295
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,451
Seung-hyo, take one with Seok-ryu.

1296
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,161
-[Seok-ryu] Yeah.
-No, it's fine.

1297
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:56,330
-Just take it. Come here.
-[Geun-sik] Hurry up.

1298
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:57,498
Here we go!

1299
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,541
One, two, three!

1300
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,001
[camera shutter clicks]

1301
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,505
[Seung-hyo] The day we graduated
high school and finally became adults.

1302
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,507
God.

1303
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,716
I can't stand to look.

1304
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,095
-Where are you going dressed like that?
-A date.

1305
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,764
It's a group date with PE majors.

1306
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,599
I hear they're really handsome.

1307
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,027
[Seung-hyo] The day
the ice cream was sweet

1308
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,407
and cherry blossoms flew in spring
when we were immature 20-year-olds.

1309
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,369
Where are you going?

1310
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,246
The US. I found it.

1311
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,707
I got into UC Berkkeley.

1312
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,585
On a full ride too! Isn't it awesome?

1313
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:47,005
Remember my friend, So-yun?

1314
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:51,260
She applied,
so I just put in an application too.

1315
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,428
But look!

1316
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,720
I got in.

1317
01:13:56,432 --> 01:14:00,102
They say you follow friends to Gangnam,
but I'm following mine to the US.

1318
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:04,398
Honestly, I thought
my mom would be against it.

1319
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,316
But she told me to go.

1320
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:07,818
[coughing]

1321
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:11,155
[Seok-ryu] But I'm
actually a little excited.

1322
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,533
This will be my first time overseas.

1323
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,952
And it'll be my first time on a plane.

1324
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:20,414
I've never even been to Jeju.
But my first trip is to the US!

1325
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,499
Isn't this amazing?

1326
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:28,797
That late night at the tent bar
when she said she was going to the US.

1327
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,550
And…

1328
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:33,719
-tonight.
-[doorbell chiming]

1329
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,013
-Seok-ryu.
-Hey, right now…

1330
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,890
Hear me out first. [panting]

1331
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,935
I won't delay it any longer.

1332
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,354
I said I'd wait until later,

1333
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,484
but that was an excuse I made
to pretend to be considerate.

1334
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,653
I lied to myself.

1335
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,200
It was out of fear. I was scared.

1336
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:58,952
So…

1337
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,664
The thing is…

1338
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,877
I'm going to say it this time.

1339
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,423
When I said you were driving me crazy…

1340
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,636
When I said I was losing my mind
because of you…

1341
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,222
What I meant by that was…

1342
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,019
I…

1343
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,401
like you.

1344
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,029
[mellow music playing]

1345
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:47,167
LOVE IS ALL ABOUT TIMING

1346
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:52,589
ALREADY LOVE

1347
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,591
[pop song playing]

1348
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:29,626
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1349
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,128
How do I face her tomorrow?

1350
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,838
She's not asleep. No.

1351
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:36,508
If you've drawn the knife,
you should cut something.

1352
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,052
-Why aren't you in a T-shirt today?
-I washed them.

1353
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,512
[Mi-suk] You wore perfume too?

1354
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:43,599
Does that mean your answer
has no expiration date?

1355
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:45,851
Seung-hyo might not know,

1356
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,145
but I think I liked him first.

1357
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:50,981
[Dan-ho] I want to clear up
any misunderstandings about me.

1358
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:53,442
Not just anyone can survive
the social affairs department.

1359
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,068
I've changed my strategy.

1360
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,613
The "lasts" didn't work,
so I'm going back to the beginning.

1361
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,449
[Seung-hyo] The reason why I can't stay
as Seok-ryu's friend

1362
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:01,825
isn't because she's a woman.

1363
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,577
It's because she's Seok-ryu.

1364
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:10,125
