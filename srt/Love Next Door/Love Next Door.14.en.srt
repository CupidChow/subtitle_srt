[Seung-hyo] Did the materials
arrive today?

4
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,191
Yes, the insulation materials came in.

5
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,109
We're installing them now.

6
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,904

-Sure.

near-death experiences

11
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,550
often have similar experiences.

Hi, what's your name?

00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,480
It happened to me too.

You did great!

18
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,442
Great job!

19
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,236
You can have this.

20
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,823
[Seok-ryu] Lock your door again,

21
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,825

[Seung-hyo] I…

27
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,485
like you.

28
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,536
[Seok-ryu] You're being too hasty.
You could get really hurt.

Grab my hand, and let's go slow.

[Seok-ryu] A stone finish?

That's like a solid piece of rock!

00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,594
A second later,
and you would've been really hurt.

42
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,224
Now that I think about it,
your surroundings aren't safe at all.

00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,559
Rebar, brick, glass, and nails.

44
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,061
It's too dangerous.

I'm sure you do. You love it,
so how could you quit?

00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,909
Still, be careful. Wear your helmet
and put on some armor or something.

49
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,037
Jeez, it's making me so worried.

50
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,043
Why aren't you coming? What are you doing?

00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,129
-You got third place.
-What?

52
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,007
You won an award

54
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,678
I never entered a contest,
so how could I win?

78
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,347

81

It was held
by the Korean Vegetable Association.

82
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,404
It's a small contest.

83
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,406
Anyone could enter online.

84
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,868
I just thought your food was so good,
so I thought it wouldn't hurt.

85
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,119
This is so annoying.

86
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,622
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

87
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,458
I'm so happy that I'm annoyed.

88
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,086
-What?
-[scoffs]

89
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,464
I've come in first
for so many things before.

90
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,426
But I've never been so happy
to place third in this random contest.

91
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,136
Really? Seriously?

92
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,387
Yeah.

93
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,475
I want to cook so badly,

94
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,812
but no one will take me,
and I have no place to go.

95
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,524
I said I wouldn't care
about what others thought,

96
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,068
but it was hard to do.

97
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,906
I thought, "Why am I like this?"
And I was feeling hopeless.

98
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,828
But this feels like the heavens
have given me permission to keep trying.

99
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,122
That's a relief.

100
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,959
I thought you'd check to see
who came in first and second first.

101
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,378
Who was first? Let me see.
What's their dish?

102
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,590
"Lee Su-a. Spring root vegetables
and five-grain nutritious rice."

103
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,719
It's not that innovative or anything.

104
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,637
SWEET LOVE

105
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,889
It's kind of traditional.
Let me see again.

106
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,183
[Seung-hyo] You sure you're happy
about coming in third?

107
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,564
[sighs softly] You scared me.

108
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,400
Why are you standing here like this?

109
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,944
Mr. Kang is off-limits.

110
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,576
Hey, if you're going to date him,
do it after I die, okay?

111
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,036
And just so you know,
I'm going to live until I'm 100.

112
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,539
Then, we'll be over 70.

113
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,082
"We"?

114
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,460
Did you just say "we"?

115
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,586
[Mo-eum] Mom!

116
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,839
If you want to live a long life,
stop eating stuff like this.

117
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,967
This is all because of you!

118
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,721
I can't take it out on you,
so I'm eating my stress instead!

119
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,598
-Yes, all right. Okay.
-[Jae-suk] Hey.

120
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,141
-Hey!
-[Mo-eum] Yes, I understand.

-Hey, can't you hear what I'm saying?
-[exclaims]

Hey! You can never date him!
I don't care if the sky falls!

00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,025
Don't you even dream about it!

[dog barks distantly]

125
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,031
Even with a smooth path in life,
it's full of hardship.

126
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,202
Why would you bear kindling
and walk straight into the fire?

00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,163
[door opens]

128
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,833

[exclaims]

130
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,506
Mrs. Do, I ate the snacks
you gave me yesterday

131
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,132
and brushed my teeth really well.

[exclaims]

133
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,093
-Really?
-[Yeon-du] Yes.

134
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,804
And I smiled a lot.

135
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,891
I smiled at my friends and my teacher.

136
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,268
Oh, I smiled at my dad too.

00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,561
[pleasant music playing]

138
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,523
I'm sure the bugs
making me sad are gone now.

139
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,944
You'll be late for school.
You should go, Yeon-du.

140
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,657
[door slams]

141
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,992
[babysitter] Yeon-du, let's go.

142
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,495
Let's go.

143
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,664
And we're off.

144
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,583
[speaking indistinctly]

00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,474
[exhales]

146
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,644
[Dan-ho] I know she's too good for me.

147
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,396
I know you'll worry too.

148
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,648
So I tried all I could
to cut ties with her…

149
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,442
but I don't think I can anymore.

150
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,278
[slow music playing]

151
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,862
Dan-ho.

152
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,743
Hey, go inside.

153
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,329
[Mo-eum] Why?
Why are you locking me in? Wait!

154
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,415
-Dan-ho!
-Please go inside.

155
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,458
I think that'll be best for tonight.

156
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,087
You said you'd take me.

157
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
You said you couldn't quit me.

158
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,301
Okay?

159
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,635
-[Jae-suk] Go inside.
-Wait.

160
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,762
You said it yourself!

161
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,390
[Jae-suk] Go inside! Now!

162
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:02,977
[door closes]

163
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,274
I'm sorry for startling you.

164
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,568
I'll explain how everything happened--

165
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,320
I don't want to know.

166
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
-Sorry?
-I don't need to know.

167
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,200
And it won't change anything
if I did know.

168
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,913
Mo-eum has always been like this
since she was a kid.

169
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,583
She can't ignore anything
that looks pitiful.

170
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,752
[slow music continues playing]

171
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,212
If she was on her way to buy toys

172
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,381
and saw an old lady
in the street selling vegetables,

173
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,760
she'd buy all her vegetables instead.

174
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,805
Community Chest. Christmas seals.

175
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,018
She'd spend all her money
on those things for her class.

176
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,854
That's probably the reason.

177
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,981
She loves Yeon-du.

178
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,984
And she pitied seeing you
raise a child alone.

179
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:58,115
So shouldn't you have tried
to keep your composure?

180
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,827
Just because she acts that way
doesn't mean you should go along with her.

181
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,204
You have a child.

182
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,166
-Mother--
-Don't call me that!

183
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,921
I'll pretend I didn't hear
what you just said.

184
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,218
I hope we don't have any more
embarrassing moments as neighbors.

185
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,395
[car starts]

186
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,193
It's all set. Go!

187
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,739
It's hot, isn't it?

188
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,658
[grunts]

189
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,160
Why did you have to come in the summer?

190
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,745
I know, right?

191
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,665
[man] So, how's the work?

192
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,252
I guess it's tough enough yet.

193
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,505
I thought it'd take my mind off it.

194
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,506
[man] What?

195
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,968
-Nothing. Another truck is coming in.
-[horn honks]

196
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,845
[man] They don't give us
a chance to breathe.

197
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,847
Hey, go to the back!

198
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,476
Here, take it. Your award.

199
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,312
Gosh, this is heavier
than I thought it'd be.

200
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,440
That's what the weight of an award is.

201
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,234
Is your hand okay though?
How long do you need the cast for?

202
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,904
I can take it off now. I just tweaked it.

203
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,824
That's a relief.
This hand has so many things to do.

204
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,368
What are you doing?

205
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,414
Maybe it was winning the award,
but we're getting tons of requests.

206
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,874
We're going to get super busy.

207
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,460
That's not good.
I wanted to decrease my workload.

208
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,629
What are you saying?
We need to strike while the iron's hot.

209
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,631
We're going to soar to the top.

210
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,385
-I'm going to get married.
-What? What did you say?

211
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm going to get married.

212
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,763
Wait. With who?

213
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,974
-With Seok-ryu.
-Seok-ryu?

214
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,519
-Hey, your girlfriend was Seok-ryu?
-Act like you don't know.

215
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,562
[gasps]

216
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,772
Holy cow!
But how can this happen?

217
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,608
You're childhood friends.

218
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,151
You're like family.

219
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,612
-You can't do that.
-Myeong-u, be quiet and sit.

220
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,238
-I mean…
-Sit down.

221
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,407
Holy cow!

222
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,658
-So…
-Yeah?

223
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,869
-The thing is…
-Yeah?

224
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,205
Like this. Ta-da.

225
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,706
[sighs softly]

226
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,749
[gasps]

227
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,127
I have to propose.

228
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,630
Do you know any good ways to do it?
You have experience.

229
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,841
Seung-hyo, I'm a professional.

230
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,427
My goodness.
Do you want me to teach you?

231
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,221
-First off…
-Yeah?

232
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,890
Go to a basketball… No.
A baseball stadium.

233
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,935
Then, between innings,
you're bound to appear on the big screen.

234
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,230
That's when you get down on one knee
and take out the ring you prepared.

235
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,731
Then, she'll start to weep!

236
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,608
She doesn't like crowded places.

237
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,569
And taking her there
would be a difficult task in itself.

238
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,113
-[snaps fingers]
-There's another way.

239
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,407
A performance. Take her to see a play.

240
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,994
Once the lights go down
and the curtain rises, you tell her.

241
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,664
"Will you marry me?
No, let's get married."

242
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,832
[exclaims] Then, she'll start to weep!

243
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,334
[quirky music playing]

244
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,294
Do women really like that stuff?

245
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,547
It's no joke.

246
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,051
See? Even Na-yun's applauding the idea.

247
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,178
Millennials and Gen Z approve.

248
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,179
I see.

249
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,847
-Do it.
-See?

250
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,811
If you want to be rejected
on the spot, do it.

251
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,109
Your marriage proposal
is only important to you.

252
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,696
Unless you're paying for their tickets,
don't ruin the show for others.

253
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,407
I mean, it wasn't my idea.

254
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
Just remember these three things.

255
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,706
No audience, a decent ring,
and a heartfelt letter.

256
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,126
But wouldn't that be too ordinary?

257
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,420
What's the point
if only that day is special?

258
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,298
Just make every day
you spend with her special.

259
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,260
You're right.

260
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:47,970
Thanks.

261
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,722
I'm more grateful.

262
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,811
I used to draw but saw a house you built
and fell in love with it.

263
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,938
It's what brought me here.

264
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,523
[pleasant music playing]

265
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,817
It was admiration at first.
And then, it became love.

266
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,404
Everything got mixed together,
so I became confused.

267
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,949
But I've decided on admiration again.

268
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,243
Na-yun.

269
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,494
Be happy.

270
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,663
That's enough for me.

271
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,375
I will.

272
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,502
I promise.

273
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,795
HEALTHY RECIPE CONTEST WINNERS

[Seok-ryu] "Third place.
Broc-cauliflower and chicken risotto."

275
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,054
"Bae Seok-ryu."

276
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:31,972
[door opens]

277
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,141
I told Dan-ho that I liked him.

278
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,392
What?

279
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,645
-But he rejected me.
-What?

280
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,272
Still, I held onto him.

281
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,273
Hey!

282
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,401
But in the end,
he admitted that he liked me too.

283
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,363
Oh, okay.

284
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
Then, the mutual agreement was settled.

285
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,574
It's a happy ending.

286
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,285
Wow, what a sudden whirlwind.

287
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,538
Why does your story have
so many twists and turns?

288
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,375
But he told me he liked me

289
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,418
right in front of my mom.

290
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,589
[Seok-ryu] My friend, I apologize.

291
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,010
I was so caught up in my relationship
that I neglected you.

292
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:14,181
Yeah. You're so precious to me,
but I had no idea so much happened to you.

293
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,309
Seriously, I was too neglectful.

294
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,894
I'm really sorry. I regret it.

295
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,813
I'm the one who didn't tell you.

296
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,356
Get off your knees.

297
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,112
You must've had it so hard.

298
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,031
[groans]

299
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,122
My feelings were like
sour, bitter, and salty flavors.

300
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:42,084
Sometimes, it was so spicy
I thought I had heartburn.

301
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,420
Is this what love is like?

302
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,797
It's complicated.

303
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,633
Just like the durian candy you like,

304
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,301
it stinks, but it tastes good too.

305
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,971
This is why I've avoided love until now.

306
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,473
But despite that, you fell in love.

307
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,434
[sighs] I'm screwed.

308
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,687
You like Mudflat Man that much?

309
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,188
Well…

310
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,318
I don't know if I like him
for being Mudflat Man or for being Dan-ho.

311
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,115
Which came first? The chicken or the egg?
I don't know anymore.

312
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,118
What about you?

313
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,703
You like Seung-hyo that much?

314
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,621
Yeah, I do.

315
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,832
-[laughs] She likes him!
-[Seok-ryu chuckles]

316
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,003
Hey! What am I going to do about my mom?

317
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,089
I'm burdened with the same issue.

318
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,259
My mom said she won't allow it
unless it's over her dead body.

319
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,471
My mom would probably
make me the dead body.

320
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,681
[both sigh]

321
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,809
[Mo-eum groans softly]
This is so annoying.

322
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,567
SEOK-RYU

323
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,903
-[keys tapping]
-[Seung-hyo] What are you up to?

324
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,366
Hello, ma'am.

325
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,536
Oh, you're the one who helped
fix my wagon last time.

326
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,662
Yes, you remembered.

327
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,832
I usually forget everything at this age,

328
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,628
but I do remember those who helped me
since I'm so grateful to them.

329
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,879
It was nothing.

330
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,675
It's the same
with that reporter over there.

331
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,638
Gosh.

332
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,725
[playful music playing]

333
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,312
[Seung-hyo] Right.

334
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,271
Goodness.

335
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,153
[chuckles softly]

336
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,699
Wow, that was like
a beer commercial. [chuckles]

337
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,118
-[Dan-ho chuckles]
-Want another?

338
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,912
No, one can is my limit.

339
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,330
I see.

340
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,623
[Dan-ho sighs]

341
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,250
It seems I've wasted my life though.

342
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,044
I had no idea beer tasted this good.

343
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,839
Alcohol always tastes the best
after a day of hard labor.

344
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,550
The best makgeolli I've ever had…

345
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,053
was after I volunteered
to build homes for those in need.

346
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,389
-You volunteered to build homes?
-[Seung-hyo] Yes.

347
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,018
I've been volunteering since college,
and now, I go whenever I have time.

348
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,354
Do you know if that organization

349
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,439
also does repairs
for houses in shanty towns?

350
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,024
Shanty towns?

351
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,944
You know the alley of shacks
on the upper side of Hyereung-dong?

352
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,447
That's where the elderly woman
from earlier lives.

353
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,790
I went there myself, and the conditions
were far worse than I thought.

354
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,753
Are you free next week?

355
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,591
It's a bit tight,
but I'll try to prepare as much as I can.

356
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,051
You're going to do it yourself?

357
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,511
Yes.

358
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,805
No, this wasn't my intention.

359
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,765
I wanted to know
if there was a way to apply.

360
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,225
I know.

361
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,269
But still, it'd be quicker if I did it.

362
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,187
[exhales]

363
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,940
Even expressing my gratitude
makes me feel bad now.

364
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,943
Come on. What are friends for? [chuckles]

365
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,490
Right. [inhales]
We did agree to be friends,

366
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,951
even though we're still being formal.

367
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
We're respecting each other.

368
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,792
But you're Mo-eum's friend too.

369
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,835
Yes.

370
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,837
Mo-eum and I like each other.

371
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:14,922
[amusing music playing]

372
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,256
[coughs]

373
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,174
What?

374
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,468
But her mother doesn't approve of us.

375
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,511
I see.

376
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,055
I…

377
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,808
don't know what to do.

378
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,185
I see.

379
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,144
[inhales]

380
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,479
[phone vibrating]

SEOK-RYU

382
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,777
[Seok-ryu] I'm with Mo-eum.

383
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,488
Wait.

384
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,701
-Hey, that's… Did you drink it all?
-[Seung-hyo exclaims]

385
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,204
You said one can was your limit.

386
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,041
-If you need more, I can buy you--
-No, this is enough.

387
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,294
[quirky music playing]

388
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,463
[groans softly]

389
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,675
I'm so upset I could die.
I don't want to go for a walk.

390
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,094
Nothing relieves stress
like going for a walk.

391
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,805
Let's sit here for a second.

392
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,889
Let's rest a bit.

393
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,641
[Mo-eum] What's wrong with you?

394
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,309
[Seok-ryu] Let's sit here.

395
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,187
-[Mo-eum] Goodness.
-Hey, try to look pretty.

396
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,357
I'm not drunk, but why do you
keep telling me to sober up?

397
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,152
That can of beer you drank
was over five percent alcohol.

398
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,780
We can walk and get closer too.

399
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,449
-Us?
-No. What?

400
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,910
-What?
-Yes. [chuckles nervously]

401
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,079
-What's with you?
-Goodness!

402
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,374
I can't believe
we ran into each other like this!

403
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,750
What a coincidence!

404
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,294
You're right.

405
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,547
This neighborhood's so small, isn't it?

406
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,798
Yeah, seriously.

407
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,012
-Is that the best you can act?
-I'm not an entertainment reporter.

408
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,264
But that was terrible.

409
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,769
See? I told you it wouldn't work.

410
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,188
Whatever. I've set the table for you.

411
00:21:55,689 --> 00:22:00,610
So whether you can dance
or get married, you figure it out.

412
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,862
[Mo-eum] What?

413
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,821
[Seok-ryu] Let's go.

414
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,031
Hey.

415
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,574
Good luck.

416
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,075
Let's go. Come on.

417
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,036
What in the…

418
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,455
What on earth?

419
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,167
Unbelievable.

420
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,463
-What are you doing?
-What?

421
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,758
Oh. Right.

422
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,936
-Have you been drinking?
-A little…

423
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,899
However, I'm very sober.

424
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,817
Me too.

425
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,361
I know I was really drunk that night,

426
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,363
but I remember everything.

427
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,533
So why didn't you call me?

428
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,619
Because of my mom?

429
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,122
I understand how she feels.

430
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,375
I would've said no too.

431
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,461
I know. Yeah.

432
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,507
I mean, who asks someone
to be their girlfriend,

433
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,050
which was…

434
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,303
practically a proposal,

435
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,722
by asking their mother?

436
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,891
I'm sorry.

437
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,228
I thought a head-on approach
would've been better than lying.

438
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,521
That's not what I meant.

439
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,026
You never told me you liked me.

440
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,153
You even rejected me
when I said I liked you.

441
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,156
But why did you say
those important words to my mom?

442
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,119
To make matters worse,
I'm the one who kissed you first--

443
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,995
[pleasant music playing]

444
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,721
Why did you stop?

445
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,848
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,474
After thinking about it,

447
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,226
I sweated a lot today.

448
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,520
Why does that matter now?

449
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,939
It didn't seem polite.

450
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,233
What you're doing right now isn't polite!

451
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,945
I like you.

452
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,074
After my family had that accident,

453
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,369
every day felt
like an emergency in my life.

454
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,957
But then, I heard a siren
and a paramedic appeared.

455
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,252
She saved people.

456
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,671
And she helped Yeon-du.

457
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,090
That righteous woman saved me,

458
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,259
and I humbly admit I like her.

459
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,062
After hearing what you just said,

460
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,732
you really are a professional with words.

461
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,656
With the money I earn from my articles,

462
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,118
I'll buy you lots of good food.

463
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:06,463
You think you can handle it?
I… have a pretty big appetite.

464
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,346
I better write more articles then.

What the hell?

471
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,585
Did this place sprinkle gold
on their tteokbokki or something?

472
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,339
Why is the line so long
this early in the morning?

473
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,590

-Mi-suk?
-My gosh! Honey!

To buy designer bags, they say
you need to line up early outside stores.

485
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,701
They're doing it for tteokbokki now too.

486
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:21,121
Exactly, so why did you buy this?
We have more than enough here.

487
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,291
-Bring over some of that tteokbokki.
-Why? What for?

-[scoffs] Jeez.

00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:42,976
What's wrong?

493
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,314
What is it? What?

494
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,280
Mmm.

495
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,990
It's good.

It's not good.

498
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,415
It's nothing compared to yours!
The flavor's too strong.

499
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,834
There's no subtle savoriness to it.

500
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,378
What's the point when business is bad?

501
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,342
-Most days are a swing and a miss.
-Gosh, people these days…

They only want strong flavors.

You'll be like this
every time we go to eat good food.

523

Probably. I almost forgot.

524

Mr. Yoon gave me
his list of good restaurants.

525

If only my stomach was okay,

526
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,671
I'd visit different restaurants
and film mukbang videos.

I was just kidding. Look at me eating now.

529
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,224
I mean it.

530
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,436
What about doing what you did before?

531
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,982
You made cooking videos in the US.
You can start again here.

532
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,983
No way.

533
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:59,696
People there didn't know Korean food well,
so I was just acting like an expert.

534
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,989
It'd be different here.

535
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,033
No, it wouldn't.
You'd do even better now.

536
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,328
There are already
so many talented people.

537
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:12,834
Also, NerTube channels these days
are so professional and high-quality.

538
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,377
How could I do something like that?

539
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,962
I can just film for you.

540
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,882
-You?
-Yeah.

541
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,635
[Seok-ryu] Hey.

542
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,637
-Is it better with it off?
-[Seok-ryu] Yeah.

543
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,972
-It's too bright.
-Okay.

544
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,101
Okay, that should do it.
I just have to press record.

545
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,353
What? Already? Wait!

546
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,147
What do I do first?

547
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,900
I've already prepared the ingredients.

548
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,902
Should I boil water first?

549
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,903
Wait.

550
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,239
No, I have to blanch the broccoli
and make the chicken broth.

551
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:48,286
Chef Bae, why are you so nervous?
This isn't your first time.

552
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,413
I don't know. I'm so nervous.

[playful music playing]

554
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,917
Do I look weird on the camera?

555

You're beautiful.

557
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,928
My confidence and self-esteem
are at an all-time low these days.

558
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:05,887
I'm so blue.

559
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,890
Then, let's make it red.

560
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,520
Hey, the camera's on.

561
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,357
Your food really is delicious.

562
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,567
I know that better than anyone.

563
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,530
I'm ready.

564
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,865
-Then, we'll start.
-Okay.

[in English] Ready, action.

568
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,839
[in Korean] The dish we'll make today

569
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,591
is called Broc-Cauliflower
and Chicken Risotto.

570
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,761
Just from its name, it seems
like a healthy combination, right?

571
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,055
And honestly,
it doesn't sound too good either.

572
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,598
But today,

573
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,686
I'll try to break the perception
that healthy food doesn't taste good.

574
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,735
Miss, is something wrong?

575
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,240
I was rejected.

576
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,450
How could you be so honest about that?

577
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,160
There's no reason to hide it.

578
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,831
Still, wouldn't most people
be embarrassed to say that?

579
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,499
No.

580
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,003
I was proud to have a crush on him…

and my heart at the same time right now.

Drink as you work out.

583
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,932
You'll lose muscle mass
if you're dehydrated.

584
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,309
No, thanks.

585
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,519
I'll drink it after.

586
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,980
[Dong-jin] You look like you need it now.

587
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,859
You look like you're about to cry.

588
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,155
But still…

589
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,075
-Don't fall for me.
-What?

590
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,286
A gym member and a trainer can't date.

[amusing music playing]

592
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,458
I've decided to dedicate myself
to my work.

[Jae-suk clears throat]

What's going on?
You said these would raise my blood sugar.

599
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,703
It's keto bread made with almond flour.

600
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,956
I had to go really far to buy that.

[scoffs]

602
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,836
I guess you did want to say sorry to me.

603
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,422
Yeah, I'm sorry.

604
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,092
Also,

605
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,303
I'm going to continue to be sorry.

606
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,430
Because I'm going to be with Dan-ho.

607
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,142
You little brat,
you just made me lose my appetite!

608
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,520
I told you that you can't!

609
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,397
Mom, Yeon-du…

610
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,649
isn't Dan-ho's daughter.

611
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,442
She's his niece.

-What?
-His parents and Yeon-du's parents…

613
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,741
They died in an accident.

614
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,077
That's why Dan-ho's taking care of her.

[clears throat]

616

So what?

00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,792
Does that change anything?

618
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,545
If she was his niece and not his daughter,

619
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,965
did you think I'd allow you to see him?

620
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,342
I didn't tell you to get your permission.

621
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:36,014
After going through so much,
they were the only two left.

622
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,685
They're each other's only family,
and I'm telling you this,

623
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,687
because…

624

I want to protect them.

Do you even know what that means?

626

You have to become her mom!

There are countless times when you want
to quit raising even your own kids.

When you started work while raising us,

641

you never once forced me to study.

642

You were never obsessed with grades.

[groans]

882
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,513
[amusing music playing]

883
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,350
[crow caws]

884
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,896
[siren blaring]

885
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,071
Gosh, the rear's been wrecked.

886
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,116
What? Your rear?
Your rear hurts?

887
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,368
No, not me. Your car.

888
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,954
It's fine as long as you're not hurt.

889
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,039
Still, let's go
to the hospital just in case.

890
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,708
It's all right. I'm fine.

891
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,293
Let's go eat. I'm hungry.

892
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,336
Are you really okay?

893
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,838
Yeah, really.

894
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,464
Let's go eat.

895
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,431
So this is the building
you won an award for?

896
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,849
[exclaims]

897
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,310
You've grown a lot, Choisseung.

898
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,687
You used to cower behind me as a kid.

899
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,147
You've grown so well.

900
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,734
You're the first woman
who's ever treated me like this.

901
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,153
-[Seok-ryu chuckles]
-Of course, you'll be the last too.

902
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,070
Hey.

903
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,283
But are you sure this place is famous?

904
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,493
There aren't any customers here.

905
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,330
-It's only us.
-[Seung-hyo] Right.

906
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,374
[clears throat] It is a famous place.

907
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,085
There's a reason
why there are no customers.

908
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,671
-It's because today--
-Yeah! [chuckles nervously]

909
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,091
Don't you know how famous our chef is?

910
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,093
You don't know anything.

911
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,303
I apologize.

912
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,596
It's fine.

913
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,890
I had a sensitive matter
to deal with today.

914
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,600
Allow me.

915
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,060
[classical music playing]

916
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,488
Today's first dish is bruschetta.

917
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,282
-With top-quality extra virgin oil…
-[phone vibrating]

918
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,037
-It's fine. Please, take it.
-Right.

919
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,996
Excuse me.

920
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,541
Hey.

921
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,668
What? Right now?

922
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,337
Wow!

923
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,422
Yeah, okay.

924
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,884
Great job. You did great.

925
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,179
-[Seung-hyo] Is everything okay?
-[chuckles excitedly]

926
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,432
-My baby was just born!
-[Seok-ryu gasps]

927
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,559
My wife has been in labor since dawn.

928
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,477
[Seung-hyo] Wow.

929
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,189
Then, why didn't you tell me before?

930
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,441
I mean, I wanted to.

931
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,611
But everything had been prepared,
and it's such an important day.

932
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,697
-Gosh, but still…
-[Seok-ryu] Wait.

933
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,824
Then, shouldn't you be going now?

934
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,326
Quick. You should go to your wife.

935
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,537
Yes, go ahead. Don't worry about us.

936
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,622
Then, I'm really sorry,

937
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,541
-but I'll get going now.
-[both chuckle]

938
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,960
-I almost forgot!
-[Seung-hyo] Yes?

939
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,211
-Mr. Choi!
-[Seung-hyo] Yes?

940
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,590
[whispering] The cake's in the kitchen.

941
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,968
-Good luck.
-[in normal voice] Good luck.

942
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,387
-You too!
-[Seok-ryu] Good luck!

943
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,472
[chef] Holy cow!

944
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:19,850
Wow.

945
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,937
Well, I guess we're done eating.

946
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,107
-Should we go home after this?
-Yeah.

947
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,817
I mean, no. We can't.

948
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,695
The chef's cake…

949
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,322
He made us a dessert.

950
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,658
How about we eat that before we go?

951
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,368
-[Seok-ryu] Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

952
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,662
[Seok-ryu] Thank you for the meal.

953
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,708
[chuckles softly]

954
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,918
It's okay. I still have a chance.

955
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,256
It's fine as long as things end well.

956
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:53,967
For me,

957
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:59,181
the results are more important
than the process, right?

958
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,558
I can do this.

959
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,561
I can do this, right?

960
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,564
Let's go.

961
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,195
[pleasant music playing]

962
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,538
[music distorts]

963
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,539
[exclaiming]

964
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,170
[Seung-hyo groans]

965
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,422
[groans]

966
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,301
[Seok-ryu] Are you okay?

967
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,806
You should've been more careful.

968
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,685
I bet that hurt.

969
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,149
[door opens]

970
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:52,901
Hey.

971
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,820
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

972
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,198
Goodness. I made acorn jelly.
Take some with you.

973
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,159
-Goodness. I'd be so grateful.
-[chuckles softly]

974
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,746
Hey, I heard our husbands

975
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,540
are at the snack shop together.

976
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,835
Gosh, despite being neighbors,
they used to be so distant.

977
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,170
They're suddenly great friends. How funny.

978
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,213
I know.

979
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,843
Mi-suk, I have something
to talk to you about.

980
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,553
Go ahead.

981
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,180
You know the cruise trip
we agreed to go on? Let's go together.

982
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,598
[chuckles softly]

983
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,226
I don't know. I'll think about it.

984
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,937
If this is about money, I'll pay for you.

985
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,483
What?

986
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,445
Why would you pay for me?

987
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,575
Well, because I want to go with you.

988
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,493
Also, it's not that much money.

989
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,870
Friends can do that.

990
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:45,787
No, they can't.

991
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,873
It's not like letting friends
borrow money.

992
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,666
Who would ever pay that much?

993
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,335
[exhales] I've never heard of that before.

994
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,129
We're not just ordinary friends.

995
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,839
We've been friends for 40 years.

996
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,427
And most importantly,
I'm so grateful for you raising Seung-hyo.

997
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,178
You paid me for that.

998
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,181
What?

999
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,142
You paid me a salary.

1000
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,978
I was paid for it,
so why be grateful?

1001
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:10,896
[scoffs]

1002
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,608
Hey, that's still something
to be grateful for.

1003
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,568
I can tell by how much he likes you.

1004
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,320
You looked after him with such care.

1005
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,034
That's true.

1006
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,493
Yeah, I did.

1007
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,664
When Seung-hyo
and Seok-ryu both got sick,

1008
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,209
I took care of him first
and took him to the hospital first too.

1009
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,587
Why? Because I was paid to.

1010
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,298
I didn't want to be told I raised
my friend's precious son poorly.

1011
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,257
[chuckles awkwardly]

1012
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,303
Hey. When did I ever say that to you?

1013
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,471
You didn't.

1014
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,848
But I could silently sense it.

1015
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,100
Whenever you paid me extra for the month,

1016
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,812
whenever you gave me gift certificates
for the holidays to thank me,

1017
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,856
do you know how miserable I felt?

1018
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,943
Is that how you've thought of me
all this time?

1019
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:01,863
-Did you even think of me as a friend?
-You probably thought of me as a maid.

1020
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,075
If that weren't the case,
why would you pay for my trip?

1021
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,368
Who are you to pity me?

1022
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,703
It's not pity. It's friendship.

1023
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,665
And if that's how you felt,
it's due to your inferiority complex.

1024
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,000
-Inferiority complex?
-[Hye-suk] Yeah.

1025
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,253
Are you done talking?

1026
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,214
No, I can go on. Why?

1027
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,133
No one thinks that way of you,
but you put yourself down.

1028
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,886
That's an inferiority complex.
It's a complex!

1029
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,096
Hey!

1030
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,015
-Hey!
-You bitch!

1031
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,517
You were always so arrogant!

1032
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,019
-Hey!
-You constantly tried to teach people!

1033
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,646
-Hey!
-You always looked down on them!

1034
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,398
-With eyes like this!
-Let go!

1035
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:40,235
How did you pretend to be my friend
while secretly hating me all this time?

1036
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,403
Hey! Let go!

1037
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,946
-[Mi-suk] Hey!
-You were two-faced.

1038
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,864
But I believed you were my friend.

1039
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,825
Hey! I'm the crazy one!

1040
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,326
-Hey!
-Hey!

1041
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,453
-Hey!
-[Hye-suk] Hey! Let go!

1042
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,579
Honey!

1043
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,165
-Honey, what's wrong?
-Honey, what are you doing?

1044
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,125
-Let go!
-Honey!

1045
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,835
-What's going on?
-What are you doing?

1046
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,295
-What's wrong with you?
-Honey! Hey!

1047
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,505
[speaks in French]

1048
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,341
It's over between us now!

1049
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,801
I won't hang out with you anymore!

1050
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,179
That's what I wanted to say!
Don't act like you know me anymore!

1051
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,723
That's what I wanted!

1052
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,599
You leave the Lavender group text.

1053
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,185
Yeah, right!
Jae-suk and In-suk are closer to me!

1054
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,312
[Hye-suk] No, they like me better!

1055
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,439
-Honey!
-Hey!

1056
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,108
Tonight, let's go home.
We'll talk about this later.

1057
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,317
[Hye-suk] There's no later!

1058
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,446
Hey, it's over between us now!

1059
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,865
-Okay, all right!
-Hey, you!

1060
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,116
Give my food containers back!

1061
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,034
Get out!

1062
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,326
-I'm so sorry!
-My containers!

1063
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,995
-Don't you worry about them!
-Sorry!

1064
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,371
-[Geun-sik] Go!
-Hey, you!

1065
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,331
-Quick!
-Who acts like that?

1066
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,375
-Okay. That's enough.
-Let me go!

1067
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,046
[clears throat]

1068
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,550
[camera beeps]

1069
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,096
[Seung-hyo] We still
haven't eaten anything yet.

1070
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,100
That's okay. We were going to film anyway.

1071
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,770
It worked out.
Get ready for my new dish.

1072
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,147
[phone vibrating]

1073
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,241
What? What are you looking at?

1074
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,287
[inhales deeply]

1075
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,957
Seok-ryu, what's the matter?

1076
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,215
[female subscriber] My mother is currently
undergoing chemotherapy.

1077
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,635
She needs proper nutrition,
but she has trouble eating.

1078
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,970
I was looking for a healthy recipe
and tried yours.

1079
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,098
It's been a while,
but she ate an entire bowl.

1080
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,349
Thank you.

1081
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,767
[slow music playing]

1082
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,728
Your sincerity got through.

1083
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,688
Yeah.

1084
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,774
[sniffles]

1085
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:44,943
[chuckles softly]

1086
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,778
So why are you crying?

1087
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,449
-Well?
-Because she's like me.

1088
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,537
It was like that for me too.

1089
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,623
My mouth was filled with sores.

1090
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,086
Even drinking water was nauseating,

1091
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,755
but everyone kept telling me
I had to eat something.

1092
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,846
But to hear that someone enjoyed
the food I made…

1093
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,723
I feel so moved.

1094
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,603
It makes me want to keep doing this.

1095
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,481
To those who've been in pain like me,

1096
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,776
and to those who are still in pain,

1097
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,280
I want to tell them it'll be okay

1098
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,533
and that things will get better

1099
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,202
by offering a bowl of comfort.

1100
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,498
I bet no one could do that
better than you.

1101
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,505
I'm going to work harder to make videos.

1102
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,092
That's strange.

1103
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,930
You're smiling so beautifully,

1104
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,684
but I feel like I'm going to cry.

1105
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:01,769
Why?

1106
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,897
[mellow music playing]

1107
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,360
Now, whenever you make rice,

1108
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,907
slice potatoes,

1109
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,285
or season vegetables,

1110
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,665
I think it might break my heart sometimes.

1111
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,753
Back when you were sick

1112
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,090
and couldn't eat anything,

1113
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,556
I'm so sorry I couldn't be there with you.

1114
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,976
I regret it so much.

1115
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,108
So I was wondering…

1116
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,700
Will you let me…

1117
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,247
spend the rest of my life with you?

1118
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,541
What?

1119
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:05,959
[chuckles softly]

1120
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,462
Well, this wasn't my original plan.

1121
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,259
The flowers are at the auto shop,
the food is gone,

1122
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,512
and the cake was ruined, but still…

1123
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,057
Fortunately,

1124
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,104
I still have this.

1125
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,735
[mellow music continues playing]

1126
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,613
Seok-ryu.

1127
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,326
Will you marry me?

1128
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,082
I'm sorry.

1129
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,962
I can't marry you.

1130
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:52,922
No, I won't marry you.

1131
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,307
I'm sorry.

1132
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,653
[Myeong-u] That's right!

1133
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:19,365
So Songhan Industrial Development
rejected our proposal last time.

1134
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,367
Rejected? Says who?

1135
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,786
[amusing music playing]

1136
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,705
[groans softly]

1137
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,249
-[Seung-hyo] What?
-Well…

1138
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,918
Songhan Industrial Development.

1139
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,422
They can't proceed with construction
due to a scheduling conflict.

1140
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,965
Oh. Right.

1141
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,677
I see. I thought you meant something else.

1142
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:44,140
Sorry, I misheard you. It was my mistake.

1143
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,560
Excuse me, the CEO has a guest.

1144
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,020
Which one?

1145
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,229
You.

1146
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,939
-Me?
-[Jeong-min] Yes.

1147
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,027
[Dan-ho] Mr. Choi.

1148
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,530
You said you needed pictures
of the shanty town, so I took some.

1149
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,075
[weakly] Mr. Kang.

1150
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:09,707
[in normal voice] So that day
was strange from the start.

1151
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:14,796
The dark clouds of anxiety
were gradually approaching.

1152
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,631
It felt like a sign from the gods.

1153
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:17,882
"You won't succeed."

1154
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,300
"You're going to fail."

1155
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,302
"She's going to say no!"

1156
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,681
Then, you could've gone
with the option to postpone it.

1157
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,598
-What?
-What?

1158
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,518
Never mind. Continue.

1159
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,644
[amusing music playing]

1160
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,271
In the end,
nothing went according to plan.

1161
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,442
Still, just as I was instructed,
there was no audience.

1162
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:37,777
And…

1163
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,614
It wasn't a letter,
but it came from my heart.

1164
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,117
And the bracelet.

1165
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,705
[groans]

1166
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:52,709
Was it the bracelet?

1167
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,502
Bracelet?

1168
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,420
[snaps fingers]

1169
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,006
Na-yun told me to buy her a ring, but I…

1170
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,967
I bought a bracelet instead.

1171
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,720
I doubt that was the reason.

1172
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,555
Then, what could it be?

1173
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:10,810
Why would Seok-ryu reject my proposal?

1174
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,022
I don't understand.

1175
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,444
Maybe it was because she was hungry.

1176
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,696
I heard women get sensitive
when they're hungry.

1177
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,406
You're right.

1178
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:24,323
[snaps fingers]

1179
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:25,825
That's it.

1180
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,535
[laughs]

1181
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,704
You're right. That's why.

1182
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,790
Ever since she was a kid,
she could never stand being hungry.

1183
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,001
That's why she'd always…

1184
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:39,714
Gosh, I should've fed her
before asking her.

1185
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,508
I'm glad I could help.

1186
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,010
Thank you so much.

1187
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:46,846
[music ends]

1188
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,059
[pleasant music playing]

1189
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,562
Seok-ryu.

1190
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,232
Will you marry me?

1191
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,614
[sighs softly]

1192
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,787
[Mi-suk] That mean brat.

1193
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,955
How could she bring all of these?

1194
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,668
Jeez, look at all these containers.

1195
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,755
I was crazy to make her all that food.

1196
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,757
But to be precise,

1197
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,802
I don't think she ever asked you to.

1198
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,179
Maybe she did.

1199
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,599
That rude brat.

1200
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,768
Who is she to pay for my trip?

1201
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,269
So what if she's rich?

1202
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,188
How could she taunt
her friend with money?

1203
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:41,484
But honey, I don't think
she was intending to say that.

1204
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,027
No, that's how she is.

1205
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,905
She acts nice and sophisticated
as she slowly ticks people off.

1206
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,242
She's always been jealous of me.

1207
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,077
She was so resentful towards me!

1208
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,578
It didn't seem like that.

1209
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,789
That's because you don't know anything!

1210
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,332
Gosh, what a mean brat!

1211
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,878
I mean, I suggested it with her in mind.

1212
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,172
But she didn't appreciate
my good intentions!

1213
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,715
How could she do that?

1214
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,633
[sighs wearily]

1215
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,260
[phone vibrating]

1216
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,389
And another thing.

1217
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,933
Jeez, she said…

1218
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,518
[Geun-sik] How are things over there?

1219
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:16,936
Things aren't good over here.

1220
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,356
She must've thought so little of me
to have offered money like that.

1221
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,650
-[phone vibrating]
-She thinks I'm a charity case.

1222
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,110
[Gyeong-jong] It's the same here.

1223
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,987
I don't think her anger
will subside easily.

1224
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,239
How can you trample
on good intentions like that?

1225
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:31,951
-I was sad Mi-suk was being left out.
-[Geun-sik] Let's meet at my shop later.

1226
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,369
[Gyeong-jong] Okay, I understand.

1227
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,913
[Hye-suk] I was trying to help.
Hey, what are you doing?

1228
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,666
-Are you listening to me right now?
-Yeah, of course!

1229
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,167
I'm listening.

1230
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,963
[Hye-suk] How could she distort things
and misunderstand me like that?

1231
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,223
[Jae-suk] Why is the group text
so quiet today?

1232
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,182
[scoffs]

1233
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,395
Are they too busy to check their messages?

1234
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:03,733
[exclaims softly]

1235
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,154
Now, they're going around together
out in the open…

1236
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,322
I'll do it.

1237
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:10,948
Yeon-du.

1238
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:16,078
I'll teach you how to tie your shoes
so they never become undone.

1239
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,209
-Hello.
-Hello.

1240
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,628
[lady] Hello, little one.

1241
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,171
[Jae-suk chuckles]

1242
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,213
Oh.

1243
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:29,133
Mo-eum. Goodness.

1244
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:33,429
You'll get hurt
if you walk on your laces like this.

1245
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:36,349
-They keep getting undone.
-[Jae-suk] Hmm.

1246
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,350
[mellow music playing]

1247
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:42,271
Want me to show you a magical way
to keep your shoelaces tied?

1248
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,439
Yeah.

1249
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,774
[exclaims]

1250
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:46,692
Here we go.

1251
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:52,907
Make loops like this
in the shape of bunny ears,

1252
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,617
cross one ear over the other,

1253
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,328
put it under and through,

1254
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,748
and out to the front,

1255
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,210
and pull them like this.

1256
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,004
All done!

1257
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,300
Now, you can fly out
as Superman 100 times,

1258
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,718
and they'll still be tied.

1259
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,680
Really? Yeah!

1260
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:18,224
-All done! [chuckles]
-All done!

1261
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,810
Let's go!

1262
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,066
All done.

1263
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,862
I put a spell on it,
so they won't ever get loose.

1264
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,658
Thank you, Mo-eum.

1265
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,410
You're welcome! [chuckles]

1266
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,870
They'll really stay tied this way?

1267
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:40,830
Of course.

1268
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,125
I tied them like this every day
when I was a kid.

1269
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:46,544
Yeon-du!

1270
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:48,462
Want me to do something fun for you?

1271
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:57,013
-One, two, three!
-[Yeon-du laughs]

1272
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,807
[Mo-eum] I'm happy right now.

1273
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,059
-[Yeon-du laughs]
-[Mo-eum] I like Dan-ho,

1274
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,895
and I want to be with Yeon-du,

1275
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,273
because I want to be even happier.

1276
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,781
Like this!

1277
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:20,953
Mother.

1278
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:24,957
Jung Mo-eum.

1279
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,126
Why are you home so late?

1280
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:28,753
[Mo-eum] Uh…

1281
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,172
-Well…
-[Jae-suk] I was waiting for you.

1282
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,840
So I couldn't even have dinner!

1283
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,801
-Hurry and order some Chinese.
-[Mo-eum] Mmm.

1284
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,763
Okay.

1285
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,307
Jajangmyeon or jjamppong?

1286
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,060
[mellow music playing]

1287
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,020
What do you want to eat, Dan-ho?

1288
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:47,104
Oh.

1289
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,189
I'll have jjamppong.

1290
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,692
You eat japchae rice.
I'll order jjamppong.

1291
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:57,656
Yeon-du, do you want jajangmyeon?

1292
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,283
Yeah, I'd like that.

1293
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:05,331
We have to order different dishes,
so we can all share.

1294
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,708
That's the good thing
about having lots of people around.

1295
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,502
Mom?

1296
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,715
Yeon-du, want to go inside?

1297
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,926
We can wash our hands
and wait for the food.

1298
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,344
Okay!

1299
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,428
[Jae-suk] Come here!

1300
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,014
-There you go!
-Wait.

1301
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,307
She's heavy. I'll carry her.

1302
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,227
She's not heavy. She's too skinny to be.

1303
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,479
Do you even feed her?

1304
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:32,274
Yes, I try my best,
but I'm not skilled at cooking.

1305
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,485
[Jae-suk] This won't do.

1306
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:38,781
Starting tomorrow, I'll show you
just how astounding my cooking is.

1307
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,116
[Yeon-du laughs]

1308
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,242
Let's go inside.

1309
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,994
Yeon-du!

1310
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,496
Wait for us, Mother!

1311
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,667
-Goodness gracious!
-[Yeon-du laughs]

1312
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,003
I'll get the door!

1313
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:54,964
Just a moment.

1314
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:57,466
[Geun-sik exclaims]

1315
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,010
Gyeong-jong!

1316
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,681
No one followed you, right?

1317
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:04,890
I think so.

1318
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,475
But is this place safe?

1319
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,685
What if Mi-suk comes?

1320
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,854
She doesn't come in the evening.

1321
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,648
And she's so angry
that she's lying down.

1322
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,066
It's the same with us.

1323
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,235
-This may last a while. What do we do?
-I know.

1324
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,864
I swear, they were fighting so fiercely.

1325
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,867
I've seen enough women fighting
on Street Woman Fighter.

1326
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,326
What was that?

1327
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,037
Street Woman Fighter. It's…

1328
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,456
It's a show. Don't ask.
You don't have to know.

1329
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:34,170
Let's have a drink
while we come up with a solution.

1330
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:37,006
I don't think we should.

1331
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,049
-Really? Then, I'll drink alone.
-No, wait.

1332
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,926
-[Geun-sik laughs]
-Jeez, I didn't mean it.

[amusing music playing]

1334
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,557
We shouldn't be laughing right now.
We have to be serious.

1335
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,937
Gosh. Why does it taste so good today?

1336
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,403
Goodness, the shop
should be closed by now. Where is he?

[phone vibrating]

1338
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:08,787
Hey, Ms. Kang.

1339
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,208
Yeah, everything's fine. [chuckles]

1340
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,085
No, not yet.

1341
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,045
What?

1342
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:18,756
He's with someone?

1343
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,134
[exhales] How could you
do this to me, Geun-sik?

1344
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,260
This is betrayal!

1345
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,304

01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,440
-I grabbed it first. Hey!
-Move.

-[Geun-sik] We're closed today!

Frisée.

01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,917
Rosemary, chives, blueberries.

Why do you two lovers fight so often?

He was sipping alcohol by himself
and passed out again.

You didn't even eat anything

1371
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,791
so why are you so heavy?

1372

How…

1390
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:35,934
How could you say you can't marry me?

1391
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:41,065
You're drunk.
Let's talk about this when you're sober.

You're like my salt and sugar.

1398

[weakly] You can't…

1403
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,462
[music fades]

1404
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:55,681
[in normal voice] What?

1405
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,393
What am I doing here?

1406
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,188
This was as far as I could get you.

1407
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,234
Seok-ryu.

1408
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,071
Jeez, that was exhausting.

1409
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,031
-Take yourself home now.
-[Seung-hyo] Hey.

1410
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:13,949
[grunts]

1411
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,454
Tell me…

1412
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,125
why you rejected my proposal.

1413
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,589
You said we'd talk when I was sober.

1414
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:31,884
[exhales]

1415
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,178
I'm fine now.

1416
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,602
[sighs deeply]

1417
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,270
I guess you didn't blackout.

1418
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,317
You said you loved me.

1419
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:56,575
Then, why can't you marry me?

1420
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,079
We're perfectly fine the way we are now.

1421
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,665
So why bother?

1422
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,044
It could be even better.

1423
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:08,837
[slow music playing]

1424
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,465
I can become your roof,

1425
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,051
and you can be my rafters.

1426
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,637
We'll take shelter from the wind and rain,

1427
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,848
and we'll get plenty of sunshine.

1428
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,645
We can become stronger and closer.

1429
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,566
And we can live
a long and happier life together.

1430
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,527
Why…

1431
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,531
do you think we'll live long lives?

1432
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,493
It might not be long.

1433
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,620
I may look okay now,

1434
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,832
but there might come a day when I'm not.

1435
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,168
Why would you think like that?

1436
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,836
I don't want to either.

1437
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,297
But I can't help it, Seung-hyo.

1438
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:57,594
It wouldn't be strange
if I became sick again one day.

1439
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:01,682
Who knows?

1440
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,686
Something terrible
could happen to me tomorrow.

1441
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,480
That's the same for me.

1442
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,149
Did you…

1443
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,570
forget about the accident I recently had?

1444
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,657
And it's not just us.

1445
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,119
It's the same for everyone else.

1446
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,830
Life is finite,

1447
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,835
and death is inevitable.

1448
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:34,840
Everyone lives under the same conditions.

1449
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,429
Seok-ryu.

1450
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,433
I know what you're worried about,

1451
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,185
and I can't tell you that it won't happen.

1452
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,647
I'm not a god.

1453
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,986
But there's one thing
I can tell you for certain.

1454
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:58,572
I…

1455
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,160
want to spend my life with you.

1456
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,372
[pop song playing]

1457
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,423
A hundred years.

1458
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,885
Ten years.

1459
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,223
No, if I can live for only one day,

1460
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,060
it has to be with you.

1461
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,271
Me too.

1462
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:35,067
I feel the same.

1463
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,904
To be honest, I want to so badly.

1464
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,495
Then…

1465
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,582
will you accept my proposal?

1466
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:56,380
As long as you didn't return the bracelet.

1467
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,178
What do I do?

1468
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,932
I lost it after that day.

1469
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,107
I'm just kidding. [chuckles]

1470
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,567
It's at home. I'll go and get it now.

1471
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:18,610
Aunt Hye-suk.

1472
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:20,821
Mom…

1473
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:32,958
[thunderclap]

1474
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,042
[pop song playing]

1475
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:37,295
SWEET LOVE

1476
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,799
BITTER LIFE

1477
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:16,084
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1478
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,044
What's going on between you and Seung-hyo?

1479
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,379
We're dating and it's serious.

1480
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,964
She turned you down?

1481
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:22,466
Is she out of her mind?

1482
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,050
No. It can't be Seung-hyo.

1483
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:26,428
[Seok-ryu] Your parents are really upset,
aren't they?

1484
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:29,139
Well, we've already been caught.
I don't care!

1485
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,808
We're here too. Hi!

1486
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,685
[Seok-ryu] That's pretty cool, Choisseung.

1487
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:37,189
You're like the architect
in charge of Hyereung-dong.

1488
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,358
I saw it on the snack shop's door.
It was a sign saying they were closing.

1489
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,403
[Mi-suk] From now on,
Hye-suk doesn't exist in my life.

1490
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:47,407
I'm against it too. I have no desire
to make him my son-in-law at all.

1491
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:50,911
Will you marry me?

1492
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,459
