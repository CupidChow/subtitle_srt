1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,191
Hey.

3
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,611
Stop right there.

4
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,237
Hey!

5
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,674
What you said earlier…

6
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,887
what did you mean?

7
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,886
Seok-ryu.

8
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,394
Hyeon-jun?

9
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,982
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,819
I got on a plane to see you.

11
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,780
I've missed you.

12
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,578
What are you doing?

13
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,706
Can't you see I'm talking with her?

14
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,751
I know you.

15
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,630
You're Choi Seung-hyo, right?
Seok-ryu's childhood friend.

16
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,301
I think you know me too.

17
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,928
It's nice to meet you. I'm Song Hyeon-jun.

18
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,056
I can't say the same.

19
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,351
We're not on greeting terms either.

20
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,437
Is that so?

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,606
Why did you even show up here?

22
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,067
And why now of all times?

23
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,156
Why, what was going on?

24
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,116
I don't think I need
to give you an answer.

25
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,078
Let's go, Seok-ryu.

26
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,372
-Hey.
-I have something to say.

27
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,916
A lot too.

28
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,584
What do you think you're doing?

29
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,047
-Sir. Ma'am.
-What the hell are you doing?

30
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,051
How dare you come here?

31
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,220
Let go.

32
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:41,971
Let go of me.

33
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,474
Mi-suk, don't try to stop me.

34
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,227
Even if it kills me,
I'm going to destroy this bastard tonight!

35
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,478
I won't stop you.

36
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,189
But you can't do it here.

37
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,359
One neighborhood commotion is enough.

38
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,867
You bastard…

39
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,420
Are you coming home from work, Seung-hyo?

40
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,797
Yeah.

41
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,757
Well done.
I'm sure you're tired. Go on home.

42
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,011
And, Seok-ryu, you come home.

43
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,015
You too, Hyeon-jun.

44
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,894
Mom, why would you invite him home?

45
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,855
This is between us.

46
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,399
I'll take care of it.

47
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,360
It's a family matter. There should be
etiquette in relationships too.

48
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,612
You two called things off
without our consent!

49
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,824
Is marriage a game?

50
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,286
Enough talking. You two come with me.

51
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
Do you want more food?

52
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,516
Yes, please.

53
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,021
Why is Mom so calm?
Why is she being so generous?

54
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,232
She's possessed by a ghost
who can't let people starve.

55
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,528
Jeez, do I need to call a shaman?

56
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,407
Then, what about my brother-in-law?
Was he always this shameless?

57
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,701
Brother-in-law? Don't call him that.

58
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:31,247
I thought he was just trying
to be friendly then.

59
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,458
Was it two years ago?

60
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,502
He came to our house for vacation
because Seok-ryu was busy.

61
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,007
He gave me a bunch
of pocket money back then.

62
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,884
Shut your mouth.

63
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,886
Do you want more soup?

64
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,638
Yes, I'd appreciate it.

65
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,640
My goodness.

66
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,434
He doesn't know when to refuse, does he?

67
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,769
That little punk.

68
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,146
Goodness.

69
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,023
Dad, where are you going?

70
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:57,940
The rooftop.

71
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,444
I can't stand being
in the same room as that bastard!

72
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,529
Just give him everything!

73
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,156
Just eat until you explode!

74
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,913
-Yeah, eat up.
-Thank you.

75
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,667
My head hurts.

76
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,765
Hey, why aren't you going in?
Aren't you here to see Seok-ryu?

77
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,852
Forget it.
There's an unwelcome guest inside.

78
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,522
Unwelcome guest? Who?

79
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,982
Seok-ryu's ex-fiancé.

80
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,067
What?

81
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,362
Is this bastard high?

82
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,073
How dare he appear in front of Seok-ryu?

83
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:47,990
I'll kill him.

84
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,909
Don't do anything.

85
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,495
Why? We have to kill that jerk.

86
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,622
I want to kill him more.

87
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,142
Did you get enough to eat?

88
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,728
Yes, it was delicious. Thank you.

89
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,813
That's good.

90
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,901
I feel like I've done my duty,
so I'll say what's on my mind now.

91
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,196
Mom, why are you talking like that?
Are you shooting a historical drama?

92
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,201
From what I hear,

93
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,330
Seok-ryu cheated on you. Is that true?

94
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,416
Excuse me?

95
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,668
No, of course not…

96
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,088
Unless you did?

97
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,260
Then…

98
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,262
did you cheat?

99
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,805
No, I didn't.

100
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,809
But it was my fault.

101
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,189
I take full responsibility
for breaking off our engagement.

102
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,483
You little punk!

103
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,067
Dad, don't!

104
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,486
Hyeon-jun, that's enough.

105
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,322
It's not like that, Mom.

106
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,619
I had a feeling my daughter
wouldn't have done that.

107
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,788
Still, I wanted to ask to make sure.

108
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,458
If it were true, I wanted to apologize.

109
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,293
But since that's not the case…

110
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,921
You bastard.

111
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,506
Come get this beating.

112
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,049
-Wait, honey.
-Mom!

113
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,219
-Mi-suk!
-Mom! I said it wasn't his fault.

114
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,554
You can't hit people with this!
You'll kill him!

115
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,473
Fine. I'll kill this bastard
and go to jail.

116
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,225
Hey, you bastard!

117
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,143
How dare you break my daughter's heart?

118
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,311
How dare you?

119
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,439
-I told you I can't go to jail with you!
-Mom, please!

120
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,858
Hyeon-jun, let's go.

121
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,068
I've seen this before.

122
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,945
It's totally déjà vu.
This is so immersive!

123
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,821
-Come on.
-Hit me until you feel better!

124
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,240
That's why I came here.

125
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,367
-You're going to die.
-Good.

126
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,618
You think I won't?

127
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,370
Mom! Jeez!

128
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,163
-Mom, stop!
-Not too much!

129
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,082
Wow! This woman's so strong!

130
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,584
Come on. I said let's go!

131
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,127
Come on.

132
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,879
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

133
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,840
You punk! I can't let that bastard
leave in one piece!

134
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,968
I'll come back again, sir.

135
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,928
Don't ever come back, you bastard!

136
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,721
If I ever see you here again,

137
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,057
I'll knock your head off, you prick!

138
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,476
My son works out, punk!

139
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,358
This burning sense of justice
is rising from my core.

140
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,652
Beer's not enough to cool it.

141
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,988
Want another one?

142
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,949
Let's go and cause a scene instead.
I'll cover the costs.

143
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,159
Whatever.
You won't even pay for the beer.

144
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,870
You said you wanted
to kill him even more.

145
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,247
I was just saying.

146
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,540
-Who am I to do that?
-What?

147
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,501
What do you mean?

148
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,879
You're the son of Seok-ryu's mom's friend.

149
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,549
You've been her best friend
since childhood.

150
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,092
Exactly.

151
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,137
-We're just friends.
-Hey!

152
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,556
Being friends is an incredible thing.

153
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,185
One definition of a friend says it's one
who carries my sorrows on their back.

154
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,146
How cool is that?

155
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,524
What if I get involved
and dig up more of her sorrows?

156
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,067
I don't even know how she feels.

157
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,322
You're so frustrating.
How much longer will you keep this up?

158
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,991
When I think of all the time
you've wasted already,

159
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,037
you could've dug
until you reached the Earth's core.

160
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,873
Mo-eum, did you…

161
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,751
That's right. I saw the time capsule.

162
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,005
Hey. You should've buried just the letter.

163
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,424
If you hide your feelings in there too,

164
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,551
how would anyone know?

165
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,887
Look.

166
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,598
You're the only one who's suffering.

167
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,893
You didn't tell her, did you?

168
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,810
Are you insane?

169
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,231
Seung-hyo, you have to
save yourself from unrequited love.

170
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,691
Even I can't rescue you.

171
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,820
But…

172
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,407
I will root for you.

173
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,954
I'm off.

174
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,543
Darn, I should've teased him
about it some more.

175
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:31,607
LOVE IS ALL ABOUT TIMING

176
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,281
Why did you come?

177
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,744
Did you come to be beaten
to death by my parents?

178
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,247
No, I came to live.

179
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,584
I came because I wanted
to breathe, eat, and sleep again.

180
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,380
Without you,

181
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,551
I can't do those basic things.
I can't live.

182
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,136
That's not because of me.

183
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,055
It wasn't because we were special either.

184
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,309
It would've been the same with anyone.

185
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,979
We dated for years.

186
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,314
-It's an obvious feeling.
-Don't say that.

187
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,317
No matter how much you hate me,

188
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,362
don't say it as if we were nothing.

189
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,157
Seok-ryu,

190
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,534
I came to get you back.

191
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,871
I still love you.

192
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,459
Hyeon-jun, it's over between us.

193
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,211
It's not love you feel anymore.

194
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,922
It's just a habit.

195
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,717
A bad habit you've yet to fix.

196
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,224
Don't come back here. Please.

197
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,825
I'm sleeping over. Give me some clothes.

198
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,076
What?

199
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,078
My goodness.

200
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,873
-Did you run away from home?
-Probably.

201
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:15,711
I bet it was interesting to see
Hyeon-jun inside your house.

202
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,004
How did you know?

203
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,130
I ran into Seung-hyo.

204
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,382
-You did? Where?
-In front of your house.

205
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,134
He was pacing back and forth,

206
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,511
like a dog that needed to pee.

207
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,555
Mo-eum! Come here.

208
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,974
Jeez, why now? In a bit!

209
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,436
Hey, my carpal tunnel or whatever
is hurting my wrist,

210
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,189
-so I can't open this jar of jam!
-Jeez.

211
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,150
Hold on! Hey, give me a second.
I need to help my mom.

212
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,944
-I'll be right back.
-Take your time.

213
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,489
Mom, I told you if you eat that at night,
your blood sugar will spike!

214
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,131
Are you asleep?

215
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,384
No.

216
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,094
Okay.

217
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,429
Are you sleepy?

218
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,267
No, say what you want to say.

219
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,603
How does it feel to see Hyeon-jun again?

220
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,064
Took you long enough.

221
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,649
I mean,

222
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,362
I just remembered
what we talked about last time.

223
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,740
Don't eat until I get back. Wait for me.

224
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,950
Don't you dare lay a finger.

225
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,125
Hey.

226
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,168
You still love him?

227
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,590
-Your ex?
-That's half-right and half-wrong.

228
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,093
What does that mean?

229
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,097
I loved the time we spent together.

230
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,309
Everything he gave me.

231
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,185
I still love that.

232
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,564
But for some relationships,

233
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,150
I know it's better to end them.

234
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,737
So I'm doing my best to forget him.

235
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,697
And he needs to do the same.

236
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,369
Has there been
any changes in your feelings since then?

237
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,665
Nope. I'm much calmer
than I thought I'd be.

238
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,669
Even when I was getting on
the flight for Korea,

239
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,047
just the thought of seeing him again

240
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,508
made my heart feel like it would burst.

241
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,972
Well, then, I guess there's no need
for me to get involved, right?

242
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,390
What?

243
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,516
I mean,

244
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,894
if you wanted,
I was going to beat him up for you.

245
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,396
I would've waited right behind you.

246
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,273
As long as I don't kill him, it'd be fine.

247
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,903
Hey, isn't it illegal
to aid and abet in assault?

248
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,908
Look, a true hero

249
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,620
can put aside their lifetime job
in the name of friendship.

250
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,748
Forget it.
Just worry about your civil service job.

251
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,668
Your wish is my command.

252
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,507
All right. To ensure the safety
of our citizens tomorrow,

253
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,092
I shall proceed to sleep.

254
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,094
Good night.

255
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,391
Don't fight for world peace
in your dreams and get some rest.

256
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,268
Okay, I'll try.

257
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,146
Goodness.

258
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,023
Still, I'm relieved.

259
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,987
It seems your feelings have dulled a bit.

260
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,906
The feelings for your ex.

261
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,302
BAE SEOK-RYU

262
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,102
CHOISSEUNG

263
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,873
Honey?

264
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,129
Honey, it's time for breakfast.

265
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,382
You want me to kill you this early?

266
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,509
You expect me to make breakfast?

267
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,636
No, come and eat.

268
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,272
Why did you make
tteokbokki for breakfast?

269
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,108
Spicy food is the perfect remedy
for stress.

270
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,905
Experience the privilege of being the wife
of a tteokbokki shop owner.

271
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,910
Yeah, it's better to have
my stomach hurt than my heart.

272
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,455
By the way, did Seok-ryu come home?

273
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,791
I think she's in her room.

274
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,543
Speaking of which,

275
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,423
do you think she was trying to protect him
by taking him out like that?

276
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,508
What are you saying?

277
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,427
He was about to get knocked out,

278
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,931
so she took him out of the ring
before you could land a haymaker.

279
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:19,848
In any case…

280
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,519
it's as if you were Mike Tyson
or Manny Pacquiao.

281
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,771
You went wild on him.

282
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:28,899
You did great.

283
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,862
It made me feel better
to see you hit that punk like that.

284
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,659
Maybe I shouldn't have hit him though.

285
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,036
-What?
-You know.

286
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,205
You think he came here to get hit?

287
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,750
-He must still have feelings for her.
-What are you trying to say?

288
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,586
I know it's late, but if they want to,

289
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,588
I'd be okay if they got back together.

290
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,135
Her life will return to normal
if she goes back to the US with him.

291
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,053
You think that makes any sense?

292
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,138
Come on, why not?

293
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,849
A person's feelings
aren't always logical or consistent.

294
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,933
No!

295
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,227
What are you… Absolutely not!

296
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,108
That punk hurt Seok-ryu. I hate him.
And I don't want her to go to the US!

297
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,320
I mean… I don't want it either…

298
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,784
I'll give you some fish cake broth.

299
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,995
It'll be refreshing.

300
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:36,008
KOREAN FOOD CRAFTSMAN
PRACTICAL SKILLS

301
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,724
JIJIM NUREUMJEOK

302
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,310
Choisseung didn't even get to taste this.

303
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,896
Seok-ryu!

304
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,734
-Mom, please knock.
-Where are you going?

305
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,611
I have plans.

306
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,696
You're going out dressed like that?

307
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,031
Yeah. Why?

308
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,033
Get changed. Wear something else.

309
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,326
Why? I don't want to.

310
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,203
Don't embarrass me
in front of our neighbors!

311
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,872
You always walk around
in worn-out T-shirts and flip-flops.

312
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,916
They can tell you're unemployed
from a mile away.

313
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,043
-Because I am.
-You little brat!

314
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,045
You want me to wear a dress then?

315
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,421
This is nice. A dress.

316
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,300
Who'd wear this around the neighborhood?

317
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,971
You. Look at those bags under your eyes.
And why are your lips so pale?

318
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,474
-Did you even wash your face?
-Seriously?

319
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,434
Look at me.

320
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,561
You look so lifeless.

321
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,938
Are you aging now?

322
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,232
Put some makeup on.

323
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,358
What's with you?

324
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,692
Add a little blush too.

325
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,154
Apply some red lipstick.

326
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,950
What's suddenly gotten into her?

327
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,413
Who goes to class dressed like this?

328
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,467
You look pretty today.

329
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,725
I'LL BE THERE SOON
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY

330
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,354
You need rocks to smack
into each other to see if sparks will fly.

331
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,900
I guess Mom had an ulterior motive.

332
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,402
What?

333
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,695
It's nothing.

334
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,863
What brings you here?

335
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,991
I clearly told you not to come back.

336
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,368
I told you I came back for you.

337
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,251
So we meet again.

338
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,378
Come on. Get on.

339
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,130
-What?
-Aren't you going to class?

340
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,339
You'll be late.

341
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,799
That's right.

342
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,843
Seok-ryu.

343
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,013
Grab on tight.

344
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,949
What's with the bike?

345
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,410
The Earth is sick.

346
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,663
It's an environmentally-friendly approach
for an architect who's concerned

347
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,915
about the climate crisis
and carbon neutrality.

348
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,585
Also, the extra weight
makes for a good workout.

349
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,295
You told me to get on.

350
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,548
What's with the dress?
It doesn't suit you.

351
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,884
-And what did you do to your cheeks?
-Hey.

352
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,636
If you're talking about my blush,

353
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,139
it's Peach Fuzz,
and it's this year's color of the year.

354
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,307
As if you knew!

355
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,560
Goodness, I guess
you were expecting to run into him

356
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,145
since you're dressed up like this.

357
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,229
That's not true!

358
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,774
This was my mom's doing.

359
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,277
I'm not going to eat
her side dishes anymore.

360
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,279
I can't hear you. What was that?

361
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,740
I said you look ugly.

362
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,577
I couldn't hear you again.
Can you repeat that?

363
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,288
You look ugly--

364
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:57,167
Hey! That's dangerous. We could crash!

365
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,086
Then, stop messing around!

366
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,630
Jeez, what a lunatic.

367
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,708
-Last night--
-About last night--

368
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,711
-Go ahead.
-No, you first.

369
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,255
No, you go.

370
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,843
What did he say last night?

371
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,427
What?

372
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,639
He wouldn't have come here
from the US because he was bored.

373
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,975
He must have come for a reason.

374
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,436
Don't tell me…

375
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,565
-Does he want to get back together?
-What?

376
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,733
Well…

377
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,445
Well, so…

378
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,322
I must be right.

379
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,492
What? Did you start to waver
after hearing that?

380
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,580
I don't blame you.

381
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,791
It must've felt nice again
to see him after so long.

382
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,878
Hey, is that the only way you can talk?

383
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,089
It's true.
It's not like you two were just dating.

384
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,216
You were engaged.

385
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,467
Seung-hyo!

386
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,760
Still,

387
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,721
how could you be swayed by that?

388
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,598
Don't you have any self-respect?

389
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,099
Stop the bike.

390
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,518
I said stop!

391
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,728
Damn it.

392
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,694
You said stop.

393
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,487
Jerk.

394
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,657
Hey.

395
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,309
What is it? Did I do something wrong?

396
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,727
No.

397
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,521
You look full of energy today.

398
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,815
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

399
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,002
-Hey, Seung-hyo. Want some coffee?
-Should I make some for you?

400
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,380
We have a meeting
for the Misom project this afternoon.

401
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,674
We'll review
the Jeseon-dong coffee shop plans too.

402
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,218
And we need to start preparing
for Greip's flagship store,

403
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,344
so get ready.

404
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,015
Na-yun, is that white mark on his back
a ghost or something?

405
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,892
It's foundation.

406
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,352
Shade 21.

407
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,937
No. Shade 19?

408
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,691
Makeup? Seung-hyo must've had
a passionate morning!

409
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,694
It was intense enough
to leave a mark of a hug on his back!

410
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:14,739
Those facial features look familiar.

411
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,951
Who is it? No way. Was it Tae-hui?

412
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,246
Were you two talking about me?

413
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,914
Yeah. I mean, no.

414
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,666
-What?
-It's not her.

415
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,252
It's not? Then, who is it?

416
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,962
It's obvious.

417
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,506
-Jeez.
-Who is it?

418
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,259
-What's wrong?
-What? Well…

419
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,386
It's not you.

420
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,470
-Me?
-No.

421
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,639
Hey, who is it?

422
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,890
What was that?

423
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,270
FRESCO KOREA
TEMPERATURE OF TIME - ONGGI KETTLE

424
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,525
What are you doing?

425
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,819
I gave you some Botox
so you'd stop scowling.

426
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,488
I must've been too focused.

427
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,574
You sure that's all?

428
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,160
And not scowling about something else?

429
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,911
Stop trying to find out.

430
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,165
You caught me.

431
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,502
But didn't we agree to make a coffee pot?

432
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,504
It says "kettle" here.

433
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,842
Yeah, I changed it.
I've spoken with the person in charge too.

434
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,178
You didn't even tell me.
But why change it?

435
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,014
There's no romance
if things heat up too quickly.

436
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,643
Turn on the heat
and carefully bring the water to a boil.

437
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,480
I believe in the importance
of taking time.

438
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:30,899
Like an onggi?

439
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,526
Like love.

440
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,154
In my twenties,

441
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,657
I hoped too much
for things to heat up quickly.

442
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,745
But now, I want to focus
on warm and subtle things.

443
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,747
Slowly and for a long time.

444
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,459
You've changed a lot.

445
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,128
It's because of you.

446
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,882
No, it's thanks to you.

447
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,555
Stop being scared.
I won't ask you to take responsibility.

448
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,893
Let's just wait and see.

449
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,148
I'll follow my heart.
You follow yours.

450
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,653
And Seok-ryu will follow hers.

451
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,906
Why would you suddenly bring her up?

452
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,158
It's so easy to get you worked up.

453
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,704
Where did my cool, calm ex-boyfriend go?

454
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,291
You turn into a teenage boy
at the sound of Seok-ryu's name.

455
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,584
It's not that.

456
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,088
-You keep going off-topic, so--
-You're trying way too hard.

457
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,506
This is cute too though.

458
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,725
Yeon-du!

459
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,354
Dad.

460
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,481
Did you take the afternoon off again?

461
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,654
Yeah. You had a mild fever this morning.
Let's go home early and rest.

462
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,282
Unbelievable.

463
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,953
What will your company think of me
if you keep acting like this?

464
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,872
What?

465
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,790
They'll think of me as a weak child

466
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,834
who's prone to crying for her dad.

467
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,088
Yeon-du, having days off
is an employee's fundamental right.

468
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,966
Did you forget
I'm a social affairs reporter?

469
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,801
If they treat me unfairly over this,

470
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,137
I don't care who they are.
I'll confront them.

471
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,097
Dad.

472
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,602
Just keep your job until I go to college.

473
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,564
Okay.

474
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,525
Wait for me.

475
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,527
Goodbye.

476
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,451
Why am I the one
who always loses games and pays for lunch?

477
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,414
Hold on. Are they rigging them
behind my back?

478
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,209
That's mine.

479
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,092
Are they drunk?

480
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,765
Just a moment!

481
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,435
Sir?

482
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,857
Cardiac arrest.

483
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,151
-Someone call 119!
-I'll do it!

484
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,534
Hello? I'm at the intersection
near Hyereung Kindergarten.

485
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,410
A car just ran into a streetlight.

486
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,870
Do you have a hammer?

487
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,373
Yes, but I think the driver's unconscious.

488
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,416
Yes, I understand.

489
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:38,962
Please move!

490
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,558
Sir.

491
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,601
Sir?

492
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:11,578
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

493
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,373
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.

494
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,060
Are you okay? Don't get up.

495
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:36,978
Stay down.

496
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,564
I know it's uncomfortable,
but let's turn to your side.

497
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,815
Okay.

498
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,819
It'll be okay.

499
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,265
Jae-suk! What are you looking for?

500
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,600
-My sunglasses.
-What?

501
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,936
I had them on just a second ago.

502
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,605
Goodness. Hands on your head.

503
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,192
My goodness. I don't believe it.

504
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:29,155
Hey, it wasn't right under my nose.
It was right on my head!

505
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,700
Jeez, is it my age?
Why am I so forgetful these days?

506
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,035
Don't get me started.

507
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,579
I needed to go to the post office
to send a package yesterday.

508
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,873
I put my shoes on and left,
but forgot the box.

509
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,835
-Goodness. That's so sad.
-What's wrong with you?

510
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,796
I can't trust myself anymore.

511
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,173
I can't even remember words when talking.

512
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,342
I called the washer a vacuum
and the vacuum a fridge.

513
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,843
And I call Dong-jin Seok-ryu.

514
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,639
Hey, this gastrodia root extract
is supposed to be a gift from the heavens.

515
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,975
They say it contains neurotransmitters,

516
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,477
so it improves blood flow
and helps prevent dementia.

517
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,145
-Really?
-Try it.

518
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,730
-Give me one.
-Another extract?

519
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,941
Don't rely on these things.
Open it for me.

520
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,192
-Open it for you? Okay.
-Yeah.

521
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,404
Get in the habit of writing notes
if you're worried about dementia.

522
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,114
-Notes?
-Read books and newspapers too.

523
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,407
Okay. Here.

524
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,242
You still haven't fixed that habit?

525
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,243
-What?
-What?

526
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,745
You can't go a day without showing off.
That bad habit.

527
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,288
-Hey.
-What's with you?

528
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:23,251
You two are the closest,
but are so harsh when you argue.

529
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,169
Yeah, Mi-suk.

530
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,006
You're irritated
because Seok-ryu's fiancé's here.

531
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,258
Don't be sensitive
and take it out on us…

532
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,469
Where did you hear that?

533
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,014
Dong-jin. I went to the gym this morning.

534
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,224
I'm going to kill that punk!

535
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,436
-Hey!
-Can't keep a secret in this town.

536
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,397
I heard he was begging to get her back!

537
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,565
And why wouldn't he?

538
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,442
-She's so beautiful!
-That's right.

539
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,445
Seok-ryu looks just like you
when you were young!

540
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,863
She does take after me.

541
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,449
Yeah, Mi-suk was so popular
in high school.

542
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,743
-That's right.
-You remember too, right?

543
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,536
I don't know. I don't remember.

544
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,038
What?

545
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,206
Right. That's how you were back then.

546
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,625
-Yeah.
-Mi-suk was so pretty.

547
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,543
-Hey.
-So pretty.

548
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:09,088
She's popular like her mom.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

549
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,467
Don't take him back
no matter how much he begs!

550
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,178
-He's a despicable bastard!
-Right.

551
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,388
He's not that bad.

552
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,433
Yes, he is! He disgraced her
with a canceled engagement!

553
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,350
That's right!

554
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,895
Crushing him into a pulp
wouldn't be enough punishment.

555
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,314
Hey, what do you mean,
"crush him into a pulp"?

556
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,067
My son-in-law's not some herb extract!

557
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,985
You're all so crude!

558
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,237
-Forget this!
-Hey!

559
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,823
-That's not what I meant, Mi-suk.
-My gosh.

560
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,409
-What on earth were we supposed to say?
-I swear.

561
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,660
She's in menopause.

562
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,621
-Mood swings.
-We're all in menopause.

563
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,874
-This is so hard.
-Pomegranate juice is good for that.

564
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,919
-Open that for me.
-Wait just a second. Mi-suk!

565
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,421
She's not going to get over it.

566
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,882
-Stop drinking that.
-Just leave her.

567
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,221
Seok-ryu.

568
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,391
Wait…

569
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,149
Hyeon-jun, what's wrong?
Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

570
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,901
Are you okay?

571
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,945
I got you.

572
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,866
-My acting's improved a lot, hasn't it?
-What on earth are you doing?

573
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,785
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,496
You wouldn't have turned around otherwise.

575
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,833
Seok-ryu,

576
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,001
I messed up back then.

577
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,838
I know I wasn't good enough.

578
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,882
I should've tried harder
to be more understanding.

579
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,884
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

580
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,887
I know you did your best.

581
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,767
I was too overwhelmed.
I only thought about myself.

582
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,519
You had no other choice--

583
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,562
I'll get going.

584
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,148
Let's get something to eat.

585
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,526
If it's for the last time,
I'm fine with that. Just once.

586
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,862
Let's grab a meal together.

587
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,787
Dan-ho?

588
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,622
Yeon-du!

589
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,252
She said she had something to give you.

590
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,628
Go ahead.

591
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,175
Stoop down a little.

592
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,634
Like this?

593
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,862
Does it sting?

594
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,741
No, it doesn't sting at all.
It feels so warm.

595
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,286
It shouldn't feel warm.
That means bacteria got in it.

596
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,496
-Just a second.
-Okay.

597
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,010
There.

598
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,803
Wow, Yeon-du.

599
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,640
I'll get better in no time
because of your ointment.

600
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,891
Thank you.

601
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,102
-You know what?
-What?

602
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,647
You were so cool today!

603
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,608
Even though you didn't have webs
coming out of your hands,

604
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,194
you were way cooler than Spider-Man.

605
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,946
Really?

606
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,698
Hearing that gives me so much strength.
Thank you.

607
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,452
Come with us if you're getting off work.
We'll give you a ride.

608
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,788
What do you think? Should I come?

609
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,789
Let's go.

610
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,932
Are you feeling hot?

611
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,893
Yeon-du has a cold,
so I can't turn on the AC right now.

612
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,311
Yeah, I'm fine.

613
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,272
But it looks like you're hot.

614
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,773
A little bit.

615
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,945
-Do you mind if I take off my jacket?
-Sure, you don't have to ask.

616
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,589
I think Yeon-du has completely fallen
for you today.

617
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,052
At last! I finally did it.

618
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,722
I'm not taking this off tonight.

619
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,516
Do you get hurt often like that?

620
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,728
It's not often. Just sometimes.

621
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,063
Because all sorts of incidents happen.

622
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,649
Don't you get scared?

623
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,276
Like what happened earlier?

624
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,821
No way. None of that scares me.

625
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,823
Other things scare me.

626
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,244
"What if I can't save the patient?"

627
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,915
"What if I'm too late
and can't do anything?"

628
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:59,628
You're so brave. I admire you.

629
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,675
You're glorifying me
because of what I said.

630
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,760
It's true though.

631
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,930
When I saw you, I realized
we don't have to look far for heroes.

632
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,599
They're close to us.

633
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,226
I was just doing my job.

634
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,315
But I did see a real hero once.

635
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,067
-Really?
-Yes.

636
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,777
-Who was it?
-Well…

637
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,405
Once, we were rushing
a child to the hospital.

638
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,824
-Right.
-At that time, the roads were blocked.

639
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,077
We couldn't move forward at all.

640
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,623
That's when someone got out of his car,

641
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,584
and he directed traffic to clear the road.

642
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,295
He was like a superhero.

643
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,049
It felt like I had met
the man of my dreams.

644
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,260
I don't know who he is,
but I call him Mudflat Man.

645
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,096
Mudflat Man?

646
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,182
Yes, he had the funniest T-shirt on.

647
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,810
It said, "I love you, mudflats."

648
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,899
Are you okay?

649
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,819
-I'm sorry.
-Did the lights…

650
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,445
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

651
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,656
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

652
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,788
Dan-ho, where did you get this shirt?

653
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,793
Well, the thing is…
while I was covering a story,

654
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,255
I met an environmental group called
the Mudflat Guardians who gave one to me.

655
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,548
Mudflat Guardians?

656
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,216
Yes.

657
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,634
Holy cow.

658
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,846
So you might know him then.

659
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,557
Who else is in that group?

660
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,518
I don't know.
They're mostly older men and women.

661
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,270
Not them. I mean, young guys.

662
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:44,191
So I didn't see his face,
but he seemed to be about our age.

663
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,486
I think he was as tall…

664
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,780
as you…

665
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,420
Good night!

666
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,421
Wait…

667
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,173
What? Why are you following me?

668
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,468
Well, I had something to give you.

669
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,219
Just a moment.

670
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,513
So…

671
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,603
Seriously?

672
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,107
Why do you have
so many medical supplies in your bag?

673
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,984
They're all for you.

674
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,111
The pharmacy said

675
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,864
you need different medications
for each healing stage.

676
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,367
This one prevents infection.

677
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,037
This prevents scabs from forming.

678
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,623
This one's for scars.

679
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,548
Please don't get hurt again.

680
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,721
I have to go park my car.

681
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,239
Mudflat Man was the reporter.

682
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,118
What?

683
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,206
Why is my heart pounding?

684
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,291
What is it, a drum or something?

685
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,802
PERFECT MATCH

686
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,053
I knew it.

687
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,597
Those pale, squashed facial features.

688
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,432
I'm sure it's Seok-ryu.

689
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,935
I knew this would happen!

690
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,980
I was worried about her
from the start. Damn it!

691
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,197
-What are you doing?
-Miss.

692
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,741
You are not a cheetah.

693
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,077
You're not a puma or a jaguar either.

694
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,912
What are you talking about?

695
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,748
You should run at a speed
that's appropriate for humans.

696
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,167
I didn't sign up for a personal trainer.

697
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,087
I'm in the middle of my own workout,
so can you go away?

698
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,172
You're making me uncomfortable.

699
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,806
You'll break the equipment
and yourself at this rate.

700
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,100
Don't worry about it. Leave me alone.

701
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,189
What do I do?

702
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,482
I can't allow that.

703
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,276
What on earth are you doing?

704
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,903
This is perfect for you.

705
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,490
You can run straight
to the Serengeti at this speed.

706
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,993
-What's wrong with you?
-Eyes on the road!

707
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,411
Okay, go.

708
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,165
Look, zebras!

709
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,380
I'm watching my show.

710
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,382
Why do you have to stand
in front of the TV?

711
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,092
Today wasn't a coincidence, was it?

712
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,056
Hyeon-jun came here,
and you suddenly had me dress up.

713
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,017
Gosh, I applied lotion,
but why are my heels so cracked?

714
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,269
Look at this. You're changing the subject.

715
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,439
I can clearly see
what you're trying to do.

716
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,651
Don't do this anymore.
It won't change anything.

717
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,736
This won't do.
Let's go to the sauna tomorrow.

718
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,989
-No, I'm not going.
-Why not? It's nice.

719
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,283
We can soak in hot water and exfoliate.

720
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,869
Right. Hasn't it been years
since you exfoliated?

721
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,998
-Gross. I can't associate with you.
-Body scrubs can handle that, okay?

722
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,417
What's so great
about scrubbing your flesh off?

723
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,337
Above all,
I hate getting in the water with others.

724
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,672
-Why?
-It's uncomfortable.

725
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,049
Why would you sit around naked
with other strangers?

726
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,093
Who cares? We're all women.

727
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,345
Also, you're my daughter.

728
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,472
Isn't it nice to go with your mother?

729
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,973
Maybe when I was younger,

730
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,768
but we're independent
and separate entities now.

731
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,729
You still have that kind
of outdated fantasy?

732
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,023
Yeah, I'm old-fashioned and from the '80s.

733
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,401
You're modern and sophisticated.
Good for you, you brat.

734
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,236
How sophisticated of you.

735
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,529
Must be nice.

736
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,240
Jeez.

737
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,630
-Why are you walking around late at night?
-Is that a dog I hear barking?

738
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,300
Don't you watch the news?
The world's a scary place.

739
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,387
Did someone turn on the local station?

740
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,973
It's making
the whole neighborhood noisy. Jeez.

741
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,225
Forget it. Fine, do whatever you want.

742
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,725
You crazy bastard! You scared me!

743
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,896
-Quiet! This is a residential area.
-That's not what's important!

744
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,648
Why the hell did you follow me
and scare me like that?

745
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,567
Why did you suddenly run like that?

746
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,861
Because I thought someone was chasing me.

747
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,529
You could've called my name.

748
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,574
Well, you could've looked back.
Why were you only looking straight?

749
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,993
You should've called out and reassured me.

750
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,370
You should've checked first
before blindly running.

751
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,335
Jeez.

752
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,714
I think this is our problem.

753
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,427
We pass things off on each other,
make excuses, and shift the blame.

754
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,722
We don't say what we need to say,

755
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,308
so we go around in circles
and end up fighting,

756
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,519
like last time.

757
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,689
What I wanted to say…

758
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,025
wasn't that.

759
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,529
I wanted to answer you.

760
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,824
That day,

761
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,411
you asked me what I meant.

762
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,289
Stop driving me crazy!

763
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,417
Back then and now, you keep doing this…

764
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,710
so I feel like…

765
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,923
I'm going to lose my mind because of you!

766
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,680
-What I meant was…
-Don't.

767
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,516
Look,

768
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,017
right now…

769
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,896
I have a bunch of error messages
popped up in my head.

770
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:43,318
It's overloaded and has stopped working,
so I can't perform any new tasks.

771
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,529
So, later.

772
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,322
Tell me later.

773
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,161
-Later when?
-Just later.

774
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:57,374
Things are pretty complicated
for me right now.

775
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,336
Because of Hyeon-jun?

776
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,922
No, it's not because of that.

777
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,384
There's just a lot of other things.

778
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,683
Yeah, okay.

779
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,478
I'll hold off on answering you.

780
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,690
I'll postpone it
until your error messages are gone.

781
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,695
I'll wait until things
aren't complicated for you anymore.

782
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,531
-Seung-hyo, I--
-Later.

783
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,659
You say it later too.

784
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,167
But let me ask you one thing.

785
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,421
Are you going to keep seeing that jerk?

786
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,425
No, I don't plan on it.

787
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,053
You mean it?

788
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,391
All right, then.

789
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,690
I think we've done plenty
of walking and running now.

790
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,609
Let's go home.

791
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,319
Okay.

792
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,831
Go on ahead.

793
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,876
I'll definitely be behind you this time,

794
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,379
so you don't have to look back.

795
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,383
Don't be scared.

796
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,719
MY BIRTHDAY
TODAY

797
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,232
-Where are you going?
-It's an emergency.

798
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,942
There was a 17-car pileup this morning.

799
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,319
Is that so?

800
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,820
Then, when do you get home--

801
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,121
Seung-hyo?

802
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,969
He must've left early.

803
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,076
I'll be there soon. I'm almost there.

804
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,465
What's wrong?

805
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,634
Why did you call me at dawn…

806
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,855
I wanted you to be the first to see it.
It's our first sample.

807
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,358
You told me to come
for something big. This was it?

808
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,778
This is something big.
It came out beautifully.

809
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,322
It does look nice.

810
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,658
The body is round like an onggi.

811
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,743
The spout is like the eaves
of a traditional roof.

812
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,705
You wanted to preserve
the subtle curves of Korean design.

813
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,083
Isn't it nice?
Isn't it similar to your sketches?

814
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,168
I told you it was nice.

815
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,170
Are you longing for praise these days?

816
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,255
No.

817
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,467
I only long for praise from you.
I'm starved for it.

818
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,136
Let's keep things professional.

819
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,680
Do you usually get a lot
of broken jars like that?

820
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,392
Of course.

821
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,728
And it's not due to a lack of skill?

822
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,858
Look here, Mr. Architect.

823
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,195
Do things always go according to plan
on site just because you design them?

824
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,947
A wise answer to a dumb question.

825
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,825
No matter how carefully I shape the clay,

826
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,578
no one knows
how it'll come out from the fire.

827
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,874
Will it become a perfectly formed vessel?

828
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:34,461
Or will it crack and shatter to pieces?

829
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,755
You won't know
until it goes into the kiln.

830
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,470
That sounded
like such a great quote. Right?

831
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:49,851
Not only am I beautiful
and make onggi well but I'm also eloquent.

832
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,688
You're so great at praising yourself
that you don't need my help.

833
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,398
I said I'm still starved for it.

834
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,486
Let's get something good to eat in Seoul.

835
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,113
I'll go and change.

836
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,299
-Hello.
-Hello, Ambassador.

837
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,802
Is the vice minister inside?
We're having lunch.

838
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:28,348
I'm sorry, but the minister
called for him today, so he's gone.

839
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,811
Goodness. He did tell me to let you know.

840
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:36,147
It's going to take a while,
so he asked for a rain check on lunch.

841
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,733
Is that so? Okay.

842
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,776
Have a nice day, ma'am.

843
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,111
-You too.
-Thank you.

844
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,960
What are you all doing tonight?

845
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,920
LAVENDER

846
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,349
Please don't get hurt again.

847
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,936
What's going on?

848
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:19,733
Why is my heart thumping?
Are you kidding me?

849
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,860
Why is it beating faster?

850
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,571
Why did it skip a beat this time?

851
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,657
Why are you grumbling to yourself?

852
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,744
-I thought you were with someone.
-No, it's nothing.

853
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,330
Ms. Jung, why is your face so red?

854
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,291
-It's red?
-Yeah.

855
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,168
-Do you have a fever?
-No.

856
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,129
Are you sure your cut isn't infected?

857
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,089
No, it's not that.

858
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,633
I've applied an excessive amount
of ointment.

859
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,052
Okay, let's go.

860
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,637
Let's go.

861
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,560
CONDITIONS IN THE FIELD FOR PARAMEDICS

862
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,853
ASSAULTS ON EMTS RISE

863
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,740
What are you looking at so seriously?

864
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:14,412
Yeong-in, did you know almost 14%
of firefighters and EMTs suffer

865
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:18,666
from PTSD, depression,
and sleep disorders?

866
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,210
I'm sure they do.

867
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:25,340
Their job exposes them to a higher risk
of danger than the general public.

868
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,885
There are about 300 cases of assault
on paramedics each year.

869
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,721
Most offenders avoid punishment
because they were drunk.

870
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:37,352
Dan-ho, you've suddenly become
very interested in firefighters.

871
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,688
There's a paramedic I know.

872
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,650
I've seen her be treated badly before.

873
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,569
I've also seen her risk her life
to rescue others too.

874
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,739
So you're going to write an article?

875
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,407
What?

876
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,368
Give it your best, okay?

877
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:54,869
Good luck!

878
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,872
We might cover a story,

879
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:01,751
but we can't truly understand it
without firsthand experience.

880
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:07,590
It really becomes your story
after you go through it yourself.

881
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,594
I didn't know being a working mom
would be this hard.

882
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,723
-I got a call from the school today.
-Yeong-in, I just thought of a new story!

883
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,101
Can you excuse me… I mean, I have to go.

884
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:26,067
I don't know what it is,
but the spark in his eyes is back.

885
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,073
This place is really good.
The food's clean and the view's nice.

886
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,416
-Hello.
-Hello.

887
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,505
Seok-ryu, we came to eat too.
Fancy running into you here.

888
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,299
I know.

889
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,758
It's nice to see you.

890
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,053
But since we each have company,

891
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,598
I think it'll be uncomfortable
for us to sit here.

892
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,224
Would you like a new table?

893
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,435
-Yes.
-No, it's fine. We'll sit over there.

894
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,188
-Let's just sit.
-Yeah, sure.

895
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,048
How is it? Is the food okay?

896
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,758
Yeah, it's fine.

897
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:35,845
I'm glad. I put some effort into this.
It's been a while since our last date.

898
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,723
I've been curious about something.

899
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,100
What is that?

900
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,978
It's the japchae I made.

901
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,481
I've been taking cooking classes.

902
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:50,026
When it comes to cooking,
you're good enough to start an academy.

903
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,362
I'm studying
for a Korean Food Craftsman certification.

904
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,573
I want to do it professionally.

905
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,784
Really? That's great.

906
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,787
But are cooking classes enough?

907
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,540
How about going to cooking school?

908
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,002
The CIA is nice.
They have a campus in California.

909
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,254
I don't know.

910
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,631
Tuition wouldn't be cheap.

911
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,591
I haven't thought that far ahead yet.

912
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,802
You can take your time.

913
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:20,181
But can I try your japchae?

914
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:24,686
What? I don't think you can eat
food from the outside here.

915
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,688
Excuse me?

916
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,608
I have a favor to ask.

917
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:38,366
Someone very special to me made this food.

918
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:42,662
I know it might be against the rules,
but can I open it and just try a little?

919
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:47,125
We normally don't allow that,
so please make it quick.

920
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,334
Thank you.

921
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,754
Your boyfriend is very romantic.

922
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,232
This is so good.

923
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,111
This is the best japchae I've ever tasted.

924
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,203
Want me to get you a new knife?

925
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,706
No. The steak's a little tough.

926
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,794
Fresco wants to see us next week.
Do you have time?

927
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,256
-Even if I didn't, I'll make time.
-Right.

928
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,217
Remember Hye-won
from when we signed the contract?

929
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,553
She asked about our relationship.

930
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:45,141
So I said you were my ex-boyfriend,
but we still like each other.

931
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,062
Why would you make things up like that?

932
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:52,357
She looked interested in you,
so I made a preemptive move.

933
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,651
Correct that before the next meeting.

934
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,612
And don't lie like that ever again.

935
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,783
Liars are who I hate
the most in this world.

936
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,952
Not keeping a promise
is a type of lie too.

937
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:05,870
What?

938
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:08,706
Like secretly meeting someone
they said they wouldn't.

939
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,504
Are you okay?

940
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:16,798
Drink some water.

941
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,471
You should chew your food thoroughly.

942
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,808
I'm fine.
It just went down the wrong pipe.

943
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,310
People might think it's a big deal.

944
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,524
It's a big deal to me.

945
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,068
Even the smallest things bother me.

946
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,528
And I want to take care of you.

947
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,199
It's just like before,
and it still hasn't changed.

948
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,536
I have to go to the restroom.

949
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,663
Okay.

950
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,841
Didn't you say you wouldn't see him?

951
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,759
What's it to you?

952
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:05,012
-And you're one to talk.
-Are you talking about Tae-hui?

953
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,474
-You know we're doing a project together.
-Right.

954
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,768
You came to eat at a hotel for work.

955
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:11,978
You're a great businessman.

956
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,647
And you? You're eating with someone
you have no business with.

957
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,275
There you are, Seok-ryu.

958
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,568
I wanted to say bye.

959
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,236
To me?

960
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,822
I got some wine to go while paying.

961
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,031
This is yours.

962
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,367
No, thank you. I don't drink wine.

963
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,119
It's fine.

964
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,079
Then, give it to your boyfriend.

965
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,622
He's not my boyfriend.

966
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,250
Sorry about that.

967
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,544
Anyone could've mistaken him
for your boyfriend.

968
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,047
Then, I'll take it.

969
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,137
Let's go.

970
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:01,235
I knew this would be fun,
but I didn't expect it to be so thrilling.

971
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,865
-What does that mean?
-A "love square" is a first for me.

972
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:10,536
That man seemed close to Seok-ryu.

973
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,538
I'm sorry about earlier.

974
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,541
You couldn't eat properly because of me.

975
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,460
It wasn't pleasant.

976
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:21,547
The man in front of me
had his eyes at the back of his head.

977
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,883
Every fiber of his being
was focused on someone else.

978
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,929
Still, I'll accept your apology.

979
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,474
Because that will make me look cooler.

980
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,769
Again, I'm sorry.

981
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:38,898
Just a second.

982
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,610
Choi Seung-hyo speaking.

983
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,989
I felt strange today.

984
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,034
The japchae you made tasted good.

985
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,955
We sat across from each other
and shared a meal.

986
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,457
So it felt like old times.

987
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,796
I'll treat you something
even better next time.

988
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,631
Hyeon-jun?

989
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,967
There is no next time.

990
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:07,885
It was just this once.

991
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,304
That's why I agreed to come.

992
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:16,811
Then, let's say this was
the last time we eat steak.

993
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,897
Next time,
how about pasta for the last time?

994
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:24,569
Then, doenjang stew for the last time
and kimchi stew for the last time.

995
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,736
Hyeon-jun.

996
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,406
Don't be like this.

997
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,952
Let's not do this.

998
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,123
Seok-ryu.

999
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,750
Can you drop me off
at the nearest station?

1000
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,682
LAVENDER
JAE-SUK, IN-SUK

1001
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,604
Everyone's so quick to respond.

1002
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,481
Did they finally figure out
what day it is today?

1003
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,115
Emergency!

1004
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:13,451
I ordered frozen crabs
and had them sent to my office.

1005
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,077
But I forgot and left to see someone.

1006
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,539
They're all going to spoil.
Can someone put them in the fridge?

1007
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:22,168
Goodness, I can't help! I'm so sorry.

1008
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,503
I'm eating out with my family.

1009
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,797
I have plans too, so I can't go.

1010
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,467
If Hye-suk's off work, can't she go?

1011
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,718
Seriously?

1012
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,430
These little brats.

1013
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,391
Is melting ice more important
than your friend's birthday?

1014
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,406
I'll go.

1015
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:04,293
HYEREUNG REALTY

1016
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:10,716
Why would they ask me to do this?

1017
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,845
Why is this so heavy? Jeez.

1018
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,013
Goodness.

1019
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,682
Damn it!

1020
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,396
Happy birthday to you

1021
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,648
Hey, what's going on?

1022
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,274
Happy birthday to you

1023
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,901
You brats!

1024
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,570
You scared me!

1025
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,407
Happy birthday, dear Hye-suk

1026
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,784
Happy birthday to you

1027
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,703
Hey! Blow out your candles!

1028
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,413
Make a wish before you do!

1029
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,957
I bad-mouthed all of you so much.
I'm sorry.

1030
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,340
Surprise!
You were so surprised, weren't you?

1031
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,967
I really wanted to try this!

1032
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,177
I'd only seen it on TV.
It's my first time!

1033
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,430
It's childish. I tried to stop her.
You don't like…

1034
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,975
I guess she does like it.
She loves this stuff.

1035
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:05,104
Goodness, who knew we'd live
to see the day when Hye-suk cried?

1036
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,480
I know.

1037
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:07,940
Hey, Ice Princess.

1038
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,735
It only took 60 years,
but your heart's finally warmed.

1039
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,654
It's because there were too many candles.

1040
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,699
Who would cluelessly put all of these in?

1041
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,368
We didn't go with Korean age,
so we took one out.

1042
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,578
Really?

1043
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,415
-What?
-Who is it?

1044
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:25,666
It's Seung-hyo.

1045
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,334
Happy birthday, Mom.

1046
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,462
I left early,
so I didn't get a chance to say.

1047
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,379
Must be nice.

1048
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,674
-It is nice. I love it.
-What about your husband?

1049
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:36,969
-Did he prepare anything?
-Hey, birthdays are no big deal.

1050
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,013
He left early for an emergency
this morning.

1051
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,639
Yeah, he's a busy man.

1052
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,060
-Let's cut the cake!
-Yeah, let's taste it.

1053
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,603
Is that green tea frosting?

1054
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,354
No, it's mugwort.

1055
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,731
Jeez, I'm so sick of it!

1056
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:51,901
Hey, we're no longer the Suk Sisters!
Why bring that up again?

1057
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,404
Hey, mugwort is good for your health.

1058
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,906
Bring some plates, Jae-suk.

1059
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,157
Okay, are there forks?

1060
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,076
-No, we need some.
-Bring everything.

1061
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,464
Do you have any lily of the valley?

1062
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:16,926
Hello.

1063
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,719
Do you have lily of the valleys?

1064
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,555
I need lily of the valleys.

1065
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,065
Thank you, my son.

1066
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:37,947
Ms. Yu!

1067
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,448
How did you know I was here?

1068
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,159
The other teachers told me.

1069
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,746
They said an unrealistically
handsome young man was at the pool.

1070
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,998
I thought it was a water spirit,
so I came.

1071
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,419
Congratulations on winning
the design contest.

1072
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,881
Thank you.
I was surprised to get the call.

1073
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,884
What do you mean?
It went to the rightful winner.

1074
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,305
This place is special to you.

1075
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,267
It is.

1076
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,854
Did you tell Seok-ryu too?

1077
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,857
-No, not yet.
-Hurry and tell her. She'll love it.

1078
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,650
She won't remember.

1079
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:15,776
Of course, she will.

1080
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,779
She called to ask if the results
were out a few days ago.

1081
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,618
Hi, Ms. Yu. It's Seok-ryu.

1082
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,955
Are the results
for Choisseung's contest out yet?

1083
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,208
Not yet?

1084
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,461
Okay. I'm sorry to keep calling you.

1085
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,765
Are they out now?

1086
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:48,601
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION

1087
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,518
ANNOUNCEMENTS

1088
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:56,609
What's taking so long?

1089
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,152
Hello!

1090
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:02,531
Are the results of Hyereung High's
gym remodeling and design contest out yet?

1091
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,117
Yes, Hyereung High School.

1092
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,912
Not yet?

1093
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,706
Okay, thank you.

1094
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,795
I think she thought I'd find out sooner.

1095
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,589
She's asked me several times.

1096
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:23,469
I'll get going now.

1097
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,804
Have some alone time with the pool.

1098
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,934
You have to create a new future.

1099
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,144
Make sure it's a nice goodbye
to the past.

1100
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:36,815
Seung-hyo, good luck!

1101
01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:39,109
Bye!

1102
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,494
No matter how carefully I shape the clay,

1103
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,330
no one knows
how it'll come out from the fire.

1104
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:54,041
Will it become a perfectly formed vessel?

1105
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:58,003
Or will it crack and shatter to pieces?

1106
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,507
You won't know
until it goes in the kiln.

1107
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:04,426
Seung-hyo,

1108
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,971
you have to save yourself
from unrequited love.

1109
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,014
Even I can't rescue you.

1110
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,643
There once was an athlete
in the 200-meter event

1111
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:15,938
whose weakness
was being slow off the blocks.

1112
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:19,191
But despite this, he overcame it
through his tireless efforts.

1113
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,901
Even if it's a bit late,

1114
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:24,446
I'd tell him to muster up the courage,
just like the swimmer did.

1115
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:36,583
CHOISSEUNG

1116
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,501
What is it?

1117
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,837
-Where are you right now?
-Why do you care?

1118
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,921
Where are you?

1119
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:43,215
I'm at my dad's shop. I'm practicing.

1120
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,134
Wait right there. I'm on my way now.

1121
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,196
What's this? Why did you come here?

1122
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:33,724
Looking back, I had plenty
of chances to tell her how I felt.

1123
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,976
-Smile!
-Honey, me too!

1124
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,104
-Get out of there!
-Okay.

1125
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,648
-Take it! Smile!
-Okay! One, two, three!

1126
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:45,069
-Okay, now!
-Get out for a second.

1127
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,696
Let's take one together. Take one of us!

1128
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,574
Okay! One, two, three.

1129
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,451
Seung-hyo, take one with Seok-ryu.

1130
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,161
-Yeah. Take one.
-No, it's fine.

1131
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:56,080
-Just take it. Come here.
-Hurry up.

1132
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,498
Here we go!

1133
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,541
One, two, three!

1134
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,505
The day we graduated high school
and finally became adults.

1135
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,716
I can't stand to look.

1136
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,095
-Where are you going dressed like that?
-A date.

1137
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,764
It's a group date with PE majors.

1138
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,599
I hear they're really handsome.

1139
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,027
The day the ice cream was sweet

1140
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,407
and cherry blossoms flew in spring
when we were immature 20-year-olds.

1141
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,369
Where are you going?

1142
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,246
The US. I found it.

1143
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,707
I got into UC Berkkeley.

1144
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,585
On a full ride too! Isn't it awesome?

1145
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:47,005
Remember my friend, So-yun?

1146
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:51,260
She applied,
so I just put in an application too.

1147
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,428
But look!

1148
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,720
I got in.

1149
01:13:56,432 --> 01:14:00,102
They say you follow friends to Gangnam,
but I'm following mine to the US.

1150
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:04,398
Honestly, I thought
my mom would be against it.

1151
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,316
But she told me to go.

1152
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:11,155
But I'm actually a little excited.

1153
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,533
This will be my first time overseas.

1154
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,660
And it'll be my first time on a plane.

1155
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:20,414
I've never even been to Jeju.
But my first trip is to the US!

1156
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,499
Isn't this amazing?

1157
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:28,797
That late night at the tent bar
when she said she was going to the US.

1158
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,550
And…

1159
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:33,719
tonight.

1160
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,013
-Seok-ryu.
-Hey, right now…

1161
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,389
Hear me out first.

1162
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,602
I won't delay it any longer.

1163
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,354
I said I'd wait until later,

1164
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,484
but that was an excuse I made
to pretend to be considerate.

1165
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,653
I lied to myself.

1166
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,200
It was out of fear. I was scared.

1167
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:58,952
So…

1168
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,664
The thing is…

1169
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,461
I'm going to say it this time.

1170
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,423
When I said you were driving me crazy…

1171
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,636
When I said I was losing my mind
because of you…

1172
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,222
What I meant by that was…

1173
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,019
I…

1174
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,401
like you.

1175
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:47,167
LOVE IS ALL ABOUT TIMING

1176
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:52,589
ALREADY LOVE

1177
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:29,626
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1178
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,128
How do I face her tomorrow?

1179
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,838
She's not asleep. No.

1180
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:36,508
If you've drawn the knife,
you should cut something.

1181
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,052
-Why aren't you in a T-shirt today?
-They're gone.

1182
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,512
You wore perfume too?

1183
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:43,599
Does that mean your answer
has no expiration date?

1184
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:45,851
Seung-hyo might not know,

1185
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,145
but I think I liked him first.

1186
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:51,148
I want to clear up
any misunderstandings about me.

1187
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:53,442
Not just anyone can survive
the social affairs team.

1188
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,068
I've changed my strategy.

1189
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,613
The "lasts" didn't work,
so I'm going back to the beginning.

1190
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,490
The reason why I can't stay
as Seok-ryu's friend

1191
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,825
isn't because she's a woman.

1192
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,577
It's because she's Seok-ryu.

1193
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:10,125
