1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,647
-Seok-ryu.
-Hey, right now…

3
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,107
Hear me out first.

4
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,820
I won't delay it any longer.

5
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,239
I said I'd wait until later,

6
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,535
but that was an excuse I made
to pretend to be considerate.

7
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,538
I lied to myself.

8
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,085
It was out of fear. I was scared.

9
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,506
So…

10
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,675
The thing is…

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,388
I'm going to say it this time.

12
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,975
When I said you were driving me crazy…

13
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,104
When I said I was losing my mind
because of you…

14
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,857
What I meant by that was…

15
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,528
I…

16
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,952
like you.

17
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,221
That's hot!

18
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,806
Hey!

19
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,849
Are you okay?

20
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,518
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Let me see.

21
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,644
No, I'm okay.

22
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,896
-You burned yourself.
-No, I'm fine.

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,481
You're going to form blisters.

24
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,406
You should've been careful!

25
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,950
You made it so I couldn't be careful.

26
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,327
I didn't know you had water boiling.
I was burning inside.

27
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,245
What are you saying?

28
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,747
Stop moving.
We have to run cold water over this.

29
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,013
Hey, why are your hands so warm?

30
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:00,972
What?

31
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,809
My body usually gives off a lot of heat.

32
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,771
-Should we go to the hospital?
-No way. It's fine.

33
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,737
Your hands are already a mess.
What if they're scarred too?

34
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,405
It's not a big deal.

35
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,992
I'm sure this will be
a daily occurrence now.

36
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,702
Now that I've decided to cook,

37
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,747
I'll get burned and cut
while battling water, fire, and oil.

38
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,625
Jeez. I can't even tell you
to stop either.

39
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,127
Who are you to tell me what to do?

40
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,587
I'm just worried.

41
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,881
And why would you worry about me?

42
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,133
Do you really not know?

43
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,761
From morning until night,

44
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,930
since childhood until now…

45
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,059
It's been my fate and my task.
They're shackles weighing me down.

46
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,979
I wonder if you're going around
acting like a decent human.

47
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,983
I worry your mom will give you
a beating for saying something dumb.

48
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,109
Hey!

49
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,655
You've cried a bunch of times
after meeting so many bums.

50
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,991
What else?
You get hit and shoved all the time.

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,577
Are you a bumper car or something?

52
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,956
This is a kitchen. It's full of sharp
and blunt objects, okay?

53
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,166
That's why I'm worried you might get hurt.

54
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,836
I wonder if you're skipping meals or not.

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,131
And I hope…

56
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,968
you have good people around you.

57
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,723
That's just how I feel.

58
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,685
So…

59
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,812
think about…

60
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,064
how you feel too.

61
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,403
I know you just got out of a relationship.

62
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,406
I know you're confused
because he's here too.

63
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,409
So I'll give you some time.

64
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,205
I answered you first…

65
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,544
but you can answer me later.

66
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,010
Gosh, it spilled everywhere.

67
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,511
What were you boiling?

68
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,722
I was going to make meatball soup.

69
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,785
I left your gift in the nightstand drawer.
I hope you like it.

70
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,757
This is prettier.

71
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,077
Professor?

72
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,122
You said it was
an important day, so you left early.

73
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,331
Why are you back?

74
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,750
I must have made a mistake.

75
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,837
I thought it was over…

76
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,882
but I guess not.

77
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,553
Are you talking about work?

78
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,892
Code blue.

79
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,478
-Emergency medicine, TA code blue.
-Let's go.

80
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:07,111
HIS SECRET

81
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,259
You're really not going to swim?

82
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,678
You don't like the water?

83
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,805
Why?

84
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,932
I'm scared.

85
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,017
And I can't breathe.

86
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,688
It's dark, and it feels like
something's pulling me down.

87
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,570
In the water,

88
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,782
you hear the same sounds
as when you cover your ears like this.

89
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,867
So there's no need to be scared.

90
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,289
Seung-hyo might not know,

91
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,667
but I think I liked him first.

92
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,092
It was when I was really young,
and I gradually forgot about it.

93
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,596
Strangely, those feelings

94
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,557
are still so vivid.

95
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,860
But, Seung-hyo…

96
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,656
is just Seung-hyo.

97
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,369
You lunatic.

98
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,121
I actually did it.

99
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,248
Was I too hasty?

100
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,958
Did I make it too overwhelming?

101
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,960
No.

102
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,630
If you've drawn the knife,
you should cut something.

103
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,341
No, I think I cut something
I shouldn't have cut.

104
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,384
No.

105
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,344
It was decisive.

106
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,930
It was good. I did great.

107
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,974
I can't keep hesitating forever.

108
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,851
But was that all I could say?

109
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,770
That she was driving me crazy?

110
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,148
This really is driving me crazy.

111
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,317
That I was losing my mind because of her?

112
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,527
I really am losing my mind. This is nuts.

113
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,281
How do I face her tomorrow?

114
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,657
Damn it.

115
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,162
Damn it, I'm going to lose it.

116
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,734
No, it wasn't too much for her.

117
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,902
It wasn't.

118
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,780
It was too much. Way too overwhelming.

119
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,282
Damn it, how do I face her tomorrow?

120
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,743
I won't… How could I not?

121
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,953
Damn it, I'm going insane.

122
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,455
Is she asleep right now?

123
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,045
She's not asleep.

124
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,398
This is insane.

125
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,109
But why isn't she asleep?

126
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,613
For crying out loud. Why isn't she asleep?

127
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,665
This is driving me nuts.

128
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,625
I think I was too hasty.

129
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,127
I think I was.

130
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,350
Why isn't she sleeping?

131
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,187
Jeez, I'm going nuts.

132
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,452
This is nuts.

133
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,006
I didn't get any sleep.

134
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,638
Good morning.

135
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,265
Did you sleep well?

136
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,933
Of course, I did.

137
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,979
But you look a little tired.

138
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,148
Did you have trouble sleeping?

139
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,193
I was pretty busy.

140
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,113
-Do you want coffee?
-No, I'll drink some tea today.

141
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,636
Do you like your gift?

142
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,641
I was waiting for you to notice.

143
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,810
Yeah, I love it.

144
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,482
You know so well exactly what I like.

145
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,526
It looks good on you.

146
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:43,280
Thanks. I'll cherish it forever.

147
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,076
I'll get you something nicer next time.

148
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,040
Come on. You promised. It's for real.

149
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:53,958
Of course.

150
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,253
Wow, I can't wait.

151
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:02,841
Welcome home.

152
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,929
Were you on night duty?
It was Mom's birthday yesterday.

153
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,057
Was it?

154
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,394
I was so busy. I must have forgotten.

155
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,021
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

156
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,440
Birthdays come every year.
They're not important.

157
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,736
-It's late, but let's have a meal--
-I should go in and rest.

158
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,698
I'm a bit tired.

159
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,802
Jeez, look at these bags under my eyes.

160
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,054
The Grim Reaper would look better than me.

161
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,069
Hey, stop the blood with this.

162
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,863
You'll get blood on it.
Isn't it expensive?

163
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,698
That's not important.

164
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,617
Why would you come here? It's dangerous.

165
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,162
Who wipes a nosebleed
with something like that?

166
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,789
I should give this back.

167
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,301
Gosh, the windows weren't even open.

168
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,220
Where does all this dust come from?

169
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,394
-Mom.
-What?

170
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,188
I was wondering

171
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,941
if you've ever thought about investing?

172
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,151
Investing?

173
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,069
Yeah.

174
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,239
I'm sure you've heard,
but it's the era of marketing these days.

175
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,451
It's become crucial for fitness trainers
to promote themselves.

176
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,371
Have you heard of Instargram?

177
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,540
Yeah. You take pictures
with your phone and post them, right?

178
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,583
I saw it on TV.

179
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,460
I knew it. You're so trendy.

180
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,798
You can become an influencer
if you get famous on Instargram.

181
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,510
Then, you'll be able to rake in
all the money in this country--

182
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,554
How dare you go
and spew your nonsense again?

183
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,224
Hey.

184
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,520
Excuse me, my dear older sister.
How about you butt out?

185
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,106
I'm only 13 months older than you.

186
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,484
Where the hell do you get off
acting as if you're some cool kid?

187
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,236
Did you forget what your face value is?

188
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,029
You know,

189
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,409
I was going to live the rest of my life
in a beautiful, nonviolent way…

190
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,326
Jeez!

191
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,912
Are you two fighting
in front of your mother this morning?

192
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,791
Mom, let's continue
our deep conversation later.

193
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,126
Mom, don't listen to this punk.

194
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,420
You say that nonsense again,

195
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,797
and I'll end your life. Got it?

196
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,090
-Yeah, right.
-Enough.

197
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,387
Why aren't you in a T-shirt today?

198
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,222
I put them in the laundry.

199
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,766
No way. I folded several of them
and put them in your room.

200
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,767
No, they're gone.

201
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,688
You wore perfume too?

202
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,565
Me?

203
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,151
Yeah, you.

204
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,488
Very fragrant.

205
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,505
Did… Did you sleep well?

206
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,423
Of course!

207
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,011
I was stretched out comfortably
and slept without any thought. You?

208
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,556
When I lay down and closed my eyes
for a second, it was morning.

209
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,808
I snored so much my nose is sore.

210
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,352
I was grinding my teeth so much
I thought I dislocated my jaw.

211
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,607
-You grind your teeth in your sleep?
-What?

212
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,109
I almost forgot.

213
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,156
Thanks for letting me use this.
I appreciate it.

214
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,449
Look. I got all the blood out.

215
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,161
I wish it hadn't come out.

216
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,288
Why? To ask for something better?

217
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,373
No, so I could be buried in it later.

218
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,167
It would've looked pretty nice.

219
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,670
Are you insane? Do you think
you're in some melodrama or something?

220
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,799
And why would you be buried?
We have to make it to 100.

221
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,301
Make it to 100? Together?

222
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,137
No, I misspoke.

223
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,641
You know that saying
about living for a long time…

224
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,059
-What?
-Good health and longevity.

225
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,436
Eternal life and 100 years of marital…

226
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,648
I mean, there's a saying
that's about 100 years.

227
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,025
What was it? A hundred years…

228
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,318
What's wrong with me?

229
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,030
So about my answer…

230
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,950
Can I really tell you later?

231
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,703
Yeah, think about it
thoroughly and carefully.

232
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,621
Really?

233
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,835
Does that mean your answer
has no expiration date?

234
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,962
Still,

235
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,965
life is finite,
so no expiration date is a bit unfair.

236
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,299
I guess so.

237
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,885
Then…

238
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,852
We should decide on an item.
How about canned goods?

239
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,646
Aren't there too many kinds?

240
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,316
Peaches, pineapples,

241
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,610
corn, ham.

242
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,904
-Tuna.
-Let's go with whelks.

243
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,741
The expiration date is…

244
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,412
Three years? Hey, that's too long.

245
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,955
Then, what about Pacific saury?

246
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,085
No stainless steel cans.

247
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,759
How about instant rice?

248
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,138
This has six months left.

249
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,016
This one is eight months.

250
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,019
-This one's for a year.
-How about this stuff?

251
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,693
Your period of careful deliberation
lasts as long as refrigerated foods?

252
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,948
You said I could answer later.
You told me to think it through carefully.

253
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,118
The depth of thought is more important
than how long it takes.

254
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,207
Since they're fermented,

255
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,210
don't yogurt drinks have
the longest shelf life?

256
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,295
Let's go with milk.

257
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,380
Why did you even bother to ask then?

258
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,508
But it'll be based on the back row.

259
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,886
Deal.

260
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,154
Hey, there's plain milk
and strawberry milk.

261
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,783
There's also chocolate, banana,
and coffee. Which one do we pick?

262
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,664
Did she leave? When did she go?

263
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,461
Then, I'm going to pick the one
with the shortest shelf life.

264
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,341
Excuse me.

265
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,885
I've been watching you.

266
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,721
-What are you doing?
-What?

267
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,518
I barely make minimum wage,
and I had neatly arranged all of those.

268
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,437
What am I supposed to do
if you mess them up like that?

269
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,067
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,029
You scared me.

271
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,572
What's this?

272
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,491
Snacks. Share them with everyone.

273
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,911
You're so heartless.

274
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,247
Hey, don't you know
I'm lactose intolerant?

275
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,665
There are canned goods too.

276
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,875
Hey, wait.

277
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,420
I get why you'd buy
pineapples and peaches,

278
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,256
but why did you buy
Pacific saury and whelks?

279
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,967
I'll take this one. I'm on a diet.

280
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,803
Sorry, but this one's mine.

281
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,430
-But you like banana milk.
-Really?

282
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,514
Yeah.

283
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:51,685
I normally do,
but this one has the shortest shelf life.

284
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,357
Goodness. Why did he smile like that?

285
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,734
I have butterflies.

286
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,945
Whelks for breakfast? Gosh.

287
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,823
How about a can of beer?

288
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:07,951
Soju?

289
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,037
Soju and beer?

290
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,833
-You want to write about your experiences?
-Yes, one special per week.

291
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,836
It's a trend these days.

292
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,048
Pick a topic each week, cover it,
and write an article on it.

293
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,968
Can you do it?
Didn't you want to transfer departments?

294
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,055
In movies,
superheroes always have two jobs.

295
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,598
They have two personas too.

296
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,269
I'm just an ordinary person,
but I wanted to give it a try.

297
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,688
Can I ask you why
you suddenly changed your mind?

298
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,525
I received the undeserving title
of Mudflat Man.

299
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,820
-What?
-You won't kill the idea, will you?

300
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,823
What's with that confidence?

301
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,992
Okay.

302
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,620
Where will you go first?

303
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,663
HYEREUNG 911 SAFETY CENTER

304
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,664
Excuse me?

305
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,000
An emergency responder for a day?

306
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,127
Yes, I'm here for the experience,
not an interview.

307
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,632
I'm here to participate, not observe.
I'll work your hours and respond to calls.

308
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,426
-But…
-Don't worry.

309
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,720
I won't cause any inconvenience.

310
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,972
Yes, but you can't just will that
to happen.

311
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,393
From what I can see, I don't think
you'll be able to ride the ambulance.

312
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,980
And I don't think you'll be able
to carry anything heavy either.

313
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,609
Goodness.

314
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,361
What are you doing?

315
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,655
I want to clear up
any misunderstandings about me.

316
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,281
I'm confident in my stamina.

317
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,408
Not just anyone can survive
the social affairs team.

318
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,580
Please help me out!

319
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,457
I want to be in the field,
not behind a desk,

320
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,543
and put my body to use
to write a good article.

321
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,170
All right. I get it.

322
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,422
Goodness. Please get up.
What are you doing?

323
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,300
I said it's not up to me. Please stop.

324
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,927
Who do I need permission from?

325
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,887
What?

326
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,724
Mr. Kang, I look forward to your article.

327
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,686
Thank you, sir. I look forward
to working with you.

328
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,314
Also, feel free to let me know
if you need anything.

329
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,900
-Yes, sir.
-There she is. That's Jung Mo-eum.

330
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,153
She'll be responsible for helping you.

331
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,447
I'll be on my way now.

332
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:14,119
Wow, I didn't think he'd be good
with people enough to be a reporter.

333
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,454
But he's totally sociable.

334
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,082
-What was that?
-Yeah.

335
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,000
What?

336
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,924
Why is this here?

337
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,262
Did I leave this here?

338
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,271
What on earth?

339
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,859
I wiped everything down before I left.

340
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,943
Why is this dirty?

341
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,487
What?

342
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,282
Gosh.

343
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,451
Did I not wipe it down?

344
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,622
What?

345
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,749
What is this?

346
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,167
Your delivery's here, sir!

347
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,710
Hey.

348
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,795
You're already working hard this early.

349
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,380
Well, that's how work is.

350
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,674
Today, it's two radishes,
two cabbages, two carrots,

351
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,176
and a bag of onions, right?

352
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,135
Okay.

353
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,305
Excuse me?

354
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,141
Have we met somewhere…

355
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,810
Watching this show has been
my source of pleasure these days.

356
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,187
-It's so good.
-Yeah.

357
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,732
What was that actress's name?
She's become the nation's sweetheart.

358
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,442
Hey, do you watch this show too?

359
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,653
No, it's such a waste of time to watch TV.

360
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,862
I'd rather read.

361
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,822
Of course, you would.

362
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,115
So what's it about?

363
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,078
It's a romance story. It's about a man
and woman falling in love.

364
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,121
See? It's so predictable.

365
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,458
Most things are predictable.
And it's what everyone likes.

366
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,752
-Yeah, right.
-Jeez.

367
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,838
Yeah, I like that actor too.

368
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,007
-Yeah, me too.
-Me too.

369
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,218
So how did the two meet?

370
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,636
They met abroad.

371
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,096
HYEON-JUN: COULD WE MEET?

372
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,639
It was so romantic too.

373
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,873
My battery's dead.

374
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,087
I didn't bring my charger.

375
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,219
-Use mine.
-What?

376
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,724
It seems urgent. You can use my charger.

377
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,644
Okay. Thank you so much.

378
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,234
But it might be too loud
if I take the call here.

379
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,403
It's fine.

380
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,615
Thank you.

381
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,398
Thank you for meeting with me.

382
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,900
I didn't come for you.

383
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,278
I wanted to hear what you had to say.

384
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,407
Let's order your coffee first.
We can order some cake too.

385
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,452
You used to love cheesecake.

386
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,787
Why did you do it?

387
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,122
Seeing you two together
made me happy and content.

388
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,333
Why did you do it?

389
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,751
I'm sorry.

390
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,880
I don't have any excuses I can give.

391
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,548
You didn't cheat on each other.

392
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,342
But you both won't tell me why.

393
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,553
You're all so tight-lipped.

394
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,015
You've already broken up,

395
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,684
so I can't weld
or patch things together again.

396
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,022
But I can't let it go,
because it's all so strange.

397
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,860
If you called off the wedding,
you must've seen each other's worst.

398
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,698
-How come you don't hate each other?
-I've never hated her.

399
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,911
I still love Seok-ryu.

400
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,881
What's this?

401
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,592
What?

402
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,054
Why the hell is she with him?

403
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,734
I took this from the back row.

404
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,736
EXPIRATION DATE JUNE 29

405
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,904
Only 11 days?

406
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,951
My goodness. Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

407
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,122
That's okay.
Seok-ryu's roar woke everyone up.

408
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,333
Okay, shall we start class?

409
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,752
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right.

410
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,175
I'll have to store this well.

411
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,975
Stay fresh in here.
I'll see you in 11 days.

412
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,233
You scared me.

413
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,069
Why are you sitting there like that?

414
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,656
Did you close up and come home?

415
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,450
No customers again?

416
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,410
Why did you meet Hyeon-jun?

417
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,163
What?

418
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,001
Did you think I wouldn't know
if you kept it from me?

419
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,214
I'm Seok-ryu's dad.

420
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,675
How much more of a fool
will you make of me?

421
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,636
Don't say it like that.

422
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,097
I met him,
because he suddenly contacted me.

423
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,599
I was going to tell you.

424
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,728
What did that punk say?

425
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,564
He said he still loves Seok-ryu.

426
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,817
He wants to go back to the US with her.

427
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,236
How dare that bastard say that?

428
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,905
So what about you?

429
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,659
You just sat there
and listened to him as he said that?

430
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,037
I told you.
I'm all for Seok-ryu going back.

431
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,206
Jeez, there you go again
with that US nonsense!

432
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,459
Are you obsessed with the US or something?

433
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,337
-Are you trying to sell your daughter off?
-What?

434
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,005
You know how you are.

435
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,634
As long as the conditions are met
and it makes people jealous,

436
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,011
you don't care,
no matter how Seok-ryu feels!

437
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,389
That's right. I am self-serving.

438
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,934
She'd send me bags
from US outlet stores every season.

439
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,271
She even sent shoes,
but I'm heartbroken now that's all gone.

440
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,940
So what? I was hoping to brag
that my son-in-law was a lawyer.

441
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,067
But I'm sad it's over now.
Are you happy?

442
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,657
Look, I just…

443
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,703
I don't want her
to be a failure and live like me.

444
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,665
I don't want her
to live a poor, shabby life!

445
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,349
You don't know anything.

446
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,768
Damn it.

447
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,498
-Hey, Gyeong-jong…
-Geun-sik…

448
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,752
Do you want to get a drink?

449
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,670
That's what I wanted to ask.

450
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,255
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

451
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,927
Gyeong-jong.

452
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,973
What's it like to live as someone

453
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,018
who's successful like you?

454
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,187
Is it nice like this crunchy fried squid?

455
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,024
For me,

456
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,196
my life's like this soggy piece. So soggy.

457
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,657
It's soaked in my feelings of inferiority.

458
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,538
Since I'm incompetent,
I worried something went wrong.

459
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,042
I was so scared
that I couldn't even ask why.

460
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,671
All I could do was pester my wife.

461
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,675
Mine's bone dry.

462
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,387
My family could crumble
at the slightest touch.

463
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,642
But this tteokbokki…

464
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,559
Yeah?

465
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,106
Is it made from flour or rice?

466
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,399
This?

467
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,735
This is made from rice.

468
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,155
Why?

469
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,033
Don't get me wrong.
Ones made with flour are good too, but…

470
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,619
I like ones made with rice.

471
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,624
-Why?
-Because it's…

472
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,210
It's so chewy.

473
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:30,216
But usually, snack shops
often sell ones made with flour.

474
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,968
Why?

475
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,181
Well, because it's…
So this is what you're curious about?

476
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:41,185
Ones made with rice bloat more
and get soggy more easily.

477
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,647
The sauce doesn't soak all the way in,
so it's tricky.

478
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,774
Why?

479
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:53,990
Well, because that's how they are.
And so, I told you why.

480
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,659
But you keep asking me why,

481
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:01,080
so I'm telling you why the ones
made with rice are naturally like that.

482
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,999
Why?

483
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,042
Damn it.

484
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,883
I'm trying to be serious here.

485
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,553
Why do you keep joking around?

486
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,058
This tteokbokki…

487
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,730
Is it made from flour or rice?

488
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,357
Jeez, this guy has
a terrible habit when drunk.

489
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,445
Why did you go back to the start?
What are you, a repeat sign?

490
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,655
Come on.

491
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,075
-Why?
-Stop it! I swear!

492
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,951
It's scaring me now.

493
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,209
Goodness.

494
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,294
That scared me.

495
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,924
What is this?

496
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,052
Why is this here?

497
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,224
Did you…

498
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,267
put this here?

499
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,145
-What is that?
-I don't know. I've never seen it before.

500
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,772
I don't know either.

501
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,321
Wait, did it break?

502
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,001
Lily of the valley…

503
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,171
Lily of the valley…

504
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:38,136
Why do you keep saying
"lily of the valley" over and over again?

505
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,638
Why? Lily of the valley… What?

506
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,391
Are you talking about the song?

507
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:50,064
Late night at Mapo Terminal

508
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,985
A night train with nowhere to go

509
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,237
Lily of the valley.

510
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,698
Lily of the valley…

511
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,826
What is it then? It's not the song?

512
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,328
-Lily of the valley…
-Yeah?

513
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,373
-They're her favorite.
-They are?

514
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,291
No.

515
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,960
-They were her favorite.
-Okay.

516
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,299
They were hard to find.

517
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:21,262
So you had a hard time
finding lily of the valleys, Gyeong-jong?

518
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,097
Okay, then.

519
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,515
I'll get them for you.

520
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,350
I'll do it.

521
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,769
I'll get them for you. Wait here.

522
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,396
Wait right there.

523
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,901
I'm going to get you
those lily of the valleys.

524
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,403
I'm off to get them.

525
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,698
That fool. What gives him the right?

526
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,118
Now, he spends the entire night out?
Unbelievable.

527
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,539
You've never done this before.
You're scaring me.

528
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,708
A son can't help his mom do the dishes?

529
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,087
Use hot water. Get rid of the grease.

530
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,174
Wash that too.

531
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,134
As I do the dishes,

532
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,430
shall we continue
our conversation from before?

533
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,598
-Give them back!
-Come now!

534
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,309
Don't be like that. Hear me out, Mom.

535
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,604
In order to become an influencer,

536
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,690
I need admirers… No, worshippers.

537
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,066
I need followers.

538
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,820
Why would people follow you?
Based on what?

539
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,947
You're so objective. Right?

540
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,031
Yeah.

541
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,536
So that's why
you can buy followers with money.

542
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,455
With tens of thousands,
they say you can live comfortably.

543
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,208
You can do group buying
and get sponsorships.

544
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,044
I only have two million won.

545
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,046
Mom, it's an investment.

546
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,424
That's not nearly enough.

547
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,634
-You damn lunatic.
-Damn it.

548
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,636
-Come here.
-Hey!

549
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,848
You punk. A parasite would have
more of a conscience than you.

550
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,392
You've mooched off
your parents your whole life.

551
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,811
And you still want to live like that
in your thirties?

552
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,104
Damn it.

553
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,690
Hey, watch your mouth.

554
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,442
You better watch how you act.

555
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:43,404
You always have your head in the clouds
instead of working hard to earn money.

556
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,449
Don't you even feel bad for Mom?

557
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,410
Cut the crap.
What makes you different from me?

558
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,162
What?

559
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,956
Say that again.

560
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,499
-Hey, that's enough!
-What?

561
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,501
I already have
a terrible headache as it is.

562
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,504
Why do you two always fight
whenever you see each other?

563
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,465
Seok-ryu, stop it. Dong-jin, go inside.

564
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,011
-You're the worst.
-You have no right to act mad.

565
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,515
Mom.

566
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,851
That punk's tricked you before.

567
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,103
You better not give him any money.

568
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,564
-I'll take care of it.
-What do you mean?

569
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,567
He's like that
because you always baby him!

570
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,985
That's because…

571
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:28,115
he's had a hole in his heart since birth.

572
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,285
So the doctor said not to make him cry
since he might need surgery.

573
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,870
I've heard it a thousand times.

574
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,206
But he didn't have surgery.

575
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,542
The hole closed up on its own.
You should've been stricter on him.

576
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,545
How could you let him be this immature
for so long?

577
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,214
Try having kids of your own.

578
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,549
See if you can treat
your sick child that way.

579
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,552
Are you taking his side again?

580
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,764
Is being sick that big of a deal?

581
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,327
THERE ARE TEN DAYS LEFT

582
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:18,457
HAVE A GOOD DAY TODAY

583
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,170
Damn.

584
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,176
-What are you doing?
-What? Nothing. Let's go in.

585
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,469
-Take this.
-Okay.

586
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,016
There are ten days left.

587
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,435
Have a good day today.

588
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,895
Did he just send me an emoji?

589
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,649
He's never done this before.

590
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,943
Did something good happen?

591
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,904
Hyeon-jun.

592
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,158
I'm glad I caught you before it got cold.

593
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,243
What is this?

594
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,244
It's jasmine tea.

595
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,122
I've changed my strategy.

596
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,625
The "lasts" didn't work,
so I'm going back to the beginning.

597
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,182
You looked busy earlier,
so I didn't get a chance to tell you.

598
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,766
Thank you for the charger.

599
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,185
I owe you one.

600
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,603
It was no big deal.

601
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,104
Yes, it was.

602
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,982
On that note, can I treat you to a drink?

603
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,817
No, it's okay.

604
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,152
It's not okay with me.

605
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,237
I'll buy you some coffee.

606
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,616
But the coffee here…

607
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,284
isn't good.

608
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,410
I see.

609
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,042
Do you like osam-bulgogi?

610
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,543
What?

611
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,670
-You don't?
-I do.

612
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,089
Let's go then.

613
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,401
It's jasmine tea.

614
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,488
-Why are you giving me this?
-It's good for digestive health.

615
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,741
It looked like you were drinking
too much coffee.

616
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,077
I'll be outside.

617
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,807
I'm going to start over again.

618
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,226
If I do that,

619
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,187
you might smile at me as you did before.

620
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,359
Well, that's it for today.

621
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,361
Bye.

622
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,332
Maybe we shouldn't have done so well.

623
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,418
I can't believe Fresco likes it already.

624
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,836
Isn't that good?

625
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,546
No.

626
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,591
Then, our collaboration
will end too quickly.

627
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,176
You should've drawn them
with your foot so they'd reject us.

628
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,221
I wanted to be pressed by deadlines
so we could pull all-nighters.

629
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,348
I'm way too competent for that.

630
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,602
You know how to joke now?

631
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,564
I'm mad for some reason. I think
you've become comfortable around me.

632
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,358
I walked into the fire on my own.

633
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,487
Like you said, you won't know
what happens until it goes in the kiln.

634
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,699
Wait, did you…

635
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,287
I told Seok-ryu how I felt about her.

636
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,757
What did she say?

637
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,968
She hasn't answered me yet.

638
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,056
I see you're stuck in that kiln
with nowhere to go.

639
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,142
You could say that.

640
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,603
I hope it cracks.

641
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,522
I hope it swells up inside and bursts.

642
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,526
I'm already burning and suffering.
I don't need your help as it is.

643
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,739
So this is how it turns out.

644
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,202
Is this why people say men
and women can't be friends?

645
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,331
The reason why I can't stay
as Seok-ryu's friend

646
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,916
isn't because she's a woman.

647
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,338
It's because she's Seok-ryu.

648
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,926
It makes me angry, but I agree.

649
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,971
I don't think you deceived me
while having feelings for her either.

650
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,810
You were a great person
when we dated.

651
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,191
I was very emotional back then.

652
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,570
I'd be crouched in a dark corner alone,

653
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,156
and you'd always bring me
back into the light.

654
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,410
That's probably why…

655
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,621
I couldn't forget you.

656
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,752
Does this mean I've been dumped?

657
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,507
No, you could be dumped too.

658
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,010
-What?
-The man from the restaurant that day.

659
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,012
He seemed formidable.

660
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,224
They seemed pretty close.

661
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,226
Not to mention,

662
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,813
he's a sexy and mature man who's at ease.

663
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,940
Just out of curiosity,

664
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,484
has the social perception
of what's sexy changed?

665
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,237
Or should I be questioning
your eye for beauty?

666
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,698
You're feeling threatened.

667
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,824
Of course not.

668
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,411
I'm only asking
as a concerned business partner.

669
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,082
Call me if you come out
of the kiln broken.

670
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,292
I'll buy you a drink.

671
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,044
Why are you being so negative--

672
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,337
Let's make it makgeolli.

673
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,466
I'm not drinking. And I never will.

674
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,218
Tell Myeong-u I'll send him
the bowl I promised soon.

675
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,359
BAE DONG-JIN

676
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,320
Seung-hyo, are you free tonight?

677
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,071
TRANSFER 2,000,000 WON?

678
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,616
Your transaction is being processed.
Do you need a receipt?

679
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,910
TRANSACTION AMOUNT: 2,000,000 WON
BALANCE: 180,002 WON

680
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,119
Please take your card.

681
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,830
Please check if you have
all of your belongings.

682
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,081
Thank you.

683
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,667
Hey, it's been a while.

684
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,253
No, it's just…

685
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,840
I was wondering if you knew
of any good part-time jobs.

686
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,300
That was so fun.

687
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,052
-It's fun every day.
-What?

688
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,428
No, like last time…

689
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,514
I'll call you back later.

690
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,311
Excuse me. What kind of place is this?

691
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,605
It's a cooking school.

692
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,941
We also hold cooking classes.

693
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,275
-Cooking?
-Yes.

694
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,050
Good grief.

695
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,058
Mister, can I get an order of tteokbokki?

696
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,269
Goodness, I'm sorry.

697
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,646
I don't think I can sell this to you.

698
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,856
Why not? You have so much.

699
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,569
I don't think
I can sell this in good conscience.

700
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,945
It's too soggy.

701
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,196
What can you do?

702
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,156
Okay. Goodbye.

703
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,074
Goodness.

704
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,118
I'm sorry. Come back next time.

705
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,959
How about we start over again?

706
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,213
That's right. It's the bag from before.

707
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,924
What is this?

708
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,595
What is this? I didn't put this in here.

709
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,096
Honey.

710
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,681
What?

711
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,518
I'm home.

712
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,604
Hi.

713
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,106
Why are you sitting here?

714
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,233
Is no one home?

715
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,111
Dong-jin said he needed to talk to me.

716
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,031
He said he'd be late
and told me to wait inside.

717
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,866
Why would he need to talk to you?

718
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,328
I don't know.
He said he has something to propose.

719
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,956
Damn it. That bastard.

720
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,833
He even asked you?

721
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,502
This punk must be out of his mind.

722
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,671
What? What is it?

723
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,717
Mom, do you know what Dong-jin's doing?

724
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,927
He asked you for money,
and now, he asked…

725
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,139
KOREAN FOOD CRAFTSMAN
PRACTICAL SKILLS

726
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,267
What are you doing?

727
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,644
What is all of this?

728
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,897
Mom, don't you think
this is a little much? Come on.

729
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,024
Why are you inspecting stuff in my bag?

730
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,693
What is all of this?

731
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,695
Aunt Mi-suk, you should calm down first.

732
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,946
-Sit down…
-Can't you tell?

733
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,573
It's a cooking book.

734
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,661
Why do you have it?
Why would you have this?

735
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,872
Because I want to cook.

736
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,083
What?

737
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,337
Let's hear what she has to say first.

738
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,797
She's had her reasons.

739
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,300
Seung-hyo, did you know?
You knew she was taking cooking classes?

740
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,262
Yeah.

741
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,931
Goodness.

742
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,351
After running wild
and being reckless together,

743
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,894
were you conspiring together too?

744
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:41,978
I'm sorry.

745
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,189
-But--
-He didn't do anything wrong.

746
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,150
-This is my business. My dream.
-How dare you?

747
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,318
So…

748
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,862
that's why you've been coming to my shop?

749
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,532
To secretly use my kitchen?

750
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,243
I'm sorry.

751
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,036
I didn't have a place to practice.

752
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,958
I was going to tell you both
after I got my certification.

753
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,084
Certification?

754
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:08,547
Seok-ryu, do you really want
to do this type of work?

755
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,050
Yeah, I do.

756
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,722
I worked really hard to find my dream.

757
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,348
Goodness.

758
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,308
What about your old work?

759
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,102
Well?

760
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,439
What about all the studying you did?
And your experience?

761
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,567
It was a valuable experience.
That time is precious to me.

762
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,609
But…

763
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,739
I think this is where it ends, Dad.

764
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:52,466
We raised a smart fool.

765
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:58,555
Seok-ryu, did all of that praise
go to your head?

766
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,975
-Dad…
-You couldn't stay at a job for ten years.

767
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,644
Do you really think
you can handle this kind of work

768
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,106
with that kind of mentality?

769
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,780
What's going on?

770
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,116
Why is the mood so awful again?

771
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,578
Was it you again, Seok-ryu?

772
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,461
Don't you two ever think
you're being too hard on me?

773
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,464
Why are the standards different for me?

774
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,008
Why are you so strict with me?

775
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,178
What's Dong-jin done up until now?

776
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,223
He wanted to be a soccer player,
but ran away from camp.

777
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,600
He wanted to learn music,
so you bought him instruments,

778
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,684
but he quit right after.

779
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,270
He tried four times
and couldn't get into college.

780
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,774
He joined a theater troupe
to be an actor, but quit immediately.

781
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,484
Why the hell are you bringing the past?

782
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,861
You know why
I've worked so hard up until now?

783
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,825
You've both suffered so much
because of Dong-jin.

784
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,287
I didn't want to add to your worries.

785
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,166
But what is he doing now?

786
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,127
He's got another wild idea,
and he's pestering you, Mom!

787
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,797
Shut your mouth!

788
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,841
Keep quiet.

789
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,759
How do you always put up with him

790
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,347
but never allow me to make
a single mistake?

791
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,140
Why…

792
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,726
Why can't I do what I want with my life?

793
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,687
Fine.

794
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,025
Seok-ryu, do whatever you want.
You can do it all.

795
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,486
But not cooking.

796
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,698
I'm sure it's fun now.

797
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:45,203
You imagine your customers happily eating
your food in a charming restaurant.

798
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,205
I'm sure it's like a fairy tale.

799
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,082
I was like that too.

800
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,917
That's why you can't.

801
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,337
You can't because I've tried it. Okay?

802
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,174
Hey.

803
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:03,763
You're not the only one who feels wronged.
You're not the only victim!

804
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,725
I've spent my entire life
being criticized by you!

805
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:09,936
Damn it. So annoying.
As if she's the only one feeling wronged.

806
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,161
Don't follow me.

807
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,123
Follow me.

808
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,836
How did you know about this place?

809
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,715
I've kept it in mind for times like these.

810
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,468
Times when I'd need to comfort someone.

811
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,638
So you came here with Tae-hui.

812
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,184
There's a thing called business ethics.

813
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,355
But you know…

814
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:58,151
knowing everything
about each other's past in detail

815
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,571
isn't much of an advantage
for me right now.

816
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,658
Look at those flowers!

817
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,661
They're so white. They look like popcorn.

818
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,749
How does your brain work?
How do you go from flowers to food?

819
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,544
I mean, they look delicious.
I want to drizzle caramel over them.

820
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,047
What do you think they're called?

821
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,966
Bridalwreaths…

822
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:25,470
are neighbors to these, the fringetree.

823
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,931
They say the leaves look like rice.

824
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,140
I see.

825
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,436
Such interesting names.

826
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,987
You're not tall enough.

827
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,322
Damn.

828
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,951
Do you feel a little better?

829
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,414
I'm just a little embarrassed.

830
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,377
How do you end up seeing
all of my embarrassing moments in life?

831
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,215
I can recall all of your dark past…

832
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:05,010
Wait, this won't help me much either.

833
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,680
This is so annoying.

834
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,225
I've felt so wronged for the longest time.

835
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,521
I thought getting it off my chest

836
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,941
would make me feel better.

837
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,527
I only feel worse.

838
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,987
I know that feeling.

839
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,699
Parents aren't always right.

840
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,493
They make mistakes
with their children too.

841
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,414
When you argue over it,
you end up feeling guilty for no reason.

842
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,832
Exactly.

843
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,794
How did you know that?
Did you fight with your parents too?

844
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,838
No.

845
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,424
I'm so jealous of your family.

846
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:50,847
Your parents are cultured,
and they watch what they say.

847
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:55,935
Also, you don't have a dumbass sibling.

848
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,605
I envy that the most.
When will that punk grow up?

849
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,527
Where am I supposed
to practice cooking now?

850
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,280
Do it at our office.

851
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,409
-What?
-Use the kitchen after everyone leaves.

852
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,079
Everyone's on a business trip this week.

853
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,916
Still, I can't do that at your office.

854
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,293
Did you forget I'm the president?

855
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:23,296
You've gotten a taste for power.

856
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,632
You can't be reckless
just because you're the boss.

857
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,759
-You want to use it or not?
-I'll use it.

858
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,011
But just once.

859
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,138
And I didn't ask for this favor.

860
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,640
You offered it to me first.

861
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,974
Who's saying otherwise?

862
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,227
Right.

863
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,523
The view is nice.

864
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:46,194
They really look like popcorn to me.

865
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,783
It's past midnight.

866
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,160
You have nine days left.

867
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,582
Wait for me.

868
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,093
HYEREUNG 911 SAFETY CENTER

869
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,052
I'm Kang Dan-ho.

870
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,054
It's nice to meet you.

871
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,683
Welcome to the team!

872
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,686
I heard you were coming,
and I couldn't sleep.

873
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,937
Why?

874
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,105
I was excited.

875
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,607
Are we taking pictures today?

876
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,276
I used a sheet mask last night.

877
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,069
-Jeez.
-Are you here to have fun?

878
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,571
Just act normal.

879
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,531
That way, he'll know
how serious our job is.

880
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:35,326
-Yes, sir.
-We all put our lives on the line.

881
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,413
-You should know that.
-Yes, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

882
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,213
That last statement
sounded a bit old-fashioned even for me.

883
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,216
He's a great person
when you get to know him.

884
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,469
He has a very strong sense of duty too.

885
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,429
I can tell even if you don't tell me.

886
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,307
Okay. Shall we get going?

887
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,391
Yes, ma'am!

888
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,030
Okay. You're going to use
this locker for today.

889
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,948
-Okay.
-Your basic equipment.

890
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,368
You have your safety helmet,
vest, thermal jacket, and camera.

891
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:21,372
You can put the camera on your vest
wherever it's comfortable for you.

892
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,707
-Okay.
-Next.

893
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,170
Now, we ride in this vehicle
when we're dispatched to a call.

894
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,713
-Okay.
-Let me show you.

895
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,716
This is… Get in.

896
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,053
-I'll tell you about the first-aid kits.
-Okay.

897
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,763
The smallest bag is the vitals bag.

898
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,057
-Vitals.
-The biggest one is for wounds.

899
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,725
This is the cardiac arrest bag.

900
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,143
This is the fluids bag.

901
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,687
I'll take each one out
and explain them to you.

902
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,733
Emergency dispatch.
15-3 Boun-dong, Seongbuk-gu.

903
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,235
-Seat belts on.
-My helmet.

904
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,876
Wow! It's seasoned bracken!

905
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,507
Wow!

906
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,105
It looks so good.

907
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:31,901
It's so good.

908
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,842
Eat.

909
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,428
What about you?

910
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,762
I have to go right now.

911
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,977
-What?
-I said, "Thanks."

912
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,643
Your son's grown, and time has passed.

913
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,227
It's time.

914
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:54,067
It's an important life decision.
Think about my offer.

915
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,783
-We're paramedics. We received a call.
-Over here!

916
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,327
Are you okay, sir?

917
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,832
I think I hurt my back. I can't move.

918
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,835
We were trimming trees and I fell.

919
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,962
There must've been a beehive here.

920
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,881
Should I get the protective gear?

921
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,383
No, we can't waste any more time.

922
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,926
His condition could worsen.

923
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,637
They're not wasps. You won't die.

924
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,805
Come over here now.

925
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,225
Sir, don't move.

926
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,485
I'm glad the patient's condition
isn't serious.

927
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,862
Yeah.

928
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:46,911
But I can't really say
the same for your face.

929
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,957
It doesn't hurt at all. I feel fine.

930
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,002
Yeah, well… you could've just left
if things seemed dangerous.

931
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,088
Why did you keep helping?

932
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,465
How could I? We're a team today.

933
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,383
United as one.

934
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,968
United as one, my foot.

935
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,429
Hurry and get treated.
We have to get back.

936
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,348
No, I'm going to complete
the rest of the shift with you.

937
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,686
How are you going to
save anyone looking like that?

938
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,646
You should speak for yourself, Mo-eum.

939
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,274
Your face may be fine,
but you were stung all over.

940
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,692
Why did you call me by my name?

941
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:22,155
Calling you "Ms. Paramedic"
seemed a bit stiff.

942
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,116
-What should I call you then?
-Ms. Jung.

943
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,701
We got a call from Gongsin-dong.

944
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,370
It'd be faster to go straight there
than from the station.

945
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,830
-Let's go.
-Okay.

946
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,542
Let's go.

947
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,169
Yes, Captain Jung!

948
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,934
The patient has a herniated disk,
but there's no elevator.

949
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,395
But we have legs.

950
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,189
-Let's go quickly.
-Let's go.

951
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,530
This way.

952
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,534
Sir?

953
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,664
You can't move, can you?

954
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,624
No.

955
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,418
Can you help us?

956
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,837
Lift it more, Mr. Kang.

957
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:20,797
Okay!

958
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,590
Slowly.

959
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,259
We're paramedics. Excuse us.

960
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,677
-Did you call it in?
-Yes.

961
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,637
What did he eat?

962
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,639
Shrimp. He didn't say he was allergic.

963
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,350
-Take out the oxygen tank, Mr. Kang.
-Okay.

964
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,019
-Give me that first.
-Okay.

965
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,522
Just a moment, sir.

966
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,485
-I'll check his pulse.
-Okay.

967
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:47,240
Doctor, the patient seems
to have gone into anaphylaxis.

968
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,157
Yes.

969
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,576
I'll inject him
with epinephrine and saline.

970
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,453
-Give me the EpiPen.
-Okay.

971
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,333
Sir, I'll administer the injection.

972
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,836
-Hold his arm.
-Okay.

973
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,553
Roll up his left sleeve.

974
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,723
Can you see any veins?

975
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,106
When I contacted you,

976
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:23,192
I didn't think you'd do
this remodeling project.

977
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:27,113
These days,
those boundaries are disappearing.

978
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,491
Not to mention, I think it'll be fun.

979
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,451
A theater is such an exciting place.

980
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,956
I want to amplify that excitement

981
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,126
and turn it into a space where people
can experience a variety of things.

982
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,794
We're so grateful.

983
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,339
But it seems your affinity
for theaters is as great as ours.

984
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,092
I have a lot of memories from theaters.

985
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,343
You do?

986
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:53,306
Yes, the first movie I ever saw
at a movie theater was Toy Story.

987
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:57,226
Did you watch it with your parents
when you were a kid?

988
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,438
No, with a friend I really liked.

989
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,618
Since I'm here,
I'd like to see the employee area inside.

990
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,870
-Is that possible?
-Sure, of course.

991
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,121
Let's go.

992
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,586
I'm on my way back to the office.
Are you coming to practice later?

993
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,881
Hey. Can I really go?

994
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,717
No one will be there,
and I already told Myeong-u.

995
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,177
Okay, I'll come.

996
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,470
See you later.

997
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,581
What's going on?

998
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,416
Why did you come with him?

999
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,669
What happened was…

1000
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,630
I waited in front of her cooking class
and we came together.

1001
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,382
Look.

1002
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,884
Don't you know this is stalking?

1003
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,221
Do I have to call the cops
for you to come to your senses?

1004
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,056
I didn't follow Seok-ryu here.

1005
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,642
I heard this was an architecture firm.

1006
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,143
I came for a consult.

1007
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:27,400
Goodness, Seok-ryu and Mr. Choi
have brought our new client here.

1008
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,237
Please come in.
We'll serve you with love and care.

1009
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,488
What's going on?

1010
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,502
What is he here to talk about?

1011
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,090
I didn't eat anything, but I feel sick.

1012
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:55,094
So you want to build a house.

1013
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,387
Yes.

1014
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,889
My parents just retired,

1015
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,392
and they're thinking
of returning to Korea.

1016
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,561
We have some land in Gapyeong.

1017
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:08,190
They said it'd be nice to have a house
they could use like a vacation home.

1018
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:13,029
That sounds nice.
What a beautiful idea, right?

1019
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,905
We at Atelier In

1020
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:18,659
want to give your parents the gift
of a peaceful and content retirement.

1021
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:22,621
Did you have a budget
or construction timeline in mind?

1022
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,623
For now…

1023
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,710
I'm aiming for next year.

1024
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,420
Just a moment. Sorry about that.

1025
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,089
Hey, Hye-ran.

1026
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,719
There's a cockroach? Just kill it.

1027
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:38,471
What?

1028
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,515
Okay, I'll be right there.

1029
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,560
Did something happen at home?

1030
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:47,772
I think Ro-hui ingested
some roach insecticide.

1031
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,107
What? Isn't that serious?

1032
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,650
The kids are doing just fine.

1033
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,569
But I think I have to go.

1034
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:58,032
I'm sorry.
You can finish the consult with Mr. Choi.

1035
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,575
Okay, you should go.

1036
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,869
-Yes. I have to go.
-Myeong-u, call me later.

1037
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:02,787
Yeah, I will.

1038
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,163
I'm sorry.

1039
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:19,345
Mr. Song Hyeon-jun.

1040
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,973
This consult's an excuse, isn't it?

1041
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,975
More of a justification.

1042
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,602
The plans for my parents are true.

1043
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:27,686
I see.

1044
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,397
But unfortunately,

1045
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,733
I have no intention of taking this on.

1046
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:33,859
I see.

1047
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:35,820
That's too bad.

1048
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,781
I heard you were a skilled architect.

1049
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,491
Of course, Seok-ryu told me.

1050
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,454
Don't say her name anymore.

1051
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,582
Don't keep showing up either.

1052
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,460
It's already over between you two.

1053
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,921
No, it's not.

1054
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,925
Our relationship is too strong
to break up that easily.

1055
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,052
That's solely what you think.

1056
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,846
You'll see it in time.

1057
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,641
You'll see what type
of relationship we had

1058
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,685
and what we meant to one another.

1059
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,479
I'm not curious about what's in the past.

1060
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,190
I only believe what Seok-ryu says.

1061
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:18,154
Is that belief purely based on friendship?

1062
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:22,491
Of course not.

1063
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,834
How's the practice going?

1064
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,128
Sorry for the wait.

1065
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:38,340
-Why did you follow me? Aren't you going?
-Nope. I'm going to go with Seok-ryu.

1066
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,342
If you keep this up,

1067
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,720
I'll have to report you for trespassing
and squatting.

1068
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:45,264
Are you arguing about jurisprudence
in front of a lawyer?

1069
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,558
Did you forget this was my firm?

1070
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:50,269
I'm sorry, but can you both leave?

1071
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,854
You're really disrupting my cooking.

1072
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,565
-I'll be quiet.
-I'll just watch from here.

1073
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:04,033
If you both sit down,

1074
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,367
I would be so grateful.

1075
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,452
Okay.

1076
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,579
-Both of you.
-Okay.

1077
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,999
Thanks.

1078
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,264
Are you really not leaving?

1079
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,643
No, I cleared my schedule.

1080
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,938
Also, I plan to eat the food
that Seok-ryu makes.

1081
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,024
I'm asking because I'm genuinely curious.

1082
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,319
Was your personality always like this?

1083
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:44,323
Yeah, she liked this about me.

1084
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,201
I'm strategic and have clear purposes.

1085
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,162
How much longer do I have to wait?

1086
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,206
-Are you done yet?
-Are you hungry?

1087
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:55,876
I just have to fry the meatballs
and boil them in the broth.

1088
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,337
Take your time.
I'll wait for as long as it takes.

1089
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,839
Take your time.

1090
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,509
By the way,

1091
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,135
it smells so good.

1092
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,763
It smells so savory and aromatic.

1093
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:13,227
-It smells like it's caramelizing.
-That's not my cooking.

1094
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,521
But I smelled it earlier too.

1095
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,986
I bought this for you.

1096
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,239
It's popcorn!

1097
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:28,033
You said you wanted
to eat some, but I'm sorry.

1098
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,034
It's cold now.

1099
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,869
It's fine. I was hungry.

1100
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,121
Don't eat that.

1101
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,664
You can't eat bad stuff like this.

1102
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,249
What are you doing?

1103
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,710
You act like I poisoned it.

1104
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,587
Trans fats aren't good for you.

1105
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,135
Now, that's the taste.

1106
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,887
This devilish sweet-and-salty flavor
flows through my veins.

1107
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,017
Remember back when we watched
Toy Story together?

1108
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,019
Of course. I remember the lines.

1109
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,313
-"To infinity and beyond!"
-"To infinity and beyond!"

1110
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,023
-You remembered?
-Of course.

1111
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,774
Leave some popcorn for me.

1112
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,199
Have some.

1113
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:21,920
Great job.

1114
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,297
Yes, you too. Goodness.

1115
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:25,716
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1116
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:27,468
You look like you might pass out.

1117
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,636
You lied about your stamina, didn't you?

1118
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,598
That's because everyone else's stamina
is absurdly good.

1119
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,267
Goodness.

1120
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,436
What happened to your face?

1121
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,521
He was valiantly stung by bees.

1122
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,940
He worked really hard today.

1123
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,943
He didn't work that hard.
The weather was cooler today.

1124
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,071
Our underwear get soaked
in sweat in the summer.

1125
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:50,199
It's too bad you won't get to know
the feeling of how it dries up.

1126
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,785
Do you prefer the start, middle,
or end of summer?

1127
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:53,702
I'll come back.

1128
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,247
Did you have lunch?

1129
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,625
Go get changed.

1130
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,210
Let's have dinner.

1131
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:03,837
Yes, sir.

1132
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,589
-Let's go.
-What are we eating?

1133
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,055
You may eat now.

1134
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:14,765
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1135
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,981
This place is good.
The meat is so tender too.

1136
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,819
Captain Yeon brought you
to his favorite place.

1137
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,113
It means he's accepted you.

1138
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,407
Try the garlic sauce.
It tastes much better.

1139
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,326
-Okay.
-Try it with gat-kimchi too.

1140
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,369
It's so good.

1141
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,496
I'll pass on the honey.

1142
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,248
I have a grudge against bees now.

1143
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,585
I guess we'll get a proper article.
You saw how we had no time to eat.

1144
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,672
It's not just that.
There was no time to go to the bathroom.

1145
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,341
That's what causes
our occupational disease.

1146
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,384
Bladder infections.

1147
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:53,303
Captain Jung suffered from one
just last month--

1148
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,972
Hey!

1149
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:55,973
Eat this.

1150
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,349
I was already eating.

1151
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,019
Are there any other difficulties?

1152
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,813
Take this chance to speak freely.

1153
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,443
We don't listen to classical music.
You heard it, right?

1154
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,027
It played as our alert system.

1155
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:09,945
Right.

1156
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:12,698
Alarms would startle everyone.

1157
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,618
They changed it for our mental health.
But classical music startles us now.

1158
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,539
Once, I was on a toilet
in the bathroom of a bookstore,

1159
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,708
and I was startled to hear music
for cardiac arrest.

1160
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,960
I forgot my pants were down
and almost left.

1161
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,503
Mozart.

1162
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,213
-It's Mozart?
-Yeah.

1163
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,341
So that's why arrhythmia
is one of our occupational diseases.

1164
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,177
Because we're always stressed.

1165
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,596
How do you relieve that stress?

1166
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,473
Dating.

1167
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,309
That's what I'd like to say.
It's more of a wish.

1168
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:41,477
I'm single right now.

1169
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,353
Do you have time to date?

1170
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,813
We make time.

1171
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:49,234
Since we spend so much time together,
we end up dating each other.

1172
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,986
Workplace romances?

1173
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:55,324
-Have you all experienced that?
-I married my workplace romance.

1174
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,075
He dated a girl while in academy.

1175
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,537
What about you?

1176
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:02,372
What?

1177
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,041
I'm not interested in that.

1178
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:09,546
Ms. Jung likes Marvel and DC superheroes.

1179
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,257
I've never seen her impressed
with a real man before.

1180
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:15,802
No! There is one! Back then!

1181
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:17,554
The man who cleared the road.

1182
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,431
-Mudflat Man?
-Yeah, Mudflat Man.

1183
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,975
I should've looked at his plates.

1184
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:26,813
If you want to break down her wall,
you need to make an impact like him--

1185
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,774
Meat tastes the best when it's hot!

1186
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:29,691
It's hot!

1187
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,444
You're taking such good care
of him tonight.

1188
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,570
I want one too.

1189
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,661
Thank you.

1190
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,329
Let's drink.

1191
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:56,468
Here.

1192
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,595
Why are there two bowls?

1193
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:03,141
-Are you really giving him one?
-The more taste testers, the better.

1194
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,601
Evaluate it objectively.

1195
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:08,313
You'll understand
even if we criticize it, right?

1196
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:11,275
It's a necessary process for growth.

1197
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,902
You're putting a lot of significance

1198
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,405
into tasting the food, aren't you?

1199
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:20,117
We had an ideal relationship
where we always helped each other grow.

1200
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,368
-Sure.
-Don't eat it.

1201
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,829
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

1202
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:33,505
It's good.

1203
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,054
-Seok-ryu, are you okay?
-Hey, Seok-ryu!

1204
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,932
-What's wrong? Are you sick?
-My stomach…

1205
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,809
Where and how does it hurt?

1206
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,271
What are your symptoms? Can you get up?

1207
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:53,442
This won't do. Let's go to the hospital.

1208
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:54,818
I'll take you.

1209
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:02,034
Hyeon-jun, hold me up.

1210
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,452
You can lean on me.

1211
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,269
Miss, does your stomach hurt a lot?

1212
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,812
When did it start to hurt?

1213
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,731
Can you describe your symptoms?

1214
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:34,900
Three years ago…

1215
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,903
I received surgery in the US.

1216
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:48,914
Just a moment.

1217
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,000
These are Bae Seok-ryu's medical records.

1218
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,669
Please give them to her doctor.

1219
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,171
What kind of surgery?

1220
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,548
It was for stomach cancer.

1221
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,301
I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer.

1222
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:04,304
They removed 70% of my stomach.

1223
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:07,140
I underwent chemotherapy.

1224
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:39,381
HIS SECRET

1225
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:44,010
HER SECRET

1226

LOVE NEXT DOOR

1227
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:24,217
To me, Seok-ryu isn't some child.
She's a woman.

1228
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:27,220
How are you feeling right now?

1229
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,806
There's a gap
between Seok-ryu and me.

1230
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,057
And Hyeon-jun

1231
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:34,770
is inside of it
with a part of her I don't know.

1232
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,646
If you're going to start this,

1233
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,024
I want you to take
a proper path so you won't fail.

1234
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,359
Hyeon-jun proposed to me.

1235
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:45,822
How could you not tell me about this?

1236
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,617
This is how little I meant to you?

1237
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,077
Even as a friend,
I meant this little to you?

1238
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,584
