1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,938
The women's dorm?

3
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:05,940
Are you insane?

4
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,734
You want me to sneak in
the women's dorm?

5
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,693
What's the problem?

6
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,029
My roommates
always sneak their boyfriends in.

7
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,615
So? You want me to play
drinking games with them?

8
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,284
Should we? They love drinking games here.

9
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,244
Hey, I taught them how to play Mafia.

10
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,996
-They're good.
-Hey!

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,165
Don't worry. They're not here.

12
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,042
-So you're alone?
-Yeah.

13
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,837
Hey, where are you going?

14
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,924
The bars nearby aren't even open late.

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,133
They're expensive too.

16
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,844
It'll be my treat in my room!

17
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,764
Our little baby can save
his allowance and buy snacks.

18
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:38,681
Get off me.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,769
Right. Now that you're in the US,
what do you want to do the most?

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,898
Let's think about it later. Come on!

21
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,108
Let's go and get wasted!

22
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,610
I don't think this is right.

23
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,987
Okay. You look so pretty!

24
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,656
You look like a girl. Let's go.

25
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,808
Damn.

26
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,006
Now that you're in the US,
what do you want to do the most?

27
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,090
You dummy.

28
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,342
Why do you think I'm here?

29
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,100
BRIAN
DID YOU FORGET ABOUT OUR DATE TODAY?

30
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,400
My head hurts.

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,862
I have a splitting headache.

32
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,702
What? When did you get up?

33
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,330
What? Right…

34
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,706
Just now.

35
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,377
I think you got a text.

36
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,295
Really?

37
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,682
Who is it?

38
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,892
My boyfriend.

39
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,313
I'm seeing him later. Come with me.

40
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,649
You have a boyfriend now?

41
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,193
Yeah, we just started dating.

42
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,403
His name's Brian. He's an overseas Korean.

43
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,989
He can't speak Korean that well.
It's so cute.

44
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,824
He can barely spell.

45
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,332
Gosh, he's so adorable!
He can't even spell "promise" right!

46
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,218
Jeez, why is it so dark in here?

47
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,886
Just be quiet for a second.

48
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,222
I'm sure the switch
is around here somewhere.

49
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,267
You built this building,
but you can't even find the lights?

50
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,143
I found it.

51
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,694
You're a habitual offender.

52
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:43,116
It was a normal reaction to avoid falling.

53
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,367
Habitual offender, my foot.

54
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,035
Then, what was that earlier?

55
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,245
My gosh!

56
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,293
Give it.

57
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,175
If you go to Namsan,
aren't you supposed to have pork cutlets?

58
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,677
Why did you buy groceries?

59
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,639
Hey, you're supposed to cook food
on a good day like this.

60
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,266
Just wait, okay?

61
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,311
I'll show you a pretty cook,
as if there's "Something in the Rain."

62
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,313
Seriously though,
don't mess with Son Ye-jin.

63
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,119
Want some help?

64
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,413
You know how to cook?

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,207
Just go and sit.

66
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,720
Why are you so good?

67
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,140
I was ready to call Mo-eum
in case you cut a finger off.

68
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,019
The food is… so green.

69
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,188
It's colorful like grass.

70
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,941
Is that all you can say?

71
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:44,278
You took my pork cutlets, so I expected
at least some spicy stir-fried pork.

72
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,197
You have a palate of a child.

73
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,325
People should eat seasonal food.

74
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,954
Especially, spring greens.
They're just as good as wild ginseng.

75
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,498
There you go embellishing again,
like MSG on food.

76
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,052
No, that's actual MSG.
What did you put in here?

77
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,887
-Powdered stock?
-My cooking skills.

78
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,265
No way. Why is it so good?

79
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,433
Is it good? Really?

80
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,318
I know what it is. Yeah.

81
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,448
I'm so hungry right now
that I can't be objective.

82
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,825
I should've just pushed you
off that mountain.

83
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,618
Let me eat before you kill me.

84
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,828
At least I'll be full.

85
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,541
It's honestly good though, right?

86
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,584
Not bad, right?

87
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,434
Hey, don't eat so fast.

88
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,688
Wow, that smells great!

89
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,606
What's this?

90
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,983
I showcased my talents a little.

91
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,735
Why are you so late?

92
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,237
I'm a civil servant.

93
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,655
I was busy with my duties.

94
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,033
You did a great job.

95
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,910
I'll go and buy some drinks.

96
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,536
What? Okay.

97
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,375
Why is he leaving so suddenly?

98
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,169
I don't know.

99
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,046
-I don't know.
-Eat up.

100
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,547
Okay. It looks so good.

101
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,219
Darn it.

102
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,014
Why is Seok-ryu
suddenly looking at me weird like that?

103
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,268
She usually looks mad,
but now her eyes look kind.

104
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,523
They're too round and kind.

105
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,820
It looks so good.

106
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,739
-Eat up.
-Hold on.

107
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,534
MOM

108
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,619
It's okay.

109
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,037
I'll do it.

110
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,705
Why didn't you answer your mom?

111
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,666
What? Because I know what she'll say.

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,877
She wants me to go on a blind date.

113
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,295
-Really?
-Yeah.

114
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,382
My mom suffered so much from her in-laws.

115
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,717
Why does she want me
to get married so badly?

116
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,095
You know what happened.

117
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,972
After my dad died when I was seven,

118
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,308
my grandma went crazy
and blamed my mom for his death.

119
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,851
That's why we moved here.

120
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,520
I know.

121
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,855
I swear, I just don't get it.

122
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,316
-Marriage isn't always the answer.
-Right.

123
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,276
You're right.

124
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,070
That's why I ran away
before going through with things.

125
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,660
There is one regret though.

126
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,580
I wanted to see you in a wedding dress.

127
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,083
What? You can see.
Want to see my wedding photos?

128
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,252
-You haven't deleted them yet?
-No.

129
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,504
I spent a fortune
and put in so much effort.

130
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,006
How could I delete them?

131
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,595
Wow. You're so pretty.

132
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,138
I think so too.

133
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,058
What? What's this?

134
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,228
It's the smile you make
when you're truly happy.

135
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,647
I know who took this picture.

136
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,072
Hey.

137
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,203
I'm going to figure out
why you two broke up.

138
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,205
So?

139
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,084
Are you okay now?

140
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,755
Have you completely moved on from him?

141
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,425
No.

142
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,510
I still love him.

143
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,811
Gosh, I left my wallet.

144
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,146
I had to come all the way back.

145
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,191
Hey, you're all okay with beer, right?

146
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,901
No, I want soju tonight.

147
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,194
I want to get drunk.

148
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,613
-Okay. Got it.
-I want non-alcoholic beer.

149
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:59,033
-And juice.
-What? Why?

150
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,119
No, you're right. Don't get drunk tonight.

151
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,621
That'll be safer.

152
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,748
Don't eat until I get back. Wait for me.

153
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,249
Don't you dare lay a finger.

154
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,456
Look at her. Her legs are shaking.

155
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,754
Her legs are totally exhausted.

156
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,007
Why did you want to start
the morning with 108 prostrations?

157
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,636
We can't be doing that at our age.
Your knees will give out.

158
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,764
Stop. Goodness.

159
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,434
As long as my son can pass his exams,

160
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,603
they can take both my knees
and make stew with them!

161
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,189
You can't say stuff like that at a temple.

162
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,192
Buddhists are vegetarians.
Don't you know they only eat vegetables?

163
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,320
Hey, it was just a joke.

164
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,780
Are you upset about something?

165
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,491
-No, I'm not.
-Are you sure?

166
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,994
That's not what your face is saying.

167
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,413
What's wrong with my face?

168
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,331
Why are you picking on an innocent person?

169
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,751
Hey, don't raise your voice
in front of Buddha.

170
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,378
Let's go do what we always do.

171
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,505
What? Lunch?

172
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,673
Where are we eating?

173
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,052
Something's up with her.

174
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,387
Hey.

175
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,475
Hey, take this.

176
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,606
These are prayer tiles.

177
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,941
My son needs to pass his exams

178
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,776
before all of these tiles are used.

179
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,612
Have you ever done this before?

180
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,363
I've seen it before.

181
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,656
Do I write with this?

182
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,949
Yeah, go ahead.

183
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,789
PARK KI-HOON
PASS THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAM

184
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,962
MO-EUM
MOVE OUT

185
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,380
BAE GEUN-SIK
FIND BUSINESS SUCCESS

186
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,925
BAE SEOK-RYU

187
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,769
BAE SEOK-RYU
RETURN TO ORIGINAL STATE

188
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,827
"Move out"?

189
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,954
Hey.

190
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,205
You want Mo-eum to be a monk?

191
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,206
Hey!

192
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,832
-What?
-Seriously?

193
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,709
It doesn't mean that.

194
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,587
She's talking about marriage.

195
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,257
-I see!
-For crying out loud.

196
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,509
LET MY SON FORGET THAT MEMORY
LET ME RECONCILE WITH HIM

197
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,761
You're showing off
on a whole new level now.

198
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,263
You wrote it in French?

199
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,265
It just happened by chance.

200
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,558
And it comes more naturally.

201
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,600
Yeah, right.

202
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,060
She doesn't want us to read it.

203
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,937
It's not that.

204
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,941
But all of our wishes are
for our husbands and children.

205
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,234
What else can we do?

206
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,946
These scoundrels need to do well
for us to be at peace.

207
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,614
You're right.

208
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,032
These scoundrels.

209
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,617
Return to your original state!

210
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,577
Move out.

211
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,203
Pass the exam!

212
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,246
A productive human.

213
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,212
Professor!

214
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,547
Are you going to work?

215
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,883
-I'm coming home from work.
-You work so hard.

216
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,760
Do you want to eat something
before you go in?

217
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,429
Your wife's likely not home.

218
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,847
-What?
-The Suk Sisters…

219
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,557
Wait, they changed their name.

220
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,517
They're Lavender now.

221
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,645
Anyway, they went on
an overnight trip together.

222
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,355
They went to a temple.

223
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,190
But my wife's a Catholic.

224
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,067
-What?
-Nothing.

225
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,528
I'm a bit tired. I'll eat next time.

226
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,530
Okay, goodbye.

227
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,781
Wait!

228
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,742
Let's get another drink next time.

229
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,454
Sir, are you open?

230
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,663
Yes, of course!

231
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,540
-Okay.
-I'll see you next time.

232
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,584
-Places like this still exist?
-Come in!

233
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,543
Look at the sign.

234
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,920
Wow!

235
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,879
Record that.

236
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,052
-Here's your food.
-Okay. Thank you.

237
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,845
-Enjoy.
-Sir?

238
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,805
We're making a NerTube video. Can we film?

239
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,057
Film?

240
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,017
You've been filming since before.

241
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,728
The atmosphere here is just great.

242
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,482
Vintage and retro places like this
are all the rage these days.

243
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,733
Vintage?

244
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,403
Also, our channel has
100,000 subscribers.

245
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,988
It has 100,000 subscribers?

246
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:48,906
Yes.

247
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,951
Wow, you guys are incredible.

248
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,620
Please, film the food so it looks good!

249
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,788
Okay.

250
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,831
-I'll get you some more.
-No, it's okay!

251
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,124
We have to buy it all!

252
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,377
-Not sponsored?
-That's right.

253
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,836
Okay, I understand.

254
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,796
It can't be fake.

255
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,089
Let's make a thumbnail.

256
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,552
You and Tony know each other?
Why didn't you tell me?

257
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,555
I'm usually simple and modest.

258
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,475
I'm not the type
who mixes business with pleasure!

259
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,601
I knew it.

260
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:18,978
Hey.

261
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,437
Did you visit the site?

262
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,355
Yeah.

263
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,482
What are you doing? Why is she here?

264
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,942
I called her.

265
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,278
This is great.
I wanted to talk to you about something.

266
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,281
The thing is…

267
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,368
I wanted to ask Seok-ryu to join

268
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,412
the Greip flagship store project.

269
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,080
-Me?
-Yes.

270
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,291
Not now, but it'll start soon.

271
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,335
We got rid of the obstacles too.

272
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,045
How about working with us again?

273
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,214
Look over documents
and join our meetings.

274
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,299
-I'm against it.
-What?

275
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,844
We asked for her help
on the new building project.

276
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,054
Our agreement ended
after the presentation.

277
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,975
Asking her help
for the flagship store is unreasonable.

278
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,644
-You think so?
-Of course.

279
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,230
She has plans too.
We can't hold onto her forever.

280
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,566
It's not related with work either.

281
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:11,280
Also, I don't want to keep having her
involved with her former company.

282
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,491
Yeah. On second thought, you're right.

283
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,243
I was only thinking about us.

284
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,536
I'm really sorry.

285
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,747
You've helped us so much already.

286
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,790
No, it's fine.

287
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,378
It's too bad,
but I guess this is where we part ways.

288
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,173
Still, let's have a farewell party

289
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,383
and go somewhere nice for a meal.

290
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,302
-Sounds good!
-Is that okay?

291
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,219
Of course.

292
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,889
Should we invite Na-yun too?

293
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,140
Let's all go together.

294
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,976
Eat as much as you want today.

295
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,936
I'm paying!

296
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,480
It's the company card anyway.

297
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,482
What a sharp observation.
So sharp it hurts.

298
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,817
Na-yun, take a lot of pictures.

299
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,277
You rarely post these days.

300
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,236
Okay.

301
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,196
Thanks.

302
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,655
Seok-ryu, today's guest of honor.

303
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,656
Eat up!

304
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,949
Thank you.

305
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:56,867
You're welcome.

306
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,786
The next dish is salmon roe.

307
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,247
Wow, you don't see this often these days.

308
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,208
Koreans don't really like salmon roe.

309
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,876
Really? I like it.

310
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,253
Me too.

311
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,131
I like everything you like.

312
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,883
She's at it again.

313
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,385
Salmon is so interesting though.

314
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,930
They're born in rivers
and swim down to the ocean.

315
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,891
And they return to the river
to lay their eggs.

316
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,894
You mean their instinct
to return to their origins?

317
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,313
I heard they haven't discovered
why they do that.

318
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,024
Gosh, these animals are stuck in the past.

319
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,361
Right? They went out into the vast world.
Why go to the trouble to return?

320
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,696
What? Did they leave
their first love behind at home?

321
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,620
Why give it to me?
You said you liked it.

322
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,122
I don't like it anymore.

323
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,457
Really? Lucky me.

324
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,753
I'll eat these strong salmon
that swim upstream then.

325
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,172
I heard you like online novels, Na-yun.

326
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,924
Yeah, I don't hate them.

327
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,883
What do you read?

328
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,136
Can you recommend any good ones?

329
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,930
Themes of returning to the past
are popular these days.

330
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,142
The protagonist deeply regrets something

331
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,060
and goes back to the past to fix it.

332
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,063
Don't read those.
Why read something so pointless?

333
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,400
People should live
with their eyes on the future.

334
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,776
Why go back to the past?

335
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,196
It's all in the past.
Just forget it, okay?

336
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,407
Live a new and fresh life.

337
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,079
When's the next dish?

338
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,330
It's coming right now.

339
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,125
You totally ruined the mood.

340
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,628
It's okay.

341
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,380
What's that?

342
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,756
It's sea bream sushi.

343
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,721
Where's that kid today?

344
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,514
I wanted to ask what her name was today.

345
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,487
You should be wary of other people's eyes.

346
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,447
What?

347
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,782
You're showing off
your behind a bit too much.

348
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,659
I'm so sorry.

349
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,453
I was looking for something.

350
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,704
Did you lose something?

351
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,749
No, it's not that.
I'm looking for a four-leaf clover.

352
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,875
What?

353
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,129
Why are you looking
for such an old-fashioned thing?

354
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,381
They even sell those online these days.

355
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,342
It's something classic
that transcends time.

356
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,968
It's the thought that counts.

357
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,136
Can you see thoughts?

358
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,639
You can be on your way.

359
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,807
I was on my way here, okay?

360
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,478
It's not like they're easy to find.

361
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,689
Is it for a girl?

362
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,607
Yes.

363
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,984
-I found one!
-What?

364
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,361
It's a normal clover.

365
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,786
I found it! I mean it this time!

366
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,375
There are one, two, three, four leaves.

367
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,417
Holy cow.

368
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,337
Really? How did you find it?

369
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,173
Wow…

370
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,095
I concentrate well and have good eyesight.

371
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,850
You can have it.

372
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,519
I don't need it.

373
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,895
-Really?
-Yes.

374
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,938
Thank you.

375
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,690
Thank you! Bye!

376
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,607
Bye.

377
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,444
Make sure you laminate it first
before you give it!

378
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,031
Okay? Gosh, I wonder
if he'll even do it properly.

379
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,325
He's so weird.

380
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,246
How can you work right after you eat?

381
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,206
Here, drink this.

382
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,252
I said I was busy.
Why follow me here? Just go home.

383
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,587
I'm leaving after I drink this tea.

384
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,548
It sounds like you're kicking me out.

385
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,179
Hey, you really don't need me
for that project?

386
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,141
I mean, if you're doing it for me,

387
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,559
it's okay.

388
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,269
I can make some time for you.

389
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,062
Are you out of your mind?

390
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,648
-What?
-You said you'd find your dream.

391
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,234
You should be giving it your all,

392
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,194
but you're busy dawdling here and there.

393
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,487
No, it's just…

394
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,990
I'll take care of my own business.

395
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,825
Just focus on your own business.

396
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,287
Don't blame me down the road
when things don't work out.

397
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,371
Hey.

398
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,666
I was trying to be considerate.

399
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,587
-I want to help you--
-I don't need your help.

400
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,130
Fine.

401
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,632
Also, I've been trying hard too.

402
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,761
I think about what my dream
could be more than anyone.

403
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,137
I do it every day.

404
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,221
Really?

405
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,682
Then, don't just think about it and do it.

406
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,271
Hey!

407
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,648
Are you mad at me about something?

408
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,360
Are you venting? Are you holding a grudge?

409
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,572
Is it about losing
Greip's new building because of Chris?

410
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,825
What do you take me for?

411
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,835
Hey, honey. It's been a while.

412
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,095
How could you be so shameless
and come here?

413
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,430
Don't you feel bad about seeing Seung-hyo?

414
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,556
Not at all.

415
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,642
Is it awkward for you to see me?

416
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,561
It's not comfortable.

417
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,563
It's better if things are uncomfortable.

418
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,481
Jang Tae-hui!

419
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,110
You dumped him for another guy.
Don't play games!

420
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,112
That's a bit harsh.

421
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,115
What will you do if I'm here as a client?

422
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,620
Do you have a request?

423
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,581
I do have a request.

424
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,500
May I ask

425
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,919
why someone of your stature
would pay a visit

426
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,546
to our humble office?

427
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,590
Try to maintain some dignity.

428
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,758
Does dignity pay the bills?

429
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,969
Don't worry about him. Please, go ahead.

430
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,348
Have you two heard of Fresco?

431
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,016
It's an international home decor brand.

432
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,271
Don't they make bowls, kitchen utensils,
pots, and electronic appliances?

433
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,188
That's right.

434
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,523
Fresco collaborates

435
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,484
with world-renowned artists every year
and releases new products.

436
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,569
They're limited editions.

437
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,405
I know.
Dali once collaborated with them too.

438
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,366
I was offered to be part of the project.

439
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,910
What? It has nothing to do with us.

440
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,538
Did you come here to brag
about being a master of onggi?

441
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,749
I'm planning to design
a coffee pot with an onggi concept.

442
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,002
To preserve the structural beauty,

443
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,087
I thought working
with an architect would be good.

444
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,589
That's when I thought of you.

445
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,717
What? And you want to take him from me?

446
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,844
Dream on. He's very busy!

447
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,971
Myeong-u, I didn't get you
a wedding gift, right?

448
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,931
It's late, but I'll give you a bowl.

449
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,684
A bowl? Like the ones on the news
worth several million won?

450
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,227
-Yeah.
-You can borrow him.

451
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,062
Use him and return him in good condition.

452
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,400
Borrow? What am I, some kind of object?

453
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,651
No, you're a genius.

454
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,321
You can't miss your chance
to be on par with Dali.

455
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,655
We're done talking. Bye.

456
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,574
Wait. Where are you going?

457
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,868
I have to tell Hye-ran
we're getting a bowl.

458
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,712
What are they,
filming Architecture 101 in there?

459
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,423
Why would his ex-girlfriend
come to the office?

460
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,010
Do you know about that woman?

461
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,428
Her name's Jang Tae-hui.

462
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:17,224
She's a year older, she studied art,
and they met in college.

463
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,850
They dated for over a year.

464
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,937
Come on. I already knew that.

465
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,065
What else? Do you know anything more?

466
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,987
-They had a passionate relationship.
-Passionate?

467
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,822
It was burning hot.

468
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,872
What's this?

469
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,832
Who parked in front of our house?

470
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,340
Wow. Korea's loosened up a lot
since I've been gone.

471
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,050
It's totally liberated now.

472
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:58,890
Excuse me? It's great that you're in love,
but there's a time and a place for this.

473
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,142
You're right in front of my house.

474
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,062
Excuse me.

475
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,861
Mom, the store was out
of your favorite ice creams.

476
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,822
Who was that?

477
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,073
What?

478
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,202
We looked that passionate?

479
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,621
-Seriously, Seok-ryu?
-Sorry.

480
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,082
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

481
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,084
That's okay.

482
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,669
It was a good memory.

483
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,880
I offer my apologies once more.

484
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,299
I accept.

485
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,842
Did you say your name was Seok-ryu?

486
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,468
Yes, that's right.

487
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,053
It's nice to meet you.

488
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,098
He's told me so much about you.
It's like I know you.

489
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,309
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

490
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,938
But didn't you live in the US?

491
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,940
I just moved back recently.

492
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,608
I see.

493
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,194
That's great. Can you help me?

494
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,572
What? With what?

495
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,241
I received a great opportunity
and made a proposal,

496
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,745
but he won't take it.

497
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:05,373
-Can't you convince him as his friend?
-Stop doing as you please.

498
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,709
That's my charm. Did you forget?

499
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,045
You need time to think?

500
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,588
Yeah.

501
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,591
Then, how about coming to my studio?

502
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,426
Take a look and decide.

503
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,054
Really? Are you free this weekend?

504
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,555
Of course.

505
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,391
Bring all of your employees then.

506
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,477
There are plenty of rooms.

507
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,688
Seung-hyo, we'll hold
a company workshop this weekend. Nice!

508
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,399
We're not going. We're busy.

509
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,778
You can't live life
occupied by work all the time.

510
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,614
You should give yourself
time to rest too. Right?

511
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,783
You think I don't know what you're up to?

512
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,868
You're trying to escape
from watching the kids.

513
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,329
They don't sleep.
Help me out this one time.

514
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,206
-Everyone has to come then.
-Okay, thanks.

515
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,627
-You should come too.
-No.

516
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,671
I can't even manage
my own affairs right now.

517
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,216
Also, this is for the employees.

518
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,385
An outsider like me shouldn't join.

519
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,102
That's too bad. It would've been fun.

520
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,030
It was great seeing you.
It made my heart race.

521
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,916
Mr. Bae?

522
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,168
Hey, Seung-hyo.

523
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,928
Didn't you quit smoking last year?
Is something wrong?

524
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,764
No, it's nothing.

525
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,892
I guess I was feeling restless
without my wife here.

526
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,979
Hey.

527
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,564
-Are you going to rat me out?
-Maybe.

528
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,150
I didn't see you actually smoke it.

529
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,693
Wow…

530
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,363
My wife raised you properly.

531
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,785
Do you want a drink?

532
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,457
Just one drink. Sure.

533
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,628
-I'll pour it.
-Okay.

534
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,561
Hey, Dong-jin. Wake up!

535
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,937
Wake up!

536
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,942
Hey, punk.

537
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,695
You should wake up
as soon as the sun rises.

538
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,491
Why are you putting me to work?
Do I have to wake you up myself?

539
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,076
I gave you a chance.

540
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,666
Mom said I could beat you up
if you didn't wake up!

541
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,584
Get up!

542
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,628
I said get up!

543
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,589
That's enough!

544
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,808
What? What are you doing here?

545
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,520
Dad! They're doing something weird!

546
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,022
-Dad!
-Hey! No!

547
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,816
Dong-jin, it's not what you think!

548
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,735
Hey, it's a misunderstanding!

549
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,750
You sprained your toe.

550
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,920
That means it's not broken, right?

551
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,548
That's right. He slightly tore a ligament.

552
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,509
That's not possible. I can't move my foot.

553
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,095
I don't know.
It really shouldn't hurt that much.

554
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,221
Mr. Choi.

555
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,973
He's a bit of a crybaby.

556
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,558
You must've forgotten,

557
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,643
but my leg has been through trauma.

558
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,145
That again?
Are you going to milk that forever?

559
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,397
Milking…

560
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,606
You're being harsh.

561
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,026
Goodness, I am so sorry.

562
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,488
But is your toe the same as your leg?

563
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,409
Hey, toes are a part of the leg.

564
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,410
It's all one limb.

565
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,288
Yeah, I see.

566
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,165
So that means your toenail
is a part of your leg too.

567
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,085
How's Seung-hyo? Is he okay?

568
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,881
Yeah, he needs a cast for a week
and medication for three days.

569
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,173
That's good.

570
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,718
Why did you beat him up like that?

571
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,928
He didn't get hurt from that!

572
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,681
He tripped over his own feet and fell.

573
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,224
He fell because you hit him.

574
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,727
Let's check it again
if it still hurts in a week.

575
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,145
Okay.

576
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,190
How did this happen though?

577
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,652
Well…

578
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,157
I wanted to pay, but I forgot my wallet.

579
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,785
You can treat me next time.

580
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,954
Okay, where are we going now?

581
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,790
-Where's round two? Your house?
-Round two?

582
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,958
How about my house?

583
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,085
No, Mrs. Na would kill us.

584
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,590
Hey! Listen, you brat!
I'm the man of the house!

585
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,133
My wife's not home right now.

586
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,095
Right, she's not home.
My mom's not here either.

587
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,348
She's not home!

588
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,059
Wow! She's not home! I love it!

589
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,938
I'm free! I'm a free man!

590
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,230
Eat this.

591
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,357
Hey.

592
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,737
We'll have drinks at my house,
and you can sleep in Dong-jin's room.

593
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,489
-Okay? Not Seok-ryu's room.
-Okay.

594
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,658
-Sleep in Dong-jin's room. Got it?
-Okay.

595
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,575
Okay.

596
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,288
We'll go to my house, and I'll take out

597
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:42,293
my wild ginseng wine for you.

598
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,420
Come on, wild ginseng wine?

599
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,881
You sure it's not regular or red ginseng?

600
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,094
Hey! It's real wild ginseng wine!

601
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,887
It's the real deal, okay?

602
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,348
Then…

603
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,519
-Sound good? Let's go to my house!
-Yeah.

604
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,813
Let's go to Seok-ryu's house!

605
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,399
You're just like your mom.
You're so violent.

606
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,067
Let go.

607
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,739
Don't drink with him.

608
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,534
He has terrible habits when he's drunk.

609
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,998
-I'm sorry. I should be driving you home.
-It's fine.

610
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,751
-But I have to go to my workshop.
-Forget it. I can take the bus.

611
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,919
Are you really okay?

612
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,796
-I'm fine.
-Okay.

613
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,755
Hey, let's go.

614
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,092
I have plans. Go ahead, Dad.

615
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,301
All of a sudden?

616
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,972
I guess I'm going alone.
Don't come home so late.

617
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,683
-It's scary at night.
-Okay.

618
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,600
What a nag.

619
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,144
-Bye.
-Take care, sir.

620
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,311
Bye, Dad.

621
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,986
Hey. What are you doing?

622
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,571
Why act so surprised?

623
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,281
I drove your car here.

624
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,283
-So what?
-I mean…

625
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,995
I may not have directly caused
your injury,

626
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,330
but I do bear
some indirect responsibility.

627
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,624
I'll take care of you
until your cast comes off.

628
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,126
Why would you do that?

629
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,504
-Give me the keys.
-You want them?

630
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,966
Sure, drive yourself then.

631
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,884
Here.

632
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,642
Hey, Seok-ryu?

633
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,771
Yeah?

634
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,316
What?

635
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,901
This…

636
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,903
What do you want?

637
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,407
It's Saturday. Where are you going?

638
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,743
The convenience store.
Then, I'm off to work.

639
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,662
I've already stopped by,
and I'm on my way to cover a story.

640
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,290
Wow, I didn't ask. Good luck.

641
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,667
Ms. Paramedic, wait.

642
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,212
You'll be looking for this.

643
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,801
It's for helping me find
the four-leaf clover.

644
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,846
But aren't these yours?

645
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,807
I bought two.

646
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,435
If that's the case, thank you.

647
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,730
But did that person
like the four-leaf clover?

648
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,565
No, she didn't.

649
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,361
I said I tried hard
and another woman helped me find it--

650
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,278
What?

651
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,447
Why would you tell her that?

652
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,200
"I searched on my own for a long time."

653
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,660
You should've said that.

654
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,078
I can't lie.

655
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,622
I'll get going now.

656
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,333
Why…

657
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,382
Gosh, he knows nothing about women at all.

658
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,556
Mr. Kang, let's take a short break.
What do you say?

659
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,807
We can't.

660
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,226
We volunteered
so that elderly lady could rest.

661
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,936
We have to pick up as many as we can.

662
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:50,398
Hey, you asked me for help
to write a special feature.

663
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,692
This is no way
to treat your older colleague.

664
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,987
Now that you're out in the field
after being stuck at your desk,

665
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,864
doesn't it feel like you're alive?

666
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,867
I'm on the verge of death, you punk!

667
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,621
I'm disappointed.
You weren't like this in the past.

668
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,916
Hey, are you getting revenge
for what I said to you before?

669
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,418
Of course not.

670
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,712
Okay, boosters on!

671
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,922
Hey, slow down!

672
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,217
I can't do this! Jeez!

673
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,344
-Hey!
-Are you going to help or not?

674
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,149
Why are you scared?

675
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:37,028
Look, I was the best driver in the US.

676
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,198
Hey, don't turn your head. Watch the road.

677
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,200
And stick to the speed limit.

678
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,537
Stop pressing random buttons.

679
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,583
Don't touch anything.

680
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,048
Hey! Come on.

681
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,719
The breeze, music, and relaxation.
Isn't this just perfect?

682
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,472
-Hey!
-This is nice.

683
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:09,477
Sir, just enjoy the relaxing ride. Okay?

684
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,129
Relaxing, my foot.

685
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,965
Who drives like that?

686
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,259
Hey!

687
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,301
Hi.

688
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,387
What happened to your foot?

689
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,055
Ask her.

690
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,016
Hello. He got hurt a little.

691
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,686
Not a lot though.
He'll need two weeks to recover.

692
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,438
So I had no choice but to come too.

693
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,482
I see.

694
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,858
I'm glad you're here.

695
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,152
Myeong-u's going to be late.
Did you get his call?

696
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,279
No.

697
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,115
When did all these calls come in?

698
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,909
He has an upset stomach.
I think it's pretty bad.

699
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,120
Jeez, what did he eat this time?

700
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,497
Let's go inside.

701
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,335
What? I can't help you walk?

702
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,712
No, it's fine.

703
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,507
-Come on.
-Sure.

704
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,434
Wow.

705
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,645
Wow!

706
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,982
Did you make all of those, Tae-hui?

707
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,154
Is it okay if I call you that?

708
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,655
Of course.

709
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,867
Tae-hui, can I go see them up close?

710
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,826
Sure.

711
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,251
She's cute. She's like a puppy.

712
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,881
If you're talking about Seok-ryu,
that's not the right description.

713
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:02,965
Why not?

714
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,052
Are you jealous
because I called someone else cute?

715
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,595
There you go again.

716
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,558
-Seok-ryu.
-Yes?

717
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,019
Don't you want to know
what's inside those jars?

718
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,354
I do!

719
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,565
It's meju.

720
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,400
There are so many of them!

721
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,902
Wait, why do you have these?

722
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,363
Don't you make onggi?

723
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,572
I do.

724
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,242
I make sauces and pastes too.

725
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,160
What?

726
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,247
My dad's an expert in food.
He's a doenjang master.

727
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,457
Did you forget?

728
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,834
Yeah, that's right. Sorry.

729
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,879
So does he make it here?

730
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,256
No, he lives in Gangwon Province.

731
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,092
I'm just in charge of this place.

732
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,552
To make good bowls,

733
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:52,223
I had to learn about the essence
of what went inside them first.

734
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:56,143
I can sell more onggi if the process
of making sauces and pastes flourishes.

735
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,937
It's all part of my big plan.

736
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,022
Do you make the sauces
and pastes yourself?

737
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,441
Yes, with the other ladies
in the neighborhood.

738
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,151
Today happens to be the day for it.

739
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,238
And I need a few helping hands.

740
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,990
Was this your plan all along?

741
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,410
I just wanted to kill
two birds with one stone.

742
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,786
You know I'm greedy.

743
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,788
Still, you can't spring this on us.

744
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,789
I can't help.

745
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,291
I don't think
you could've helped anyway with your foot.

746
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,127
It's not just me. We all can't.

747
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,879
Me! I want to help.

748
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,215
I'll do it! I want to try
and make doenjang!

749
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,174
What?

750
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,843
Why not? I want to do it!

751
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,845
Nice!

752
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,805
This is going to be fun!

753
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,248
-How's the work?
-Good.

754
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,708
It's so interesting!

755
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,751
Hey, young man.

756
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,795
-Yes?
-Come and help me.

757
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,548
-Open this.
-Okay.

758
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,091
Take out the charcoal.

759
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,343
Use that and wipe the inside clean.

760
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,428
Yes, ma'am.

761
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,224
Wow…

762
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,565
Thank you.

763
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,953
I have a question.

764
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,915
What are these marks on the meju?

765
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,750
They're from being tied with straw.

766
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,794
They were hung from the ceiling.

767
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,547
I see. So that's why.

768
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,008
What will we do next?

769
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,718
What do you think?

770
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,971
We have to put the doenjang
in the onggis we sterilized earlier.

771
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,681
How do we do that?

772
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,310
You're just full of curiosity, aren't you?

773
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,604
That's just how I am.

774
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,398
Why are you in such a hurry?
Take your time to learn.

775
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,775
Yes, ma'am.

776
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,945
She's having a blast.
The time of her life.

777
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,449
Can we talk for a second?

778
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,035
Right now?

779
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:18,994
Yeah.

780
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,454
There's something you need to do.

781
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,003
What do you need my help with?

782
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,508
Just stay here with me for a moment.

783
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,845
-Is this why you called me away?
-Yeah.

784
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,723
What? You liked it
when I used to do this.

785
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,559
That was then.

786
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,770
Did you date anyone else after me?

787
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,689
Of course. We broke up a long time ago.

788
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,649
True.

789
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,777
You let people in,
but you also let people out.

790
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,405
We started dating because I asked you out.

791
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,365
If that's how you feel, I'm a little hurt.

792
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,744
I liked you a lot.

793
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,037
Me too.

794
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,040
And I've missed you.

795
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,837
Didn't you come back
just to collaborate on work?

796
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,924
I was genuine
about wanting to work with you.

797
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,345
But using that as an excuse
to see you is also genuine.

798
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,557
I was hoping for serendipity

799
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,476
and that our reunion
could be an opportunity.

800
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,520
It's true.

801
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,442
But work comes first.

802
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,945
This is my collection
that was exhibited in Vienna.

803
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,534
It's nice.

804
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,370
The curves look like columns with entasis.

805
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,457
As expected from an architect.

806
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,085
Want to try making one yourself?

807
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,932
By the way,
what are the cloth and strainer for?

808
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,853
This will keep debris from getting inside.

809
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,980
We're almost done.

810
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,777
You came all the way from Seoul
and had to do so much work.

811
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,488
No, I'm having so much fun.

812
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,242
You can speak in our dialect pretty well.

813
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,494
I do?

814
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,914
By the way, where's the bathroom?

815
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,831
I have to go.

816
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,333
It's over there.

817
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,085
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

818
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,286
Your hands should go like this.

819
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,430
You'll ruin it.

820
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:29,435
I was just looking for the bathroom.

821
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,270
It's at the end of the hall.

822
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:34,648
Okay. I'll go now since nature's calling.

823
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,108
I'm sorry I interrupted.

824
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,701
Damn it.

825
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,089
Hey, sorry about that.

826
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,675
I didn't mean to
cluelessly run into the chair.

827
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,135
What are you talking about?

828
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,805
You two look good together.
It was like a scene from Ghost.

829
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,517
Haven't you heard of it?
Demi Moore's in it.

830
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,604
There's a scene in the movie
with really romantic music.

831
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,230
As she makes pottery, he comes up and…

832
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,107
What are you trying to say?

833
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,360
I'm just saying
I hope things work out for you two.

834
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,865
You never know.

835
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,784
Old feelings could resurface
now that you've met again.

836
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,289
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

837
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,457
I'm warning you.

838
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,461
-Don't meddle in other people's affairs.
-No, I meant…

839
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,630
I only meant it if you still liked her.

840
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:43,926
-Also, friends can talk about this stuff.
-No, we can't.

841
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,806
Jeez, that little…

842
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,275
-Mr. Choi!
-Mr. Choi!

843
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,818
Seung-hyo!

844
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,862
Seung-hyo, what's wrong with your leg?

845
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,906
I just bumped into something.

846
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,324
Are you okay?

847
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,786
Seung-hyo, I had such a hard time.
I was in danger multiple times.

848
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,121
We stopped at every rest area
on our way here.

849
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,790
I told you to wear a diaper.

850
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,626
Not putting it on
was my last bit of pride.

851
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,670
It must've been tough. Go on in.

852
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,255
Where are you going? Your leg's hurt.

853
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,048
I need to get some air.

854
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,550
What?

855
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,013
I'm going inside.

856
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,687
Tae-hui! We're here… What?

857
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,480
-You're late.
-Hello!

858
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,566
Yeah, but what's all of this?

859
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,818
You said you couldn't make it, Seok-ryu!

860
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,319
It just sort of happened.

861
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:48,490
Is this a folk village? Is this where you
participate in traditional tasks?

862
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,908
Kind of.

863
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,244
Ma'am, more workers have arrived.

864
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,038
Should we check the pastes
we fermented last time?

865
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,748
Sounds good.

866
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,250
Do what?

867
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,626
So what happens is

868
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,630
they take out the meju and use them
to make doenjang and soy sauce.

869
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,048
-Sounds fun, right?
-I see.

870
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,052
-You'll help, right?
-Yeah.

871
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,555
Is she insane?

872
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,766
That punk, Seung-hyo.
That's why he acted serious and ran away.

873
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,560
-Seok-ryu?
-Yes?

874
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,728
Where's the bathroom?

875
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,647
-Go around that way.
-Okay.

876
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,858
-Go inside the building.
-Okay!

877
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,960
I left my wallet.

878
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,589
Are you okay now? Have you…

879
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,841
completely moved on from him?

880
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:48,884
No.

881
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,802
I still love him.

882
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,443
Gosh, I left my wallet.

883
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:07,861
I had to come all the way back.

884
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,864
Hey, you're all okay with beer, right?

885
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,449
No, I want soju tonight.

886
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,909
I want to get drunk.

887
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,203
-Okay. Got it.
-I want non-alcoholic beer.

888
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,871
-And juice.
-What?

889
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,581
Why?

890
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,210
No, you're right. Don't get drunk tonight.

891
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,211
That'll be safer.

892
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,588
Don't eat until I get back. Wait for me.

893
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,090
Don't you dare lay a finger.

894
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,191
Great job, everyone.

895
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,651
Great job.

896
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,112
What time is it?

897
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,656
It's past 3:00 p.m.
We haven't even had lunch yet.

898
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,117
-Should we order something?
-How about Chinese?

899
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,495
Okay, then let's all have fried rice.

900
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,830
I put the order in.

901
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,836
This is why we can't order any noodles.

902
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,838
Let's go.

903
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,354
What is it?

904
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,814
Nothing.

905
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,570
We're emergency responders.
Is anyone home?

906
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,197
We're coming in.

907
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,287
Is anyone home?

908
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,498
We're paramedics.

909
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,583
What?

910
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,044
Hey, kid!

911
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,629
Hey, wake up!

912
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,339
Hey, kid!

913
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,718
Hey.

914
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,224
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

915
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,477
Do you recognize me?

916
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,441
It hurts.

917
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:14,821
I called for help.

918
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,698
Good job. You did great.

919
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,159
Great job, kid.

920
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,996
I'm not a kid.

921
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,123
Yeon-du.

922
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,667
My name…

923
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,712
is Yeon-du.

924
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,006
Okay, Yeon-du. Good job.

925
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,717
I'll make you feel better real quick.
Just wait.

926
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,469
Thank you.

927
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,054
Do you know her?

928
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,680
Where's her guardian?

929
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,350
Was she home alone?

930
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,487
Yeon-du, wake up.

931
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,404
Yeon-du!

932
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,490
Stay with me, Yeon-du!

933
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,669
Excuse me.
Could someone give me a hand?

934
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,628
I'll help!

935
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,714
What is it?

936
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,760
Well, I think too much sunlight
has dried out the paste.

937
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,512
I want to move it to the studio.

938
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,223
-I'll move it.
-No way.

939
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,016
The jar weighs over 30 kilograms.

940
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,727
-I'll ask the men to do it.
-No, I'm really strong!

941
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,313
-Leave it to me.
-No… Myeong-u?

942
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:32,649
-Then…
-No, I'll do it.

943
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,944
-I'll hold down the fort here.
-He's busy. I'll go.

944
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,071
-We'll be back.
-Don't hurt yourself.

945
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,703
This is too difficult for us.

946
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,872
Let's leave it here and call someone.

947
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,374
We're almost there. I'll do it. It's okay.

948
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,917
No, it's too hard.

949
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,210
I'll get someone.

950
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,504
I can do it on my own.

951
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,557
-Seok-ryu!
-Bae Seok-ryu!

952
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,268
Seok-ryu.

953
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,769
Are you hurt?

954
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,648
-My gosh, the jar and paste!
-Are you okay?

955
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,276
Who cares about me? What about this?

956
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,736
This took so much effort to make!

957
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:18,987
That's not important.

958
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,989
Why can't you be more careful?

959
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,491
Why get involved when you can't even
take care of yourself?

960
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,993
It's not like that.

961
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,578
She was trying to help me.

962
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,038
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

963
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,915
Don't touch it. Don't cause trouble again.

964
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,334
That's enough.

965
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,919
She's already startled.

966
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,796
Seok-ryu, I have extra clothes in my room.

967
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:38,673
-Go and change.
-Okay.

968
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,967
The stain won't come out if it sets.

969
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,865
That jerk.

970
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,826
How could he get so angry at me?
That was so embarrassing.

971
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,471
This is my home.

972
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,264
This is how I live.

973
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,891
You're here as guests,

974
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,143
but I'm afraid I can't ask you to come in.

975
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,269
It's too small here.

976
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,147
There's no place to sit.

977
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,692
That's okay. Our legs are strong.

978
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,779
Yes, we're just grateful
to have been invited.

979
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,323
I'm the grateful one.

980
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,575
Reporters like you

981
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,537
came all this way to see someone
as insignificant as me.

982
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,540
And that cart too.

983
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,710
Can I really accept that for free?

984
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,545
I bet it was expensive.

985
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,839
Don't worry.

986
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,217
I processed the expenses
at my manager's discretion.

987
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,760
Stop it.

988
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:10,056
Ma'am, always be careful
of the roads. Okay?

989
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,559
Okay, thank you.

990
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,688
The world has become harsh and unsettling.

991
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,566
But there are still good people.

992
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,111
-Take care of yourself.
-Okay.

993
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,363
Thank you for your hard work.

994
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,285
Hello?

995
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:33,913
What?

996
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,498
Yeon-du?

997
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,417
-Dan-ho!
-What did you mean?

998
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,793
Yeon-du's gone?

999
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:42,338
Yeon-du had a cold.

1000
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,841
She was asleep after taking medicine
for her fever at lunch.

1001
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,552
I left for a second
to buy groceries and…

1002
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,095
So where is she?

1003
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,556
I was surprised too.
I asked everyone in the neighborhood.

1004
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,309
They said the paramedics came.

1005
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,737
Go slow.

1006
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,702
The patient's a five-year-old girl.

1007
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,871
Her BP's 100 over 70,
and her heart rate's 120.

1008
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,999
She has a fever of 39.6 degrees.
Oxygen saturation is 99%.

1009
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,710
She was conscious and responsive
when we arrived,

1010
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,712
but she began to decline
and lost consciousness.

1011
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,172
Pre-existing conditions or meds?

1012
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,716
Her guardian's not here,
so we couldn't check.

1013
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,094
Let's give her IV fluids and run tests.

1014
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,428
Okay.

1015
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,271
Just a moment.

1016
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,656
Is there a patient here
named Kang Yeon-du?

1017
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,449
She's a five-year-old girl!

1018
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,951
She's over there.

1019
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,290
Yeon-du.

1020
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,502
Yeon-du, it's Daddy.

1021
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,129
Yeon-du, open your eyes.

1022
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,633
Yeon-du, Daddy's here.

1023
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,009
Yeon-du, open your eyes.

1024
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,887
Sir, can you step back for a moment?
We need to insert the IV.

1025
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,180
Okay.

1026
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,230
Yeon-du.

1027
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,899
Are you okay? Are you awake?

1028
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,527
Where are we? Who am I?

1029
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,112
The hospital.

1030
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,157
Daddy.

1031
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,326
Yeah, it's me.

1032
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,079
I'm here now. It's okay.

1033
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:39,998
Nothing's going to happen.

1034
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,343
Goodness.

1035
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,971
Hey.

1036
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,183
Those clothes look better on you than me.

1037
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,185
Thanks for lending them to me.

1038
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,104
That was a big mess you made.

1039
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,856
That's okay. It happens.

1040
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,900
I'm sorry. I came and just caused trouble.

1041
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,943
Don't worry about it. It's no big deal.

1042
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,278
We can just throw it away.

1043
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,448
No, we can't!
It'd be such a waste to throw away.

1044
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,825
Maybe if I had no idea,

1045
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:19,871
but now I know just how much time
and effort went into making this.

1046
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,706
How can we throw this away?

1047
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,126
Then, how about we eat the parts
not covered in dirt?

1048
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,755
We're not bums.
Why would we eat something off the ground?

1049
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,424
Okay! I'll see what I can do.

1050
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,676
We have to have a barbecue.
There's plenty of charcoal.

1051
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,053
You said your stomach hurt.

1052
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:38,556
It's meat. That's a cure-all.

1053
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,183
Did you hear that?

1054
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,685
See? The sky is angry.
It wants us to cook meat!

1055
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,604
I think it's going to rain.

1056
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,314
-On rainy days…
-Meat!

1057
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,066
We should have kalguksu!

1058
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,402
-Spicy kalguksu!
-What?

1059
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,211
-Mr. Yoon?
-Yeah?

1060
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,004
Prepare to be summoned.

1061
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,550
I'm going to report you
to the Ministry of Labor when we get back.

1062
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:17,220
Don't be so harsh.
I'm a victim too.

1063
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,763
Whatever.

1064
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,558
I can't do this. My hands hurt.

1065
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,850
Na-yun.

1066
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,188
Pretend the dough is someone you hate.

1067
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,481
It relieves your stress.

1068
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,942
And the dough gets chewy.
It kills two birds with one stone.

1069
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,408
One for Bae Seok-ryu?

1070
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,535
One for Jang Tae-hui?

1071
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,621
Yoon Myeong-u. One, two, three, four…

1072
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,708
Goodness. You're tearing it apart.

1073
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,043
Just kill me. That would be better.

1074
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,087
That's enough of your kitty punches.

1075
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,047
Goodness.

1076
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,479
So does it taste all right?

1077
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,857
It's not just all right.

1078
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,400
It's really good. Right?

1079
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,069
The broth is especially insane.

1080
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,195
Really?

1081
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,323
Mr. Yoon, do you like it too?

1082
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,574
Seok-ryu.

1083
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,077
We don't need meat.
Doenjang was the answer.

1084
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,580
It's so warm and soothing.

1085
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:30,293
I tip my hat to the making
of Korean pastes and sauces.

1086
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:33,463
You wished for doenjang to disappear
when you were preparing it.

1087
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:39,469
But where did Seung-hyo go?
He's missing dinner.

1088
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,055
I don't know.
I called, but he didn't pick up.

1089
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,308
Just leave him.
He'll come back when he gets hungry.

1090
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,978
You've been so focused on us
that you haven't been able to eat.

1091
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,355
-You worked so hard on this.
-No.

1092
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,397
I'm eating fine.

1093
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,608
Na-yun.

1094
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,693
Do you want some more?

1095
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,738
Flour's fattening though.

1096
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,740
Just a little more.

1097
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,158
Okay. Here.

1098
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,118
-Can I have some more too?
-Hey.

1099
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,371
-Me too.
-Jeez. Then, me too.

1100
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,874
I'll bring the pot. Wait here.

1101
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,462
If it's good, then it's fine!

1102
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,799
-Give it here. I'll take it.
-No, that's okay.

1103
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,927
This looks good. Wow!

1104
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,274
Seok-ryu!

1105
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,485
I'll do it. You can stop now.

1106
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,405
We can't have the cook
clean the dishes too.

1107
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,408
I lost in rock, paper, scissors
fair and square.

1108
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:46,202
And I broke your jar.
I should make up for that.

1109
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,122
You're right.

1110
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,375
But will that be enough?

1111
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:56,129
A single onggi of mine
costs more than a million won.

1112
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:58,673
So close.

1113
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,967
I could've used you for another day.

1114
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,595
Send me your bank account number.
I'll reimburse you.

1115
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,222
Send me yours too.

1116
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,808
-Your recipe.
-What?

1117
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,936
For the spicy kalguksu.
Let's call it even with that.

1118
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,439
I haven't had noodles
that good in so long.

1119
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:17,233
It's really easy to make.

1120
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,444
You saw the ingredients earlier.

1121
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,154
The seasoning is important.

1122
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,573
It's three parts gochujang,
one part doenjang.

1123
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,908
Three spoonfuls of gochujang
per spoonful of doenjang.

1124
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,077
How big is a spoonful?

1125
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,581
Is it this much?

1126
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:39,589
I see. You know nothing.

1127
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,633
We've got a long way to go.

1128
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,642
I was going to scold her parents
when they came.

1129
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,561
You're her father?

1130
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,105
I'm sorry.

1131
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,441
You don't have to apologize to me.

1132
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,402
You should apologize to Yeon-du.

1133
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,239
How could you leave a sick kid home alone?

1134
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,701
How could you let a five-year-old
call 119 on her own?

1135
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,663
I have no excuse.

1136
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,625
You said you were covering a story.

1137
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,084
Are you going to change the world?

1138
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,003
Are you saving the country?

1139
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,381
How can you accomplish anything
if you can't take care of your kid?

1140
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,385
Yeon-du

1141
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,262
was alone when I saw her last time.

1142
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,099
She had this in her hand
as she was alone again today.

1143
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,458
Yeon-du, are you okay? Does anything hurt?

1144
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,168
Hey, Yeon-du.

1145
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,920
Were you brave for your tests?

1146
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,338
Don't yell at my dad.

1147
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:03,881
What?

1148
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,968
I hate people who yell at my dad.

1149
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,178
Yeon-du, it's not like that.

1150
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,430
She didn't do anything wrong.

1151
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:15,101
From now on,
I'm going to ignore you when I see you.

1152
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,311
Don't ever talk to me again.

1153
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,295
Yeon-du, were you scared
on your own earlier?

1154
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,755
No.

1155
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,216
You taught me.

1156
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,470
Call 112 when I meet a bad person.

1157
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,348
Call 119 when I'm hurt.

1158
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,769
I'm sorry.

1159
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,107
Yeon-du,

1160
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,443
I'm so sorry.

1161
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,946
I'm sorry too.

1162
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,741
Why would you be sorry?

1163
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:16,412
I was looking for crop circles.

1164
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:21,417
But you brought me a four-leaf clover,
so I yelled at you. I'm sorry.

1165
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,633
It's okay.

1166
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,770
Did you make all of these too?

1167
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:42,563
Yeah.

1168
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,106
That's so cool.

1169
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,407
-I have a lot of scars, don't I?
-I'm sorry for being rude.

1170
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,618
What? Not at all.

1171
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,954
I'm proud of them. I wanted to show you.

1172
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,041
They're marks of my dream.

1173
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:09,590
When I look at them, they remind me
my passion for onggi was quite intense.

1174
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:10,967
I'm fond of them.

1175
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:15,054
Now, they're just like tattoos.

1176
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:24,188
When did you decide
that you wanted to make onggi?

1177
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:28,651
Remember how I said
my dad was a doenjang master?

1178
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,821
I grew up around these onggi jars.

1179
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:36,742
They looked so crude and ugly at first.

1180
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,619
I wanted to store pastes

1181
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,872
in something elegant,
like celadon or porcelain.

1182
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,210
But then, I slowly started to like onggi.

1183
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,506
Crocks, water jars, and liquor jars.

1184
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,843
Compared to decorative ceramics,

1185
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:56,846
practical bowls and jars used by people
looked more beautiful.

1186
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,225
That's why I started.
Pretty boring, right?

1187
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,268
No.

1188
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:07,440
To me, the stories of people who have
found their dreams always sound special.

1189
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,943
I have no idea where or how to start.

1190
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,822
What do you like?

1191
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,032
Sorry?

1192
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,075
It seems you're thinking about it
too seriously.

1193
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,329
Just go do what you've always liked doing,
whatever it may be.

1194
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,458
What I've always liked?

1195
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,837
When the food was being served,

1196
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,256
my bowls looked really pretty.

1197
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,313
There you are.

1198
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:51,692
Yeah, it's nice here.
The breeze feels cool too.

1199
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,278
You don't know what you're saying.

1200
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,781
It's hard to even stand here
when the fire's at its hottest.

1201
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,657
I suppose so.

1202
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,008
Do you remember when Seok-ryu said

1203
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,719
that we were passionate in the past?

1204
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,888
But we weren't.

1205
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,556
It was only me.

1206
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,936
My love was as hot as a burning kiln,

1207
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,063
but you were a low flame on a gas stove.

1208
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:34,235
It wasn't even hot enough
to cook an egg, let alone a bowl.

1209
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:39,031
Is that why you broke up with me?

1210
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:40,950
Yeah.

1211
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,328
I found a man
whose love burned hot.

1212
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,373
But do you know what's funny?

1213
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,333
I broke up with you,

1214
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,461
but it felt like you dumped me.

1215
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,879
That's not true.

1216
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,258
I took it hard too.

1217
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,843
I'm glad to hear that.

1218
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:05,099
I had always hoped
that you would seethe because of me.

1219
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,352
You'd lose your temper.

1220
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:11,021
You'd be foolish
since you couldn't control your emotions.

1221
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:15,985
After breaking up, you'd pathetically send
a text and ask, "Are you awake?"

1222
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,991
I almost texted you once. I was drunk.

1223
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,416
But earlier,

1224
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,585
you were so angry.

1225
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:36,463
You yelled at Seok-ryu
and embarrassed her.

1226
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,549
I've never seen you do that before.

1227
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,385
That's because she messed up.

1228
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,928
She didn't do anything wrong.

1229
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,223
To tell you the truth,

1230
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,684
that jar was cracked.

1231
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:53,647
I was going to move it
to the studio to repair it.

1232
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:57,359
I didn't want to be honest about it.

1233
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,446
I think…

1234
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:03,407
I was jealous.

1235
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,154
When did he take those?

1236
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,823
Why are you out here this late?

1237
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,534
I should ask you the same thing.

1238
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:11,910
I couldn't sleep, so I came out.

1239
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,787
I saw something white moving outside.

1240
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,165
That's because you didn't eat dinner.

1241
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,544
There's some dough left.
Do you want some kalguksu?

1242
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:22,755
Later.

1243
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:29,011
Hey, you got the stain out of my shirt.
What did you use?

1244
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,387
Rice and vinegar.

1245
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,602
How kind and thoughtful of you.

1246
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,608
But why do you keep opening those lids?

1247
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,818
I'm looking for treasure.

1248
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,656
I heard one of these has soy sauce
that's been aged for 100 years.

1249
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,617
Soy sauce?

1250
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:53,369
Why are you looking for that?

1251
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,120
I'm curious.

1252
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:59,333
I wonder what soy sauce looks like
after being aged for 100 years.

1253
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:04,254
Still, there are so many jars here.
It'll take ages to open them all.

1254
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,007
I'll open them, so mind your own business.

1255
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,349
How is this soy sauce
different from others?

1256
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:19,937
One of the old ladies
said it's darker and smells richer.

1257
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,522
It's still just soy sauce.

1258
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:25,317
How will you remember what you've opened
if you search randomly like this?

1259
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,236
You take that side. I'll look here.

1260
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:29,613
Why are you helping me?

1261
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,867
You're always trying
to bite my head off these days.

1262
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,204
-When did I do that?
-All the time.

1263
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,457
You pick fights with me and get irritable
for no reason.

1264
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,794
-You're always scolding me.
-Jeez. You're being ridiculous.

1265
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,881
You wait and see.

1266
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,884
This is gochujang.

1267
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,847
This one's doenjang. Darn.

1268
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:57,891
It's soy sauce.

1269
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,186
What? You found it already?

1270
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:12,948
Hey, it does look a little darker.

1271
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,616
It's amazing.

1272
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,118
What is?

1273
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:18,036
This jar…

1274
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:21,790
is filled with the night sky.

1275
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,626
It's so dark.

1276
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:26,628
It's sparkling.

1277
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:31,383
I thought you were looking for soy sauce.
What's with the poem?

1278
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,971
Spicy noodles. Wild chives and soy sauce.

1279
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,765
Pickled perilla leaves.

1280
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:42,019
Why are you suddenly talking about food?
Are you hungry?

1281
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:45,772
Hey, Choisseung.

1282
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,150
I think I found it.

1283
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,986
Yeah. This is the soy sauce, right?

1284
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:54,406
I mean, a dream doesn't have to be grand
or elaborate.

1285
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:59,703
I can't do anything impressive,
like how you swim the freestyle,

1286
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:04,291
but I think I can manage the dog paddle.

1287
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,128
I…

1288
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,672
want to cook.

1289
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:22,100
Hey, there are so many things
I want to make with this.

1290
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:26,230
I think I was jealous.

1291
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,942
When you're with Seok-ryu,

1292
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:33,070
you're not the person I used to know.

1293
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:36,323
You're irritable and not generous either.

1294
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,076
You're pathetic and immature.

1295
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,412
And you're always looking
in her direction.

1296
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,336
Do you know how you look
when you look at her?

1297
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,633
You're just full of curiosity, aren't you?

1298
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:55,842
That's just how I am.

1299
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,054
You smile.

1300
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,642
When Seok-ryu smiles,

1301
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,604
you just smile with her.

1302
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,858
I've never done it before,

1303
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:15,487
but if I made soy sauce marinated crabs
with this, it would be awesome, right?

1304
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,615
Should I ask her
for a taste of this tomorrow?

1305
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,953
Even the smallest difference
can make a big impact, you know?

1306
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,207
I've been running away from my feelings
for a long time.

1307
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:31,044
I've ignored and denied them.

1308
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,130
But…

1309
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,092
after seeing Seok-ryu smile so brightly
in front of me now, I realized.

1310
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:40,637
I…

1311
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:44,933
can't help but like her.

1312
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:07,623
GO BACK TO YOU

1313
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:45,577
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1314
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,537
I've known her for so long.

1315
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,998
I thought I knew everything about her.

1316
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,001
What if I became a cook like my dad?

1317
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:56,338
I thought I'd moved on
from my feelings for her.

1318
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,216
But I'm a bit confused
after seeing her again.

1319
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:02,135
I've never confessed
my feelings to her before.

1320
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,305
Men stay out late enough to see
the morning dew. That's a serious problem!

1321
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:08,350
I saw you. You were with some woman.

1322
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:10,769
Where did you go off gallivanting
after closing the shop?

1323
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,187
Are you having an affair?

1324
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,023
You've been distant lately towards me.

1325
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,527
I feel like I'm going to
lose my mind because of you!

1326
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:25,075
