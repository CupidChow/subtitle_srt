00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,209
I guess…

181
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,210
[door lock chimes]

182
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,212
[door closes]

183
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,631
…she'll be leaving again soon.

184
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,804
Was that a hit-and-run?

185
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,353
Can't you see the sign on my face?
It says, "Don't mess with me."

186
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,313
No, it says, "My face is very puffy."

187
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,773
I dare you to keep going.

188
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,317
-Where are you going?
-The library. Why?

189
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,735
Okay, bye.

190
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,236
What?

191
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,739
Aren't you curious as to why?

192
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,616
-You can ask me!
-[Seung-hyo] What for?

193
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,369
I'm going to do something amazing!
Do you want to see?

194
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,538
VOCATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIA

195
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,291
Self-exploration. Starting today,
I'm searching for my dream.

196
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,960
You're going to look for it in a book?

197
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,879
Studying came easily to me.

198
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,051
Hey, I read a little in advance.

199
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,221
How about a perfumer? It has a cool vibe.

200
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,224
No? Then…

201
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,935
A watch repairer!
With the attitude of a craftsman.

202
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,812
No? Then…

203
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,023
How about something unique,
like breeding stag beetles? Cool, right?

204
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,151
Or how about opening an antique store?

205
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,155
Hey, I saw a TV show once,
and chess players were so cool.

206
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,658
Just take that and disappear.

207
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,827
I know you're here for the free coffee.

208
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,831
Was I obvious?
Prices are so inflated these days.

209
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,793
The kitchen here is really nice.

210
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,963
It's for the employees,
but no one uses it.

211
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,756
Look at how shiny the stove is.

212
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,134
I know. This is brand new.

213
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,052
Hey, Seung-hyo!

214
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,138
[Seok-ryu] Hello.

215
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,598
Hey, pinch my cheeks.

216
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,142
No, that's inappropriate.

217
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,268
Don't be like that!

218
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,271
It's because I don't know
if I'm dreaming or not!

219
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,398
-[Seok-ryu] Want me to do it for you?
-No, don't!

220
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,399
Okay.

221
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,442
Hey, Seung-hyo.

222
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,862
Greip contacted us!

223
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,363
[exclaims excitedly]

224
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,243
Greip's building a new office in Seoul.

225
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,080
They want a draft proposal from us
and Hwawoon Architecture.

226
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,499
I get Hwawoon.
It's one of the five big firms.

227
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,084
But why newbies like us?

228
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,919
Do you know my friend Jin-kyu?

229
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,589
Yeah, he works
for an architecture firm in the US.

230
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah, that firm works a lot with Greip,

231
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,636
and they're in charge
of the project in Korea this time.

232
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,100
They're looking for a local firm
to collaborate with and he recommended us!

233
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,144
Really?

234
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:54,356
Yeah, Greip just sent me an email!

235
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,734
[exclaims excitedly]

236
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,322
[sighs]

237
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,158
I think my anxiety with English
is an incurable illness.

238
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,701
Can you read this, Seung-hyo?

239
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,704
-I can read it.
-We need to write a reply.

240
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,165
-Do we have to?
-What?

241
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,043
Are you just going to
leave them on read then?

242
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,711
You know a little English.

243
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,755
You went backpacking
in the US during college.

244
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,340
That was a long time ago.

245
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,675
My skills aren't business-level.

246
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,219
What do we do now?

247
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,221
Should we hire an interpreter?

248
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,974
Greip has global standards.

249
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,437
From ceiling height to lighting,
they should be applied to the design.

250
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,235
Greip has complicated procedures,
so there will be a lot of discussions.

251
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,071
Communication skills will be important.

252
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,198
Jennifer's the one who sent the email.

253
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,450
She's pretty meticulous.

254
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,618
Wait!

255
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,913
I heard you worked
for a company in the US.

256
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,872
Was that here?

257
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,083
-Yeah, it was Greip.
-[gasps]

258
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,000
Goodness.

259
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,296
Seok-ryu, if you have time,
can you save us?

260
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,881
-What?
-[Seok-ryu] How much?

261
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,592
How much would it cost to hire you
as a part-time employee?

262
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,178
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.
Cut it out.

263
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,639
I'm sorry. I'm a little busy.

264
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,058
There something I really need to find.

265
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,518
Yeah, she's looking for something.

266
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,686
It's urgent too.

267
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,188
Please.

268
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,691
Can't you do us this favor?
This is very important to us.

269
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,152
Myeong-u, I'll sign up
for English classes tomorrow.

270
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,405
-[in English] I can do it.
-Seung-hyo, shut up.

271
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,990
[in Korean] Yeah,
you're Seung-hyo's friend.

272
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,577
Why would you use me like that?
Don't worry about it.

273
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,744
-We'll find a way.
-Stop.

274
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,829
-I'll do it.
-What?

275
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,622
Seok-ryu.

276
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,790
I'll help you.

277
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,708
[gasps]

278
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,087

[quirky music playing]

280
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,638
-Are you snooping?
-You scared me!

281
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,974
I'm keeping an eye out
for potential scandals.

282
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,435
[gasps] Na-yun, don't tell me…

283
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,312
"Men and women can't be friends."

284
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,521
Are you that kind of person?

285
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,357
Millennials and Gen Z like you
can't think like that.

286
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,320
Mr. Yoon, to be clear,
you're a part of that generation too.

287
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,906
-What?
-You're a millennial.

288
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,783
You were born
between the early 1980s and early 2000s.

289
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,869
Is that so?

290
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,121
That means we're in the same group.

291
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,748
[chuckles] I guess I'm still young.

292
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,710
[Na-yun] Did you have to hire
his female friend like this?

293
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,837
Daughter of his mom's friend,
not a female friend.

294
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,590
That's the same thing!

295
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,592
[chuckles]

296
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,930
You can yell at me all you want.
We're the same generation.

[keys clacking]

298
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,400
You sure this won't be a problem?
You'll be involved with Greip again.

299
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,195
That's true.

300
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,033
So why did you agree to help?

301
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,118
Because of me?

302
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,954
Of course.

303
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,291
Hey, it's already 6:00 p.m.
Aren't you going home?

304
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,043
I have a mountain of work to do.

305
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,003
Still, we should eat dinner.

306
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,588
You only had a sandwich for lunch.

307
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,256
I'm not hungry.

308
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,885
Don't skip your meals!
All of this is to survive anyway!

309
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,554
Go if you're going to nag.
You're done for the day.

310
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,931
No, I'm not.

-What are you doing?
-Reading comic books.

313
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,229
It's an advanced version
of doing self-exploration.

314
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,441
"This story has only one main character."

315
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,194
There's a writer and a model.

"Being cool is the only weapon
for those who are powerless."

"This is Wonjoong High School basketball."

00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,704
-How about basketball?
-You can't play basketball.

319
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,622
Not as a player. I could be a coach.

320
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,833
You're at it again.

321
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,169
-Hey!
-What?

322
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,841
Is your work fun? Is it worth
starving yourself for 24 hours?

323
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,719
I could starve for 72 hours.

VICE MINISTER
KWAK SE-HWAN

How does it feel to be
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs?

[Se-hwan chuckles]

Earl Grey?

You were the UK ambassador for so long
that your tastes have changed.

[chuckles]

333
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,045
It's because I'm old now.
Too much coffee hurts my stomach.

Did you know?

335
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,300
People call you the Colin Firth
of the Foreign Ministry.

336
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,762
You were more like Alain Delon
when we first joined.

337
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,057
Hey, did you come here to insult me?

338

Both our names were mentioned.

339
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,352
But only I got the job,
so is this revenge?

What are you saying?

341
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,191
I'm not suited to be stuck
in an office like this.

342
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,401
I want to travel the world.

343
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,613
Yeah, that suits you.

344
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,949
So where are you going to
send me this time, Vice Minister?

345
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,243
I've been in Korea
for almost two months now.

I'm okay with rough areas too.
Just send me anywhere.

I'll work extra hard
for the rest of my term.

Yes, ma'am.
I'll discuss it with the minister.

00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,055
How about we go eat?

353
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,015
Yeah, sure.

354
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,893
[mellow music playing]

355
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:25,896
[door opens]

356
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,455
Mi-suk!

357
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,541
Suk!

358
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,210
Hye-suk! This was heavy.
What luck. Give me a ride.

359
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,003
Did you go grocery shopping?

360
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,260
Gosh, it's always the same
for a cook like me. Did you have dinner?

361
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,177
Not yet.

362
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,929
Come over and eat.

363
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,806
I'll season bracken for you. You love it.

364
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,558
Forget it. I'd be a nuisance.

365
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,519
It's just another spoon on the table.
It's not a nuisance.

366
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,895
Call your husband too.

367
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,730
He's busy. What for?

368
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,025
Doesn't your husband eat at home?

369
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,570
He needs to work the dinner rush!
He better not come home.

370
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,489
Jeez, why is my ear so itchy?

371
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,325
Is my wife bad-mouthing me again?

372
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,204
-[Gyeong-jong] So you were outside.
-Hello, Professor! [chuckles]

373
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,542
Well, I should be inside
for the dinner rush,

374
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,043
but there aren't any customers.

375
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,006
[Gyeong-jong] Then, can I order something?

376
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,008
-There's nothing at home.
-[Geun-sik chuckles]

377
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,928
Of course. Why would you say it so sadly?
Come on in.

378
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,015
[bell chiming]

379
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,226
[Gyeong-jong slurping]

380
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,485
[Geun-sik] Hey.

381
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,445
[chuckles softly]

382
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,198
Are you okay with some soju?

383
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,783
It's fine with me,
but don't you have to work?

384
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,121
It's no big deal.
I can just close for the night.

385
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,080
[chuckles]

386
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,207
Let me.

387
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,583
It's an honor.

388
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,129
The top emergency medicine professor
in the country is pouring me soju.

389
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,590
You're too kind.

390
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,926
You must've had some free time today.

391
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,385
You're always busy.

392
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,888
The kids these days keep leaving me out.

393
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,890
I guess I'm an old-timer now.

394
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,477
You can take this chance to rest.
What's there to worry about?

395
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,273
[both exclaiming]

396
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,985
After you collapsed,
did you have any other symptoms?

397
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,695
No, none.

398
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,074
I'm doing fine thanks to you.

399
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,495
But I'm always getting injured.

400
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:47,871
You are?

401
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,416
My wife is always poking
and prodding incessantly.

402
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,627
It's a new fatal wound every day.

403
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,047
If only I made good money,

404
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,883
I wouldn't be treated with such disdain.

405
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,968
[liquid pouring]

406
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,641
On that note, I'm so envious of you.

407
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,061
It's pointless. What's money really worth?

408
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,398
[Geun-sik] So arrogant…

409
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,733
Gosh, I hate you. [chuckles]

410
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,235
It's jerks who have…

411
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,197
People who have everything
always say things like that.

412
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,201
But those who have nothing know
how important money is.

413
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,497
You need a lot of money to look generous.

414
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,083
It's the same when going to buy fruit.

415
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,835
A box of tangerines for 5,000 won

416
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,338
can't compare to the huge hallabongs
that cost 10,000 or 20,000 won.

417
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,009
I can only buy the tangerines.
It's the same with ice cream.

418
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,220
I can't buy the ones in quarts.
I have to buy single popsicles.

419
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,723
Premium taiyaki! Those always look good.

420
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,767
But I buy the cheap taiyaki instead.

421
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,271
I envy you.

422
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,939
What?

423
00:21:56,023 --> 00:22:00,027
Why didn't I ever think about
buying something to bring home?

424
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,115
That's because you're busy.

425
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,702
Let's just drink.

426
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,619
Sure.

427
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,125
-[both chuckle softly]
-[glasses clinking]

428
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,920
-[pop song playing in background]
-[exhales]

429
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,382
[inhales]

430
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,845
It's you, right?
The paramedic Jung Mo-eum?

431
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,889
The broken glass from the Han River?

432
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,432
Wait, the rice cakes.

433
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,643
Yes. Did the rice cakes taste all right?

434
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,187
Yes, they did.

435
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,273
But how did you know I worked there?
I didn't tell you my name.

436
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,691
I looked into it.

437
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,902
I'm not the type to forget
to show my gratitude.

438
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,944
I see.

439
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,071
By the way…

440
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,781
-Do you live near here?
-Yes.

441
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,365
I moved here recently.

442
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,161
-It's so nice to run in to you.
-Really? [chuckles]

443
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,288
[straining]

444
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:57,250
I'm sorry, but how long
are you going to hold this for?

445
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,462
I think it can be resolved if you let go.

446
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,671
[quirky music playing]

447
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,341
You just said you never forget
to show gratitude.

448
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,927
[chuckles] You can't let me have
this one drink?

449
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,096
That principle's engraved in my bones.

450
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,057
-But this is a different issue.
-[scoffs]

451
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,266
You're very firm.

452
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,477
Just like my name. Kang Dan-ho.

453
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,771
I guess people do live up to their names.

454
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:22,567
Yes, all right.
Mr. Kang Dan-ho, let me be firm as well.

455
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,402
My hand touched this can first.

456
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,987
And it's my favorite drink.

457
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,823
It's cool and refreshing.

458
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,575
Yes, it's like a stroll through the forest
for your taste buds.

459
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,204
I relieve the day's fatigue with this too.

460
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,874
I really love this drink.
I've been drinking it for 20 years.

461
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,168
I've been drinking it for 21 years now.

462
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,337
[Seok-ryu] Mo-eum?

463
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,505
[Seung-hyo] Mr. Kang?

464
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,259
Mr. Choi?

465
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,428
[breathing heavily]

466
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,393
It's surprising that you moved
to our neighborhood.

467
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,521
I had no idea
I'd run into you like this again.

468
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,566
Are you really a reporter
for The Chungwoo Daily?

469
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,735
-You're not an impersonator?
-He covered me.

470
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,362
-You want to see?
-Forget it.

471
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:11,616
I can't believe
you know Seung-hyo and Mo-eum.

472
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,702
It really is a small world.

473
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,330
It's fate that we met like this,
shall we toast?

474
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,790
Yeah, sounds good.

475
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,625
[Mo-eum] Toast, my foot.

476
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,169
[quirky music playing]

477
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,880
-[sighs] Cheers.
-[Seok-ryu] Cheers.

478
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,635
[exhales]

479
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,098
Thanks for letting me have this.

480
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,059
I didn't exactly let you have it.

481
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,396
You took it and paid for it
while I was greeting the architect.

482
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,774
How do you have such similar tastes?

483
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,109
In an unexpected way too.

484
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,569
Is that so?

485
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,031
It's our first time meeting,
but you're strangely familiar.

486
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,118
I wasn't in Korea for 10 years.

487
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,162
Is it because I have a pretty face?

488
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,705
Don't say that anywhere else.

489
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,082
-You'll get hit with a rock.
-Do you want to die?

490
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,752
-[Seung-hyo] What? Come on.
-[Seok-ryu] Are you asking?

491
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,171
I'm sorry. I must've been mistaken.

492
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,551
So are you all childhood friends?

493
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,386
Yeah, you could say that.

494
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,680
To be more precise, our moms were friends.

495
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,598
High school friends.

496
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,100
We hung out like this since we were kids.

497
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,770
Somehow, we're still hanging out.

498
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,355
[Dan-ho] That's nice.

499
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,525
I was always jealous of people
with neighborhood friends.

500
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,403
Where did you live?

501
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,113
[Dan-ho] What?

502
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,033
Well… Just around. [chuckles nervously]

503
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,871
I have something urgent to take care of.
I should go.

504
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,790
-What? All of a sudden?
-[Seung-hyo] What?

505
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,583
-Next time. Sorry. See you later.
-What?

506
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,502
What? Why?

507
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,091
-That was so sudden.
-[Seung-hyo] Did I say something wrong?

508
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,676
[Mo-eum] That was suspicious.

509
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,469
Do you still doubt people?

510
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,389
Why would he leave so urgently?

511
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,600
He avoided having to answer that question
about where he lived.

512
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,811
He didn't want to talk
about personal matters.

513
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,104
I thought of it!

514
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,107
Do you remember burying the time capsule?

515
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,024
Yeah.

516
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,986
-We dug that up recently.
-[Mo-eum] Yeah.

517
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,696
Your letter was gone.

518
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,364
You almost had me there.

519
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,242
I dug it up that night. I was curious.

520
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:21,288
[Seok-ryu] What?
Mo-eum was the real traitor!

521
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,081
Do you remember what we wrote?

522
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,082
[quirky music playing]

523
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,376
[laughingly] Seok-ryu's letter

699
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,243
[Jae-suk] I see.

700
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,578
Where are you going?

701
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,748
Where else would I go?
I'm going to the real estate office.

702
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,666
Let's go. I'll take it for you.

703
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,001
You don't have to.

704
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,085
It's fine.

705
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,462
Aren't you busy?

706
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,589
-It's okay.
-Thanks so much.

707
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,257
[Dan-ho] This is so heavy!

708
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,467
-Yeah.
-What's in here?

709
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,762
[Mo-eum groans]

710
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,974
REPORTER KANG DAN-HO

711
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,270
I guess he is a reporter.

712
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,903
Hey, kid.

713
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,113
What are you looking for?
Do you want help?

714
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,241
I'm looking for crop circles.

715
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,202
Crop circles?

716
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,412
Traces left by aliens?

717
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,291
Yeah, I saw something shine
in the sky last night.

718
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,209
[gasps]

719
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,461
-[quirky music playing]
-A UFO might've landed.

720
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,047
Do you believe in aliens? So do I, friend!

721
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,591
You're more like my aunt.

722
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,719
Sorry, did I overstep?

723
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,845
Yes.

724
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,264
But I believe in aliens too.

725
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,391
In reality, Santa's an alien too.

726
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,810
What?

727
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:08,022
If Santa wants to deliver presents
all over the world on Christmas Eve,

728
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,274
he has to transcend space and time, right?

729
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,944
Wow, you're a genius.

730
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:13,986
I'll look with you.

731
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,614
That's okay. I can do it alone.

732
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,615
Why?

733
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,701
My dad told me not to talk to strangers.

734
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,289
[Mo-eum] What?

735
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,585
[music fades]

736
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,254
-[Jae-suk] Over here.
-[Dan-ho] Okay.

737
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,840
[door lock opens]

738
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,592
Come on in. Right there. Yeah.

739
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,345
-[exhales] Here?
-Not there. On the table inside.

740
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,058
Thank you so much. [chuckles]

741
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,560
Did you just get here?

742
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,602
[Jae-suk] Mi-suk?

743
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,312
Who's this?

744
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,816
He just moved in next door.

745
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,026
I asked him to carry
this heavy box for me.

746
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,237
-[chuckles] Hello.
-Hello.

747
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,738
I should get going.

748
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,740
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

749
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,160
-[chuckles nervously]
-[Jae-suk] Yeah.

750
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,579
-Thank you!
-No problem.

751
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,290
-[Jae-suk] Bye, see you again.
-[gasps]

752
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,500
He looks decent.

753
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,210
Good personality and handsome.

754
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,503
Isn't he?

755
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,964
-What does he do?
-A reporter for The Chungwoo Daily.

756
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:15,965
[gasps, snaps fingers]

757
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,926
He'll look good with Seok-ryu.

758
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,637
No, not a chance.

759
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,348
Why not?
Do you have dibs on him for Mo-eum?

760
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,310
-No, it's not that. He's… What?
-[phone ringing]

761
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:33,441
-Yes, hello! Yes, this is Hyereung Realty.
-[Mi-suk gasps]

762
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,068
What is this?
He lifted this that effortlessly?

763
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,028
[gasps]

764
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,031
The young man's strong too.

765
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,492
He's a reporter and he's strong.

766
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,373
You didn't find it?

767
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,419
What?

768
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,547
[quirky music playing]

769
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,551
-Do you want a bite?
-No.

770
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,845
Why not? Take a bite. I'll share.

771
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,222
No.

772
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,640
Fine.

773
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,808
Do you want chocolate?

774
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,726
Okay.

775
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,187
No.

776
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:12,939
[Mo-eum] Here.

777
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,488
My dad told me not to take food
from strangers or follow them anywhere.

778
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,324
You don't have to follow me. Just take it.

779
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,037
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you trying to seduce me?

780
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,247
Are you up to something?

781
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,332
You watch a lot of TV!

782
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,251
Are you trying to kidnap me?

783
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,045
And a lot of movies.

784
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,507
I'll call the cops.

785
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,591
[Mo-eum] No!

786
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,636
I'm not a strange person.

787
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,722
I work in a field similar
to law enforcement.

788
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,517
It's the other emergency line.

789
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,312
Beep, boop!

790
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,774
Whoop, whoop!

791
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,735
Not the fire truck, but an ambulance.

792
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,071
Are you a paramedic?

793
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,614
Goodness…

794
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,869
[music ends]

[keyboard keys clacking]

796
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,834
Let's get lunch.

797
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,169
Go ahead. I have work to do.

798
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,879
Stop working and let's go eat!

799
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,881
Why are you getting angry?

800
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,302
You know I'm on a tight schedule.

801
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,430
Hey! Don't do that.
Who cares if they're Greip?

802
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,933
-Don't work with those scumbags!
-What's gotten into you?

803
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,727
It's already been decided.

804
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,023
Greip's new building
was assigned to Hwawoon already.

805
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,940
What are you saying?

806
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,484
I was turning off the monitor,

807
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,321
and I could hear their voices.
The call hadn't ended.

808
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,075
Since the schedule's tight,
they want Hwawoon to start right away.

809
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,203
Atelier In was shortlisted,
but it won't work out

810
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,540
because of the company's short career
and no track record.

811
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,750
[mellow music playing]

812
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,252
They said you were the control group.

813
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,589
Did you tell Myeong-u?

814
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,424
No, not yet.

815
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,593
Don't tell him.

816
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,095
-Pretend like you don't know.
-Why?

817
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,973
Will you keep doing this?

818
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,017
You know they're going with Hwawoon.

819
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,186
That information I learned unofficially.

820
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,229
I'll act officially.

821
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,774
Yeah. I see.

822
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,026
Just half-ass it and turn it in.

823
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,613
You're a big shot in Korea.

824
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,198
What does Greip know?

825
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,200
"Half-ass it"?

826
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,119
I won't do that.

827
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,998
My principle
is not to differentiate between tasks.

828
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,210
It doesn't matter if the odds are low
or the project is small.

829
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,546
As long as it's under Atelier In's name,

830
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,340
I will always do my best.

831
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:49,053
Do you think you'll be a major piece
in this openly rigged game?

832
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,846
Are you a global sucker?

833
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,764
Seok-ryu.

834
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,517
That's harsh.

835
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,894
I'm not harsh. That industry's the issue!

836
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,355
I know them better than anyone.

837
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,357
No matter how hard you try,

838
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,525
it's a waste of time.

839
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,027
Don't talk about my hard work like that.

840
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,363
Who cares if you know them?

841
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,489
You don't know me.

842
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,200
So you're going to continue
this futile effort

843
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,618
and starve in the process?

844
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,828
Just leave me be.

845
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,414
Fine! I'll get lost while I'm at it too!

846
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,499
Count me out of this one.

847
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,087
Hey, doesn't Mr. Yoon deserve to know?

Hello.

861
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,803
-Hello.
-Is this your first time here?

862
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,223
-Do you live in this neighborhood?
-No, I work nearby.

863
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,642
I see.

864
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,020
The equipment here sucks, right?

865
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,730
I can't say it doesn't.

866
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,024
If we want to get new members,

867
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,526
we need to change all the equipment first.

868
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,153
I've said it again and again.

869
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,488
There's no point.

870
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,573
The gym director is so old-fashioned.

871
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,991
I see.

872
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,785
His name's Go Seul-gi,
and he used to be a boxer.

873
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,121
He switched to bodybuilding
after an injury.

874
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,457
He's a burly guy,
but isn't his name feminine?

875
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,374
You're right.

876
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:46,086
[Dong-jin] Still, he's skilled
and has many medals.

877
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,088
He's fit for his age too.

878
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,215
Mmm.

879
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,383
But how can I describe his mindset?

880
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,386
You know what his nickname is?

881
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,554
No.

882
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,639
It's Gold-school.

883
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,349
Because he's old-school!

884
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,977
He said exercise is more about sincerity
than equipment or whatever.

885
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,895
I swear.

886
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,272
-[groans]
-Are you here to sign up?

887
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,066
-Yes.
-Right this way.

888
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,529
-Damn it.
-[music ends]

889
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,365
I met an incredible friend today.

890
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,159
Okay, okay. Eat this while we talk.

891
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,495
You said you were starving,

892
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,539
-so I personally delivered it.
-[Mo-eum chuckles]

893
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,499
I almost forgot I was hungry.

894
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,334
Wow.

895
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,630
-[exclaims]
-[Seok-ryu] What kind of friend was it?

896
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,007
-[Mo-eum] Well…
-[Seok-ryu] What?

897
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,717
[both groan]

898
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,344
It's good.

899
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,638
-The egg melts in my mouth.
-[Seok-ryu] Mmm.

900
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,557
It's still so hot.

901
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,393
What a speedy delivery, friend. Well done!

902
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,310
Right?

903
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,939
See, there's no friend like me, right?

904
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,025
What incredible friend did you meet?

905
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,611
[Mo-eum chuckles softly]

906
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,697
What? A six-year-old kid?

907
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,368
Yeah, but her mental age is probably
older than you.

908
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,661
She was very profound.

909
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,830
-[Seok-ryu] You little brat!
-[chuckles]

910
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,415
I mean it. [chuckles]

911
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,960
She was this tiny!

912
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,921
She was looking for crop circles
in the lawn.

913
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,339
A miniature Jung Mo-eum.

914
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,009
You looked for E.T. all the time
as a kid, remember?

915
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,927
[Mo-eum] I did have those moments.

916
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,473
Anyway, she was so smart and pretty.

917
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,641
What's her name?

918
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,269
I didn't ask.

919
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,812
Are you sure she lives here?

920
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:27,938
I don't know.

921
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,234
I should've asked her! [crying]

922
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,235
[Seok-ryu sighs]

923
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,988
I almost lost my best friend
to a random kid.

924
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,699
Hey, Mo-eum?

925
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,787
Didn't you have portraits of Iron Man,
Spider-Man and other various men there?

926
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,331
Why suddenly the North Pole?

927
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,374
[Mo-eum] It's the South Pole.

928
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,918
It's my biggest interest these days.

929
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,087
[Seok-ryu] How does love change?

930
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,631
From men to the South Pole.

931
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,841
It seemed more productive.

932
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,176
I can't deny that.

933
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,221
Since we're done eating,
let's take a walk around the neighborhood.

934
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,433
-Call Seung-hyo too.
-No! No way!

935
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,934
I'm leaving if you call him.

936
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,436
Did you fight again?

937
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,731
[Myeong-u sighs]

938
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,151
It's disappointing because the building
has no facade. How do I put it?

939
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,987
I think it lacks impact.

940
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:17,905
Impact?

941
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,365
Mmm.

942
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:24,036
How about implementing a prism-shape
to refract and absorb the light,

943
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,412
creating various colors?

944
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,374
[exclaims]

945
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:33,754
Like the harmony of thousands of colors,
always evolving into something new!

946
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,800
We can transform Greip's archive
into a physical space.

947
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,928
Yeah, you know how to put words together
so well.

948
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,181
Hey, this is it. We're done now.

949
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,142
Greip's a done deal for us, right?

950
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,519
[exclaiming excitedly]

951
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,438
-Wait…
-Let's not get our hopes up.

952
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,733
How can I not? It's Greip.

953
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,693
Besides that,

954
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,697
the fact that we were given
this opportunity really excites me.

955
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,242
It feels like we're being rewarded
for all of our hard work.

956
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,995
Not to mention, I trust you.

957
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,874
Choi Seung-hyo's architecture
inspires people.

958
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,252
As long as I have you,

959
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,879
I'm not scared of Hwawoon's team at all!

960
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:21,135
Shall we add the finishing touches?

961
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,182
-Myeong-u.
-Yeah?

962
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,188
Move 30 centimeters away.
You'll hurt your eyes.

963
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,152
You sound like my father sometimes.

964
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,530
Dad!

965
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,614
[birds chirping]

966
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:48,912
Hello.

967
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,040
[quirky music playing]

968
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,128
It's you again.

969
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,671
It's the paramedic again.

970
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,256
A durian-flavored lollipop.

971
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,091
Have our tastes overlapped again?

972
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,509
It seems so.

973
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,094
[scoffs] Yes.

974
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,764
I think I was first again this time.
Get your hand off.

975
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,017
I remember I let you have it before.

976
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,435
-Step away now.
-Excuse me?

977
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,104
You know this flavor is a rare gem, right?

978
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,025
This convenience store carries this flavor
because of me. Why?

979
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,569
-I'm the only one who buys it!
-Not anymore.

980
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,070
I'll buy it from now on.

981
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,780
Why do you always get the last word in?

982
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,282
You're free to say something too.

983
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,700
This is ridiculous.

984
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,961
[Mo-eum exclaims]

985
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,089
[chuckles softly] Will you pay now?

986
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,344
-Yeah.
-[music ends]

987
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,180
The more, the merrier.

988
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,934
We can experience the sweetness
of the candy from multiple perspectives.

989
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,103
Yeah, I am experiencing
a new and tantalizing flavor today.

990
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,189
-Do you want a ride?
-No.

991
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,608
-Be on your way.
-If you'll excuse me.

992
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,696
What? He has the same car as Mudflat Man.

993
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,451
Who cares? He's so petty! [exclaims]

994
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,790
[shudders]

995
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,254
[Dan-ho sighs wearily]
When will I finish unpacking?

996
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,966
[sighs deeply]

997
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,059
What?

998
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,271
I still had this?

999
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,188
[scoffs]

1000
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,116
200703 ON-SITE
SEOUL NATIONAL SWIM CHAMPIONSHIP

1001
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,242
[scoffs]

1002
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,874
Hmm.

1003
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,752
[pleasant music playing]

1004
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,557
[chuckles softly]

1005
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,979
SEOK-RYU'S TREE

1006
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,531
[Seung-hyo groans]

1007
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,415
Seok-ryu's bothering me with trees now.

1008
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,958
[mellow music playing]

1009
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,466
[phone vibrating]

1010
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,472
[Dan-ho] I found a picture
from a long time ago.

1011
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,974
I knew you looked familiar.

1012
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,147
Seung-hyo, it's time. Let's go.

1013
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,065
Okay.

1014
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,652
SEOK-RYU'S TREE

1015
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,403
[door closes]

1016
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,656
Is Seok-ryu meeting us at the hotel?

1017
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,075
No, she's not coming today.

1018
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:16,078
What are you talking about?
She's right there.

1019
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,162
Hey, Seok-ryu.

1020
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,793
[sighs deeply]

1021
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,128
-[Myeong-u exclaiming]
-[Seung-hyo] Is it that again?

1022
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,254
[chuckles softly]

1023
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,509
The bladder must get worked up when
people get nervous. I have to go again.

1024
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,720
-Go ahead.
-Yeah, the bathroom.

1025
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,101
[door opens]

1026
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,227
[door closes]

1027
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,566
-Why did you come today?
-Are you complaining?

1028
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,527
You said you wouldn't come.

1029
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,279
I didn't want you to suffer
for not knowing English.

1030
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,282
If things go south,
I should cuss them out.

1031
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,575
You are good at cussing.

1032
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,703
Do you want me to practice on you?

1033
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,620
[chuckles softly]

1034
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,122
[chuckles softly]

1035
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,375
[indistinct conversation]

1036
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,050
Seok-ryu?

1037
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,970
[chuckles softly]

1038
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,264
[in English] It's you. Oh, my God. Hey.

1039
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,932
It's been a while.

1040
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,229
-Oh, nice to meet you.
-[Seung-hyo] Nice to meet you.

1041
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,481
-I'm Chris.
-I'm Seung-hyo.

1042
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,528
[Jennifer] Chris joins us here in Korea
as the chief product designer for Greip.

1043
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,947
He's going to play a critical role,
tapping into the voices

1044
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,950
both inside and outside
of our organization for this project.

1045
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,161
Keep going. Sounds great.

1046
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,787
[all chuckling]

1047
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,248
[Chris] I didn't know I had
such a heavy responsibility

1048
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,583
resting on my shoulders.

1049
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,461
Though I'm here on business,

1050
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,130
I've always wanted
to visit Korea personally.

1051
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:55,010
[in Korean] That's because I immigrated
to the US when I was eight.

1052
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,305
No wonder. So you're an overseas Korean.

1053
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,182
-[Chris] That's right.
-[both chuckle]

1054
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,224
[in English] Most of all,

1055
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,435
[in Korean] seeing Seok-ryu again

1056
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,145
makes me so happy.

1057
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,605
[Myeong-u] Seok-ryu?

1058
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,523
You two know each other?

1059
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,525
Yes.

1060
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,027
We said hello earlier.

1061
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,653
She was the project leader at Greip.

1062
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,490
Really?

1063
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,118
Wow, old colleagues meeting
across the ocean by chance?

1064
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,121
Maybe this is destined to work out.

1065
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,539
-[both chuckle]
-Right?

1066
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,960
She suddenly said
she was returning to Korea then.

1067
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,921
so I was really disappointed.

1068
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,381
[in English] It was such a bummer
when she left the States.

1069
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,343
Pardon? Are you the Seok-ryu
I heard so much about?

1070
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,261
I didn't know
if you just had the same name.

1071
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,347
No wonder it's been so seamless
working with you.

1072
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,848
[Chris] Yeah, exactly.

1073
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,893
She's always passionate
and fully committed to her work.

1074
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,186
[mellow music playing]

1075
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,396
I can always trust her to get things done.

1076
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,733
[all chuckling]

1077
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,654
We ran a pilot test,

1078
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,865
but the metrics didn't live up
to our expectations.

1079
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,783
[sighs]

1080
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,536
I wanted to see a boost
in the conversion rate,

1081
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,246
but there wasn't much improvement.

1082
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,666
No, the outcome isn't quite
what we'd intended.

1083
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,295
Let's go back to the drawing board
and see where we went wrong

1084
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,047
before the next monthly briefing.

1085
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,592
[Susan] Again? But we tried
so many times already and still failed.

1086
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,219
Susan's right.

1087
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,514
We're on a tight schedule,
so we may be better off just giving up.

1088
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,057
I know it's been difficult,

1089
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,143
but why don't we give it another shot?

1090
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,854
[exhales] Still…

1091
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,648
[Chris] All right. Let's just do it.

1092
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,607
Hmm?

1093
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:36,403
But Peter and Susan
have only just come on board,

1094
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,405
and they need some time to adjust.

1095
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:42,617
So I'll need you to do a lot more.
Is that okay?

1096
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,827
Of course.

1097
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,787
Shall we wrap it up here, then?

1098
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,830
[Chris] Okay, wrap up.

1099
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:47,873
[both groaning]

1100
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,709
[Chris clears throat]

1101
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,587
[door opens]

1102
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,214
[exhales]

1103
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,257
[in Korean] Great job.

1104
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,259
Thanks for agreeing with me, Chris.

1105
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,637
For sure. Of course, I should agree.
We're on the same team.

1106
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,601
You know,
even though this office is like a desert,

1107
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,104
we should be each other's genies.

1108
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,272
[in English] Genie?

1109
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,190
Yeah. When you're down

1110
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,401
[in Korean] and having a hard time,

1111
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,612
you can rub the lamp like this.

1112
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,697
Are you asking me for a wish?

1113
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,656
[in English] Kind of.

1114
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,410
[in Korean] This means, "I trust you."

1115
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,664
You're passionate, and you have
a strong sense of responsibility.

1116
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,458
[in Korean] Our captain.

1117
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,001
[exhales]

1118
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,337
-[in English] Boom!
-Boom!

1119
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,713
-[Chris] Go for it!
-[in Korean] Thanks.

1120
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,798
[Susan in English] You know Seok-ryu?

1121
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,635
I did just as you told me to, and voilà!

1122
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,969
[all laughing]

1123
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:47,641
Right? I asked the "very highly
competent Seok-ryu" to help me out,

1124
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,477
-and she did all of my work for me.
-[all laughing]

1125
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,479
-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Peter] So how did you know?

1126
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,564
Through trial and error.

1127
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,859
I realized she'll do everything
if you give her a little pat on the back.

1128
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,820
-[Susan exclaiming softly]
-Especially the "I believe in you."

1129
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,657
-[Susan laughing]
-[Chris] Those are the magic words.

1130
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,284
[Peter] Does she really believe
she can do everything?

1131
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,369
Try as she might,

1132
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,371
she'll only be hitting
the ceiling one day.

1133
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,497
Yeah.

1134
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,582
You think she's affection-deprived?

1135
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,919
Maybe that's why she's so desperate
for praise and recognition,

1136
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:16,836
like a little kid.

1137
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,879
[Susan] Yeah, could be.

1138
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,798
[Peter] By the way, did you hear?

1139
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,426
Well, it's about why she took
a break from work three years ago.

1140
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,971
Oh. That was quite big,
what happened to her.

1141
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,681
[mellow music playing]

1142
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,145
-Poor little girl.
-[chuckles softly]

1143
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,273
Well, guys. It's all over now.

1144
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,567
Then, let's go plan our weekend

1145
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:44,072
since our lovely "AI"
will be doing all our work for us.

1146
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,532
[Chris] Hey, how about this?

1147
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,659
-Let's go to K-town tonight.
-[Susan] Ooh.

1148
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,952
-Good?
-Yeah.

1149
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,078
-Sounds good.
-Great.

1150
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,871
-Okay, see you then.
-I'll see you.

1151
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,171
[chuckles mockingly]

1152
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,048
Hey, guys. What's up?

1153
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,016
[Seung-hyo in Korean] The light
that gives repeating colors

1154
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,600
or the hundreds of thousands…

1155
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,185
[Myeong-u exclaims]

1156
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,478
[Seok-ryu] I'm sorry.

1157
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,313
[Myeong-u] Don't move. I'll wipe it up.

1158
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,859
-My hand slipped.
-[chuckles]

1159
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,902
Seok-ryu, are you okay?

1160
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,492
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Sorry.

1161
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,785
I need to go to the bathroom.

1162
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,291
[door closes]

1163
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,752
Should we take a break for a moment?

1164
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,669
Sure.

1165
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,837
[chuckles softly]

1166
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,132
[Seok-ryu coughing]

1167
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,175
[door opens]

1168
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,346
[opens tap]

1169
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,937
[sighs deeply]

1170
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,398
[serious music playing]

1171
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,403
[clicks tongue]

1172
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,156
[in English] How much longer
do I have to be here?

1173
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,991
This was meant to be
a perfunctory meeting,

1174
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,367
but they have prepared a lot.

1175
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:15,121
[exhales] What a shame,
because they're only wasting their time.

1176
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,582
But I rather like their proposal too.

1177
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,502
Personally, I think it's a shame
we've decided to go with Hwawoon.

1178
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:24,422
Well, a great proposal
doesn't always translate to great results.

1179
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,758
-[phone vibrating]
-Besides, they're only a start-up.

1180
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,510
It's headquarters. Hold on.

1181
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,720
-Okay.
-This is Jennifer.

1182
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,305
[sighs]

1183
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,771
Hey, Seok-ryu.

1184
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,026
Are you okay?

1185
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:51,074
Anyway, never did I imagine
seeing you here.

1186
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,952
Right? Me neither.

1187
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,122
Yeah, you look like you're doing well.
How are you these days?

1188
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,335
Oh, I was curious
if the others knew about that.

1189
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,920
Three years ago?

1190
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,673
I'd rather you didn't bring it up.

1191
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,260
I'm sorry if I offended you.
I'm just worried about you.

1192
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,344
I already know…

1193
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,681
that Greip has decided to go with Hwawoon.

1194
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,599
-What?
-Don't worry.

1195
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,184
I'll pretend I know nothing

1196
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,647
for the sake of my colleagues
who are doing their very best.

1197
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,649
So, you keep your manners too.

1198
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,193
Hey, I think there's a misunderstanding.

1199
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,111
That's enough.

1200
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,781
You already know
that I heard you guys talking back then.

1201
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:32,824
[Chris exhales]

1202
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,119
Right.

1203
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:41,499
But I did mean it when I said
I was sorry to see you leave us.

1204
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,335
See, you were my genie at Greip.

1205
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,464
A pretty smart and convenient software.

1206
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,967
And easy to manipulate.

1207
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:57,015
Remember that. I wished…

1208
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,850
-[Seung-hyo in Korean] You bastard!
-Seung-hyo!

1209
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,894
-What's with you?
-What the hell did you just say?

1210
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,520
I thought you didn't understand.

1211
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,897
-How bothersome.
-Hey.

1212
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,940
You think I'd just play along?

1213
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,527
I didn't expect fairness,
but this is just crude.

1214
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,030
Maybe you're the one
who doesn't know their place?

1215
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:16,910
How dare a neighborhood dollar store
design Greip's new building?

1216
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,789
And they say the employees of a company
speak volumes about its status.

1217
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:26,419
I'm starting to doubt your judgment
for hiring such an unsociable guy.

1218
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,379
-You little punk!
-Hey!

1219
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,048
Don't do it.

1220
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,009
[Chris grunts]

1221
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:35,762
[exhales]

1222
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,639
[in English] My God!

1223
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,185
[in Korean] How dare you use violence
against someone from headquarters?

1224
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,270
I won't let this go.

1225
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,314
-[in English] I'm going to report it!
-[in Korean] Go ahead.

1226
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,440
-Do it, asshole.
-Hey!

1227
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,401
Talk to me, Chris. This is because of me.

1228
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,654
-Mr. Yoon, I'll quit.
-[Myeong-u] What?

1229
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,989
-You don't have to pay my full wage.
-Hey, Seok-ryu!

1230
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:58,034
[in English] I don't have anything to do
with Atelier In anymore,

1231
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,454
[voice shaking]
so don't get the company involved.

1232
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:05,416
[Chris] Hey, you really think
I have nothing better to do

1233
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,918
than mess with this shitty company?

1234
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:07,835
[in Korean] Damn it.

1235
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,255
[Chris in English] Hey.

1236
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,299
Also, you should work on your English.

1237
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,009
Your English still sucks.

1238
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,888
When you're asking someone for a favor,

1239
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,893
you have to say "please" first.

1240
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:24,811
[Seung-hyo exhales]

1241
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,229
[Chris] Well?

1242
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,149
Well?

1243
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,192
[voice shaking] Please…

1244
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,110
Yeah?

1245
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,072
Please…

1246
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,076
[in Korean] Please, my ass!

1247
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,744
-[Chris grunts]
-[exclaims]

1248
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:42,954
[breathing heavily]

1249
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:44,747
That…

1250
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:49,752
was a punch from a free Bae Seok-ryu,
not a part-time Atelier In employee.

1251
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,670
[Chris grunts]

1252
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:55,216
This is a gift to my former subordinate
with lousy character.

1253
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:56,968
[exclaiming]

1254
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,929
-[in English] Stop.
-[Seok-ryu's breath trembling]

1255
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,021
I haven't worn heels in a while.
They hurt a bit.

1256
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:14,193
You've seen me work, so you know
how persistent and tenacious I can be.

1257
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,114
This company is more than you deserve.

1258
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,576
I dare you to mess with Atelier In.

1259
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,662
I'll gather all evidence
of your subcontractor exploitation,

1260
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,707
product plagiarism,
neglect of duty, and gaslighting.

1261
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,336
And I'll send it
as a gift basket to Greip.

1262
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,422
Got it?

1263
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:42,972
[mellow music playing]

1264
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,775
Seok-ryu!

1265
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,610
Bae Seok-ryu!

1266
01:00:58,988 --> 01:00:59,989
Where are you going?

1267
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:04,035
I want to be alone. Just let me be.

1268
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,074
[sighs deeply]

1269
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:17,483
[grunts] I must be insane.
Why did I go hiking at night?

1270
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,444
[panting]

1271
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:25,366
What are you doing?

1272
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,034
How are your feet?

1273
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,912
I lost feeling in them a while back.

1274
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,125
That feels so much better. Jeez.

1275
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,671
Why would you walk up here in heels?

1276
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,549
Well, it's like voluntary self-punishment.

1277
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,261
Did you know…

1278
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,475
that when Jesus died on the cross
for people's sins, he was 33?

1279
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,519
He was the same age as us.

1280
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,979
[chuckles softly]

1281
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,025
You're going to use
our international age right now?

1282
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,444
Can't you see I'm serious?

1283
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,238
Keep going.

1284
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,492
I mean, it's impressive
he did that at our age.

1285
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,703
I struggle with even words that cut deep.

1286
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,332
Of course. Even the tiniest
of such remarks would hurt.

1287
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,291
[scoffs]

1288
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,669
Hey, Seung-hyo.

1289
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,506
I was an outcast at Greip.

1290
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,470
After I left the company,

1291
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,181
I blamed Chris and the others at first.

1292
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,851
But I realized something
after seeing you work.

1293
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,062
It was actually because of me.

1294
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,649
If I was doing something
I enjoyed like you,

1295
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,194
I would've endured it to the end
no matter what.

1296
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,695
No.

1297
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:48,950
What they did to you
was clearly workplace harassment.

1298
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,037
It has nothing to do
with whether you like your work or not.

1299
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,165
What I'm saying is…

1300
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,752
just because you quit your job

1301
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,756
doesn't mean you lacked passion
and determination. Okay?

1302
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,927
Also, it makes no sense
for the victim blame herself.

1303
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,723
Jeez, I should've killed that jerk.
Damn it.

1304
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,397
This won't do.

1305
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,941
Come with me.

1306
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,028
-Where are you going?
-Come on.

1307
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,324
[Seok-ryu] I was just getting
comfortable though.

1308
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,951
Where are we going?

1309
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,372
[pleasant music playing]

1310
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,748
[Seung-hyo] Write them here.

1311
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,917
The names of all the people
who harassed you.

1312
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,878
What? Why all of a sudden?

1313
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,462
Let's start with Chris.

1314
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,882
What are you doing?

1315
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,508
CHRIS

1316
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,511
It seemed like he had
a pretty good physique.

1317
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,016
CHRIS OBESE

1318
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,767
[Seok-ryu scoffs] I should've figured.

1319
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,353
He had a lot of hair too.

1320
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,439
"Hair loss."

1321
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,192
Stop it.
It's not like you to be this immature.

1322
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,361
Did you forget what he did to you?

1323
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,661
That jerk has super straight teeth.
He had braces as a kid.

1324
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,331
"Dentures."

1325
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,124
Write athlete's foot. And hemorrhoids.

1326
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,876
-And ingrown toenails.
-Athlete's…

1327
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:23,961
There's not enough space.

1328
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,255
You should've bought a bigger lock.

1329
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,758
We need to write ones
for Susan and Peter too.

1330
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:29,717
I'll write smaller.

1331
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,594
-"Athlete's foot."
-Hemorrhoids.

1332
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,970
-"Hemorrhoids."
-Ingrown toenail.

1333
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,221
Ingrown…

1334
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,266
Don't you think
an ingrown toenail is a bit harsh?

1335
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,643
Just write it all down.

1336
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,478
[Seung-hyo] Yeah, okay. "Ingrown toenail."

1337
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,440
-[lock clicks]
-All right, you punks.

1338
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,902
Taste the power these curses
coming all the way from Korea.

1339
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:51,614
First, it was K-pop and K-dramas.
Now, it's K-superstitions, you jerks.

1340
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,283
[Seung-hyo chuckles]

1341
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:57,578
[inhales]

1342
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,205
Feeling better now?

1343
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:03,626
Yeah, much better.

1344
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,294
That's a relief.

1345
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:11,842
Hey, Seung-hyo.

1346
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,178
I was impressed by you.

1347
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,224
Don't tell me you like me. I'll kill you.

1348
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,934
You crazy fool. It's not that!

1349
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:24,397
It was impressive
how you finished the pitch to Greip.

1350
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,817
You knew it wouldn't work out,
but you didn't give up.

1351
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,443
It was marvelous.

1352
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,028
[chuckles softly] Is that so?

1353
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,948
You had me going there.

1354
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,909
So I've made up my mind.

1355
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,163
I'll find a place
where I can swim to the very end.

1356
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:46,043
Hey, just you wait. I'm going to do
the freestyle and the butterfly.

1357
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:48,713
[chuckles softly]

1358
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:51,132
Sounds good.

1359
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:54,719
[music ends]

1360
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:55,928
[phone vibrating]

1361
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,766
YOON MYEONG-U

1362
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,769
Shouldn't you answer that?

1363
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,814
[clears throat]

1364
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:12,987
Hey, Myeong-u. Sorry.

1365
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,238
[Myeong-u] For what?

1366
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,156
Well…

1367
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,784
-Well…
-Is it…

1368
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,748
an apology for the exhausting nights
of overtime we have ahead of us?

1369
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,708
What do you mean?

1370
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,378
We got the project from Greip.

1371
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,338
What?

1372
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,882
[upbeat music playing]

1373
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,676
It's not their office building.
It's a flagship store.

1374
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,928
A new one's opening next year in Seoul.

1375
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,472
They're giving us a chance.

1376
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,893
Wait, are you serious?

1377
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,270
But how?

1378
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:48,939
The design team leader liked our proposal.

1379
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,609
What? What is it?

1380
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,653
[Myeong-u] Is Seok-ryu next to you?
Tell her this for me.

1381
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,574
That jerk Chris was fired from Greip.

1382
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,992
[in English] Shit!

1383
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,661
[screams, exhales]

1384
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,164
You guys are fired!

1385
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,753
[in Korean] I'll make sure you never work
in this industry again.

1386
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:15,549
Well, I think you'll be the one
who won't be able work again.

1387
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,094
-[in English] What?
-[Myeong-u chuckles]

1388
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:22,765
[in Korean] I have a habit
of recording meetings.

1389
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:26,644
It's a way for me to be more attentive
to our clients' feedback.

1390
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:31,232
But I had no idea this would also serve
as evidence to prove the allegations.

1391
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:32,483
-[laughs]
-[exhales]

1392
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:34,902
That's an illegal wiretap.

1393
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,028
[in English] That's not legal.

1394
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,863
-[in Korean] Legal validity?
-[in English] Yeah.

1395
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,865
[in Korean] Yeah, you're right.
But… [inhales]

1396
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,784
I think it'll work for vigilantism.

1397
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,577
What kind of dog crap is that?

1398
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,537
Meow!

1399
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:50,000
I like cats more than dogs.

1400
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,336
I like going on trips and wine too.

1401
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:55,631
And sneakers!
I go crazy for limited editions shoes!

1402
01:08:55,714 --> 01:09:00,886
But the thing is
I know someone who's just like me.

1403
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,139
"Château Ribello"?

1404
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,099
-Ro-hui. Ro-a.
-[babies cooing]

1405
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:09,562
This has an exquisite raspberry
and chocolate aroma. My goodness.

1406
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,857
-[babies cooing]
-"Domaine Cavalerie Santren."

1407
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,359
Where did he get such fine wine? [gasps]

1408
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:18,654
Gosh. I thought it was someone else
with the same name at first.

1409
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,823
You see the name here, right?

1410
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,200
Tony Brown.

1411
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,869
Senior Vice President of Greip.

1412
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:28,455
Wow! We follow each other on social media.

1413
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,624
We also keep
in close touch with each other.

1414
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,459
[in English] So what?

1415
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,044
[in Korean] Sure.

1416
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:38,048
It might not be a big deal to you,
but there's one thing you don't know.

1417
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,633
In this world,

1418
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,721
we know we have soulmates
and people with the same tastes.

1419
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,892
Well, I'm very thorough about keeping
my private and personal lives separate.

1420
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,394
I haven't told Tony yet,

1421
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:53,981
but you won't play fair.

1422
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:56,984
So, I've already sent
this recording to everyone.

1423
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:59,278
-Hey, you bastard!
-Watch it, you bastard!

1424
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,490
Did being away from Korea this long
make you forget all etiquette?

1425
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:05,576
Look, you little greasy-haired brat.

1426
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:08,996
How dare you speak like that
to someone much older than you?

1427
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,665
You should be respectful. Got it?

1428
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,251
Button your shirt all the way.

1429
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,755
Okay? Fix your tie too.

1430
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:19,673
-[coughs]
-You little punk.

1431
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,967
Yes, sir.

1432
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,093
There you go.

1433
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,094
[in English] Sorry.

1434
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,221
[in Korean] In Korean, damn it.

1435
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,639
[Chris] I'm sorry.

1436
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,390
[inhales]

1437
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,852
-[exhales]
-What did Mr. Yoon say? What is it?

1438
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,647
Chris is going to be fired.

1439
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,317
It seems Myeong-u was friends
with the VP of Greip.

1440
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,318
What?

1441
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,112
Also, they want us on the project.

1442
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:43,697
What project?

1443
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,283
Greip's flagship store. [chuckles softly]

1444
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,410
-Really?
-Yeah.

1445
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,955
-For real?
-Yeah.

1446
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,498
My gosh! [echoing]

1447
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,541
[pleasant music playing]

1448
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,725
Hey, Seok-ryu. Why did you come here?

1449
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,354
-Didn't you have the mock test today?
-It's just a mock test.

1450
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,314
This is like your entrance exam.

1451
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,194
What about getting the best score
for a new phone?

1452
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,696
You won, so that's enough.

1453
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:28,784
And I don't need
that fancy swivel phone. It's fine.

1454
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,412
Who needs a two-megapixel camera?

1455
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:34,415
It would just show freckles. It's okay.

1456
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:35,749
[pop song playing]

1457
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,670
Well, I don't have much to give you.

1458
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,384
You can have this.

1459
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,427
[camera shutter clicks]

1460
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,304
[Seok-ryu] What?

1461
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,974
Why would you give this to me?

1462
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,935
You said today's White Day.

1463
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,812
Go and trade it
for some taffy or whatever.

1464
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:02,818
Wait…

1465
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:06,196
Did you…

1466
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:09,700
just tell me…

1467
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,494
to get lost?

1468
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:18,876
-Hey!
-[Seung-hyo] This too.

1469
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:20,711
Let's go home.

1470
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,129
Hey!

1471
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:25,174
Is this real gold?

1472
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:29,428
It's not, right? Is it?

1473
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,597
Can I bite it?

1474
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,561
[Seung-hyo] My mom and dad
didn't come to my meet,

1475
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,315
but as I looked at the girl
who skipped her exam for me, I realized.

1476
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,734
After meeting Bae Seok-ryu,

1477
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:47,196
there was never a moment
when I didn't like her.

1478
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:49,948
I'm going to lose it.

1479
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,034
But I don't have the courage to tell her

1480
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,286
because I don't want to ruin
our friendship.

1481
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,582
So instead of now,
I'll do it when I'm in my twenties.

1482
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,001
After we become adults,

1483
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:05,005
I hope I'll be able to tell Seok-ryu
how I feel then.

1484
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:09,468
Hey, Seok-ryu. Are you happy
your wish to go to the US came true?

1485
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,554
Yeah, things are looking up for me.

1486
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,808
But I'm a little lonely.

1487
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,435
[exclaims softly]

1488
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,063
[slurping]

1489
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:23,607
I'm already out.

1490
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:26,527
Hey, wait. I'll bring more.

1491
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,445
I have a lot of alcohol. A lot more.

1492
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,697
A whole bunch.

1493
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,742
-Damn it.
-[Seung-hyo] Are you okay?

1494
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,370
Your backpack's so annoying.

1495
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:41,375
Are you immigrating?
Why did you pack so much stuff?

1496
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,710
I almost forgot.

1497
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,255
I should've showed you when I got here.

1498
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:47,214
[Seok-ryu grunts]

1499
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:48,799
So this…

1500
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,969
Your mom said your hands and feet get cold

1501
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:54,263
and told me to give you
this electric heating mat.

1502
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:58,559
[exhales] My mom's ridiculous.
It's much warmer here than in Korea.

1503
01:13:59,143 --> 01:13:59,977
Really?

1504
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,814
These are…

1505
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:06,900
dried seaweed…

1506
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,613
-and cans of tuna.
-[coughs]

1507
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:14,241
They have those here too.
In any case, thanks.

1508
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,702
Here's some gochujang. And this too.

1509
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,955
A poster of DOS.

1510
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,166
I've switched over to Justin Bieber now.

1511
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,212
Okay, last but not least.

1512
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:32,050
Man, it was so hard to bring this over.

1513
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,761
I thought my shoulders
were going to break.

1514
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,056
You cried about leaving
before reading the new releases.

1515
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,308
-The series is done now.
-Hey!

1516
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:43,437
Holy cow! I wanted to read these so badly!

1517
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,274
Seriously, Seung-hyo! You're…

1518
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,318
You're the best.

1519
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:52,946
-I knew I could count on you!
-[Seung-hyo exclaiming softly]

1520

-[Seok-ryu yelps]
-[Seung-hyo] You're a habitual offender.

1532
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,704
Why is Seok-ryu
suddenly looking at me weird like that?

1533
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,748
[Mo-eum] You should be wary
of other's eyes.

1534
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:09,791
You're showing off
your behind a bit too much.

1535
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,293
Just focus on your own business.

1536
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,503
[Seok-ryu] Are you mad at me
about something?

1537
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:15,339
You're so pretty.

1538
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,341
Have you completely moved on from him?

1539
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:18,300
No.

1540
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,177
I still love him.

1541
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,261
Wake up!

01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,264
-I said get up!
-[Seung-hyo] That's enough!

01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,016
Do you think I'm a pushover?

1544
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,059
I told you.
