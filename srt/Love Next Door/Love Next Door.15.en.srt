00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,978
Wow, look at this.

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,773
Honey, did they install
a moving walkway in our neighborhood?

5
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,733
My legs are moving
on their own. [chuckles]

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,069
You fool! Stand up straight.

7
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,403
-Straight!
-Goodness.

8
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,406
Why are you so heavy? Jeez.

9
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,117
Just how much tteokbokki did you eat?

10
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,786
I had some deep-fried food.

11
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,871
I have high cholesterol.

12
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,124
-But how could I pass up good food?
-[Geun-sik] It's plant-based.

13
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,251
Why on earth
did you have to go this way?

14
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,963
Excuse me.
Does all of Hyereung-dong belong to you?

15
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,591
I wish I could, but I can't afford it.

16
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,010
Jeez, it's always about money with you.

17
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,016
Aunt Hye-suk.

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,477
Mom…

19
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,525
Seung-hyo. Seok-ryu.

20
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,735
-What are you two doing here?
-Well…

21
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,363
What's going on here?

22
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,156
I was mistaken, right?

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,742
[Geun-sik] You two brats always fight!

24
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,703
Now, you're ramming your bodies
up against each other!

25
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,163
What's the meaning of this?

26
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,581
So what happened was…

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,209
-We're dating.
-What?

28
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,087
You're… dating.

29
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,172
Are you talking about some old 80s song?

30
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,423
Wait, hold on.

31
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,092
-We…
-[Geun-sik] What?

32
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,803
We're in a serious relationship.

33
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,640
[Seok-ryu] Yes, we're sorry
we didn't tell you earlier.

34
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,393
We thought it over
for a while before doing this.

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,228
So we had to be careful.

36
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,939
[Seung-hyo] We know you're very shocked.

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,152
We know you'll be worried too. But…

38
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,407
Our feelings for each other
aren't shallow or superficial.

39
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,120
[Geun-sik] So you're telling me
they're not shaking hands right now?

40
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,205
My goodness.

41
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,915
Hey…

42
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,459
Let's go home.

43
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,880
Okay, Aunt Mi-suk. I'll go with you
and explain everything.

44
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,882
No, Seung-hyo. You go home.

45
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,552
-Seok-ryu, let's go.
-Just me?

46
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,387
No. You can't.

47
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,514
You can't take just her. I'll go too.

48
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,683
Don't you have something
you need to tell me?

49
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,519
Yes, but I'll go
to Seok-ryu's house first--

50
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,606
But I'd like to hear it now!

51
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,524
I'm sorry. But first…

52
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,860
[in French] Hey, you goddamn idiot!

53
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,279
You must think
very little of me, don't you?

54
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,199
Enough with the nonsense
and come here right now!

55
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,911
If you don't, I'll kill you!

56
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,495
[groans softly]

57
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,289
[In Korean, whispering]
What did she say?

58
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,874
It's better if you didn't know.

59
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,044
It always sounds so beautiful
when you speak French.

60
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,128
Yeah, okay.

61
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,130
-She's being pretentious again.
-[Hye-suk] Wait.

62
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,967
Hey, it's better than pretending
to be a lifelong friend like you.

63
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,970
You wouldn't have had
any friends if I didn't do that.

64
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,390
You were so cold
people called you the Ice Princess.

65
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,434
That's a personal attack!

66
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,478
Mom, why are you
being like that to Aunt Hye-suk?

67
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,063
Did you two get into a fight?

68
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,898
They did. It was bad.

69
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:52,815
[Hye-suk scoffs]

70
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,651
[sighs]

71
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,445
Seok-ryu, come with me.

72
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,239
[Geun-sik] Bye, Gyeong-jong.

73
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,157
-No, you can't.
-Seung-hyo!

74
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,159
What's wrong with you?

75
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,535
[Geun-sik] Hey!

76
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,957
Choisseung! There's a Spanish proverb.
"All sunshine makes a desert."

77
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,417
"Rain and wind make the land fertile."

78
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,254
We're going through this hardship
to become stronger.

79
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,214
-No, we can't!
-You understand, right?

80
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,591
I can't let you go by yourself.

81
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,886
-My goodness.
-We have to be together no matter what.

82
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,137
Don't worry.

83
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,390
-I'll never let you go now.
-[Hye-suk] No. All right.

84
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,516
-Don't worry.
-No.

85
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,644
-You deserve a beating.
-Choisseung! You trust me, right?

86
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,646
-Don't worry!
-Mom!

87
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,191
I think your mom is upset.
Let's go home for now. Okay?

88
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,150
Dad, wait.

89
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,070
No! Don't hit her, Aunt Mi-suk!

90
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,947
How could you hit her?

91
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,241
[in French] Shut your mouth!

92
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,660

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,957
-Mom.
-[Mi-suk] Be quiet!

96
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,875
No, wait. Just listen…

97
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,631
Seok-ryu, what did you do this time?

98
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,259
Hey, getting in trouble is my specialty.

99
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,261
You keep stealing my shtick.

100
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,595
Just butt out.

101
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,015
-[Mi-suk] Explain yourself.
-[Geun-sik] Go ahead.

102
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,892
What's going on between you and Seung-hyo?

103
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,520
It's like we said earlier.

104
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,731
We're dating and it's serious.

105
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,024
[laughing]

106
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,444
Is that funny to you?

107
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,529
-You find that funny?
-Stop lying.

108
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,906
Did you drug him? Why would he date you?

109
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,034
-I told you to butt out.
-[Dong-jin chuckles]

110
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,786
You two are dating. That's it?

111
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,788
He wanted to ask for permission first,

112
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,789
but I stopped him.

113
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,042
You and Aunt Hye-suk are friends.

114
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,336
And honestly, I wasn't confident then.

115
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,005
But I can tell you for certain now.

116
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,132
I really like Seung-hyo a lot.

117
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,885
What? You're serious?

118
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,804
It's not just a casual relationship.

119
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:52,769
[Geun-sik] Does that mean
you're considering marriage?

120
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,395
-[Mi-suk] No.
-What?

121
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,774
Whatever the case may be,
it can't be Seung-hyo.

122
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,442
-Why not?
-[Geun-sik] Yeah, why?

123
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,985
You like Seung-hyo.

124
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,488
In any case, you can't.
I'll never allow it.

125
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,656
-I've made myself clear.
-Mom.

126
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,574
Mom.

127
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,160
Your mom had a fight
with Aunt Hye-suk.

128
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:13,331
Honey, you should drink a lot of water.
You need it when you're angry.

129
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,291
It's gaslighting.

130
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,001
What?

131
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,295
I'm sure he was brainwashed by you.

132
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,172
If not, why on earth would he…

133
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,342
Come on.
You used to beat him up all the time.

134
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,594
And you dragged him around
like a rag doll.

135
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,554
I told you to butt out, didn't I?

136
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,932
-Didn't I?
-I'll butt out! I'm sorry!

137
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,143
Damn it, my hair!

138
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,564
-That damn temper of hers!
-[Seok-ryu] What did you say?

139
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,277
For someone who told us
he wanted to share a meal with us,

140
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,822
I wondered where you went every night.

141
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,991
I guess you were busy dating.

142
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,827
We still have breakfast together.

143
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,664
Yes, I've been actively taking part.
[clears throat]

144
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,290
[sighs]

145
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,794
When did you and Seok-ryu
start dating and how?

146
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,629
Who initiated it?

147
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,465
I'm sure Seok-ryu
said she liked you first.

148
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,677
You're perfect in every way,
and you're right beside her.

149
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,098
So how could she not develop
feelings for him? My word.

150
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,891
I liked her first.

151
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,895
-What?
-I've liked her since we were kids.

152
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,523
My feelings only grew after we met again.

153
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,985
Honestly, Seok-ryu told me no
and rejected me several times.

154
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,486
But I persisted.

155
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,823
Wait. Wait a second.

156
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,785
-So she turned you down?
-[sighs]

157
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,998
Well… At first, but now--

158
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,041
She is ridiculous!

159
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,420
Goodness, I really adored her,
but is she out of her mind?

160
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,589
Why? What's wrong with my son?

161
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,215
-[Gyeong-jong] I know!
-[Hye-suk] Why?

162
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,843
What is he, chopped liver?

163
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,511
-Why would she reject him?
-Hilarious.

164
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,890
I'm not saying this because you're my son,
but you don't deserve that treatment.

165
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,849
[Hye-suk] Exactly!

166
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,185
Well… What I meant was…

167
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,896
It was only like that at first,
but we're dating now.

168
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,482
-She's even accepted my proposal.
-[gasps]

169
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,150
You proposed to her too?

170
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,069
Did you make it a special event too?

171
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,864
-What?
-Look at him. He did.

172
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,908
He did do it!

173
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,328
Did you put flowers
in your car with balloons,

174
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,455
and rent out an entire restaurant too?

175
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,917

a listening device on me?

-Sit down.

179

-[Gyeong-jong] Take a seat.
-There's no point in raising a son.

180

No wonder why it's a saying.

181
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,474
Hey!

182
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,018
Remember this necklace
you got me for my birthday?

183
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,771
I already had the same one.

184
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,690
I didn't know. You should've told me then.

185
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,735
-How could I be so petty and tell you?
-You're doing it right now.

186
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,699
Want me to buy you a necklace?
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

187
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,369
Forget it! I don't need any of it!

189
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,918
Dad, I…

190
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,297
Don't even think of trying to convince me!

191
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,383
I'm on your mom's side!

192
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,678
-Dad, if you can talk to her…
-Hey.

193
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,305
My hands are already full.
Let's fight our own battles.

194
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,269

Honey, can I ask you something?

199
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,162
-No.
-[Geun-sik] Okay.

200
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,834
It's about Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo.

201
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,918
Why can't they date?

202
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,341
It's not anything personal
because of your fight with Hye-suk, right?

203
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,011
I said don't ask,
so why do you keep asking?

204
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:01,350
I know blood's thicker than water,

205
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,644
but who'd be a better son-in-law than him?

206
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,773
He's handsome, he has a great job,
and he has good character.

207
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,318
-We've known him since he was a kid.
-That's why they can't.

208
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,529
-We've known him for too long.
-What?

209
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,323
Hye-suk knows everything too.

210
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,867
Seok-ryu's canceled engagement
and illness. She knows it all.

211
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,455
I don't want that to become
a weakness for my child.

212
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,832
I don't want her to be
at a disadvantage, and above all…

213
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,793
and I don't want her to get hurt!

214
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,631
If they hurt Seok-ryu…

215
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,216
I don't care who it is,
I'll make them pay.

It's just…

220
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,207
In the past,

221
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,626
when we were busy…

222
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,463
I wonder about how Seung-hyo had felt.

223
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,882
Things like that.

224
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,011
We were terrible to him.

225
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,683
If I could turn back time,

226
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,769
I would go back to that day

227
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,146
when Seung-hyo was seven,

228
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,607
standing behind the door alone,

229
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,152
and I'd give him a hug.

230
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,614
Still, back then…

231
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,826
since Seok-ryu was by Seung-hyo's side,

232
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,662
we were so fortunate.

233
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,456
Honey.

00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,002
What's the survival rate
for stomach cancer?

235
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,091
[sighs] Never mind.

236
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,094
Pretend you didn't hear that.

You could've been hurt!

But…

253
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,059
I missed you so much.
What else could I do?

254
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,312
So I did my best impression of you.

255
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,522
Your wrist isn't fully healed yet.

257
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,651
Doing this will make it better.

258
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,991
Your parents are really upset,
aren't they?

259
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,743
No.

260

They're just a bit flustered.

-What about your parents?
-What?

262
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,753
They're a little surprised.
They're just…

263
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,671
They're flustered too.

264
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,634
-Liar.
-You lied too, babe.

265
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,887
But it's funny when you think about it.

266
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,680
What did we do that was so bad?

267
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,349
Why do we have to be so scared?

268
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,852
What did you just say?

269
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,396
"Babe"?

270
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,315
Well, yeah.

271
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,401
What happened to the person
who wanted to keep things secret?

272
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,946
Well, we've already been caught.
I don't care!

273
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,449
So if my mom doesn't approve,
you're not going to see me, babe?

275
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,078
That would never happen.

Can't you tell from how I climbed up here?

277
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,166
My instinct to fight back is kicking in.

278
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,086
Should I wear a protest headband
saying, "Seung-hyo's mine"?

[romantic music playing]

280
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,922
Not a headband.

Instead…

Do you like it?

287
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,418
Yeah, I love it.

288
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,422
But I'm curious. Why did you get
a bracelet instead of a ring?

289
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,758
Because…

290
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,137
Don't come to my workplace
and spread rumors about me.

291
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,347
I should sue you
for spreading false information.

292
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,850
What an ungrateful jerk.

293
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,477
You should repay me instead of suing me.

294
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,562
[chuckles softly]

295
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,690

296
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,609
It wasn't on purpose.

297
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,778
I guess my mind saved…

298
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,117
everything you did
and every word you said.

299
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,579
And I'll continue to do so.

300
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,664
I'll listen closely

302

No, I was happy waiting for you too.

352
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,701
Don't be ridiculous. Come on. [chuckles]

353
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,411
-You look pretty today.
-[Mo-eum] What?

354
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,328
Hello. How are you?

355
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,539
Hi, I'm fine.

356
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,374
-But don't mind me.
-[phone vibrating]

357
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,333
I'm going home.

358
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,711
Just a moment.

359
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,629
Hello, Mr. Choi.

360
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,385
-It's not Choi Seung-hyo, is it?
-It is.

361
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,596
Yes, go ahead.

362
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,015
-Is that Choisseung?
-Go.

363
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,601
I see.

364
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,394
Right now?

365
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,439
Yes, I can.

366
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,655
Right about now, I would be
on a Wolmido Island amusement ride,

367
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,783
or having chicken and beer
by the Han River.

368
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,287
But why am I here?

369
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,874
You dreamed a lot
about going on dates, didn't you?

370
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,501
Hey, are you going to handle
your boyfriend right or what?

371
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,794
Sorry.

372
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,463
We can hear you, you know.

373
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,672
So what?

374
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,757
I'm sorry.

375
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,052
We're remodeling
an elderly lady's house next week.

376
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,012
-An elderly lady?
-[Dan-ho] Yes.

377
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,890
There's an elderly lady
in the neighborhood we know.

378
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,892
She lives alone.

379
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,395
Mr. Choi took time
out of his busy schedule to help.

380
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,231
[Mo-eum] That's a such good a deed.

381
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,441
It's so good you can't complain.

382
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,403
[Seung-hyo] It's more serious
than I thought.

383
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,366
They're plywood walls, which are weak
for soundproofing or insulation.

384
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,576
Essential amenities are nonexistent.

385
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,705
They could've made a kitchen
or a bathroom in this leftover space.

386
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,666
If the owners had that kind of money,

387
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,793
they would've made more rooms like this.

388
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,671
More units mean
more rent they can collect.

389
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,881
Why would they go this far?

390
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,966
For money.

391
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,844
Recently, there have been rumors
of redevelopment.

392
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,845
Right.

393
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,890
My mom's been getting
a lot of calls about that at work.

394
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,351
But I like how Hyereung-dong is now.

395
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,603
-Me too.
-Me too.

396
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,523
Yes, me too.

397
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,776
By the way, why do you two
still speak formally with each other?

398
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,361
When are you going to speak casually?

399
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,279
-Sorry?
-What?

400
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,280
[Mo-eum] You're right.

401
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,407
We live in the same neighborhood.

402
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,994
We're friends of the same age.
You should drop formalities.

403
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,870
-It's fine.
-It's okay.

404
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,622
[Seung-hyo chuckles]

405
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,792
This is more comfortable for us.
Trust us.

406
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,961
An appropriate distance
is the key to friendship.

407
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,379
I see.

408
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,631
[Seung-hyo] Right.

409
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,841
[both laugh awkwardly]

410
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,634
-[Mo-eum] What was that?
-They seem close.

411
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,136
And at times, they don't.

412
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,021
Hey! Why has it been so hard
to reach you these days?

413
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,732
Hye-suk didn't come by here, did she?

414
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,941
[sighs]

415
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,027
She's been out of touch too.

416
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,862
The group text has been so quiet.

417
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,242
Wait, did you make
a new group text without me?

418
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,371
I'm glad you said that.
If you know how, create a new group.

419
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,874
Leave Hye-suk out.
It'll be just you, me, and In-suk.

420
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,250
What?

421
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,463
-Did you two fight again?
-I've decided to never see her again.

422
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,882
Is it serious?

423
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,052
From now on,
Hye-suk doesn't exist in my life.

424
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,637
Still, you've been friends for 40 years.

425
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:32,142
You may have your differences,
but if you cut ties with her,

426
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,561
it would be sad to see
all those years become a waste.

427
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,607
Hey, I have a lot of years ahead of me.
I can make new friends.

428
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,818
Like shoes, old friends are always
more comfortable than new ones.

429
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,196
You have a long ways to go,

430
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,074
so don't hurt yourself with new shoes.

431
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,284
[scoffs] Were you always
this good of a talker?

432
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,580
[sighs]

433
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,458
It's because I have
a lot on my mind these days.

434
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,337
I've almost attained nirvana
by letting everything go.

435
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,964
What? Is something going on with you too?

436
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,594
Mo-eum is dating Mr. Kang.

437
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,137
Mr. Kang?

438
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,264
Your next-door neighbor?

439
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,390
[gasps]

440
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,684
-Yeon-du's dad?
-Yeah.

441
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,937
So what did you do?

442
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,814
You didn't give them permission, did you?

443
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,691
[sighs] They like each other,
so what can I do?

444
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,112
Break her legs
and keep her at home?

445
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,197
Shave her head
and send her to a temple?

446
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,074
[groans]

447
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,160
Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo are dating too.

448
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,454
That's hot! I mean, it's cold!

449
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,705
What?

450
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,959
Hey, Hye-suk.

451
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,378
Sorry, Jae-suk. I'll come back later.

452
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,213
-I'm off, Jae-suk.
-I said I'm leaving!

453
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,048
Jae-suk, can you tell her I'm going

454
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,467
because it's time to go
and not because of her?

455
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,220
She must think
the world revolves around her.

456
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,849
-That little brat.
-Why are you two being so childish?

457
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,977
She's the one who always starts it.

458
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,979
Mi-suk! Goodness.

459
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,063
Where are you going?

460
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:05,402
Gosh! She's just leaving.
I had something to ask her though.

461
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,821
Hye-suk! It's been a while!

462
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,781
-How are you?
-Good.

463
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,991
What were you going to ask?

464
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,910
Well, on my way here,
I saw on the snack shop's door.

465
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,079
What was it?
It was a sign saying they're closing.

466
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,622
What?

467
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,416
-Really?
-[In-suk] Yeah.

468
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,879
What's going on?

469
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,177
[pop song playing in the background]

470
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,314
Yeon-du.

471
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,152
There's actually something
I have to tell you today.

472
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,322
The thing is…

473
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,490
I'll do it.

474
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,493
I want to do it.

475
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,711
Mmm, Yeon-du.

476
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,007
I need to ask
your permission for something.

477
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,426
What is it?

478
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,929
Can you give me…

479
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,933
the chance to become your mom?

480
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,190
I know I can't be your real mom,

481
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,651
but I can promise you a few things.

482
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:33,156
I won't force you
to eat spinach and carrots.

483
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,037
I promise to win the parents' relay race
at your kindergarten's sports day.

484
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,374
Also…

485
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,336
When you're sick,

486
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,505
and when things are hard,

487
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,758
I promise to be by your side.

[mellow music playing]

489
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,019
But if…

490
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,314
by any chance, if you'd hate that--

491
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,691
[Yeon-du] I don't hate it.

492
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,112
I mean… to be honest, I would love it.

493
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,908
-Really?
-Yes.

494
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,703
I've been waiting for this day.

495
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,707
This is a secret,
but I've dreamt about it too.

[Mo-eum exclaims]

497
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,256
Did you sleep well?
Any dreams about being an alien's friend?

498
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,841
No, I dreamt of something else.

499
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,175
What was it?

500
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,178
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

501
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,224
I went to the moon in my dream,

502
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,477
and you and Dad got married there.

503
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,357
We were wearing spacesuits
and floating around. [giggles]

505

Mo-eum,

506
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:58,116
you're my best friend in the whole world.

507

Dad, are you crying?

-I was just yawning.
-What? I don't think so.

516
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,905
You're obviously crying
because you're touched.

-We made your dad cry!
-[exclaims]

-Tissues?

00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,482
It looks so good.

526
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,360
But I don't have the energy to cook,
so I can't make it.

527
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,113
It'd be nice if I could try your food.

528
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,864
[sighs softly]

529
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,326
What are you thinking so hard about?

530
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,538
What? It's nothing.

531
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,331
Hey, you can't talk to me though.

532
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,750
We agreed to take an hour to work.

533
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,252
Don't talk to me.

534
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,963
Yeah, I'm working really hard too.

535
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,924
[playful music playing]

536
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:42,554
-I can't take this. I'll move a seat over.
-No!

537
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,765
Then, you'll want to move
two seats over and get even closer.

538
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,809
Then, you'll want to sit beside me
and hold hands.

539
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,728
No, you can't.

540
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,939
We're an ideal couple that can manage
successful careers and love.

541
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,734
What do I do?

542
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,153
I'm already done with work.

543
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,030
It's time for something else now.

544
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,907
No, not yet!

545
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,367
I still have a lot to do!

546
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,828
-I'm not finished yet!
-[Seung-hyo chuckles]

547
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,371
I'm still not done!

548
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,206
[exclaims, screams]

549
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,168
[sighs]

550
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,004
I came to work on a Saturday night
to pursue wealth and honor.

551
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,089
And I end up seeing something like that.

552
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,767
SHANTY TOWN
BEFORE AND AFTER

553
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,116
-What's this?
-A gift.

554
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,075
Open it.

555
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,662
Honey, am I dreaming right now?

556
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,581
Did I fall asleep with my eyes open?

557
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,000
You damn punk, did you mess up again?

558
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,002
What is it this time? What did you do?

559
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,087
-You little punk, you're dead!
-What?

560
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,590
What is it? Did you make another mess?

561
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,008
No, I didn't.

562
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,302
I got my paycheck,
so I bought this for Mom and Dad.

563
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,429
That makes no sense, you punk!

564
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,265
The last thing I ever got from you

565
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,601
was a colored paper flower
you made in school!

566
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,228
[Dong-jin] Wait, hold on.

567
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,563
I must've been a scumbag.

568
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,732
Take a look. It's a health supplement.

569
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,067
[Geun-sik] You're right.

570
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,193
I know what this is.

571
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,153
You and Dad are older now.

572
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,072
I got something nice
to help your blood sugar.

573
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,283
Since it's opened now,
each of you take one.

574
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,786
Here's yours, Dad.

575
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,622
Is this really that good?

576
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,208
Yeah. This is for you, Mom.

577
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,669
This is too precious to drink.

578
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,337
Hey.

579
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,798
What does that make me
if you say that? I drank all…

580
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,592
Yeah, Mom. That's like a chronic disease.

581
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,469
Be happy when your kids
give you something.

582
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,887
-Yeah.
-[Seok-ryu] Okay?

583
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,265
And use those beauty products I got you.

584
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,808
All right, I'll drink it.

585
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,394
I need to be healthy
so I don't trouble you.

586
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:58,189
I thought this punk
was trying to sell this to us. [chuckles]

587
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,191
Dong-jin, you've finally grown up.

588
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:01,943
You don't get any.

589
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,444
You still have a ways to go.

590
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,697
There you go being rude to me again.

591
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,532
Seok-ryu, Dong-jin.

592
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,075
Mom, we weren't fighting.

593
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,619
Our conversation
just got intense for a second.

594
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,954
It's not that.

595
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,333
-I have something to tell you two.
-Can I have two at once?

596
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,293
-Honey?
-Yeah?

597
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,129
I see.

598
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,507
[chuckles awkwardly]

599
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,386
Well…

600
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,432
I've decided to close the shop.

601
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,100
-What?
-Why?

602
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,978
Why do you think?
I'm at the age of retirement now.

603
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,438
The FIRE movement. Don't you know?

604
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,315
-What's that?
-You don't?

605
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,441
What is that?

606
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,200
[slow music playing]

607
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,827
[sighs softly]

608
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,916
Dad.

609
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,544
If you're here to get permission
to see Seung-hyo,

610
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,464
I have no power.
Talk it out with your mom.

611
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,051
Honestly, it's about that too,

612
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,679
but let's put him aside for now
and talk about you first.

613
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,181
What? What about me?

614
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,766
I'm worried about you.

615
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,727
Are you really okay
with closing the shop?

616
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,103
Of course, I'm okay.

617
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,023
You know I had a hard time.

618
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,069
I almost got scammed by those jerks too.

619
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,822
Gosh, the thought of being liberated
makes me so relieved.

620
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,992
It's like putting
a bunch of ice in your mouth

621
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,494
and crunching it on a hot day.

622
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,411
[both chuckle]

623
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,871
Then, that's a relief.

624
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:44,504
Still, if you become uneasy
or troubled by any chance,

625
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,339
you have to let me know.

626
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,758
What's our family's new motto?

627
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,886
"No more keeping troubles to yourself."

628
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,388
Yeah, that's it.

629
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,682
Good job, Dad.

630
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,392
[both chuckle]

631
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,436
Then, in that case,

632
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,232
are you going to hang out
with me more when I don't have work?

633
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,776
I am a little busy.

634
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,777
What?

635
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,030
So you're going to put me aside
and only hang out with Seung-hyo?

636
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,532
You little…

637
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,242
Don't even think of getting my approval.

638
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,910
Okay, I've persuaded you.

639
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,036
[Geun-sik] What?

640
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,913
What do I do about Mom?

641
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,624
Hey, I'm going to be
against it until the end.

642
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,712
Gosh, no way!
You're too precious to give up.

643
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,922
Honestly, it's true.
I have pretty eyes.

644
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,507
Jeez… I agree.

645
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,092
What was that?

646
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,137
You have pretty eyes,
but your nose is even prettier.

647
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,346
-Really?
-Let me see.

648
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,558
Look at that bridge.
It's as high as Mount Everest.

649
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,269
-[laughs]
-Come on. That's an exaggeration.

650
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,688
-It's unique. My nose takes after yours.
-Yeah.

651
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,606
-That's right.
-I have Mom's eyes.

652
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,108
Eyes? What are you talking about?

653
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,028
If I grow my hair out,
I'd look exactly like you.

654
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:50,987
[both laugh]

655
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,118
[Dan-ho] Hi, Mr. Choi.

656
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,953
Hello.

657
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,371
-Am I late?
-Of course not.

658
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,458
We're here too. Hi!

659
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,793
What? Why are you two on-scene so early?

660
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,337
I'm more of an expert
on being on-scene than you.

661
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,548
I'll be responsible for your safety today.

662
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:14,427
In that case, I can write articles
and add wallpaper.

663
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,514
And I don't mean desktop wallpaper.
I mean actual wallpaper.

664
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,641
I'm in charge of the food.

665
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,269
-You can't work on an empty stomach.
-[Seung-hyo] Wow.

666
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,313
[Myeong-u] Don't you need
more skilled personnel?

667
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,522
-Hello.
-Hello.

668
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,232
-[Myeong-u] Hello.
-Myeong-u.

669
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,984
I mean, your intentions are good,

670
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,029
but as it stands, Seung-hyo will do
all the work by himself.

671
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,655
[chuckles softly]

672
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,074
So you're here to help me?

673
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,077
Did you forget? I introduced you
to this volunteer group.

674
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,913
Okay, let's go! We must be quick
if we want to finish before sunset!

675
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,289
-I'll sit in the back.
-Yes, sir.

676
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,835
-[Dan-ho] I'll sit in the middle.
-[Mo-eum] Wow.

677
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,462
Okay.

678
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,963
[pop song playing]

679
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,799
Goodness.

680
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,516
Goodness, the walls are covered in mold.

681
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,975
We'll have to rip them out.

682
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,227
[exhales]

683
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,146
[Myeong-u] Goodness gracious.

684
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,858
-[sighs]
-[Seok-ryu] There's no kitchen.

685
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,445
Does she cook with this portable stove?

686
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,533
The area out front is too dangerous.
The stairs are cracked too.

687
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,828
There's not enough space.

688
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,454
Will this be possible?

689
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,498
We'll have to try.

690
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,958
[drill whirring]

691
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,938
-It won't withstand it. It's too old.
-Really?

692
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,439
It'll be better if we put it here.

693
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,732
-Here?
-Yeah.

694
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,114
[pop song continues playing]

695
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,712
[electric saw whirring]

696
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,138
[Myeong-u] Wow.

697
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,224
Great job.

698
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,693
Dan-ho…

699
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,279
Keep holding that.

700
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,663
-Just a bit. Good, right?
-[Dan-ho] Yes.

701
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,498
[Mo-eum] We can move over a bit more.

702
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,334
Hold on.

703
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,462
[nail gun blowing]

704
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,436
[Myeong-u] Who wants
to put up wallpaper with me?

705
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,813
No one?

706
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,106
Me!

707
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,901
Fill the gaps. Yeah.

708
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,611
-Good job.
-[Myeong-u] Let's do our best.

709
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,987
[Seok-ryu] Good, right?

710
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,998
There.

711
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,257
Goodness.

712
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,218
Is this really my house?

713
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,595
-[Dan-ho] Yes, ma'am.
-[old lady gasps]

714
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,851
Mr. Choi renovated your home.

715
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,274
[Seung-hyo] I thought you'd need it
in your daily life.

716
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,484
We made you a mini kitchen.

717
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,319
You'll be able to cook here now.

718
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,531
There's a window here.

719
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,699
[Seung-hyo chuckles softly]

720
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,745
It was the first thing I thought
when I saw this house.

721
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,539
I wanted to give you a window.

722
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,834
Now, when you come home after work,

723
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,585
open the window first.

724
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,505
You can look at the sky
and take a deep breath.

725
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,550
Whenever I'd come home
after collecting scrap paper all day,

726
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,177
it would feel so suffocating.

727
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,141
I couldn't enjoy life
and spent each day just waiting to die.

728
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,018
I felt so trapped.

729
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,354
But I can truly live life now.

730
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,525
Ma'am.

731
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,068
If you look out front,

732
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,738
we made your stairway safer
and installed handrails.

733
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,449
That was Mr. Yoon's idea.

734
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,369
Yes, well… [chuckles awkwardly]

735
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,830
It seemed a bit dangerous,
so always be careful.

736
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,623
-Thank you.
-[Myeong-u] You're welcome.

737
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,584
-Thank you so much.
-[Myeong-u] It's all right.

738
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,805
[phone vibrating]

739
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,353
Hey, Jae-suk.

740
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,813
I called to see what you were up to.

741
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,816
What do you think?
I cleaned up after dinner.

742
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,610
[laughs]

743
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,905
If you're not doing anything,
want to come by the office?

744
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,406
-[Mi-suk] Right now?
-Yeah.

745
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,533
I got a bottle of wine as a gift today.

746
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,036
They said it's really nice.

747
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,287
Okay.

748
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,417
Since we're drinking expensive wine,
I put on a wine-colored lipstick…

749
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,211
[quirky music playing]

750
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,508
-What are you doing here?
-Jae-suk called me here.

751
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,468
Did she call you too?

752
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,970
-What's going on?
-What?

753
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,013
What's going on?

754
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,975
What on earth? Was that the sound
of the door locking?

755
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,060
But we're still inside.

756
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,479
[Jae-suk] You brats! Listen up!

757
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,980
Jae-suk, what are you doing?

758
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,109
-[Jae-suk] We're the Suk Sisters…
-Hey! It's Lavender!

759
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,151
Right.

760
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,237
Lavender, formerly known as Suk Sisters.

761
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,990
The four of us met at 17,
and for 40 years,

762
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,160
we've been inseparable friends.

763
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,122
But you suddenly want to cut ties

764
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,832
and go your separate ways,

765
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,000
so how can we just sit back
and let that happen?

766
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,795
Yeah! That's not what friends do!

767
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,965
[Jae-suk] So we created an opportunity
for you to reconcile.

768
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,342
I didn't want you to get drunk and fight,

769
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,053
so I put grape juice
in the fridge instead of wine.

770
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,555
Hey, open the door. Open it now!

771
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,181
Hey, are you insane?

772
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,517
This is confinement, you know!

773
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,979
I'll open it in one hour,
so play nice until then.

774
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,481
Hey, wait! The bathroom!

775
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,858
What if we have to pee?

776
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,192
Hey, don't worry.

777
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,445
Look over there.

778
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,447
There's a chamber pot under the table.

779
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,159
My goodness, it really is there.
You crazy brat!

780
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,161
-Hey.
-Anyway, have a good time!

781
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,580
-Let's go!
-Open the door! Hey!

782
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,666
What do you take us for?
How can we pee in a chamber pot?

783
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,252
-Hey! Those little…
-Come on! Seriously…

784
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,131
[sighs softly]

785
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,179
I don't believe this.

786
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,513
I swear.

787
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,182
-Jeez.
-Come on!

788
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,155
I'm sorry about that day.

789
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,366
I think I spoke without thinking.

790
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,660
You probably said what you were thinking.

791
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,661
[scoffs]

792
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,455
You didn't hold back anything at all.

793
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,416
Don't you see I'm apologizing first?

794
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,835
-Who asked you to?
-My heart did. What?

795
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,838
I mean…

796
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,133
We can't face Seung-hyo
and Seok-ryu like this.

797
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,595
We're being petty and immature.

798
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,805
I'm thirsty.

799
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,225
-Do you want some juice?
-[Hye-suk] No.

800
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,768
What if I need to pee?

801
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,977
You can use that.

802
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,649
[amusing music playing]

803
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,989
[gulping]

804
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,244
[exclaims]

805
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,830
Hey, can I have a sip too?

806
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:27,878
[sighs]

807
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,718
[exclaims]

808
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,055
Have you ever thought about it?

809
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,224
About Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo

810
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,142
being together?

811
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,353
No, I never even imagined it.

812
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,105
[scoffs]

813
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,982
I was so flustered.

814
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,567
[scoffs]

815
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,821
What were you so flustered about?

816
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,739
It wasn't something expected.

817
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,866
So? What do you want to do?

818
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,326
What's there for us to do?

819
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,370
After hearing about it,

820
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,330
it seems they just started to date.

821
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,459
-Is that what Seung-hyo said?
-[Hye-suk] No.

822
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,921
It's not that.

823
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,051
What I mean is, let's wait
and respect what they choose to do.

824
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,052
[scoffs]

825
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,137
Wait?

826
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,224
It sounds like you want them to break up.

827
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,183
[sighs]

828
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,061
So what I mean is

829
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,897
we shouldn't make
hasty judgments or decisions.

830
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,567
-Seok-ryu's been through a lot too.
-Like what?

831
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,944
Her canceled engagement? Or…

832
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,654
Her cancer?

833
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,573
Hey.

834
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,410
It seems you're trying
to find fault in Seok-ryu with that.

835
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,579
Forget it. I'm against it too.

836
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,666
I have no desire
to make him my son-in-law at all.

837
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,043
Hey, Mi-suk!

838
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,754
What on earth do you take me for?

839
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,964
Also, what's wrong with my son?

840
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,592
There's nothing wrong with him.
You're the problem!

841
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,885
You for a mother-in-law?

842
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,429
Wow, I'd be crazy to let
my daughter marry into that.

843
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,680
Hey! Are you done?

844
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,390
No, I have more to say!

845
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,143
If you can't fix that personality of yours
in this day and age,

846
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,731
Seung-hyo's going to be
on the fast track to die a bachelor.

847
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,232
Hey!

848
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,734
HYEREUNG REALTY

849
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,902
[Jae-suk chuckles]

850
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,904
It should be over by now, right?

851
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,238
Let's open up and see.

852
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,753
[gasps]

853
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,254
[quirky music playing]

854
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,218
[Mi-suk, Hye-suk groaning]

855
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,681
[Mi-suk] Hey, I swear
if I ever talk to you again,

856
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,683
I'll change my name.

857
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,559
Instead of Na Mi-suk, I'll be Ga Mi-suk.

858
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,187
Fine, change it. Go ahead. [laughs]

859
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,982
Sure. Why don't you
go with Da Mi-suk then?

860
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,486
If I ever end up talking to you,

861
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:02,366
I'll bark. Woof, woof!

862
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,035
I'll become a dog.

863
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,871
[sighs] Our plan failed.

864
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,998
Let's go.

865
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,168
These darn brats.

866
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,462
Goodness!

867
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,392
STIR-FRIED TOMATO AND ACORN JELLY

868
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,103
[chuckles softly] She's gotten more views.

869
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,859
[lady] I'm sick, and I saw your video
while searching for healthy food.

870
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,486
It looks so good.

871
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,448
But I don't have the energy to cook,
so I can't make it.

872
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,576
-It'd be nice if I could try your food.
-[knock on door]

873
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,745
Seung-hyo, come on out!

874
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,750
Professor Kim Chi-hun recommended us?

875
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,087
Yes, he said you were
the top architect these days

876
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,090
-and praised you so much that I came here.
-[Myeong-u chuckles]

877
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,051
Coming from Gangnam,
the traffic was so bad.

878
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,097
Is there a reason why you built
your office outside of Seoul?

879
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,724
This is where I grew up.

880
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:13,020
A good location became available
while I was looking for a site.

881
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:14,897
Well…

882
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,442
There were rumors
of redevelopment in Hyereung-dong.

883
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,695
Do you know anything by any chance?

884
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,363
-Sorry?
-[exhales]

885
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,867
These days, finding trendy things
in run-down areas is all the rage.

886
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,786
I thought you may have heard
some premium information.

887
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,163
[Myeong-u chuckles awkwardly]

888
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,208
Well, we've heard about it too,
but it's just a rumor.

889
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,335
Nothing's really happening.

890
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,254
[chuckles softly] Yes,
we didn't come here for that.

891
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,881
Then, that's disappointing.

892
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,008
I mean, I was hoping

893
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,594
you had a good feel for making money.

894
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:50,140
But it's surprising to hear you came here
simply because you liked the place.

895
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,353
I'm planning to put up a building.

896
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:58,774
I need someone who can deliver
as much value as I invest.

897
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:03,111
But if you're this out of touch
with reality, it'll be a problem.

898
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,573
On my way here,
the commercial area looked tiny.

899
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,825
And there was a shanty town off that way.

900
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,077
This area looked lousy.

901
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,749
I think it's best if you look
for a different architecture firm.

902
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,918
-Hey.
-[client] Is that so?

903
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,045
You were right.

904
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:25,884
I don't think we're equipped
to meet what you're looking for.

905
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,177
[chuckles]

906
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,138
It seems you're being like this
because I was a bit blunt.

907
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,807
Still,

908
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,726
you're going to refuse a referral?

909
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,603
Yes, sir.

910
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,105
Turning down a project

911
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,899
won't really impact
our livelihood that much.

912
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,859
-Right? [chuckles]
-What?

913
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:43,986
[Myeong-u chuckles]

914
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,446
We aim to work with clients
who align with our goals

915
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,323
and avoid those who don't.

916
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,075
How was that?

917
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,952
[giggles]

918
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,458
-Myeong-u, is this really okay?
-[Myeong-u] About what?

919
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:03,839
I mean, it's a building after all.
Won't it be a shame to turn it down?

920
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,800
You're the one who said
you wouldn't do it first.

921
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,510
Well, I wouldn't say that.

922
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,388
Still, how could you end things like that?

923
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,057
I mean, I've always been like this,
but you…

924
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,559
[Myeong-u] What about me?

925
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,353
What, am I someone who has a knack
for finding ways to make money?

926
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:22,316
Am I some monster born from capitalism,
always crunching numbers on a calculator?

927
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,525
-Yeah.
-[groans]

928
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,903
But you're a rational pragmatist.

929
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,614
[amusing music playing]

930
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,658
But what am I going to do?

931
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,078
I mean, I'm becoming more and more
of a romantic these days.

932
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,913
What are you talking about?

933
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,540
After the retirement community project

934
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,084
and the renovated shanty townhouse,
I started to think a lot.

935
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,544
How can I put it?

936
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,255
Working on something flashy
and extravagant

937
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,591
didn't make my heart feel as full.

938
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,717
That's right.

939
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,010
-Me too.
-[Myeong-u] Yeah.

940
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,554
Sometimes, I think this is why
I went into architecture.

941
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,056
You little punk.

942
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,266
Is this why you wanted
to build our office here?

943
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,143
You wanted to slowly change me,
didn't you?

944
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,145
Let's say I was looking
at the big picture.

945
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,521
[sighs]

946
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,399
But I need to enroll the twins
to an English academy.

947
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,151
And I want to buy
an apartment in Gangnam.

948
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,029
-Seok-ryu can teach them English.
-Yeah?

949
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,864
-And I'll build you a house.
-What?

950
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,534
Really? Okay, you promised.
A verbal contract is still a contract.

951
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,036
Go and write it down.

952
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,163
-I'll sign it.
-Hey! You reminded me.

953
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,333
I went to the district office
to turn in some documents. Look.

954
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,584
They had this.

955
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,051
"Our Neighborhood's Architect."
What's this?

956
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,303
It's a program at the district office.

957
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,348
They provide free consultations
for residents.

958
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,809
They also improve living conditions
for neglected spaces.

959
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,769
Like how you renovated
the shanty townhouse?

960
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,562
Yeah.

961
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,941
A lot of shops are closing
and old alleys are being abandoned.

962
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,151
They preserve neighborhood culture too.

963
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,529
Wow.

964
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,323
You'll become the protector
of Hyereung-dong.

965
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,700
I have to be selected first.

966
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,828
Of course, they'll select you.
What do you mean?

967
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,789
I heard construction for the pool
and gym will start soon.

968
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,208
That's pretty cool, Choisseung.

969
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,586
You're like the architect
in charge of Hyereung-dong.

970
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,882
Everyone calls me an architect,

971
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,552
but I'm actually a licensed architect.

972
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,512
The difference between the two is--

973
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,639
I should work harder too.

974
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,724
What?

975
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,310
[sighs] Seeing you venture out like this

976
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,771
makes me want to do the same.

977
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,276
All I can do is make videos right now,

978
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:34,156
but I want to actually serve people
my food one day.

979
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,285
I want to cook
pots of happiness for them.

980
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,585
-[Gyeong-jong clears throat]
-[Geun-sik sighs]

981
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:52,924
I had no idea sitting with you like this
would become so awkward.

982
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,262
Did you want to see me
about Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo?

983
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,140
It's about our wives.

984
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,434
Right.

985
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,145
It's a full-scale war they're having.

986
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,106
I wouldn't be surprised
if nuclear bombs started falling.

987
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,232
[bangs table]

988
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:14,279
As the neutral party,
shouldn't we try to settle them down?

989
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,907
Yes, you're right.

990
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:18,950
Then…

991
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,870
[amusing music playing]

992
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,497
Yes, in situations like this,

993
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,333
instead of being so serious and sober,

994
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:30,712
we need a slightly more relaxed,
peaceful atmosphere.

995
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,840
Regardless of the time or place,

996
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,385
we always need this
for these types of conversations.

997
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,512
[chuckles]

998
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,306
They say the truth
comes out when you drink.

999
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,225
[Geun-sik chuckling] Exactly!

1000
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,309
Click, clack!

1001
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,897
I guess we're having soju
instead of kaoliang today.

1002
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:53,068
We can't always drink the expensive stuff!
Come on! My shop's closing!

1003
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,111
We're shutting down and you ask for…

1004
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,782
Or bring in something
nice to drink too then.

1005
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,243
[exclaims]

1006
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,162
-Hey, did you hear?
-What?

1007
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,081
Root Diner is closing.

1008
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,209
Business was never good there.
They rarely had customers.

1009
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,210
I know.

1010
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,712
Flies didn't even touch their food.

1011
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,880
[lady 1] Good grief!

1012
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,300
[lady 2] Not only is her daughter jobless
but her husband's shop closed too.

1013
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,426
[both] Goodness.

1014
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,554
-I can't believe her luck.
-I know.

1015
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,597
-Goodness.
-What's wrong with my luck?

1016
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,058
M-Mi-suk!

1017
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,727
I put kimchi in the ground the other day.

1018
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,354
Today, I'll put you in the dirt!

1019
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,231
You can bad-mouth me.

1020
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,776
But my daughter and husband?

1021
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,696
If you mess with my family, you'll pay!

1022
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,073
-Goodness!
-Wait!

1023
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:43,159
[straining] Hey,
why aren't you budging? Darn it!

1024
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,162
-What are you going to do about it?
-[Mi-suk screaming]

1025
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,247
[grunting]

1026
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,624
[Hye-suk] Hey!

1027
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,214
What do you think you're doing? Well?

1028
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,674
-Mi-suk, are you okay?
-Hey.

1029
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,384
-Are you insane?
-[lady 1] Goodness.

1030
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:03,889
-Hey!
-Jeez, why are you butting in?

1031
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,432
-Hey!
-[Hye-suk] My goodness!

1032
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,893
-You little… How dare you?
-[Hye-suk] Hey! I'm okay.

1033
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,477
You're dead!

1034
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,229
[ladies clamoring]

1035
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,149
-[lady 3] What's with you?
-[lady 2] Jeez, stop it!

1036
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,276
-[lady 2] What?
-[lady 3] You!

1037
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,069
[ladies clamoring]

1038
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,529
[Mi-suk] Are you insane?

1039
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,489
Jeez, all she's good at is studying!

1040
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,285
Now, this feels more like it!

1041
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,245
-Hey!
-[pleasant music playing]

1042
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,956
-Let go!
-[lady 2] Hey!

1043
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,375
[ladies clamoring]

1044
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,295
[screaming]

1045
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,908
HYEREUNG POLICE STATION

1046
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,076
[Mi-suk] They're the ones…

1047
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,535
-Hye-suk!
-Mi-suk!

1048
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,162
Mi-suk, who did this?

1049
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,665
-What's going on?
-Why did you two come together?

1050
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,832
They reek of alcohol.

1051
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,626
Wait, were you two together again?

1052
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,044
No, not at all.

1053
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,505
-No way. Where were you?
-[Seok-ryu] Mom!

1054
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,131
-Aunt Hye-suk!
-Hey!

1055
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:23,718
-Are you two okay?
-Jeez, they keep coming in pairs.

1056
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,719
Were you together too?

1057
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,055
-Were you?
-You two pairs should be embarrassed.

1058
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,307
You two are in no position
to talk that way.

1059
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,893
It's not them, is it?

1060
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,687
Hello. What are you doing here?

1061
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,356
-Wait…
-[Seok-ryu] Is that blood?

1062
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,984
Are you okay? My goodness.

1063
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,237
Why did you settle?
They were in the wrong first.

1064
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,656
Just think of it as paying
for their treatment.

1065
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,575
They were clearly the ones
who got badly beaten up.

1066
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,995
That's right.
It'll take them two weeks to recover.

1067
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,206
Honey, find a lawyer.
We're going to sue them for slander.

1068
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:56,459
Still, seeing some action
after all this time was so refreshing.

1069
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,169
[chuckles]

1070
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,796
Hey, you remember?

1071
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,717
When that bully was shaking me down
in that back alley?

1072
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,135
-You came.
-Yeah!

1073
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,012
-And you saved me.
-That's right!

1074
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,389
I took my backpack and lunchbox

1075
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,434
-and ran in swinging them at her.
-[Hye-suk] That's what I did today.

1076
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,019
-Yeah, you copied me.
-I remembered.

1077
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,521
You hit the scariest lady
with the green onion.

1078
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,440
-Her eye got so swollen.
-So swollen!

1079
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,151
-She said she'd kill us.
-Mom, Aunt Mi-suk.

1080
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,320
Have you two made up now?

1081
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,405
What?

1082
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,037
They have.

1083
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,414
[Seung-hyo chuckles]

1084
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,458
-Something's on my face?
-Yeah.

1085
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,667
What is that?

1086
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,340
[Mi-suk scoffs]

1087
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,968
What's with that basket?

1088
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,847
I've never seen you carry
anything like that around before.

1089
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,478
I have a lot of time now.

1090
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,647
I should try to cook more at home.

1091
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,401
It looks like you'll be wasting
ingredients for no reason.

1092
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,737
Then, teach me.

1093
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,698
I bought some bracken,

1094
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,659
but I don't know how to cook it.

1095
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,370
There's a bunch of good cookbooks.
Why learn from me?

1096
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,082
The food you make tastes the best.

1097
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,709
You can't teach the feel for cooking.

1098
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,965
I'll cook it tomorrow, so just take it.

1099
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,593
[mellow music playing]

1100
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,137
[chuckles softly] I swear…

1101
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,808
I didn't think I'd ever get
to eat it again after we fought.

1102
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,309
Goodness.

1103
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,561
That's such a relief.

1104
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,773
All you could think about
after we cut ties was bracken?

1105
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,692
Of course. That dish is important to me.

1106
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:49,114
You'd always make that dish first
for me whenever I came to Korea

1107
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,490
and every time I left for work.

1108
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,535
You'd always pack
a bunch of it in ice for me.

1109
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,954
Gosh, when did I ever do that?

1110
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,832
Whenever I opened a food container,

1111
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:03,128
it overflowed with your friendship.

1112
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,671
How could I ever forget that?

1113
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,177
Why do you…

1114
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,097
keep making me feel so small?

1115
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:20,395
Fine, I'll be honest. I felt inferior.

1116
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,441
You can speak English and French.

1117
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,194
You communicated with locals
and earned a living abroad.

1118
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,322
But I got paid to look after Seung-hyo.

1119
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:36,494
It would've been nice to have looked after
your son without taking money.

1120
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,704
Are you insane?

1121
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,623
Why would you not take pay
for such priceless work?

1122
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,962
Seung-hyo grew up well all thanks to you.

1123
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,256
Raising a human being

1124
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,967
is an incredible feat.

1125
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,594
Not anyone can do it.

1126
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,223
You did the same for me.

1127
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,770
When I was eating lunch alone
after starting school,

1128
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,314
you came over to me and said,

1129
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,691
"I heard your name's Seo Hye-suk."

1130
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,236
"We're short a Suk Sister member.
Want to join?"

1131
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,529
[chuckles]

1132
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,660
That's why I'm not going to
be formal when we're in-laws.

1133
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,792
-Hye-suk.
-Yeah, just call me by my name.

1134
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,879
I'm going to call you by your name too.

1135
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,088
That's what I'll do.

1136
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,345
Even if our kids get married,
our friendship comes first.

1137
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,225
Are you giving them your blessing?

1138
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,309
Jeez.

1139
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,938
I was never against them
in the first place.

1140
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,982
Yeah, right! You looked so displeased.

1141
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,612
Be honest.
It bothers you that Seok-ryu was sick.

1142
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,739
Of course, it does!

1143
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,909
Seok-ryu was sick,
so how could I not be worried?

1144
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,953
She's your precious child.

1145
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,746
The apple of your eye.

1146
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,748
She's the daughter of my best friend.

1147
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,960
[pop song playing]

1148
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,044
[sighs]

1149
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,631
You know how much I adore her.

1150
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,802
How could I not care about her?

1151
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,935
Goodness.

1152
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,690
I didn't know you felt that way.

1153
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,402
I was afraid
she'd be devastated if you said no.

1154
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,991
After she was sick and alone
in a foreign land, I had to protect her.

1155
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,701
[sighs, sniffles]

1156
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,541
Mi-suk.

1157
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,754
I'll protect her with you.

1158
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,134
Just like how you raised Seung-hyo,

1159
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,678
I'll love and take care of Seok-ryu too.

1160
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,226
Thanks.

1161
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,062
I'm so grateful.

1162
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,897
I'm more grateful.

1163
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,276
-No, I am.
-[Hye-suk] You brat.

1164
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,904
[Mi-suk chuckles] I'm so sorry
I hit you back then.

1165
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:17,989
[Hye-suk] It hurt.

1166
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,783
You silly brat.

1167
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,036
-Goodness.
-What are they doing?

1168
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,079
Hey, we know you're there.

1169
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,331
Come on out.

1170
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,457
Seriously.

1171
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:32,295
-How long have you been back there?
-[Hye-suk] Goodness, Seok-ryu.

1172
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:38,009
You've always been so smart
and dependable since you were young.

1173
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,011
Maybe we were meant to be.

1174
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,015
Take care of Seung-hyo for me.

1175
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,184
Okay, I will.

1176
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,437
-Seung-hyo.
-[Hye-suk] Goodness.

1177
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,563
[Seung-hyo chuckles]

1178
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,775
[Mi-suk groans]

1179
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,028
You know you're half my son, right?

1180
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,988
Of course.

1181
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,658
If Seok-ryu hits and bothers you,

1182
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,117
you can tell me.

1183
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,620
-I'll punish her.
-You can tell on him too.

1184
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,955
-Okay.
-Got it? Tell me everything.

1185
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,209
[Geun-sik] They say as men age,
there's an increase in estrogen,

1186
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,586
and they cry more too. [whimpers]

1187
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,423
[voice shaking] Is it true, Gyeong-jong?

1188
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,302
To be precise, testosterone decreases.

1189
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,931
The ratio of estrogen
increases relatively.

1190
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,724
I can't look at them.
Do you have any meds?

1191
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,644
I can't stand them!
What's wrong with those two?

1192
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,479
What happened?

1193
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:35,358
[faintly] They're always hanging out
and drinking together these days.

1194
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:02,760
[door closes]

1195
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,303
[slow music playing]

1196
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:06,889
[mutters]

1197
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,615
[sighs]

1198
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,453
Hey. Where are the kids?

1199
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,705
I think they're still sleeping.

1200
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,498
[Geun-sik] I see.

1201
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,792
-I'm off.
-[Mi-suk] Okay.

1202
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,337
How does it feel to go
to work for the last time?

1203
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,091
[laughs] Well, it feels the same.

1204
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,802
Close up and come home early today.

1205
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,970
Let's have some soju.

1206
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,097
Okay. [chuckles]

1207
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,432
Bye.

1208
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,312
[sighs]

1209
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,236
-Great work.
-Yeah, you too.

1210
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,530
Ms. Jung,
the director's looking for you.

1211
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,948
-Me?
-[man] Yes.

1212
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,205
-Oh, hello, sir.

[clap hands]

1214
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,499
Congratulations.

1215
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:15,958
For what?

1216
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,251
Goodness.

1217
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,421
How will you adapt in such a far-off place
if you're that clueless?

1218
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,215
-What?
-Ms. Jung.

1219
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:27,011
You've been selected as the safety officer
for the South Pole research station.

1220
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,514
-Wow!
-Wow!

1221
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,141
Me? Really?

1222
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,268
I just got the official letter.

1223
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,853
You're the first-ever woman selected.

1224
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,146
-Wow.
-[members exclaiming]

1225
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,024
[director] In two weeks,
on-site adaptation training will start.

1226
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,235
-Job training and orientation too.
-Yes, sir.

1227
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,570
After that, you'll leave
at the start of next month.

1228
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,240
What? That quickly?

1229
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,950
Yeah, get ready.

1230
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,619
Now, let's give her a round of applause.

1231
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,162
[all cheering]

1232
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:54,997
Thank you.

1233
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,469
Jeez, my last day's a bust too.

1234
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,596
Goodness!

1235
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,600
-Are you open?
-Of course.

1236
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,143
You can sit wherever you'd like.

1237
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,314
[both chuckle]

1238
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,402
Okay, here you go.

1239
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,862
I didn't order the fish cakes.

1240
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:26,904
What?

1241
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:28,781
It's on the house.

1242
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,157
-[laughing]
-[chuckles softly]

1243
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,450
Enjoy.

1244
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,328
You gave me an extra fish cake
in the past too.

1245
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:35,913
What?

1246
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,541
I lived in this neighborhood
ten years ago.

1247
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,625
Is that so?

1248
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,128
I came to eat tteokbokki
after bombing my finals.

1249
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:46,340
You gave me fish cakes
and told me to cheer up.

1250
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:50,261
[chuckling] Really? I did that?

1251
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,597
I came to meet a friend and stopped by.

1252
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,057
You and the fish cakes haven't changed.

1253
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,392
[slow music playing]

1254
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,104
-Have one more.
-No, that's okay.

1255
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,188
[Geun-sik chuckles]

1256
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,316
-Do you want some sundae?
-No, it's fine.

1257
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,860
I want to give you some.

1258
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,947
To be honest, today's my last day.

1259
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,575
CLOSING AFTER SEPTEMBER 13

1260
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:14,952
I see.

1261
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,955
I would've regretted it if I didn't come.

1262
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,459
Thank you for the food.

1263
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,051

1264

[sighs]

1266
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,080
-Honey.
-Dad, we're here.

1267
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,331
What brings you here?

1268
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:03,751
What do you think?
We're here to eat your tteokbokki.

1269
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,421
-I don't think we're the only customers.
-Hmm?

1270
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,257
What? You're all here?
We came for some deep-fried food.

1271
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,968
Honey, what did you say was good?

1272
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,261
The deep-fried peppers.
You still have some left, right?

1273
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:18,474
Gosh, what on earth is going on? Goodness.

1274
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,435
-Hello!
-The shop's too small.

1275
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,354
-Where will you sit?
-We're here too!

1276
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,730
[playful music playing]

1277
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,774
-[Geun-sik] Goodness.
-Sit down.

1278
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:27,900
[exclaims]

1279
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:28,901
Hey, kiddo!

1280
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:34,407
Yeon-du, you haven't had
tteokbokki yet, right?

1281
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,618
-[Yeon-du] That's right!
-Yeon-du, you're so lucky.

1282
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:41,998
The first tteokbokki you'll ever have
will be from Root Diner!

1283
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,624
[all cheering]

1284
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,752
If you put the tables together,
move them back when you leave.

1285
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,587
-All right, already!
-Fine!

1286
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,880
[Dong-jin] Stop it, Mom!

1287
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,133
I'll do it.
That's why I have these muscles.

1288
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:54,176
-[all exclaiming]
-There we go!

1289
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,262
-He takes after me.
-[all laughing]

1290
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:57,847
What's going on?

1291
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,265
Are we the last ones here?

1292
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,017
-We came right after work.
-Hello.

1293
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,436
And you are?

1294
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,314
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Kang Dan-ho from The Chungwoo Daily.

1295
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,483
What's a reporter doing here?

1296
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,193
Well…

1297
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:12,862
He's my boyfriend.

1298
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,113
-Gross.
-[everyone cheering]

1299
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,949
-[Geun-sik laughs]
-Who knew she was such a cute fool?

1300
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,325
She's so adorable.

1301
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,037
-Thank you for coming.
-No, it's fine.

1302
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,331
I'm preparing a special article
on retirement.

1303
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,626
If it's okay with you,
could I interview you?

1304
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,961
-[Mi-suk] Ooh.
-[Geun-sik] Me?

[chuckles]

1309
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,223
This is my first time.

1310
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,266
[Gyeong-jong] Cheers!

1311
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:43,350
First…

1312
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:47,688
You're about to retire,
so how does it feel?

1313
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,106
Well…

1314
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,568
I don't really know.

1315
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:56,530
I cut vegetables and make broth.

1316
01:07:56,614 --> 01:08:00,576
Then, I soak the rice cakes.
I did that every morning.

1317
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,412
Once I stop and become comfortable,

1318
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:07,083
maybe it'll start to sink in then.

1319
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,542
I'm sure it will.

1320
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:13,005
So now that you're about to retire,
what do you regret the most?

1321
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,300
Also, what are you
looking forward to the most?

1322
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:17,968
[inhales]

1323
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,179
Regret?

1324
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,682
To be honest, what I regret is…

1325
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,273
[slow music playing]

1326
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,902
[voice shaking] I don't think
I regret anything.

1327
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,196
[groans softly]

1328
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,326
Honestly… Goodness. [chuckles]

1329
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,955
So many things didn't go my way.

1330
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,041
But that's life, you know?

1331
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,544
Yeah.

1332
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,505
Rather,

1333
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:58,384
I have more happy memories of this place.

1334
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,510
[chuckles] Gosh.

1335
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,970
[sniffles]

1336
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,389
"It tastes good."

1337
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,810
I loved hearing that.

1338
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,188
[chuckles softly]

1339
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:15,985
Also, what I look forward to is…

1340
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:19,613
my family.

1341
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:26,036
I've been busy my whole life
and used that as an excuse.

1342
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,080
-[inaudible conversation]
-[Geun-sik] Finally,

1343
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:31,542
it feels like… I can return

1344
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,128
to my family now.

1345
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:47,308
[Dan-ho] What'd you like to tell yourself
after all the hard work you've done?

1346
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,809
Well… [sighs]

1347
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,814
"Great job."

1348
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,609
"You worked hard,

1349
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:58,986

1352
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:26,388
Hey.

1353
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:29,266
Why are you still here?

1354
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:30,684
Did you think we'd leave you?

1355
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,395
We said we'd clean up with you.

1356
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,065
I needed some time to myself.

1357
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,233
[Dong-jin] Yeah, Mom.

1358
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,652
Respect a man's need for solitude.

1359
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:44,031
Dad, did you say farewell
to your beloved shop?

1360
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:47,785
Yeah, it was a passionate goodbye.

1361
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:50,663
Great. Let's go home now.

1362
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:52,873
Let's go!

1363
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,625
[Seok-ryu] And we're off!

1364
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,170
You're really unemployed now.

1365
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,588
-Yeah.
-What will you do tomorrow?

1366
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,132
Tomorrow?

1367
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,885
Hey, son. Let's go play billiards.

1368
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,554
[groans] I have to study
for my exam tomorrow.

1369
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,140
You punk. One day won't decide
if you pass or fail.

1370
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:11,058
Hey!

1371
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:14,228
Seriously? He wants to study.
Don't interfere with that!

1372
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,063
Dong-jin hasn't studied in so long.

1373
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,607
Look at this.
Did you see your mom, Seok-ryu?

1374
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,943
She's already looking down on me
for being unemployed.

1375
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:24,738
Stop. Let them have each other.
Let's play badminton tomorrow.

1376
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,449
-Badminton? I don't want to play with you.
-Yeah, I get it.

1377
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,244
You're going to keep playing
until you win!

1378
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,371
-That's right!
-No, I don't.

1379
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:36,542
Dad, don't do it. I got stuck playing
board games with her for seven hours once.

1380
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,296
Hey, that was because
you kept buying the best spot!

1381
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,632
Gosh, I'm exhausted
from staying up this late.

1382
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,260
Hold on. Don't be rude
to your sister like that!

1383
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:47,928
-That's right, you punk!
-What did I do?

1384
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,555
-What?
-You punk!

1385
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,432
-[Dong-jin] What?
-You too!

1386
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,225
-Don't say that to your kid brother.
-Yeah.

1387
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,227
-Don't call him a punk.
-[Dong-jin] Yeah.

1388
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,313
-[Geun-sik] He's my child too.
-[Mi-suk] Yeah, but…

1389
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,857
[Seok-ryu] Okay, fine. Hey, you wimp!

1390
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,574
[phone vibrating]

1391
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,803
[Seung-hyo] Seok-ryu.

1392
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:31,430
Choisseung!

1393
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,641
Why are you here alone? It's dangerous.

1394
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,352
I was waiting for you.

1395
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,523
I thought being with family was
the right thing tonight, so I didn't call.

1396
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:45,944
How's your dad? Is he okay?

1397
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,365
He took some soju
to the rooftop with my mom.

1398
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,409
That's nice.

1399
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,121
Having someone
by your side on a day like this…

1400
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:58,999
[pop song playing]

1401
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,794
I have something for you.

1402
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,713
What? What is it?

1403
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,388
It's sanjeok.

1404
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,515
I tried to give this to you before,
but I couldn't.

1405
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:17,267
I can't believe I didn't eat it back then.

1406
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,685
I ruined my own luck.

1407
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,563
-Can I try one?
-Yeah.

1408
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:35,869
Wow.

1409
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,622
It's so good.

1410
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:40,207
Of course.

1411
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:45,003
I prepared and cooked the tree onions,
bellflowers, carrots, and beef one by one.

1412
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,715
I put them on skewers
and covered them in egg wash.

1413
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,467
It was a lot of work.

1414
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,510
It looks like it.

1415
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,972
And it smelled like oil so much.

1416
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:58,475
I thought I had become
one with cooking oil.

1417
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,311
Gosh, you worked so hard.

1418
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,312
[Seok-ryu] Yeah.

1419
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,857
But still,

1420
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,067
despite that,

1421
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,528
I'll always make it for you.

1422
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:14,992
Unless you tell me you're sick of them,

1423
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:18,036
I'll make sanjeok for you forever.

1424
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,833
I'm so lucky.

1425
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,336
This is my proposal.

1426
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:35,429
I mean, I thought
being proposed to twice was a bit much.

1427
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,683
So I wanted to balance it out.

1428
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:44,771
Does that mean…

1429
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,275
I can eat rainbows forever?

1430
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,777
Yeah, all colors of the rainbow.

1431
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,655
Whatever color you want
and as much as you want.

1432
01:14:57,868 --> 01:15:00,078
That's the sweetest proposal in the world.

1433
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,874
So, is that a yes?

1434
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,504
Yes. Gladly.

1435
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,147
Thank you.

1436
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:29,733
For what?

1437
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,527
For everything.

1438
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:35,364
For back then and now.

1439
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:37,491
Everything.

1440
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:58,387
[pop song playing]

1441
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:33,422
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1442
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,423
[chuckles softly]

1443
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:35,966
-My eyes!
-It's not weird stuff.

1444
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,636
We legitimately have official approval
from both families now.

1445
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,223
[Seung-hyo] There's no time to waste
for us to catch up on 30 years of romance.

1446
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,183
Let's go on a date. Don't worry.

1447
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,144
You'll be safe next to me.

1448
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,979
[Dan-ho] Why won't she be around?

1449
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:51,148
[man] She was assigned to the South Pole.

1450
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:52,733
[Myeong-u] Seung-hyo.

1451
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,402
Help me out, Myeong-u.
I want to get married too.

1452
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:57,070
You two are becoming in-laws?

1453
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,905
Let's have the wedding next spring.

1454
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:02,576
Why? Strike while the iron's hot.
Just do it before the year's end.

1455
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,625
