00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,910
Just wait, my baby.
I'll make it look nice for you.

[young Seung-hyo crying]

00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,300
What am I going to do now?

[continues crying]

8
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,638
Don't worry. It'll be all gone
when you wake up tomorrow.

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,932
What if it's not gone?

10
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,725
Then…

11
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,312
I'll take responsibility.

12
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,399
I, Bae Seok-ryu, will take responsibility
for you, Choi Seung-hyo.

13
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,359
I promise.

14
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,903
Seal it.

15
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,741
Good. Great job.

17
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,995
Okay. Let's eat this.

[amusing music continues playing]

19
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,592
I said I didn't need the banana milk.
Why did you buy it?

20
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,469
That was that, and this is this.

21
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,179
What?

22
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:23,726
What is "that"?
What do you mean by "that was that"?

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,603
What do you think? It's "that."

24
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,231
In English, it's called "that."
It's a demonstrative pronoun.

25
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,692
Yeah, I know. That's what that is.

26
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,194
But what I meant… was that…

27
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,321
Jeez.

28
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,407
This word's losing all meaning.

29
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,994
Hey.

30
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,162
What?

31
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,247
What are we now?

32
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,040
I don't know.

33
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,377
Whatever a relationship after a kiss is?

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,295
Hey!

35
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,380
That kiss…

36
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,133
Can you not say that word
so suddenly like that?

37
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,094
I don't kiss my friends.

38
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,763
I said stop doing that!

39
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,891
We're not kissing now. We did before.

40
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,183
No, what I meant was…

41
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,353
Stop saying that word itself.

42
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,981
-The word? Kiss?
-Stop!

43
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,482
[chuckles softly]

44
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,613
Also, I don't do that
with my friends either.

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,656
Then, it's settled.

46
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,034
We're not friends anymore.

47
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:21,993
[scoffs]

48
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,955
How can 30 years of friendship
end just like that?

49
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,542
It was the hardest thing
I've done in my life.

50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,046
Winning an Olympic medal
would've been easier.

51
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,675
[Myeong-u] Seung-hyo! Seok-ryu!

52
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,346
-Mr. Yoon.
-What? You two already met up?

53
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,931
You were looking frantically for him.

54
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,016
I thought he owed you
money or something.

55
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,267
-Really?
-[Myeong-u] Yeah.

56
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,605
Goodness, Mr. Yoon!
When did I ever act like that?

57
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,190
-You did…
-[Seok-ryu] Jeez.

58
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,484
[Na-yun] Then, why did you come here?

59
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,363
I mean, why would you come
all the way from Seoul to see him?

60
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,114
-Well, actually--
-Hey!

61
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,824
-Hold on! [chuckles]
-You scared me.

62
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,369
Do you really think
I came here to see him?

63
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,122
I just came and was in the area,
so I thought I'd call him.

64
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,832
[Myeong-u chuckles] Right.

65
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,168
Yeah, so why did you come?

66
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,921
I just came here!

67
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,006
I just came here, so I called him.

68
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,508
[Myeong-u laughs] Okay, great.

69
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,511
But it's still a pretty far drive.
So what brings you here?

70
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,721
No, I'm telling you it's personal!

71
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,891
It's personal, so why do they keep asking?

72
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,228
-I didn't take him for the type.
-[Myeong-u] Wait, are you crying?

73
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,730
Did I do something wrong?

74
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,774
-I feel like I was scolded.
-[Na-yun] Is she mad?

75
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,530
This is what I believe.

76
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,241
If you're someone who cooks,

77
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,660
you have to try food
from Gangwon Province,

78
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,705
which subtly enhances
the original taste of the ingredients.

79
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,373
[inhales deeply, exhales]

80
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,376
So you came all the way here to eat?

81
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,878
See? I knew you wouldn't believe me,

82
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,964
so I wasn't going to tell you.

83
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,257
[inhales, exhales]

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,550
It's true.

85
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,094
This gajami sikhae
is especially good. Seriously.

86
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,179
Gajami sikhae? What?

87
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,889
They made sikhye with fish? No way.

88
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,766
It's red too. I can't eat spicy food.

89
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,435
-It's not what you think.
-What?

90
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,603
It sounds like sikhye,
but it's not the drink.

91
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,147
-It's spelled differently.
-Is it?

92
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,315
-It's flounder.
-Okay.

93
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,191
They add rice and salt to it
and ferment it.

94
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,319
-That's how the dish is made.
-[Myeong-u] Fermented?

95
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,864
He's messing with you.
He loves fermented fish dishes.

96
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,240
[Seok-ryu] What?

97
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,950
You're a total food connoisseur!

98
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,369
Well, I wouldn't say "connoisseur."
[laughs]

99
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,039
He's marked
over 100 restaurants on the Greip map.

100
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,499
No, it was 328 as of yesterday.

101
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,917
[Seok-ryu gasps]

102
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,419
Can you share those with me?

103
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,420
No way!

104
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,548
I'm going to hand them down
to my twins. [laughs]

105
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,466
-Please!
-Still…

106
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,551
You've helped us out a lot.

107
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,470
So I'll give them all to you.

108
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,264
[gasps] Thank you!
This meal is on me then.

109
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,099
Thank you! Let's eat!

110
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,185
I bet you're hungry. Eat this.

111
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,939
[amusing music playing]

112
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,942
Me.

113
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,487
You like marinated raw crabs, right?

114
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,155
-Eat this.
-[Myeong-u] I do?

115
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,116
No? What about Na-yun?
What did you like?

116
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,327
You. I like you.

117
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,953
Okay, you can eat whatever you like.

118
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,539
I want to eat that. It looks so good.

119
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,291
[Seok-ryu] Eat up.

120
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,209
[Na-yun] Okay.

121
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,713
Mmm.

122
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,549
The gajami sikhae has great texture.

123
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,886
I could absolutely destroy it.

124
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,974
-Eat up.
-[Myeong-u] Okay.

125
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,655
[knock on door]

126
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,949
-Yes?
-[Seung-hyo] Can I come in?

127
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,991
-Sure.
-[door opens]

128
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,995
[Seok-ryu] Hey,
is it really okay to stay here?

129
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,581
Seriously, I can find another place.

130
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,375
There are plenty of empty rooms.

131
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,335
Also, here.

132
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,295
I thought you'd need more clothes.

133
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,964
Right, thanks.

134
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,424
Gosh, I've been borrowing
clothes a lot lately.

135
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,384
[chuckles softly]

136
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,762
The bathroom's at the end
of the hall, so you can wash up.

137
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,181
Okay, I got it. [clears throat]

138
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,143
[amusing music playing]

139
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,355
Were there any bugs?

140
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,149
-[Seok-ryu] No.
-Okay.

141
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,489
-[Seok-ryu] You're not leaving?
-What?

142
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,824
Aren't you going to go?

143
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,452
-Just for a moment--
-[Na-yun] Seung-hyo!

144
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,287
Seung-hyo, where are you?

145
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,623
Go on. She's looking for you.

146
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,542
Are you sure you want me to go?

147
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,085
What?

148
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,337
Back then and now.

149
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,631
Why do you keep giving me dirty looks?

150
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,799
What are you talking about?

151
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,718
My gaze is so gentle right now.

152
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,179
You should look in the mirror
when you say that.

153
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
Wait a second.

154
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,018
Are you jealous?

155
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,438
Don't be ridiculous. Hurry and get out.

156
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,522
Stop laughing. Go.

157
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,649
Fine, I'm leaving. Why are you pushing?

158
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,942
Just go.

159
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,575
[door closes]

160
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,793
Seung-hyo.

161
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,212
What?

162
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,589
My wife's not here, so I can't sleep.

163
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,634

It's late. Why weren't you asleep?

174
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,217
What about you?

175
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,303
I was reading.

176
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,891
Mokminsimseo?
The book Jeong Yak-yong wrote?

177
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,309
Yeah.

178
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,895
Who reads those kinds of books these days?

179
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,230
I do.

180
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,234
It's been a classic since long ago
that transcends time.

181
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,239
It teaches integrity, responsibility,
and how to lead by example.

182
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,491
It tells you how to live.

183
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,827
This book provides
enlightenment about life.

184
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,496
Okay, don't get worked up.

185
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,498
Did I get worked up? [clears throat]

186
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,167
Well, it just seemed like
you didn't know the value of this book.

187
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,713
By the way, it's really nice here.

188
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,216
It's too bad I'm only staying for a day.

189
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,594
You can come again next time.

190
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,138
I'll go back with you tomorrow.

191
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,681
What about your work?

192
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,474
I finished earlier than expected.

193
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,521
I was going to leave the day
after tomorrow, but I can go a day early.

194
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,273
Let's go together.

195
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,067
How? You drove here.

196
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,944
I need to drive Mo-eum's car back.

197
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,196
For my car…

198
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,450
-I'll call a designated driver.
-Are you insane?

199
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,661
Do you know how expensive that would be?

200
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,956
Yeah, that does sound crazy to me, too.

201
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,792
But when I thought about it,

202
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,086
I realized spending time with you
was worth more.

203
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,505
Please. You've got to be kidding me.

204
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,884
You like me that much?

205
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,970
-Yeah.
-I see.

206
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,514
[pleasant music playing]

207
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,142
Well, how much do you like me?

208
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,810
[inhales]

209
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,688
Even after 30 years together,
I'm still not sick of you.

210
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,232
Wow, that's a bit of an exaggeration.
[chuckles softly]

211
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,319
Have some shame
and take out the times we were apart.

212
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,905
But there weren't any.

213
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,785
I've always been with you.

214
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,085
Here.

215
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,254
When we were eight,

216
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,800
you splashed paint all over me.

217
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,891
When we were seven,

218
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,646
you put sticker tattoos
on my face while I was asleep.

219
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,195
When we were six,

220
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,990
you gave me magic candy

221
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,661
that turned my lips purple
so you could tease me.

222
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,874
[pleasant music continues playing]

223
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,923
[chuckles softly]

224
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,010
And when we were five,
I spat bubble gum on your hair.

225
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,429
Jeez. [chuckles]

226
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,431
[Seok-ryu chuckles]

227
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:10,062
Wow, how could you still like me
after enduring all that suffering?

228
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,731
See?

229
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,317
I told you I was a femme fatale.

230
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,237
-Get off me.
-No.

231
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,824
You said we've always
been together like this.

232
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,914
[sighs] I'm a bit sleepy now though.

233
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,000
You are?

234
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,419
Yeah.

235
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,421
Maybe it's because of that long drive.

236
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,344
We can't have someone
come out and see us though.

237
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,890
[pleasant music continues playing]

238
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,782
[chuckles softly]

239
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,460
[music ends]

240
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,552
[exclaims softly]

241
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,720
[upbeat music playing]

242
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,347
[door opens, closes]

243
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,060
Ms. Jung Mo-eum?

244
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,937
Yes.

245
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,610
INTERVIEW ROOM

246
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:44,949
INTERVIEW FOR SOUTH POLE
RESEARCH STATION PARAMEDIC POSITION

247
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,742
[interviewer] Ms. Jung Mo-eum.

248
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,205
You have a high TOEIC score
and a recreational watercraft license.

249
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,499
You're also a certified Level 1 paramedic.

250
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,252
You're well-prepared.

251
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,797
Yes, sir. Not only did I do my best
to excel in fire safety management

252
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,466
but I also worked hard
to perform my duties in the field.

253
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,344
Why do you want to go to Antarctica?

254
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,640
To be honest, my dream
was to become Superman when I was a kid.

255
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,766
[chuckles softly]

256
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,185
Then, I wanted to be Spider-Man.

257
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,815
I realized I couldn't be either,
so I joined the Korea Fire Service.

258
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,110
And I've been very satisfied with my job.

259
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,614
Because I'm still able to help people.

260
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,241
[chuckling]

261
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,951
Yes, I guess you're right.

262
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,454
I'd like to go to Antarctica
to experience an unknown world

263
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,498
and to help preserve world peace.

264
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,294
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

265
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,802
[serious music playing]

266
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,238
Thank you for telling me
about Hye-suk last time.

267
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm glad she's safe.

268
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,575
But…

269
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,786
this is as far as my gratitude
for Hye-suk will go.

270
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,916
-Excuse me?
-Seo Hye-suk is my wife.

271
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,917
She's my woman.

272
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,837
I know that.

273
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,881
Then, that's more reason
to not behave like this.

274
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,091
Don't try to sway her anymore.

275
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,594
I think there's a misunderstanding.

276
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,347
I heard your nickname is Alain Delon.

277
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,973
Why suddenly bring that up?

278
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:37,436
-Yes, you're handsome.
-Excuse me, Dr. Choi.

279
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,272
However, my feelings for her won't change.

280
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,274
-The reason for that is…
-[door opens]

281
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,567
…I love Hye-suk!

282
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:44,985
Darling.

283
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,697
What's going on?

284
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,871
What are you doing here? Well?

285
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,122
Well…

286
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,125
Hye-suk and I are just friends.

287
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,378
She just called you "Darling"!

288
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,463
What kind of friends call each other that?

289
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,716
-We do, because we're close.
-We're really just friends.

290
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,177
I've never once harbored
feelings for her.

291
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,804
That's why it's so ridiculous!

292
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,348
She's such a beautiful
and intelligent woman.

293
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,267
How could you not fall for her?

294
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,560
Are you a robot?

295
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,437
[amusing music playing]

296
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,733
I'm gay.

297
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,694
-Gosh.
-Excuse me?

298
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,072
I like men.

299
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,417
[music ends]

300
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,044
You're such a beautiful
and intelligent woman.

301
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,505
-[chuckles]
-[Hye-suk] Stop it. Jeez.

302
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,134
I'm sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

303
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,343
Don't be sorry.

304
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,137
It was actually nice.

305
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,598
He can declare his love for you
with such confidence.

306
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,727
Gosh, he's such a fool.

307
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,354
Seeing that made me envious.

308
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,732
-What's there to be envious about?
-[laughing]

309
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,819
I'm pretty old now too.

310
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,364
Maybe I should be braver as well.

311
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,910
Whatever you choose to do,
I'll support you.

312
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,328
You know that, right?

313
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:25,544
I know. Always and forever.

314
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,093
[Se-hwan chuckles]

[sighs softly]

319
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,656
I'm so embarrassed by you right now.

320
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,784
-Stay two steps behind me.
-Okay.

321
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,870
[scoffs]

322
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,748
I mean, how could you…

323
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,420
-How could you doubt me?
-I didn't doubt you. That bastard…

324
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,340
I mean, I was afraid
he might've had bad intentions.

325
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,884
Regardless of the reason, I'm sorry.

326
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,843
Unbelievable.

327
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,762
Gosh.

328
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,892
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
I wouldn't have misunderstood if you did.

329
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,145
My friend trusted me with that secret.
How could I tell you?

330
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,357
He must've been so uneasy living
in this conservative and rigid society.

331
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,071
That's so cool. You're so cool.

332
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,115
Jeez.

333
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,451
-What are you doing? Let's go.
-Coming.

[Hye-suk groans softly]

335
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,291
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

336
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,128
That was so embarrassing.

337
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,463
Goodness. What do you think you're doing?

338
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,799
SEND YOUR NAME,
ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER

-Yeah! I did it!
-[door opens, closes]

341
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,310
You scared me. What are you yelling for?

342
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,104
Mom, are you ready?

343
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,148
Yeah, the food's ready. Help yourself.

344
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,234
No, not food.
Are you ready for the good life?

345
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,403
-You know the money you lent me?
-Yeah?

346
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,196
I'll multiply it by a hundred. A thousand!

347
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,740
Are you an influenza now?

348
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,701
No, not influenza. An influencer.

349
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,035
Right, influencer.

350
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,913
No, wait. Like a virus,
I'm going to be deadly.

351
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,623
And I'll become more infectious.

352
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,208
Just try to break even.

353
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,296
Mom, trust your son!

528
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,731
We read books together.

529
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,358
-Okay. [gasps]
-And we removed the guts from anchovies.

530
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,693
You did?

531
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,449
Mom, did you make Yeon-du
remove the guts from anchovies?

532
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,327
Are you Cinderella's stepmother?

533
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,370
Seriously?

534
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,041
No. It looked fun,
so I said wanted to help.

535
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,834
Really?

536
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,880
Jeez. Did you think your own mother
would abuse a child?

537
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,841
No. I just wanted to make sure.

538
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,426
Yeon-du.

539
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,013
I'll take the anchovies
we prepared together,

540
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,973
and I'll stir-fry them nice and well!

541
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,433
Okay, thank you!

542
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,517
That sounds so good.

543
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,227
It sounds so good! [chuckles]

544
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,650
Hey, if you're not going to get married,

545
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,071
go somewhere and bring back
a daughter like Yeon-du.

546
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,155
What?

547
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,200
That's how badly I want
a grandchild of my own. Okay?

548
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,785
Go and stir-fry the anchovies.

549
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,620
I swear…

550
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,379
Yeon-du, aren't you bored
from just reading books all day?

551
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,922
Mmm.

552
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,423
I don't know.

553
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,424
Mmm.

554
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,263
Is there anything else you want to do
besides reading books?

555
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,015
Want to go ride bikes?

556
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,767
I don't know how to.

557
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,768
Really?

558
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,188
Then…

559
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,982
-How about scooters?
-I can't ride those either.

560
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,736
You don't like to play outside?

561
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,491
It's not that, but my dad says
it's too dangerous outside.

562
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,952
I see.

563
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,829
[quirky music playing]

564
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,291
[Mo-eum laughing] It's you!

565
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,377
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

566
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,670
[both] Minus one!

567
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,796
Ribbit, ribbit!

568
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,340
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Minus one!

569
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,716
-Yeon-du.
-Ribbit!

570
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,343
Dad!

571
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,012
[both exclaiming]

572
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:47,809
Yeon-du, I missed you so much today.

573
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,477
Did you miss me too?

574
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,729
[Yeon-du] Well…

575
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,897
Yeah, I'd say so.

576
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,982
[chuckles]

577
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,401
[exclaims]

578
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,780
Thank you. I owe you a lot.

579
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,867
No, it's fine. Do you have work tomorrow?

580
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,160
-Yes.
-[Mo-eum] I see.

581
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,871
-Take a day off.
-Sorry?

582
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,914
Let's meet here at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

583
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,832
But…

584
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,167
-No refusals.
-Wait.

585
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,293
No questions.

586
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,335
But…

587
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,921
And no mudflat shirt.

588
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,884
-Yeon-du, see you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow!

589
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,135
-[Mo-eum] Ribbit!
-Ribbit!

590
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,094
[chuckles]

591
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,388
[Yeon-du] Dad, let's go.

592
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,020
[Seok-ryu] Hey, isn't this
the tree I gave to you?

593
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,731
Did you kill it and buy a new one?

594
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,982
That's right.

595
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:36,941
How did you know?

596
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,027
That's the secret of its origin.

597
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,944
[scoffs]

598
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,321
Wow.

599
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,324
It's grown so much. This is so neat.

600
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,992
How did it grow so much?

601
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
-Seok-ryu.
-[Seok-ryu] Yeah?

602
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,955
[clears throat]

603
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,791
Are you going to go on that blind date?

604
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,795
Are you crazy?
I'll make something up and turn her down.

605
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,840
This won't do.
Let's just tell her we're dating.

606
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,758
What?

607
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,968
Who knows? This might happen again.

608
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,554
Let's also tell your dad.

609
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,225
We'll tell my parents too.
Let's officially get their approval.

610
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,144
We should tell the entire neighborhood.

611
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,437
We can't.

612
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,814
[amusing music playing]

613
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,148
-Why not?
-I mean…

614
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,234
We've just started to date.

615
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,111
Telling everyone seems a bit too much.

616
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,406
It's pretty obvious that it'll be chaos.

617
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,411
It's a little bit of an issue.
Our moms are friends.

618
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,372
And we're all so close.

619
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:37,168
And to be honest, you don't know
what could happen to us.

620
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,131
Let's keep it a secret for now.

621
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,178
All right. If that's what you want…

622
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,974
Let's keep our relationship a secret.

623
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,058
Top secret.

624
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,227
We have to be diligent. No one can know.

625
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,770
No one will know.

626
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,105
[music ends]

629
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,327
Is he up?

630
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,003
Choisseung.

631
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,379
[playful music playing]

632
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,216
Bonjour, Seok-ryu!

633
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,968
-Aunt Hye-suk!
-[Hye-suk] Hi.

634
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,096
Seung-hyo went to work early today.
Is it urgent?

635
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,348
No, it's nothing.

636
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,476
Hey, I didn't know your windows
were this close.

637
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,395
You could trip and kiss each other.

638
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,438
[chuckles nervously]

639
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,482
I bet you two hardly ever spent
any time apart.

640
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,984
That's right. [chuckles]

641
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,571
That's why I'm so sick of it!

642
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,323
I bet Choisseung feels the same.

643
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,117
But still, don't fight
and try to get along, okay?

644
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,744
Okay.

645
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,495
-I have something on the stove.
-Go ahead!

646
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,331
Sorry. I'll see you next time. Bye!

647
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,919
Gosh, that scared me.

-[Seung-hyo] Na-yun.
-Yes?

653
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,903
What did you just do?

654
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:27,862
Oh…

655
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,656
Well…

[Seung-hyo sighs]

657
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,873
You know what you did
was excessive, right?

658
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,708
Yes.

659
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,419
I've allowed your actions to slide

660
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,922
because I thought of you
as just a cute former classmate.

661
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,132
But I can't anymore.

662
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,385
I'm sorry for what I just did.

663
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,221
But Seung-hyo,

664
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,223
you know that I like you.

665
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,642
I thought it was half crush, half joking.

666
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,812
No, it's not. I'm serious.

667
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,231
Then, I think I need to
be perfectly clear.

668
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,067
There's someone else I like.

669
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,903
Is it someone I know?

670
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,658
She's someone I found
after a long and difficult journey.

671
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,787
I don't want to do anything
that would make her feel uncomfortable.

[Seung-hyo] I'm sorry I didn't pick up.
Want to see a movie later?

675
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,601
What is this? Is he officially
asking me out on a date?

676
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,686
Sounds good.

Did you sleep well?

682
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,371
Any dreams about being
an alien's friend?

683
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,373
No, I dreamt of something else.

684
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,541
[Mo-eum] What was it?

685
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,335
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

686
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,545
Okay.

687
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,922
Wow.

688
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,382
You're very punctual.

It's the basics of being a reporter.

690
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,511
I came because you asked me to, but…

691
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,014
I don't need to say
where we're going, right?

-What?

-We're not going to help?
-[Yeon-du] Let's go.

I'll just do it.

No, it's fine.

704

-I'll do it.
-[Yeon-du] Dad.

00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,432
-Dad?
-[Dan-ho] Yeah?

706
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,768
[pop song continues playing]

707
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,028
[exclaims]

708
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,198
[exhales]

709
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,869
[chuckles softly]

710
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,166
[inaudible]

711
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,628
Careful, it's hot.

712
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,172
Try some.

713
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,924
-I'll eat it on my own.
-Okay.

714
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,346
Mmm.

715
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,474
-Is it good?
-You're pretty good at grilling!

716
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,561
What are we doing next, Mo-eum?

717
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,688
What we're going to do next is…

718
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,484
-Wow!
-Wow! [laughs]

719
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,570
[both exclaiming]

720
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,074
Don't shoot Yeon-du!

721
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,868
[Yeon-du laughing]

722
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,163
[Dan-ho exclaims]

723
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,706
[Yeon-du laughs]

724
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,044
[Dan-ho] I give up!

725
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,550
[Yeon-du laughing]

726
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,846
[Mo-eum] You're drenched.

727
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,100
I was able to borrow this.

728
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,476
Oh.

729
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,188
But we don't have any electricity.
How can we use that?

730
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,814
Just a second.

731
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,274
[pop song continues playing]

732
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,498
[hair dryer blows]

733
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,833
Wow!

734
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,627
[Mo-eum] Wow!

735
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,836
I'll dry your hair, Yeon-du.

736
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,546
Let's dry your hair.

737
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,925
[Yeon-du] What was the most fun for you?

738
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,885
I liked playing
with the water guns the most.

739
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,345
Me too. [giggles]

740
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,980
[chuckles softly]

741
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,357
-All done.
-[hair dryer stops]

742
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,527
[Mo-eum] Wow, Yeon-du!

743
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,030
I'll tie your hair nice and pretty later.

744
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,824
-Okay.
-Your hair's wet too.

745
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,284
I'll dry it myself.

746
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,369
What?

747
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,538
I see! Right!

748
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,334
[hair dryer blows]

749
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,713
[pleasant music playing]

750
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,812
[Dan-ho] I thought you might be cold.

751
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,732
Yeon-du, how about we go over there?

752
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,317
All right.

753
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,238
[pleasant music continues playing]

754
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,548
[pop song playing in the background]

755
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,351
Hey, Choisseung.

756
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,769
Hey.

757
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,107
I'm here and you won't even look at me?

758
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,443
I did look.

759
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,364
[amusing music playing]

760
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,241
What are you so busy with?

761
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,661
I was tasked with remodeling
a movie theater.

762
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,705
I thought of something when I got here,

763
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,373
so I wanted to draw it before I forgot.

764
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,168
Will it take long?

765
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,545
No, I'll be done
before the movie starts.

766
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,053
So this is what a blueprint looks like.

767
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,638
Yeah.

768
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,228
Do you want popcorn? I'll buy some.

769
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,064
No, I'm fine.

770
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:22,651
Really? Then, I'll just buy a drink.

771
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,153
Okay.

772
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,822
[amusing music continues playing]

773
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,047
[sighs wearily]

774
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,890
[lady in movie] You want more?

775
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,604
Oh.

776
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,731
Sorry.

777
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,404
[lady in movie] They said they'd analyze
the photos and bring them here.

778
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,498
[exclaims]

779
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,500
The sun is already setting.

780
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,546
Should we go before it gets too late?

781
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,005
No.

782
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,510
Yeon-du just fell asleep.
Let's stay for 30 more minutes.

783
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,011
-Okay.
-[Mo-eum faintly chuckles]

784
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,728
She must be heavy. Give her to me.

785
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,688
Oh.

786
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,400
Yeon-du, let's sleep on the bed.

787
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,070
It was fine though.

788
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:55,995
[both exclaim]

789
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,291
[Mo-eum] So how was camping?

790
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,085
Not bad, right?

791
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,628
Yeah.

792
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,506
I've never thought about it,

793
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,468
but Yeon-du really liked it.

794
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,722
Yeon-du said she couldn't ride a bike.

795
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,018
She can't ride scooters
or rollerblades either.

796
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,566
It's because of the accident, right?

797
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,196
It wasn't on purpose.

798
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:36,494
I just keep getting so worried.

799
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,579
I understand how you feel.

800
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,043
I know I have no authority
to tell you what to do either.

801
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,045
But…

802
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,050
if you keep a miracle
hidden away like that,

803
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,928
it'll never really be a miracle.

804
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:02,311
I want Yeon-du to feel the wind
and stomp her feet.

805
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:07,733
And sometimes, she'll fall down.

806
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,446
That's how I'd want her to grow.

807
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:19,495
I want her to see and hear
all the good things in this world.

808
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:25,417
I hope she can take it all in
like a sponge and grow healthy.

809
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,378
[mellow music playing]

810
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,799
Wouldn't that be a real miracle?

811
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,095
I'm so sorry to Yeon-du.

812
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,350
It would've been nice
if I was as brave as you.

813
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,321
Sometimes, I think it would be nice
if I was Yeon-du's mom.

814
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,036
[chuckles nervously]

815
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,914
Come on. Still, that's a bit much.

816
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,499
I can't?

817
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,630
I know I'm moving really fast right now.

818
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,801
It's like I've just traveled to Andromeda
over 2.5 million light-years away.

819
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,885
But…

820
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,014
that's how I feel right now.

821
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,225
Ms. Jung…

822
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,103
My heart races whenever I see you.

823
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,191
It beats rapidly like a drum every time.

824
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,614
I even see you in my dreams too.

825
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,785
So I was wondering.

826
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,996
About our kiss…

827
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,750
Can't we cancel our agreement?

828
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,919
I don't think it was a mistake.

829
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,841
[music fades]

830
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,183
No, we can't. Never.

831
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,187
Yeon-du can't become your daughter.

832
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,022
And what happened that day was a mistake.

833
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,274
It has to be.

834
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,194
Why?

835
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,865
Because it can't happen.

836
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,077
[slow music playing]

837
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,586
From now on,
I won't leave Yeon-du at your house.

838
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,840
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't hang out with her anymore.

839
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,801
-Dan-ho…
-We should go.

840
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,471
Yeon-du.

841
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,973
-Wake up. We have to go home.
-[Yeon-du groans softly]

842
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,144
[Dan-ho] Let's sleep in the car, okay?

843
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,818
[amusing music playing]

844
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,552
Go on in first.

845
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,553
What? Why?

846
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,222
What if we run into
your mom again like last time?

847
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,058
Come on. We've hung around
with each other for years.

848
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,144
-She won't be suspicious of this.
-But still…

849
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,147
To keep this secret, we need to be careful
around the neighborhood.

850
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,858
I'll take a lap around the block.
Go on in first.

851
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,484
Okay, then.

852
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,829
Since when did he start
listening to me so well?

853
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,039
Ridiculous.

854
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,465
[inhales]

855
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,717
[exclaims softly]

856
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,178
Alzheimer's…

857
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,974
-It's not that.
-Really?

858
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,392
-[doctor] Yes.
-Really?

859
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,603
Take a look for yourself
if you don't believe me.

860
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,647
Hey, you're going to break it!

861
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,608
There's nothing wrong with her brain.

862
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,859
Of course,

863
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,778
we'll have to see if your symptoms
reoccur in the future.

864
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,740
Then, why did I keep forgetting things?

865
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,493
You could say
it's a type of short-term memory loss.

866
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,036
I see.

867
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,373
Have you experienced any shock
or a significant amount of stress lately?

868
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,958
[pleasant music playing]

869
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,129
Yes.

870
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,840
Then, it could be from that stress.

871
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,176
It could be due to heightened anxiety.

872
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,137
If you rest and take care of yourself,
you'll be fine.

873
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,139
Thank you.

874
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,852
[sighs in relief]

875
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,482
I'm so relieved.

876
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,693
No, "relieved" isn't enough
to describe how I feel.

877
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,822
I've been in an emotional hell
for the past two weeks.

878
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,200
You said it would be okay,

879
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,203
but I thought of the worst-case scenarios.

880
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,081
Are you listening to me?

881
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,416
-[groans softly]
-[Hye-suk] Honey!

882
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,585
Honey, what's wrong?

883
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,878
[crying]

884
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,132
[Hye-suk] Honey, what's the matter?
What is it?

885
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,261
What? Honey, don't cry. What's wrong?

886
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,847
[voice shaking] I thought something bad
was going to happen to you.

887
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,477
I just learned the truth not too long ago,

888
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,023
and I was finally able to express
my true feelings.

889
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,444
But I was afraid I was too late.

890
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:50,409
I was afraid you'd forget me. [crying]

891
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,494
[Hye-suk exclaims]

892
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,830
I was scared I'd lose you. [crying]

893
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,041
Honey.

894
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,003
I can't live without you, Hye-suk!

895

896
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,175
-For goodness' sake.

[exclaims]

898
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,471
I swear.

899
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,474
You've been embarrassing me
a lot these days, you know.

900
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,687
But this isn't so bad either.

901
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,691
-[sniffles] Honey.
-[crying]

902
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,945
[crying] He said
I didn't have Alzheimer's!

903
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,741
Stop crying, Gyeong-jong!

904
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,035
Why didn't you say
anything like this before?

905
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,954
You big dummy! [crying]

906
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,588
[upbeat music playing]

907
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,515
[sizzling]

908
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,029
[music fades]

909
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,364
See you next class!

910
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,740
[both] Bye!

911
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,496
[line ringing]

912
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,164
-Hello?
-[Seok-ryu] Hey, Choisseung.

913
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,918
So I made neobiani in class today.

914
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,795
It's so good. Want me to bring you some?

915
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,963
I had work to do outside,
so I'm not at the office.

916
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,049
Do you want to come by later at night?

917
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,593
-At night?
-[Seung-hyo] Yeah.

918
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,969
[Tae-hui] Seung-hyo!

919
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,306
I have to go. I'll see you later.

920
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,142
[line disconnects]

921
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,771
At night?

922
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,899
If it's at night…

923
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:51,988
Then, it'll be dark
and no one will be around.

924
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,283
[amusing music playing]

925
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,664
ORDER DETAILS

926
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,084
What? I made the post days ago,
but why are there only ten orders?

927
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,047
Damn it.

928
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,555
Were my abs not defined enough?

929
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,934
[exclaims] I should've
worked out a bit more.

930
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,310
[phone vibrating]

931
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,562
JAE-YEONG

932
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,814
Hey, Jae-yeong.

933
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,816
What? Haeundae Beach?

934
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,485
I'm in no position to go now…

935
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,905
Really? I don't have to pay?

936
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,284
You're paying?

937
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,702
[Seok-ryu] Choisseung!

938
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,580
I made a lot of good food…

939
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,541
for us.

940
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,251
[playful music playing]

941
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,629
You're all here.

942
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,965
It's been a while, Seok-ryu.

943
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,049
Hi.

944
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,015
[gasps]

945
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:04,019
My goodness! This was made with such care!

946
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,979
Why did you bring so much food?

947
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,063
Oh.

948
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,233
You must've come
to congratulate Seung-hyo.

949
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,234
Congratulate him?

950
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,404
Yes. To celebrate the launch
of the collaboration with Fresco,

951
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,363
they interviewed him.

952
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,157
Hey, that article should be out now.

953
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,450
-Show it to her.
-Right.

954
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,161
I've been looking at it for a while.

955
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,831
The picture came out well too. [chuckles]

956
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,792
[Tae-hui] I was going
to leave right after,

957
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,168
but Myeong-u told me to stay.

958
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,879
[Myeong-u] Aren't you glad I did?
You can have all this good food.

959
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,297
[Tae-hui] Whatever.

960
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,341
I've finished my coffee, so I'll go.

961
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,926
What? You're leaving and not eating?

962
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,219
I'm busy.

963
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,639
-You're going to go?
-[Tae-hui] Yes.

964
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,600
I did want to congratulate you,

965
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,352
so I'm glad I can.

966
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,023
Congratulations
on your official start to cooking.

967
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:50,941
[chuckles softly]

968
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,944
It was thanks to your advice. Thank you.

969
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,154
It was thanks to your delicious kalguksu.

970
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,906
[playful music continues playing]

971
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,242
Great job today. I'm off.

972
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,244
All right, get home safe.

973
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,412
-Thanks.
-[Jeong-min] Good night.

974
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,289
Bye. Thanks. Great job.

975
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,457
Get home safe.

976
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,797
It would've been nice if she stayed.

977
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,781
I texted you and said I'd call you later
since tonight wasn't a good night.

978
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,453
I saw it just now.

979
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,500
Why didn't you tell me
you had an interview with Fresco?

980
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,794
Was it because of Tae-hui?

981
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:56,131
They said it wouldn't take long,
so I was going to tell you after.

982
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,133
-But it ended up like this.
-What?

983
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,093
You thought I wouldn't understand?

984
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,053
No, it's not that.

985
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,684
I'm sorry. I have no excuse.

986
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,396
It was nice seeing her
after all this time.

987
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,189
She's still pretty.

988
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,609
Tae-hui didn't come
because she wanted to either.

989
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,694
Myeong-u kept insisting.

990
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,113
Did you tell her we're dating?

991
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,031
No.

992
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,493
You told me not to tell anyone.

993
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,703
But an ex-girlfriend

994
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,413
is different…

995
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,667
[sighs softly]

996
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,419
Okay.

997
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,089
Also, we didn't have time
to talk about anything personal.

998
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,050
It was an official event.

999
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,554
Now that I think about it,
you two are like Hollywood actors.

1000
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,934
I could never work with my ex-boyfriend.

1001
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,186
I mean, think about it.

1002
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,855
Even if you try,
feelings don't just disappear.

1003
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,981
And things were once good.

1004
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,025
It's all in the past.

1005
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,736
I want to stop talking about this.

1006
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,364
What's wrong? I know everything anyway.

1007
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,490
[sighs]

1008
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:07,327
Hey, when you told
Tae-hui earlier to get home safe,

1009
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,662
your voice was no joke.

1010
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,497
-It was so deep.
-I never did that.

1011
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,541
You did. You were so worried about her.

1012
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,169
I mean, why didn't you just take her home?

1013
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,087
Seok-ryu.

1014
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,297
How were you around her
when I wasn't here?

1015
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,842
Were you mature
and understanding around her?

1016
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,094
[sighs softly]

1017
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,015
I don't want to answer that.

1018
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,022
I'm not obligated
to tell you things like that.

1019
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,483
[amusing music playing]

1020
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,666
[sighs wearily]

1021
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,384
[sighs deeply]

1022
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,803
What's wrong with me?

1023
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,309
[sighs]

1024
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,690
You have some nerve, Choi Seung-hyo.

1025
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,944
[sighs deeply]

1026
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,783
Are you heading out now?

1027
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,410
Yes. Where are you going?

1028
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,120
I'm going to Seoraksan Mountain.

1029
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:35,123
Your father and I are taking
an overnight trip with Seok-ryu's parents.

1030
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,043
[gasps] I forgot to tell you.

1031
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,172
You're staying one night.
Why did you pack so much?

1032
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:46,551
No. The thing is, your dad…

1033
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,678
What is all this?

1034
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,430
Compression bandages and heat packs.

1035
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,974
Your ankle hasn't fully healed yet,
so it's just in case.

1036
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,643
I have acupressure patches
if your feet hurt from walking a lot.

1037
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,021
Why not bring crutches
and a wheelchair too?

1038
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,189
You think I should?

1039
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,315
I'll call the hospital.

1040
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,108
[scoffs] No, honey. It's fine.

1041
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,736
Come here! We're late. Let's go. Jeez!

1042
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,071
[playful music playing]

1043
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,073
So that's what Dad's really like.

1044
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,868
[Mi-suk] I said hurry up!

1045
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,329
[Geun-sik] Hey, you washed my pants wrong.
They shrank!

1046
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,915
-You should've washed them right.
-Honey, they're mine.

1047
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,166
[laughing]

1048
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,126
-They're not mine?
-Seriously?

1049
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,544
I see. It has a lace trim.

1050
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,923
-I told you to pack earlier!
-[Geun-sik] I don't have any tank tops!

1051
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,967
Is there a black hole in the drawer?
I can't find anything in this house.

1052
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,220
Seok-ryu, your dad
would be a perfect slug.

1053
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,305
-A slug!
-[Geun-sik] Is that how you talk of me?

1054
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,765
You turn me into a slug?

1055
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:34,933
When are you leaving?

1056
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,352
-It's been 30 minutes!
-[Mi-suk] Why look for that now?

1057
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,270
We'll probably go tomorrow
thanks to your dad!

1058
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,189
My tank top. My sunglasses are gone!

1059
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,192
-Find my sunglasses.
-Dad, they're on your head!

1060
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,777
[laughing] There they are!

1061
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,987
Jeez! And where are you going?

1062
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,864
What? I'm going to Busan with my friends.

1063
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,784
-Wow, you're all going without me?
-Here it is. Here!

1064
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,036
Jeez, it was right there!
How could you not find it?

1065
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,371
-I caught it.
-Good grief.

1066
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,331
-Let's take these!
-Where's Dong-jin going?

1067
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,416
-Busan with his friends.
-[Mi-suk] All of a sudden?

1068
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,001
Dad, could you not wear those?

1069
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,545
-No, I need these.
-Goodness.

1070
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,256
-Don't wear those at Seoraksan.
-That's a fashion crime.

1071
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,884
Sorry! He kept on dawdling.

1072
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,219
It's okay. We didn't wait much.

1073
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,097
[Geun-sik] You took forever
in front of the mirror picking scarves!

1074
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,473
-"This or that?"
-Let's go!

1075
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,474
[both] Okay!

1076
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,518
-Get in.
-[Gyeong-jong] Here.

1077
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,602
[Hye-suk] Thanks, honey.

1078
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,273
-Here.
-Honey, get in.

1079
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,315
Honey?

1080
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:29,028
The car looks so sleek and shiny.
I've always wanted to go for a ride in it.

1081
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,992
-Wow!
-[Hye-suk] Your first time in our car?

1082
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,910
-[Geun-sik] Yes.
-[Hye-suk] I see.

1083
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,080
GANGNEUNG DAEGWALLYEONG SERVICE AREA

1084
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,165
Are we almost there?

1085
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,291
-Yeah.
-Honey!

1086
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,543
-[Hye-suk] The water's so cold.
-Here. Dry your hands.

1087
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,004
[Hye-suk] Thanks. The water was so cold.

1088
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,464
-Really? No hot water?
-No.

1089
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,548
That's terrible.

1090
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,889
Honey! Man, these have
entire walnuts in them!

1091
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,056
My hands feel frozen.

1092
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,476
-That's cold. Hey!
-[Gyeong-jong] Hey!

1093
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,144
-You're so rude.
-Come on.

1094
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,396
-I think it got on my face. Look.
-[scoffs]

1095
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,898
-Geun-sik!
-Goodness.

1096
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,442
-Just lightly pat it.
-Do you have a handkerchief?

1097
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,735
A handkerchief?

1098
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,529
Yeah. But I used this
to blow my nose. Is that okay?

1099
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,490
You're so rude.

1100
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,366
-What's wrong?
-I want those walnut pastries.

1101
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,118
Do you want some of these?

1102
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,913
Wow! Let's take a picture here!

1103
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,332
Mi-suk, let's take
our individual pictures first.

1104
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,708
-[Mi-suk] Individual ones?
-Yeah.

1105
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,043
Take a picture of me.

1106
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,211
-Just a second.
-Okay.

1107
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,962
Honey, take a picture of me with this.

1108
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,756
-Just take it yourself.
-No, with the bear!

1109
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,174
For goodness' sake.

1110
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,884
-With the bear?
-[Mi-suk] Yeah.

1111
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,302
-Okay.
-[camera shutter clicking]

1112
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,970
That's how you get the bear in it.

1113
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,680
No, take some more.

1114
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,349
-Jeez.
-[Geun-sik] Weather is amazing.

1115
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,391
It's unbelievable.

1116
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,603
[dramatic music playing]

1117
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,982
[Hye-suk] Should I stand here?

1118
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,651
[Gyeong-jong] That's good, honey.

1119
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,444
Who carries around something like that?

1120
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,113
-[Mi-suk] It is heavy.
-Goodness. What is he doing?

1121
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,657
Now, that's funny.

1122
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,325
Goodness.

1123
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,535
He's going crazy now.

1124
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,371
You two have both gone crazy.

1125
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,373
-Is that okay?
-Let's see that jawline!

1126
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,832
[Geun-sik] I feel embarrassed.

1127
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,000
[Mi-suk] What's with you?

1128
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,544
[Gyeong-jong] Good!

1129
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,546
-Great!
-Let me see.

1130
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,881
-I'm next!
-No, let's look.

1131
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,634
-[Hye-suk] Honey.
-[Gyeong-jong panting]

1132
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,886
Since when did you take
such great pictures?

1133
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,723
I went online and studied how to take
good pictures of your girlfriend.

1134
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,851
-Do you like it?
-[camera shutter clicking]

1135
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,020
[Hye-suk] I love it.
You did great. It's amazing.

1136
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,524
You idiot. You made me look like a dwarf.

1137
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,442
It looks just like you.

1138
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,236
Hey, Gyeong-jong.

1139
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,029
Can you take a picture
of me with that too?

1140
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,156
-Yeah, okay!
-Make my legs look long.

1141
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,449
Take your own.

1142
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,202
-Mo-eum.
-[Mo-eum] Yeah?

1143
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,829
Can you call my phone?

1144
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,747
[Mo-eum] Okay.

1145
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,087
-[line ringing]
-[phone vibrating]

1146
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,714
It works.

1147
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,091
-[line disconnects]
-It works very well.

1148
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,553
It was so quiet I thought it was broken.

1149
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,388
[amusing music playing]

1150
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,224
SEOK-RYU

1151

[knock on door]

1152
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:12,859
Come in.

1153
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,197
-Dan-ho.
-Mr. Choi.

1154
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,950
-I mean, Mr. Kang.
-Seung-hyo.

1155
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,164
Didn't we go back to being formal?

1156
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,499
Right, we did.

1157
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,002
Take a seat.

1158
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,253
-Thank you.
-Of course.

1159
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,718
[sighs softly]

1160
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,099
-You can sit anywhere.
-Right.

1161
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,686
[Dan-ho sighs]

1162
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,065
I'm sorry for interrupting if you're busy.

1163
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,568
Mr. Yoon said you were in your office
and it was okay to go in.

1164
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,987
No, it's okay. I'm glad you came.

1165
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,281
But what brings you here?

1166
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,575
I have a favor to ask of you.

1167
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,453
I've been writing articles
about my experiences lately.

1168
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,416
For my next feature, I want to highlight
the lives of construction workers.

1169
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,045
I was wondering if you could
introduce me to a construction site.

1170
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,213
Oh.

1171
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,256
Of course, I can.

1172
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:21,344
We have a few sites under construction.
I'll call them and let you know.

1173
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,762
Thank you.

1174
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,306
I owe you a lot.

1175
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,852
Gosh, there's no need to say that.
You've helped me out a lot.

1176
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,938
You helped me catch those scammers too.

1177
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,816
-And you provided advice last time.
-I see.

1178
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,070
About your friend…

1179
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:42,532
May I ask how things turned out
with your friend's friend?

1180
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,785
They just recently started dating.

1181
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:47,829
Congratulations.

1182
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,372
[amusing music playing]

1183
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,582
I mean, congratulate your friend for me.

1184
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,628
Congratulate. Right.

1185
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,463
What's wrong?

1186
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,174
Is something not working out?

1187
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,093
No, it's just…

1188
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,471
He says dating is hard.

1189
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,727
Love is quite hard.

1190
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:12,895
[chuckles softly]

1191
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,522
[clears throat]

1192
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:20,445
How could he take
Tae-hui's side in front of me?

1193
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,321
I don't think he took her side.

1194
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,573
Whose side are you on?

1195
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,533
Seung-hyo, that bastard!

1196
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,538
Also, I asked him how he was
when he dated her,

1197
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,957
and he didn't want to answer.

1198
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,376
He said he wasn't obligated to tell me.

1199
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,589
Then, what answer did you want to hear?

1200
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,842
-What do you mean?
-Think about it.

1201
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:46,512
You'd be upset if he said
things were great with her.

1202
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,890
If he said things were awful…

1203
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:53,269
Would you want him to be a scumbag
who bad-mouths his ex-girlfriends?

1204
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:55,980
No.

1205
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,983
Right? So why would you
ask about his past?

1206
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,610
That's self-harm.

1207
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,278
[sighs] You're right.

1208
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,157
-I know that too.
-You know but what?

1209
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,576
But it makes me jealous!

[mellow music playing]

1211
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,167
Hey, from now on,
I'm going to be Seung-hyo's friend.

1212
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,044
Seok-ryu, you brat!

1213
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:22,381
He was kind enough to let you say goodbye
to Hyeon-jun, so you can't do this to him.

1214
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,842
I know. I know that too.

1215
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,429
But I can't control how I feel,
so what can I do?

1216
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,104
[sighs audibly]

1217
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,774
[clicks tongue]

1218
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:43,027
She's right. You can't control feelings.

1219
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,823
Hello.

1220
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:53,579
Uh…

1221
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,331
[exclaims softly]

1222
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,583
There was only one left.

1223
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,001
Take this.

1224
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,254
No, it's fine. You can have it.

1225
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:05,383
Really, it's okay. You take it.

1226
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,595
No, I want you to have it.
It's my feelings for you.

1227
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,557
-What?
-[Mo-eum exclaims]

1228
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,768
The fire in my heart

1229
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,940
won't be extinguished
until it's completely burned out.

1230
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:26,028
So, enjoy.

1231
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:30,783
[sighs softly]

1232
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:33,953
[scanner beeping]

1233
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,329
[slow music playing]

1234
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,709
I think I have to stop drinking this.

1235
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,797
But I don't know if I can.

1236
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,009
[sighs]

1237
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,888
[Hye-suk] Stop laughing.

1238
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,556
-Do you enjoy teasing me?
-[Mi-suk] Hey.

1239
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,476
If those were signs of dementia,
we'd all be in a nursing home right now.

1240
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,396
It was really serious. I mean it.

1241
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,773
I told you. I couldn't remember anything.

1242
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:07,278
Hye-suk, I forgot what we had for lunch.

1243
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,195
What did we eat?

1244
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,781
Sweet and spicy chicken.
We had chicken, remember?

1245
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,199
-Sweet and spicy chicken.
-Right!

1246
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,618
-Chicken!
-Get a grip, Mi-suk.

1247
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,328
It was so crunchy and delicious!

1248
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:18,080
-[Hye-suk laughing]
-Hey, this is how we are now.

1249
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,416
Anyway, I'm so relieved that you're okay.

1250
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:25,463
Yeah. I learned so much
after going through this incident.

1251
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,090
Family, friends.

1252
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:31,010
Knowing I have people
I can lean on in my life

1253
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,221
was so reassuring.

1254
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:37,475
I thought that too

1255
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,561
after learning
about what happened to Seok-ryu.

1256
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,732
I wanted her to meet someone who's willing

1257
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,026
to embrace all of her pain.

1258
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,904
Someone reassuring and generous.

1259
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,075
I want to find
a nice partner for Seung-hyo too.

1260
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,870
He was lonely
for a long time because of me.

1261
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:02,083
Hey, let's introduce them
to good people if we find any.

1262
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,168
Let's do that.

1263
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,252
[both] For real!

1264
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,421
-For real, okay?
-Yeah, for real!

1265
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,757
-Find good ones at the foreign ministry!
-For real.

1266
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,675
Okay.

1267
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:14,261
Hey, they left to buy alcohol,
but why aren't they back?

1268
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,681
Good question.
Are they brewing it themselves?

1269
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,849
-Did they go to karaoke?
-Those lunatics.

1270
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:22,478
They must be crazy.
Geun-sik mentioned his favorite song.

1271
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,188
He was talking about it earlier.

1272
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,357
-[Hye-suk] Where is it?
-[Mi-suk] That fool.

1273
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,775
-The basement!
-[Hye-suk] Really?

1274
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:28,734
Let's hurry!

1275
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:32,655
What's that?

1276
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,657
Tae-hui kept her word.

1277
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,450
[giggles] Time for the unboxing!

1278
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,246
Right. You sold me for a bowl.

1279
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,205
[exclaims softly]

1280
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:45,751
Seung-hyo, I might be a traitor to you,
but this was worth it. Look.

1281
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,545
Ta-da! [gasps]

1282
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,633
-Wow, it's beautiful.
-[chuckles softly]

1283
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,927
-Benedict Yoon?
-Yes?

1284
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,471
-You like it that much?
-Yes, of course.

1285
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,682
I'm going to hand this down
as a family heirloom.

1286
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,351
My future descendant will be
on Authentic Masterpieces with this,

1287
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,520
and it'll be valued
at 100 billion won! [gasps]

1288
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,106
I should take a picture and show my wife.

1289
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,024
[chuckles softly]

1290
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,358
Take this too.

1291
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,609
That's yours.

1292
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,195
Gosh. Mine's bigger.

1293
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,238
[chuckles softly]

1294
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,419
[Tae-hui] In a traditional
wedding ceremony,

1295
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,380
the bride and groom use
a hollowed gourd split in two

1296
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,674
to share ceremonial wine.

1297
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:34,842
[pleasant music playing]

1298
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:38,596
They say it symbolizes how one
is the perfect match for the other.

1299
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,433
It's my gift to you and Seok-ryu.

1300
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,935
I wish you both happiness.

1301
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,146
[pop song playing]

1302
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,025
PRINCESS

1303
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,618
[sighs] Boring.

1304
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:07,583
[groans softly]

1305
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,793
[breeze blowing]

1306
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,344
Hey.

1307
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:21,597
What are you doing?

1308
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,682
What do you think?

1309
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,644
Were you always this kind?

1310
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:28,229
[pop song continues playing]

1311
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,857
Did you think
your boyfriend was cold-hearted?

1312
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:36,237
Boyfriend, my foot. Are you crazy?

1313
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,365
Wait.

1314
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,701
If I'm not your boyfriend, then what am I?

1315
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,956
I mean, you are. But…

1316
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,624
I don't know.

1317
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:49,583
[exclaims softly]

1318
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,544
It's just awkward to say that word.

1319
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,051
Did you make that house too?

1320
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,137
Yeah.

1321
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:11,522
[Seok-ryu] No, stay away.
He's hurt, so he's still sensitive.

1322
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,233
I think you're the one who's sensitive.

1323
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,151
[sneezes]

1324
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:16,902
[coughs]

1325
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,406
Why did you bring in a cat
if you're allergic to them?

1326
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,700
It was hurt. I couldn't just abandon it.

1327
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,452
You said you were
out of money for the snack bar.

1328
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,829
Was it for the medical expenses?

1329
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:30,332
[muffled] Yeah, my hands are shaking
from chocolate withdrawal.

1330
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,835
But what do I do?

1331
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,172
It has nowhere to go after it heals.

1332
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:39,133
The weather's getting hot. Don't touch.

1333
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,050
[cat meowing]

1334
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:43,387
[Seok-ryu] I'm so worried.

1335
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,972
[pop song continues playing]

1336
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,705
Hey, you sure you're doing it right?

1337
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,958
The roof has to be sturdy
to keep the rain and snow out.

1338
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:15,294
Do you want to make it?

1339
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,514
[Seok-ryu] Hey,
the walls have to be sturdy too.

1340
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,642
Winter will come right after summer.

1341
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,562
You'll get diabetes that way.

1342
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,440
I'll worry about myself.

1343
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,282
Wow!

1344
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,701
-Great job!
-Hey!

1345
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,456
-Hey! Why you…
-[exclaiming]

1346
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,582
Come on!

1347
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,002
[Seok-ryu] I'm sorry! Sorry!

1348
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,463
MADE BY
CHOI SEUNG-HYO

1349
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,842
I'm continuing to reconstruct it.

1350
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,516
I think the cats that use this
are descendants of the one we knew.

1351
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,394
-They have the same coat pattern.
-Really?

1352
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,813
-Yeah.
-I want to see.

1353
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:18,023
-Forget it, okay?
-[sniffles]

1354
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,276
Your allergies are about to flare up.

1355
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:22,861
Isn't it a tragedy?

1356
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,614
I love cats, but I can't touch them.

1357
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,701
The cat house I made back then

1358
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,829
was the first house I ever made.

1359
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,833
I built it so poorly.

1360
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,086
But I was proud of it.

1361
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,633
I created a home
for a living thing with my own hands.

1362
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,344
I think…

1363
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,849
that's when I wanted
to become an architect.

1364
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:53,183
[Seok-ryu gasps]

1365
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,352
That means that cat was your first client.

1366
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,729
No.

1367
01:11:59,106 --> 01:11:59,940
It was you.

1368
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,444
I made it for you.

1369
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,779
You were worried about the cat.

1370
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,239
[pleasant music playing]

1371
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,866
I wanted you to be happy.

1372
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,249
[stomach growling]

1373
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,337
[Seung-hyo coughs]

1374
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,466
-[stomach growling]
-[coughs]

1375
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,301
[chuckles] Let's go eat.

1376
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,471
Let's go.

1377
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:33,932
[Seung-hyo] I'm starving.

1378
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,435
[Seok-ryu] Why haven't you eaten
anything so late?

1379
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:37,811
[Seung-hyo] Where should we go?

1380
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,438
[Seok-ryu] My home.

1381
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,903
Your mom made a whole pot of soup
before going on the trip.

1382
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:48,614
It's either this or curry. Eat up.

1383
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:52,618
[slurps]

1384
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,040
-I'm sorry about before.
-[Seung-hyo clears throat]

1385
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:02,169
What are you talking about?
I'm the one who caused the problem.

1386
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,463
I'm sorry.

1387
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,298
No, I was too harsh.

1388
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:12,888
Seeing you two together turned me
into someone petty and cheap.

1389
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:16,266
I'm the one who's done
more unpleasant things though.

1390
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,393
[chuckles softly]

1391
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,397
It's not great sharing
our past relationships with each other.

1392
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,317
Not knowing is one thing,
but knowing makes it hard.

1393
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,611
No wonder it's an unwritten rule.

1394
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,657
From now on,
I won't hide anything from you.

1395
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,493
I won't get involved with her
like that again.

1396
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,954
No, I won't leave any room for it.

1397
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:42,918
But…

1398
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:46,755
I was honestly happy to see you jealous.

1399
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,174
-What?
-Not a lot.

1400
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,927
Just a little bit.

1401
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,684
-[Seok-ryu clears throat]
-Still, let's not fight.

1402
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,437
It felt awful to fight with you.

1403
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:03,981
I couldn't focus at work,
and I was frustrated.

1404
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,024
This was a first for me.

1405
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,943
It was?

1406
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:09,736
Yeah.

1407
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,740
I didn't want to be someone
who was consumed by a relationship.

1408
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,078
It felt so unfamiliar.
I didn't feel like myself.

1409
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:21,957
Hey, that's normal.

1410
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,251
How long have you been pretending
to be cool?

1411
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,919
I don't know.

1412
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,673
I'm sure of one thing.

1413
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,635
You make me feel warm on the inside.

[harp music playing]

1415
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:46,482
Hey, I borrowed a lot of comic books.
They're in my room.

1416
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:49,443
Let's eat this quickly and read them.

1417
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,153
Yeah, sure.

1418
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,779

[Seung-hyo clears throat]

1420
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,084
[Seok-ryu] What are you doing?

1421
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,171
Why are you looking around
like it's your first time in here?

1422
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:10,756
No, it's just…

1423
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:12,758
[clears throat]

1424
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:17,012
Ta-da! I borrowed a whole series for you.

1425
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,597
What is this?

1426
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,309
What do you think?
It's Princess. It's your favorite.

1427
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:25,020
Well… Here it is. This is what I wanted.

1428
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,356
The book you wanted…

1429
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,066
was Princess?

1430
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:30,817
Oh, that.

1431
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,821
I just made that up.

1432
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:35,906
What?

1433
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,492
To be honest,

1434
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:44,081
I went to the comic book room to see you.

1435
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,542
What?

1436
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,796
Well, after being like that back then,

1437
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,423
why do you treat me this way now?

1438
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,424
[music fades]

1439
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,425
What did I do?

1440
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:58,345
You don't seem that interested in me.

1441
01:15:58,971 --> 01:15:59,930
Me?

1442
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:03,392
You can't look me in the eyes,
and you act indifferent.

1443
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,729
You treat me worse than how you did
before we started dating.

1444
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:13,110
Well… I mean, that's because…

1445
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:14,861
Well… [clears throat]

1446
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,451
I was just really nervous.

1447
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,623
It was because I was nervous.

1448

1450
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,313
How can you sleep
in this kind of situation?

1451
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,949
Why am I so nervous? This is so strange.

1452
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,132
[Seok-ryu] So this is what
a blueprint looks like.

1453
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:18,717
Yeah.

1454
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,386
[heart thumping]

1455
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,974
Really? Then I'll just buy a drink.

1456
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,059
Okay.

1457

[pop song continues playing]

1458
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:09,351
I'd waited for so long.

1459
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,314
But when you're actually next to me…

1460
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:17,484
[exhales]

1461
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,196
My mind goes blank,
and I don't know what to do.

1462
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:26,827
I thought…

1463
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:28,829
you were being…

1464
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,873
so calm.

1465
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:35,502
Now that we're dating,

1466
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,797
maybe you didn't see me as attractive.

1467
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,841
That's what I thought.

1468
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:45,762
I got anxious and worked up by myself.

1469
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:47,431
That's not it at all.

1470
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,267
It's the opposite.

1471
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:56,481
I like you so much.

1472
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,279
I don't know how to treat you.

1473
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,157
[song ends]

1474
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:20,046
Let's take these downstairs.

1475
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,300
You don't want to read them here?

1476
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,307
I don't think we should stay here.

1477
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,224
Why not?

1478
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:34,311
I'm having bad thoughts.

1479
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:36,938
What bad thoughts?

1480
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,319
Thoughts I shouldn't be thinking.

1481
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:46,406
Cheap and crude thoughts.

1482
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,867
Unhealthy thoughts.

1483
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,454
I used to like unhealthy junk food.

1484
01:19:56,374 --> 01:20:01,254
Powdered candy, taffy, and dalgona.

1485

-Crunch balls, corn nuts, and slushies.
-[Seok-ryu] Yeah.

So go ahead.

Think bad thoughts.

1488
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:20,065
What about bad deeds?

1489
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,487
You can do those too.
