with the soy sauce I brought?

really brings out the savoriness.

I wasn't trying to secretly read it.

I mean, you got to read my letter,
so it didn't feel fair.

Did he like me? But it was a joke?

155
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,559
Why would he plan a joke for 10 years?
What are they, economic reforms?

156
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,562
He could've just said it wasn't true.

157
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,897
Why did he crumple it up and toss it?

158

Did you pick the lock to get in?

180
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,269
I entered the key code.

181
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,354
Was no one else here?

182
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,106
Why are you so flustered?

183
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,191
Are you worried there might be a thief?

184
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,443
There's nothing to steal here.

185
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,613
No, I was just worried
because the door was open.

186
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,950
Why would you come here
without telling me?

187
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,160
Dad, do you remember?

188
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,995
I used to hang around here a lot as a kid.

189
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,456
-[water running]
-You practically lived here.

190
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,211
You'd always follow me
into the kitchen and mess around.

191
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,755
[Seok-ryu chuckles] You're right.

192
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,052
In the past, you used to work at a hotel
and even worked at a big restaurant.

193
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,930
But I loved it the most
when you worked here.

194
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,683
When you worked at the hotel,

195
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,352
you wore that tall hat
and I only saw you in photos.

196
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,062
I never actually saw you work.

197
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,022
And the restaurant was too busy.

198
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,192
But I loved
that I could come here all the time.

199
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,235
[chuckles softly]

200
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,197
It's strange,
but I still remember how I felt back then.

201
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,117
The sound of the knife cutting.

202
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,995
The low and steady warmth of the air.

203
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,789
The sound of people.

204
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,541
Seeing you work from the back.

205
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,044
And the tastiest tteokbokki
in the world.

206
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,382
That's good to hear.

207
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,427
-[Seok-ryu] Dad?
-Yeah?

208
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,595
What if…

209
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,015
What if I became a cook like you?

210
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,892
What are you saying?

211
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,351
It's a relief you didn't!

212
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,770
Why?

213
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,938
I made you study hard

214
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,275
so you wouldn't have to get your hands wet
or stand in front of a hot stove.

215
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,277
Leave this kind of work to me.

216
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,445
[chuckles]

217
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,656
-[Geun-sik] Seok-ryu.
-Yeah?

218
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,450
Want some tteokbokki before you go?

219
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,910
Sounds good.

220
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,119
Okay. [chuckles]

221
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,412
Wait right there.

222
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,083
[objects clattering]

223
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,127
THE CHUNGWOO DAILY

224
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,504
[exhales]

225
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,922
Wait a second!

226
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,717
Goodness. Thank you. [panting]

227
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,598
I would've pressed "Close"
if I knew it was you.

228
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,726
That would've hurt
your performance review. [chuckles softly]

229
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,687
How's Yeon-du? Is she okay?

230
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,691
Yes, she was discharged.
She went to kindergarten this morning.

231
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,235
What a relief.

232
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,739
Kids always get sick
when the seasons change.

233
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,449
It's to worry their parents.

234
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,493
Could you transfer me
to a different department?

235
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,496
-What?
-I know you did a lot to accommodate me.

236
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,832
But the social affairs team
will be fine even without me.

237
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,920
My daughter needs me the most right now.

238
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,966
I had three kids as I stayed on this job.

239
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,052
I know. That's why I respect you.

240
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,887
I'm not trying to brag.

241
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,600
I probably would've left
if my husband weren't a freelancer.

242
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,770
It must be hard raising her on your own.

243
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,105
[elevator rings]

244
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,566
But kids grow up fast.

245
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,071
Give it another thought.

246
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,533
And if you still want to leave then,
I won't try to stop you.

247
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:35,916
[exhales]

248
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,680
[pleasant music playing]

249
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,104
[Seok-ryu over tablet]
You know how in the US

250
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,190
we have chicken soup
when we're not feeling so well?

251
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,154
I guess it's because it's so comforting,
and it warms you up from the inside.

252
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,574
Well, Korea has its own chicken soup,

253
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,534
which we will be making today.

254
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,493
The samgyejuk.

255
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,955
The ingredients are as you see here.

256
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,837
So let me start by preparing the chicken.

257
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,926
I had an important presentation
earlier today,

258
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,596
so you can imagine
what a tense day it has been for me.

259
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:35,684
That's why I wanted
to comfort my tired soul,

260
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,479
not just with food but by cooking.

261
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:45,569
Because personally for me,
it's a very soothing ritual.

262
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,488
As I cook,

263
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,866
I get very comfortable and I just unwind.

264
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,412
I feel like totally myself
when I'm at ease.

265
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,906
[Tae-hui] Hey, Seok-ryu.
It's been a while!

266
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,865
Hello!

267
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,121
-Why aren't you saying hi?
-Why? I see her every day.

268
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,375
-You took your cast off.
-Yeah.

269
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,675
Thank you so much
for the soy sauce the other day.

270
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,511
It tastes absolutely amazing.
My family loves it.

271
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,596
Let me know if you need more.

272
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,932
Do you have time to come in for tea?

273
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,392
Tea?

274
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,895
We have work to talk about.
Why are you inviting her?

275
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,689
We need to go over Fresco.

276
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,733
We need to decide
on the direction and schedule.

277
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,235
Yeah, okay.

278
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,864
I was busy anyway.

279
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,033
I'm sure you're busy. You should go.

280
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,660
I'm sorry, Seok-ryu. Let's meet up later.

281
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,626
[scoffs]

282
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,046
He went nuts when I said
to work things out with her.

283
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,298
Now, I'm an unwelcome guest?

284
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,217
Like me? Yeah, right.

285
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,762
Forget it.
I don't care about that letter either.

286
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,479
What's the reason?

287
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,816
I see you still ask random questions
without any context.

288
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,859
I don't understand.

289
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,987
Tell me why you agreed to work with me.

290
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,115
It seemed like a good opportunity.
I thought it'd be fun to try.

291
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,910
How predictable.

292
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,578
What did you expect?

293
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,246
POMEGRANATE TREE

294
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,917
I don't know. Something more honest.

295
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,504
I know you used me as an excuse today.

296
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,132
You were silent the whole time,

297
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,219
but in front of Seok-ryu,
you said on purpose we had to work.

298
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,221
Sorry if it seemed that way.

299
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,769
Since it's turned out this way,
how about just using me?

300
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,107
-What?
-Use me the best you can.

301
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,777
It'll be nice.
I'd get to go on dates with you,

302
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,529
and you can face your feelings.

303
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,615
Do you want to be thrown out?

304
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,158
Come on.

305
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,618
I think Seok-ryu's cute.

306
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,162
Of course, you're cuter.

307
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,415
Can't I hang out
with you two cuties a bit longer?

308
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,085
You can tease me all you want,

309
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,586
but don't say anything to Seok-ryu.

310
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,173
[sighs audibly]

311
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,510
I think you already told her
something important.

312
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,220
What?

313
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,849
But there's something you left out.

314
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,518
I should ask her to grab a bite later.

315
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,103
What did I tell her?

316
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,980
I mean, what are you going to say?

317
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,857
I'm not telling you.

318
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,774
What did I say?

319
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,943
-If I tell you, you'll let me join in?
-Tae-hui!

320
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,529
I love it when you call my name.

321
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,531
What did I say?

322
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,283
What are you going to tell her?

323
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,742
[upbeat music playing]

and maintain cruising speed.

[engine accelerating]

327
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,172
[Seok-ryu exhales]

328
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,175
I wondered
what you were doing at the river.

329
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,635
-Who knew you'd be on a boat?
-[exhales]

330
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,890
I passed the written test, so I need
to practice for the in-person exam.

331
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,350
You're about to overtake
the land, air, and sea.

332
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,020
What's next?
A light aircraft pilot license?

333
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:48,937
Next is…

334
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,148
-The South Pole.
-What?

335
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,277
There's a paramedic who was sent
to the research station there.

336
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,572
This license will earn
extra points for it.

337
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,908
Wow, that's so like you.

338
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:05,662
You'd walk in puddles,
mud, and wet cement as a kid,

339
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,165
always picking paths
others wouldn't travel.

340
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,709
You're finally venturing
into uncharted territory.

341
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,877
[Mo-eum] Come on.

342
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,755
Hey. Don't count your chickens
before they hatch.

343

[clears throat]

344
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,468
Documents, interviews,
and personality and aptitude tests.

345
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,720
I have a long way to go to be selected.

346
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,556
I'm the one with a long way to go.

347
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,807
What?

348
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,185
I registered for a cooking class.

349
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,479
Holy cow.

350
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,606
I thought long and hard about it.

351
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,651
I think I want to do it.

352
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,072
No, I want to do it.

353
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:45,619
In the past, I thought studying
was your favorite thing to do.

354
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,704
But I was wrong.

355
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,542
You just liked the praise and attention
that came from studying well.

356
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,795
You went crazy for the extra stuff.

357
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,964
You've been brutally honest a lot lately.

358
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,715
Yes, but…

359
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,550
You loved to cook.

360
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,762
It was a pure and selfless love.

361
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,227
I should've known you were destined for it
when I saw you make perfect dalgonas.

362
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,314
-Are you cheering me on?
-Of course.

363
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,691
[clears throat]

364
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,777
Let's celebrate today.

365
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,780
Let's call Seung-hyo over
and have a party.

366
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,031
Hey.

367
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:23,949
Hello?

368
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,617
Seung-hyo!

369
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,077
-Hey, don't.
-[Mo-eum] Wait.

370
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,206
Seok-ryu said she registered
for cooking classes today.

371
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,126
She registered for cooking classes?

372
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,586
Yeah…

373
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,049
Well, on that note,
let's have a party to celebrate tonight.

374
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,677
I can't go. I have plans.

375
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,596
Really? Okay.

376
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,808
Then, come after you're done.
I'll text you the location later.

377
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,560
Bye.

378
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,896
[call disconnects]

379
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,234
[sighs softly]

380
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,195
Why say that if he can't make it?

381
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,905
Don't you know him at all?

382
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,159
He always says he can't come but he does.

383
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,827
He really won't come today.

384
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,454
What's this?

385
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,415
Did you two fight again?

386
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,883
[Dan-ho] Mr. Choi?

387
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,384
Oh.

388
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,596
It's nice to run into you
around the town like this.

389
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,556
I feel the same. Are you going home?

390
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,934
No, I'm thinking of getting a drink.
Do you want to join me?

391
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,352
Oh.

392
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,856
[inhales] Well…

393
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,736
This is it.

394
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,699
[Seung-hyo] Oh.

395
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,202
You live next door to Jung Mo-eum?

396
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,288
Yes, I just learned that recently.

397
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,664
I see. [chuckles softly]

398
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,543
Try to be understanding
if things get loud.

399
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,878
She's a good person.

400
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:00,962
I know.

401
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,425
But I feel bad about making you come here.

402
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,927
It was due to circumstances.

403
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,136
Daddy!

404
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,721
[Dan-ho] Yeon-du.

405
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,806
[door closes]

406
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,642
My girl, did you wait a long for me?

407
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,726
[Yeon-du] Yeah.

408
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,271
This is my daughter.

409
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,023
Yeon-du, say hi.

410
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,943
Hello, I'm Kang Yeon-du.

411
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,361
But who are you?

412
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,199
I'm Choi Seung-hyo.

413
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,784
I am…

414
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,829
your dad's…

415
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,580
neighborhood friend.

416
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,167
[chuckles softly]

417
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,460
[pleasant music playing]

418
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,713
[exclaims]

419
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,674
[Dan-ho] I'm sorry.

420
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,845
I'm sure misugaru wasn't the drink
you were talking about.

421
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,807
No, this is exactly what I wanted.

422
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,016
With a lot of ice too.

423
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,309
[Dan-ho chuckles]

424
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,522
[exhales]

425
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,235
I haven't had any alcohol,
but I oddly feel like I'm getting drunk.

426
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,363
I guess this neighborhood does that?

427
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,200
It's my first time here,
but I feel like I've lived here forever.

428
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,494
It's strangely relaxing.

429
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,289
And it makes me excited.

430
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,461
I've experienced that too,
and this place is like that.

431
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,589
You're adjusting well.

432
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,176
Yes, thanks to my neighborhood friend.

433
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,143
Can I ask you why
you wanted to drink tonight?

434
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,729
-Sorry?
-Well…

435
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,274
I guess it's a habit from work.

436
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,068
I read people's faces.

437
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,362
I ask incessantly
if I'm curious about something.

438
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,908
Maybe that's why people hate reporters.

439
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,869
Well, it looks like you already knew.

440
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:56,870
[Dan-ho chuckles]

441
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,872
Of course.

442
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,334
However, I'm good with the opposite too.

443
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:07,422
I'm a good listener. I can be neutral.
And I can guarantee anonymity.

444
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,968
I just thought I could be of some help.

445
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,394
It's about my friend, not me.

446
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,358
There's someone he liked a long time ago.

447
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,905
He thought he'd moved on
from his feelings for her.

448
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,575
But he's a bit confused
after seeing her again.

449
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,578
That's understandable.

450
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,875
He doesn't know what to do,
so he keeps avoiding her.

451
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,127
-I think he's having a hard time.
-[Dan-ho] Mmm.

452
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,005
Is it something that can't happen?

453
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,299
For example, is she seeing someone else?

454
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,680
She's in love with someone else.
They almost got married.

455
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,558
In any case, she's single now, right?

456
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,979
As for this woman,

457
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,897
does she know how your friend feels?

458
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,941
No.

459
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,569
But he's scared she might find out.

460
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,616
He's never confessed
his feelings to her before.

461
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,618
Why not?

462
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,996
They've always been together,

463
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,499
so he didn't know the true nature
of those feelings at first.

464
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,251
After that…

465
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,463
he was cautious
to not ruin their friendship.

466
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,133
When he did decide to tell her…

467
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,802
the timing was off.

468
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,306
And now…

469
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,645
he can't even dare to try.

470
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,442
He had a hard time
for a while because of that.

471
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,029
He'd get nauseous and dizzy.

472
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,658
He's finally settled down now

473
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,080
and doesn't want to go back to that time.

474
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,709
[quirky music playing]

475
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,589
No wonder he didn't come today.

476
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,717
[Mo-eum exclaims]

477
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,061
I'm so curious. How can I wait 10 years?

478
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,233
All right. Let's see here.

479
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,113
Whose letter is this?

480
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,366
It must be Seung-hyo's.

481
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,412
[exclaims]

482
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,709
[laughing] I knew it!

483
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,670
Just tell her that you like her.

484
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,631
Why does he make it so hard on himself?

485
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,008
I swear…

486
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,928
Jeez, he's so pathetic.

487
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,847
He's still as dumb as ever.

488
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,266
[scoffs]

489
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,812
Did you hear that strange noise?

490
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,523
Not really.

491
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,024
I don't know.

492
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,652
Was I mistaken?

493
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,697
Then, is your friend going to continue

494
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,325
to pretend like he doesn't like her

495
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,411
and push her away?

496
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,956
He says he's trying for now.

497
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,625
If he were my friend,

498
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,878
I'd tell him about a swimmer I know.

499
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,757
There once was an athlete
in the 200-meter event

500
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,969
whose weakness was
being slow off the blocks.

501
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,013
But despite this, he overcame it
through his tireless efforts.

502
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,099
[mellow music playing]

503
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,101
Even if it's a bit late,

504
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,230
I'd tell him to muster up the courage,
just like the swimmer did.

505
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,316
[exhales]

506
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,905
[sighs softly]

507
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,328
[Mi-suk] Get up!

508
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,496
I said get up!

509
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,458
[Geun-sik] I'm up.

510
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,545
You should wake up early in the morning
and get ready for work.

511
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,213
We're not even ready to retire.

512
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,340
What have you accomplished
to afford to be lazy?

513
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,259
Okay, stop it.

514
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,802
Stop what?

515
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,639
Thinking about all the money we've lost
is enough to keep me up at night.

516
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,434
Why are you bringing up
things from the past again?

517
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,644
The past? Things are still the same now.

518
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,899
And when did you come home last night?
I woke up to you sleeping next to me.

519
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,151
I told you. I went to a funeral.

520
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,154
Gosh, you went to a funeral
the other night and the night before.

521
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,573
You're just going around giving money.

522
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,451
This is why I hate coming home.

523
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,204
What? You have no right to be shouting!

524
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,288
Whatever.

525
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,291
Look! You're running away
because you have nothing to say!

526
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,628
-I'm not done yet! Come home early.
-[Geun-sik] I have a class reunion today!

527
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,670
[Mi-suk] Again?

528
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,047
Are you kidding me?

529
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,048
[phone vibrating]

530
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,842
Unbelievable…

531
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,681
Why are there insufficient funds?

532
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,099
[gasps]

533
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,602
Is this a new voice phishing scam?

534
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:28,034
Hey, I'm saying this in advance to avoid
any misunderstanding. I'm just passing by.

535
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,453
My cooking class is near here.

536
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,788
I didn't say anything.

537
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,291
I'm trying to get
my Korean Food Craftsman certificate.

538
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,878
Don't tell my parents yet.

539
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,630
I won't.

540
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,217
Today's my first class.

541
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,388
I looked over the curriculum,
and there's a written and in-person exam.

542
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,474
And once class is over,
I get to take home whatever I make--

543
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,059
I have a meeting.

544
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,435
I'm off.

545
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,234
What was that?

546
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,612
He's the one who insisted
that I find my dream.

547
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,660
KOREAN FOOD CRAFTSMAN

548
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,125
WHAT DO KOREAN FOOD CRAFTSMAN DO?

549
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,506
-[Myeong-u] The deodeok looks good.
-Jeez!

550
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,258
Why did you suddenly close the window?

551
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,051
What are you doing there?

552
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
What are you doing?

553
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,220
What?

554
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:34,392
-Look at the time. Let's have the meeting.
-Isn't that for a certificate?

555
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,643
Why are you looking at that?

556
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,606
Na-yun, tell Hyeong-chan and Jeong-min
to come to the meeting room.

557
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,316
Are you learning to cook? Korean food?

558
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,942
I like Western cuisine.

559
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,777
HYEREUNG COOKING SCHOOL

560
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,702
[cooking teacher] Welcome
to the Korean Food Craftsman class.

561
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,620
Hello.

562
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,371
[all] Hello.

563
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,414
[playful music playing]

564
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,292
Today's our first class together.

565
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,254
The first one's always memorable
and exciting.

566
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,298
With that in mind, I'll make sure

567
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,843
to give you a very raw
and memorable first experience.

568
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,305
We'll be learning the basics
of knife skills today.

569
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,223
You'll first learn basic techniques.

570
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,352
Then, you'll start cutting radishes,
carrots, and other vegetables.

571
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,772
All right, let's pick up
the knife that's in front of you.

572
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,649
Okay, good.

573
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,027
First, place the non-slip pad
on the counter

574
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,779
and put the cutting board on top of it.

575
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,867
Good. When putting knives down, make sure
the blade always faces away from you

576
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,494
to not accidentally cut yourself.

577
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,620
That's good.

578
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,539
We're going to julienne the radish.

579
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,001
First, peel the radish.

580
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:47,173
Okay. Then, cut them into slices
about 0.2 centimeters thick.

581
00:32:56,057 --> 00:33:00,812
When preparing an omelet,
remove the chalazae from the yolk.

582
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,940
Then, strain the egg whites
through a sieve.

583
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,234
Whisk it smooth to avoid creating bubbles.

584
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:11,155
Next, coat the pan with a thin layer
of oil over low heat.

585
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,126
[indistinct chatter]

586
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,007
[indistinct chatter]

587
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,301
[lead worker] Hey, Mr. Choi!

588
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,554
-Over here!
-Come sit down!

589
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,974
Have you all been well?

590
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,684
Not at all.

591
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,936
Work sites have been a mess these days.

592
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,063
It was great when we worked with you.

593
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,441
What do you mean?
You hated me for being strict.

594
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,109
I'd rather have someone strict.

595
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,654
These people can't do their jobs
and always abuse their power,

596
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,614
so it's been miserable working for them.

597
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,618
Come on. You're not the type
to let a client walk all over you.

598
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,829
Hold on. Are you mocking me?

599
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:00,788
[all laughing]

600
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,873
Well, prepare yourself.

601
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,668
I'm going to punish you
with alcohol tonight!

602
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,753
[all exclaiming]

603
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,089
I drove tonight. I can't.

604
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,008
Call a designated driver.

605
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,302
Ma'am, can we get some soda
and another glass?

606
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,219
[female staff] Okay!

607
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,263
In return, dinner's on me tonight.

608
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,890
[lead worker] What? Really?

609
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,058
[all exclaiming]

610
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,477
Okay!

611
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,396
Then, instead of alcohol,

612
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,775
-I'll punish you with meat instead!
-[workers laughing]

613
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,109
-Open up!
-[Seung-hyo] Gosh.

614
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,614
-Wow!
-[lead worker] Isn't it good?

615
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,074
What is this? Why is it so good?

616
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,742
I'm quite the gourmet.

617
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,161
The taste of the meat here
is different from other places.

618
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,247
-It's so juicy!
-[all laughing]

619
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,625
You know our chief's philosophy.

620
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,669
"Grease the wheels with delicious meat

621
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,922
to keep the job running smoothly."

622
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,965
-[workers] Huzzah!
-All right!

623
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,302
[all chuckling]

624
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,553
It's so good.

625
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,181
[all exclaiming]

626
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,102
I don't think this will be enough.

627
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,814
Excuse me, could we have
more pork belly and short rib, please?

628
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,107
And more beef brisket too!

630
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,486
Gosh, what's this?

631
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,488
What's this? Take it.

632
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,656
Thank you very much.

633
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,116
-[worker] Eat up.
-Thank you.

634
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,701
I can't believe
you didn't have a single drink.

635
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,203
You're so dogged!

636
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,247
I'm sorry. I still have work left to do.

637
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,916
You're drunk.
Don't go for another round of drinks.

638
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,459
Make sure you go home, okay?

639
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,294
Gosh, stop your nagging!

640
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,422
Leave your car at home next time
and come on foot.

641
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,007
Like this.

642
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,343
-Yes, sir.
-[lead worker] Okay, see you next time.

643

-Goodness.
-Chief! This way!

706
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,863
I can't expect someone who never clears
his own dirty dishes to do anything.

707
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,990
Does he eat all three meals at home?

708
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,075
-Yeah!
-Goodness.

709
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,744
-All three meals?
-That's right.

710
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,912
-My goodness.
-[In-suk] Hey.

711
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:36,540
I said, "Let's go out to eat," and he said
he hated the smell of foods with MSG.

712
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,918
-[gasps]
-You know how much MSG I put in his soups?

713
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,628
[all laughing]

714
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,546
He's lucky it wasn't rat poison!

715
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,464
I know!

716
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,049
Husbands don't know that.

717
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,384
[In-suk] They all don't.

718
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,843
Maybe you don't add enough.

719
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,720
I add a whole bunch in!

720
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,846
[Hye-suk] Really?

721
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,516
Gosh, I'm the most envious of Hye-suk.

722
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,892
Why me?

723
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,479
You both independently do your own work.
You live apart and are cool about it.

724
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,898
It's so cool!

725
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,317
-It is.
-I bet you two don't even fight.

726
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,152
No, we don't fight.

727
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,112
[In-suk chuckles]

728
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,239
Hey, her family is
in a different world altogether.

729
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,574
It's been hard
to even see my husband around lately.

730
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,076
-Why?
-[Mi-suk] I don't know.

731
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,911
I don't know. Who knows what he's up to?

732
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,538
He always comes home at dawn.

733
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,997
[Jae-suk] What? Dawn?

734
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,666
He's staying out all night!

735
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,710
Mi-suk, some men stay out
late enough to see the morning dew.

736
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,712
-That's a serious problem!
-[Jae-suk] Of course!

737
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,591
Why are you being so serious?
Forget it. It's not like that.

738
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,427
-He has business--
-[Jae-suk] What business?

739
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,178
Funerals, class reunions, and what else?

740
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,639
-Yeah, those are the best excuses.
-Yeah!

741
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,682
[In-suk] My goodness.

742
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,935
Mi-suk, you need to be careful!

743
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,271
He could be having an affair!

744
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,231
What are you talking about?

745
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,901
-[In-suk] Hey! What's wrong with you?
-[Jae-suk] Are you okay?

746
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,486
-It got everywhere!
-Unbelievable.

747
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,490
How many funerals did he go to?
One, two, three…

748
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,033
He went to three funerals.

749
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,326
Wipe your mouth.

750
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,661
No, wait! Is that okay?

751
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,329
-Is that a rag?
-[Jae-suk] It's a cloth.

752
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,831
It doesn't smell. Wipe your mouth.

753
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,334
[In-suk] That's right.
Is your shop taking a break?

754
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,044
-[Hye-suk coughing]
-What?

755
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,671
It hasn't been open for days.

756
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,672
What?

757
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,300
[In-suk] Hey, look into it quick. Okay?

758
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,719
What are we going to do?

759
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,387
[mysterious music playing]

760
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,691
[exhales]

761
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,447
[paper rustling]

762
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,958
SHORT-TERM CREDIT LOAN
REVOLVING CREDIT

763
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,170
[exclaims]

764
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,464
[breathing heavily]

765
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,179
[man slurping]

766
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,097
[exclaims]

767
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,434
Hello.

768
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,102
Hi.

769
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,272
[Dan-ho] Wait.

770
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,152
There are two seats here.
Would you like to sit?

771
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,656
Right.

772
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,160
Thank you.

773
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,038
Not at all.
It wasn't my chair to begin with.

774
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,499
[grunts]

775
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,421
[exhales]

776
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,261
[sighs] Excuse me,

777
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,721
I usually try not to interfere.

778
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,600
But you shouldn't be here
while Yeon-du is home alone.

779
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,269
Yeon-du…

780
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,314
went to an overnight camp
for kindergarteners.

781
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,774
I see…

782
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,320
-She went to camp.
-[Dan-ho] Yes.

783
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,323
I'm sorry.

784
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,827
It's fine.

785
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,954
But…

786
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,665
you're having dinner pretty late.

787
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,749
Yes.

788
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,211
I was out on a call and had to
go around looking for hospitals.

789
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,047
Did the hospital refuse a patient?

790
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,507
Yeah.

791
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,842
I'm sure you know,

792
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,595
but there's a lot of patients
and a shortage of medical staff.

793
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,430
That's the current situation.

794
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,390
What happened to the patient?

795
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,893
I made sure the patient
was examined and admitted.

796
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,479
[exhales] I'm relieved to hear that.

797
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,777
You're really impressive.

798
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,154
Excuse me?

799
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,072
What gives?

800
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,575
Is this a "love your enemy" type of thing?

801
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,701
[chuckles]

802
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:45,164
It's not that. You know how to give
honest criticism in a kind way.

803
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,419
I hope you'll continue
to look after Yeon-du.

804
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,256
Tell her to give me another chance.

805
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:58,510
If you've said anything bad about me,
I ask that you take it back.

806
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,430
I didn't do anything like that at all.

807
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,390
Okay, then.

808
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,685
By the way…

809
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,855
If you don't mind me asking,

810
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,900
but does Yeon-du have any other family?

811
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,360
Oh.

812
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,696
Yeon-du's mom is very far away.

813
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,490
[Mo-eum] I see.

814
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,540
I think you're a really good dad.

815
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,377
[pleasant music playing]

816
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,544
Me?

817
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,629
Yes.

818
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,715
You raised your daughter well.

819
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,177
Look at how smart and cute she is.

820
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,223
Right?

821
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,101
Isn't she cute?

822
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,106
She's the most precious person
in the world to me.

823
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:59,738
I could give everything up for her.

824
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,490
Everything.

825
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,368
Don't give anything up.

826
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,247
Well…

827
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,042
My dad passed away when I was young.

828
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,712
So I know what it's like.

829
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,049
If my mom ever sacrificed
anything for me,

830
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,176
I hated that the most.

831
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,640
I'm just saying.

832
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,688
Then, can I play with Yeon-du
from time to time again?

833
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,649
Of course,

834
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,234
as long as it's okay with her.

835
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,569
Really?

836
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,905
Thank you. Can you tell me what she likes?

837
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,282
I want to win her back.

838
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,660
-What does Yeon-du like?
-[Mo-eum] Yes.

839
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:51,373
[slurring] She liked ghosts
and zombies in the past.

840
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,834
What? You're starting to slur…

841
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,545
Isn't good pronunciation
important to news reporters?

842
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,546
[quirky music playing]

843
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,175
[slurring] Yeon-du likes aliens.
She likes aliens.

844
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,347
Dan-ho?

845
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,891
[groans softly]

846
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,186
How much can you usually drink?

847
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,395
What?

848
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,190
[chuckles softly]

849
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,027
One can of beer.

850
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,779
What he's saying and doing don't line up.

851
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,824
Goodness.

852
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,328
Dan-ho? What do I do?

853
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,163
Goodness!

854
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,374
Assisting a drunk person home.

855
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,752
This is off-the-clock work!

856
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:42,466
If he weren't Yeon-du's dad,
I would've just left him.

857
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,467
[grunts]

858
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:48,263
Dan-ho, I don't think
you should drink for a while.

859
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,391
Just stick to the Pine Ear Drink! Got it?

860
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,393
[straining]

861
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,439

[groans]

864
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:07,658
[panting] I'm sure
he won't freeze to death, right?

865
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,047
[door opens]

866
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:23,966
[door closes]

867
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,812
[music ends]

868
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,821
-[breathing heavily]
-[Geun-sik] Are you insane?

869
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:49,408
Is this how you treat someone
after a hard day's work?

870
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,411
A hard day's work? You were working?

871
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:55,205
Where did you go off gallivanting
after closing the shop?

872
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,791
What on earth have you been up to?

873
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,296
You applied for revolving credit?

874
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,256
You took out a cash advance?

875
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,552
Hey, you have eyes. Look at this.

876
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,096
The bean sprouts were on sale
for 1,500 won.

877
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,848
The pork belly cost 9,900 won.

878
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,933
The gas bill is 3,180 won!

879
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,643
[breathing heavily]

880
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:21,481
I keep track of these trivial details
as we've tightened our belts.

881
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,900
How could you?

882
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,570
How could you mess up again?

883
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,030
[Seok-ryu] I'm home.

884
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:29,823
[door closes]

885
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,203
-Mom, what's wrong?
-I can't put up with your dad anymore.

886
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,288
I'm at my limit.

887
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,624
What's wrong? Dad, what is it?

888
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,167
No, it's nothing.

889
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,836
[Mi-suk] You close the shop
and stay out all night!

890
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,756
And you messed up with money again!

891
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,635
Tell me why.

892
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,179
Did you co-sign another friend's loan?

893
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,930
No.

894
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:54,848
Wait…

895
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,017
Were you gambling?

896
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,435
No, it's not like that.

897
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,394
Then…

898
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,230
-Are you having an affair?
-Honey!

899
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,275
You really don't trust me?

900
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,277
How can I trust you
when you act like this?

901
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,946
How could you say… [sniffles]

902
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,992
How can you back me
into a corner like this every time?

903
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,412
I had no choice…

904
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,916
I had no other choice but to do that.

905
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,001
[breath trembling]

906
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,379
Dad, what is it? What's going on?

907
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,173
There was an accident.

908
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,473
Excuse me, sir?

909
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,850
-Yes?
-[water running]

910
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:39,935
[dramatic music playing]

911
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,436
[chuckles] What is it?

912
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,397
I think something's in the food.

913
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,691
I think it's a hair.
You should take a look.

914
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,194
That's not possible.

915
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,488
-[boy 1 yelps]
-[Geun-sik groans]

916
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,073
-I'm so sorry!
-[boy 2] Seriously?

917
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,074
Were you burned?

918
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:54,991
[boy 1 groans]

919
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,619
Let me see.
You should've been more careful!

920
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,915
-I'm sorry. Let's go to the hospital.
-Let go of me! [yelps]

921
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,378
I'm just worried you're really hurt.

922
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,255
Of course, I'm hurt!

923
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,173
I'm hurt, and my watch…

924
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,508
[gasps]

925
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,636
My watch stopped.

926
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,764
-Watch?
-[boy 1] Come on!

927
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,726
The watch… I'm sorry.

928
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:26,148
Are you trying to brush this off
with just an apology?

929
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,609
That watch costs 30 million won!

930
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,194
It does?

931
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,239
[boy 2] No. It costs way more, mister.

932
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,451
Do you think you can buy
this watch with just money?

933
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,495
To buy this, you need to
build a purchase history

934
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,581
by buying several items from this brand.

935
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,958
It's a top-of-the-line luxury brand.

936
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,794
That means…

937
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,381
even if I sold you off, I still
won't be able to afford this watch.

938
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,091
Don't try to touch it.

939
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,388
Okay, I understand.

940
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:04,102
I'll cover the cost of repairs then.

941
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,522
Hey, he kills my precious watch
and wants to cover the cost of repairs.

942
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,774
[both chuckle]

943
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,359
Look, the thing about this watch is

944
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,153
he bought it less than a week ago.

945
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,614
It's totally brand new.

946
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,532
Then, what should I…

947
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,743
Reimburse the full amount
before I sue you!

948
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,369
-You're so frustrating.
-Gosh.

949
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,371
Sir…

950
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:44,434
DESIGNATED DRIVERS

951
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,479
[phone ringing]

952
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,610
[automated voice] You have been assigned.
Proceed to the pickup location.

953
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,867
Sir, did you call for a designated driver?

954
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,869
-[man] Yeah.
-[Geun-sik] Okay. [groans]

955
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,955
I'm sorry.

956
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,623
This way, sir.

957
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,801
Sir, we're at the location you provided.

958
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,887
Sir, we're here.

959
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,015
-[man retching]
-[Geun-sik groans] Sir!

960
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,353
-Sir!
-[man groans]

961
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,231
-Sweetie, why are you so cute?
-[Geun-sik] Yes?

962
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,067
-Where's your car?
-Car? Is it here?

963
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,443
Over there!

964
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,405
Do you want to come over?

965
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,532
-[Geun-sik] Where do you live?
-My house?

966
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,203
Ma'am, we're here.

967
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,455
-[car lock beeps]
-Here's your key.

968
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,542
You're so annoying.

969
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,377
[Geun-sik] Take care, ma'am.

970
00:52:59,009 --> 00:52:59,843
[exhales]

971
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,810
[line ringing]

972
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,812
Hello, it's me.

973
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,398
I deposited 20 million won just now.

974
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,150
Please accept this for now.

975
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,819
I'll try to get the rest somehow.

976
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,363
Just give me a few more days.

977
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,620
So to pay them, you took money
from our living expense account?

978
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,747
You took out a credit card loan

979
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,415
and worked as a driver?

980
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,627
[scoffs] To handle that alone…

981
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,128
Are you a fool?

982
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,756
Do you have any sense at all?

983
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,008
You do think I'm a fool.

984
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,512
You look down on me for being incompetent.

985
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,390
When did I ever?

986
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,726
Well, all the time.

987
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,562
With me, it's always money.

988
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,274
All you ever talk to me about is money.

989
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,276
[exhales]

990
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,487
But gosh,
if I were to tell you about this,

991
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,072
what would you think of me then?

992
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,742
What if I got sued
and had to close the shop?

993
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:09,162
If I lost even the tiny bit of income

994
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,622
that I'm earning now,

995
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,708
what would that make me?

996
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,670
The only thing I know how to do…

997
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,464
[sniffles]

998
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,177
All I know how to do
is just make tteokbokki.

999
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,889
If I can't even do that,
then what does that make me?

1000
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,015
[emotional music playing]

1001
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,602
Well? What can I
contribute to this family?

1002
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,688
There's nothing else in my life.

1003
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,523
Dad…

1004
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:41,027
I'll do whatever I can
to pay that money back.

1005
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,238
Who asked you to?

1006
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:48,451
-That's not what's important right now--
-Please, Mi-suk. Stop scolding me!

1007
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,706
It hurts when I'm hit too, you know.

1008
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,000
Okay? It hurts me too.

1009
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,293
I'll be home later.

1010
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,052

[Mi-suk crying]

1014
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,159
[Seok-ryu] Dad!

1015
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,453
-[Geun-sik] Hey, why did you…
-[thuds]

1016
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,787
Are you okay?

1017
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,957
[Seok-ryu exhales]

1018
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,504
[Geun-sik whimpering]

1019
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,553
Dad.

1020
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,971
[Geun-sik] I'm okay.

1021
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,015
I'm all right. [sniffles]

1022
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,354
You always did this for me
when I was a kid.

1023
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,524
Now, I'm doing it for you.

1024
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,152
I've grown up a lot, haven't I?

1025
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,286
I'm sorry, Seok-ryu.

1026
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,080
Why would you be sorry?

1027
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,873
They're the bad guys.

1028
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,167
Let's just go to the cops.

1029
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,753
Full compensation is ridiculous.

1030
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,338
We can't report it.

1031
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:28,301
They could close our shop
for violating the Food Sanitation Act.

1032
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,511
[exhales]

1033
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:35,600
[chuckles softly]
I have no right to be a father, do I?

1034
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,853
Gosh, I have a beautiful daughter,

1035
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,731
but I've never bought you a nice outfit.

1036
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,277
I couldn't even send you any allowance
when you were studying overseas.

1037
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,489
And I'm still…

1038
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,784
causing you to worry over money.

1039
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,498
How can you place value on that
with money? It should be with love.

1040
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,835
What about me? I'm unemployed.

1041
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,795
I don't have the right
to be your daughter?

1042
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,839
What are you talking about?

1043
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,257
Hey! You're…

1044
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,177
You'll always have the right
to be my daughter.

1045
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,389
No renewal is needed,
and it can't be cancelled.

1046
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,268
You'll always be my daughter, okay?

1047
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,603
It's the same for me.

1048
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,441
Bae Geun-sik will always be my dad.

1049

They could close our shop

I'm going to lose my mind.

1057
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,484
[inhales]

1058
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,529
Fish cake soup, hair, watch.

1059
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,536
If only we had
security cameras in the shop…

1060
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,291
Security camera!

1061
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,588
BEST CLEANERS

1062
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,510
Hello!

1063
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,221
Hey, Seok-ryu!

1064
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,306
-Are you dropping off clothes?
-No.

1065
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,559
Can I see some footage
from your security camera?

1066
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,229
-You want to see too?
-Did someone else come by?

1067
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,813
Seung-hyo already came by for it.

1068
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,857
What's going on?

1069
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,610
[phone vibrating]

1070
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,820
BAE SEOK-RYU

1071
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,073
[lounge music playing in background]

1072
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,368
-Are you the son of Root Diner's owner?
-Yes.

1073
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,496
Is the burn on your hand okay?

1074
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,789
Of course not.

1075
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,125
Let's resolve the watch issue first.
We'll discuss this later.

1076
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,210
Okay.

1077
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:11,130
First, take the remaining money.

1078
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,007
[sniffles]

1079
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,969
Your father said
he couldn't get the money.

1080
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,429
You must've worked hard for this.

1081
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,099
[Seung-hyo] I'm sorry,
but before you take it,

1082
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,851
could I see the watch my father broke?

1083
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,729
The watch? Why?

1084
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,565
Since we're covering the full cost,

1085
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,358
I'd like to at least see

1086
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,318
what this expensive watch looks like.

1087
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,320
-I'm sure he does.
-[chuckles softly]

1088
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,447
Yeah, okay.

1089
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,950
He'll never be able
to afford it himself.

1090
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,162
So this is the watch. Wow.

1091
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,040
This is an Audemar
Constantine Philip Mills.

1092
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,834
He must've heard of it before.

1093
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,087
Of course. It's one of the top
luxury watches in the world.

1094
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,297
Wow…

1095
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,841
I have the same watch.

1096
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,759
What?

1097
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,637
How interesting.

1098
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,473
I received an award recently.

1099
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,893
This watch company sponsored the awards
and gave me one as a gift.

1100
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,562
[amusing music playing]

1101
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,814
This is a new model that just came out.

1102
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,442
The serial number starts with 245D.

1103
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:17,488
But… this one doesn't.

1104
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,574
It starts with 215D.

1105
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,118
-It's different?
-I don't know.

1106
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,413
This chronograph is so crude.

1107
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,957
And why does the blue dial look so dull?

1108
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,878
The stainless steel
should've been brush finished.

1109
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,130
Why is it so shiny?

1110
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:39,093
Goodness.
This is just a cheap knock-off.

1111
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,179
Where did you get this?

1112
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,597
What would you even know?

1113
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,981
[Seung-hyo] Do you know where that is?

1114
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,860
It would be nice
if we could zoom there a little.

1115
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,112
Yes. Just like that. [snaps fingers]

1116
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,449
Hey, what is this? Who are you?

1117
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,451
No, let's keep watching. It gets better.

1118
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,577
Okay.

1119
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,123
[Seung-hyo] I see. That's how?

1120
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,253
Wow.

1121
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,883
You prepared the foreign object
and put it in the soup.

1122
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,427
You called the owner over

1123
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,471
and deliberately spilled
the soup on your watch.

1124
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,722
Wow.

1125
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,141
You must've practiced a lot.

1126
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,185
And?

1127
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,563
That video isn't proof
that we put something in the food.

1128
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,481
[boy 1] Yeah.

1129
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,484
We recorded everything.
The hair and the damaged watch!

1130
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,443
Proof?

1131
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,237
I'm glad you said that.

1132
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,990
You see the time stamp on the footage?
It says 11:59 a.m.

1133
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,200
Take a look.

1134
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:49,789
This means when you went into the shop,
it was at least after 12 p.m.

1135
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:56,421
So why is your broken watch
stopped at 11:45?

1136
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,338
Why is that?

1137
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,049
-[whispering] You should've checked it.
-Shut up.

1138
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,677
[Dan-ho in normal voice]
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

1139
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,721
What took you so long? I was waiting.

1140
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,431
Who's this guy?

1141
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,807
Are you working with him?

1142
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,435
Let me introduce myself.

1143
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,688
I'm Kang Dan-ho
with The Chungwoo Daily.

1144
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,733
THE CHUNGWOO DAILY
KANG DAN-HO

1145
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,026
I've really wanted to meet you two.

1146
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,738
I received a tip from someone.

1147
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,200
Why is the quality
of this footage so good?

1148
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,078
A lot of thieves have stolen clothes
from the dry cleaner.

1149
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,539
-So he installed the best camera model.
-I see.

1150
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,875
[Seung-hyo]
That's not what's important.

1151
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,461
I used this photo to try
and identify these two.

1152
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,378
Right.

1153
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:41,048
They claimed they had NerTube channel
with 100,000 subscribers.

1154
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,175
But that was a lie.

1155
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,971
Here. They have an empty channel
with 30 subscribers.

1156
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,724
They likely use it as bait for blackmail.

1157
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:53,060
Yeah, I'm sure there are
other victims of the same con.

1158
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,062
[Dan-ho] I think so too.

1159
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,148
They're probably older…

1160
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,650
Unfamiliar with NerTube…

1161
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,194
Small business owners.

1162
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,115
[both exclaiming]

1163
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,243
[boy 1] What are you doing? Hey!

1164
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,161
See? I knew it.

1165
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,079
The burn on your hand was a lie too.

1166
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,709
The owner spilled soup on his hand too,
but he was fine.

1167
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:20,296
[Dan-ho] I looked into it,
and there were similar incidents nearby.

1168
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,340
Despicable crimes that prey

1169
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:25,468
on the weak and powerless
because they can't touch big franchises.

1170
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:30,807
[Seung-hyo] Most recently, I heard a watch
stopped working at a gomtang restaurant.

1171
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,187
[sniffs] I think I can smell
ox bone soup from the strap.

1172
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,314
-[sniffing]
-[Seung-hyo] Ma'am?

1173
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,274
Yes, Seung-hyo?

1174
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:44,612
I'm sorry. I should call you
President Choi now, right?

1175
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,531
Thanks for lending us the projector.

1176
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,535
Their faces
are being recorded on camera, right?

1177
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,579
Of course!

1178
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:55,790
[laughing nervously]

1179
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,584
We're screwed.

1180
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,753
[intense music playing]

1181
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,672
[Seung-hyo] Dan-ho!

1182
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,050
Wait for me!

1183
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,136
-[boy 2] Call me later!
-[boy 1] Okay!

1184
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,354
[Seung-hyo grunts]

1185
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,236
[boy] Let go of me!

1186
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:26,904
Ow.

1187
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,199
[grunting]

1188
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:32,994
[chuckling]

1189
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,955
[boy exclaiming]

1190
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,958
Why is he so fast?

1191
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,006
Hey, you expect to get a story
at this rate?

1192
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,215
[groans softly]

1193
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,133
[thuds]

1194
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:48,718
Goodness.

1195
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,303
[panting]

1196
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,055
Watch out.

1197
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,896
[panting] Are you okay? Hey.

1198
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,483
Hey.

1199
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,742
[horn honking]

1200
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,368
[panting]

1201
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,912
Damn it.

1202
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:16,913
[exclaiming]

1203
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:19,624
[exclaims in frustration]

1204
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:21,876
[boy exclaims]

1205
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,377
[scoffs]

1206
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,588
[Seok-ryu] Hey.

1207
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,507
[both grunting]

1208
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,009
[panting]

1209
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,178
How dare you do that to my dad?

1210
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,221
[shrieks]

1211
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,141
-[groans]
-Who in the world are you?

1212
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,268
Damn it.

1213
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,853
[groaning]

1214
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:41,938
[breathing heavily]

1215
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,358
Hey, is your head okay?

1216
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,610
-Are you hurt?
-[Seok-ryu] I'm okay. I'm not hurt.

1217
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,196
[Seung-hyo] Hey, your nose is bleeding…

1218
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,740
That bastard.

1219
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,076
Hey, this isn't because of him.

1220
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,411
I overdid it the past few days.
I'm just tired.

1221
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,624
Hey, stop the blood with this.

1222
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,584
You'll get blood on it.
Isn't it expensive?

1223
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,835
That's not important.

1224
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,004
Why would you come here? It's dangerous.

1225
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,382
[Seok-ryu] What about you?
You just got your cast off

1226
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,968
and you're out here doing flying kicks.

1227
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,260
[Seung-hyo] Seriously?

1228
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,350
Jeez!

1229
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:23,270
-You the jerk who took my dad's money?
-Yeah, that's him.

1230
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,982
Uphold our family's honor
and get revenge.

1231
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,275
No! I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

1232
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,235
Kill him!

You caught them?

They caught the men who blackmailed me.

1243
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:56,887
They were con artists.

1244
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:02,184

Honey…

What was that?

1253
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,283
Just tteokbokki?

1254
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,244

[mellow music playing]

1256
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,375
All I know how to do
is just make tteokbokki.

1257
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,004
If I can't even do that,
then what does that make me?

1258
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:34,842
Well? What can I
contribute to this family?

1259
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,470
There's nothing else in my life.

1260
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,680
Don't you know
how special that tteokbokki is?

1261
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,557
You've spent decades in front of a stove.

1262
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,311
We raised our kids on that precious food.

1263

What do you mean it's just tteokbokki?

1264
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,230
How could you say that?

[Mi-suk] There's nothing in your life?

1267
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,861
Then, what about us?

1268
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,990
Do I, Seok-ryu,
and Dong-jin mean nothing to you?

1269
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:01,786
[voice shaking] No,
you all mean everything to me.

1270
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,622
You're all too good for me.

1271
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:08,542
I'm not even wishing for anything big now.

1272
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:13,964
I just want to take care of our family
and make them happy. [crying]

1273
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,136
But it's so hard.

1274
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,389
Why is it so hard
to live an ordinary life?

1275
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,725
That's the greatest dream of all.

1276
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,728
It's the most meaningful
and valuable dream.

1277

But you know dreams come true, right?

1278
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,528
Mi-suk, I'm sorry.

1279
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,697

Come here. [crying]

01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,411
As long as you get it, it's fine.

1282
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,956
So stop crying now.

1283
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,750
Let's go to the station.

1284
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:50,793
You're going too?

1285
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,462
Of course. Wherever we go,
we'll go together.

1286
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,465
We'll go on picnics
and see flowers on nice days.

1287
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,801
If we're sick,
we'll visit the hospital.

[chuckles softly]

1292
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,687
Because I'm your wife.

And we're a family.

-Honey.
-What?

1298
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,449
You'll end up in jail.

1299
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,243
You won't go with me?

01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,619
Honey, I love you.

01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,798
I'm begging you.

1401
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,176
Just leave me alone.

1402
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,929
Stay out of my life from now on.

1403
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,097
No!

1404
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,975
I'm going to butt in all I want!

1405
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:07,104
Did you ask for my permission
before coming to my house back then?

1406
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:09,314
I'm going to keep
sticking my nose in your life.

1407
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:10,691
[exhales]

1408
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,986
[Seok-ryu] Because we're close.
I'm allowed to do that!

1409
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,113
Stop driving me crazy!

1410
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,367
Back then and now,

1411
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,786
you keep doing this…

1412
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:26,915
so I feel like…

1413
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,086
I'm going to lose my mind because of you!

1414
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,506
[mellow music playing]

1415
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,468
[exhales]

1416
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,714
[Seok-ryu] I know
all of Seung-hyo's firsts.

1417
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,382
[Mi-suk] Here.

1418
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,176
You go to a bathhouse.

1419
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:20,677
-Then, you drink this.
-Yeah!

1420
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,473
Seung-hyo, try it. It's good.

1421
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:32,356
[chuckles softly]

1422
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,941
[Seok-ryu] The first time
he had banana milk.

1423
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,234
[Mi-suk] Good, right?

1424
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,614
[young Seok-ryu] No!
I won't do it! I don't want to!

1425
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,116
[Seok-ryu] The first time
he started swimming.

1426
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,201
[crying]

1427
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:49,289
[Seok-ryu] What the hell?

1428
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,378
-Choisseung?
-Why are you staring at the ground?

1429
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,588
What's with you?
How are you suddenly taller than me?

1430
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,299
What have you been eating
in France during the break?

1431
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,803
The first time he became taller than me.

1432
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,763
How annoying.

1433
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,518
My turn?

1434
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,228
[Mo-eum groans softly]

1435
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,897
You're on a deserted island.

1436
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,649
What three things would you take?

1437
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:18,735
Fire-making tools, a water distiller,
and a Swiss Army knife.

1438
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,903
[Seung-hyo] Jeez.

1439
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:21,363
She answered so seriously.

1440
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:23,031
It's my turn now.

1441
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,617
[sighs]

1442
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,827
Choisseung?

1443
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,287
Do you have a crush on anyone right now?

1444
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,256
[Seok-ryu] He does.

1445
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,466
He does! He likes someone!

1446
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,509
He does.

1447
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:43,802
Who is it?

1448
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,596
Hey! Does she study architecture too?

1449
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,473
I think I know.
Does she go to your school?

1450
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,726
-[Mo-eum laughing]
-Is she in the same class?

1451
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:51,768
I don't know.

1452
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:54,563
[Seok-ryu] What do you mean?
Who else would know if you don't?

1453
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,858
The only thing I didn't know

1454
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,110
was who his first love was.

1455
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:21,506
[sighs deeply]

1456
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:30,766
Hey.

1457
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,644
Stop right there.

1458
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:35,729
Hey!

1459
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:43,236
[Seok-ryu breathing heavily]

1460
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:58,835
What you said earlier…

1461
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,632
what did you mean?

1462
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,359
YOUR FIRST

1463
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:28,532
YOUR FIRST LOVE

1464
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:29,950
[pop song playing]

1465
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,569
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1466
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,613
[Seung-hyo] Why did you even show up here?

1467
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,156
And why now of all times?

1468
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,909
We have to kill that jerk.

1469
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,452
I want to kill him more.

1470
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,746
I'll kill this bastard and go to jail.

1471
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,956
Hey, you bastard!

1472
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,875
[Seok-ryu] You're eating
at a hotel for work.

1473
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,543
You're a great businessman.

1474
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,461
[Seung-hyo] Don't say her name anymore.

1475
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,797
Don't keep showing up either.

1476
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,341
It's already over between you two.

1477
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,720
[Mo-eum] Seung-hyo, you have to
save yourself from unrequited love.

1478
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:33,555
Even I can't rescue you.

1479
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:37,142
[Seung-hyo] I won't delay it any longer.
I'm going to say it this time.

1480
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,690
