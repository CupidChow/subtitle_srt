What do you think? You're cleaning grills.

Make sure to clean them thoroughly.

"Wouldn't I eventually get bored
with my marriage too?"

when she ran away from home before.

00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,823
-The stew is cold.
-It's fine.

181
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,449
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

182
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,706
-[Dad] That's right. Share.
-Thanks.

183
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,040
Thank you for the meal.

184
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,250
We need to talk.

185
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,586
No, we don't.
I came here to see Aunt Mi-suk.

186
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,298
Come have breakfast, Dong-jin!
Don't make me serve it twice.

187
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,882
[Dong-jin] I'm not eating.

188
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,220
Consuming carbs is a crime,
and consuming sodium is a punishment.

189
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,472
I can't get tempted by them.

190
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,849
What a bunch of nonsense.

191
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,768
Look, idiot. Tofu, kimchi,
seasoned vegetables, and meat.

192
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,271
-It can't get any healthier than this.
-[Mi-suk] Here, honey.

193
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,230
[Seung-hyo] Thanks.

194
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,025
You should know these things
if you want to be a trainer.

195
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,443
Don't get on my nerves.

196
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,529
This is why
you keep failing the certification exam.

197
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,741
-Look who's talking, you jobless pest.
-[chopsticks clatter]

198
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,534
-Excuse me?
-[Dad] There they go again.

199
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,662
-Did you just call me a pest?
-[groans]

200
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,374
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,
my pest of a sister.

201
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,252
Did you just grab my hair bun,
you brat? Let go.

202
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,921
Not on my watch.
Get your hand off my head first, you pest.

203
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,007
-Let go or else!
-[lid clatters]

204
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,764
Where are you going, Mom?

205
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,308
That brute tore out my hair.

206
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,810
[Seok-ryu] Where's she going, Dad?

207
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,895
You'll find out soon.

208
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,688
[Seung-hyo] Five,

209
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,065
four,

210
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,399
three,

211
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,901
two,

212
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,818
one.

213
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,780
-[drum kit clanging]
-[Seok-ryu gasps]

214
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,207
Is this coming from our basement?

215
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,458
[Mo-eum] Yes.

216
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,753
A legendary drummer lives in our basement.

217
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,673
She only appears when her anger peaks.

218
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,925
Is that drum kit

219
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,386
the one you got in middle school
when you wanted to be a musician?

220
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,513
[exclaims] Mom is so talented.

221
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,723
She's good at anything
that involves hitting.

222
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,641
[Dad] She is.

223
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,643
-She's really good.
-[Mo-eum] Yes.

224
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,770
She's like Ringo Starr.

225
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,232
[Dad] She's as skilled at hitting
those drums as she is at hitting people.

226
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,290
Come on, tell me already.

227
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,000
What really happened?

228
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,172
Why did you quit your job
and break off your engagement?

229
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,757
You're rubbing it in.

230
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,511
How could you rub salt in my wounds
when your job is to save people?

231
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,305
You need to tell me so I can help you out.

232
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,433
Why did you do it? Whose fault was it?

233
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,560
Who, what, when, where, why, and how?

234
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,479
-Did my mom ask you to ask me?
-[water splashes]

235
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,732
Yes. In the utility room.

236
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,943
I'll let it go since you were honest.

237
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,446
It just doesn't make any sense.

238
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,782
It's not something
a perfectionist like you would do.

239
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,785
A perfectionist?

240
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,912
-Me?
-Yes.

241
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,206
No one else I know lives
as diligently as you.

242
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,209
Competitiveness, grit, drive,

243
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,420
achievement, meticulousness,
and persistence.

244
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,298
As I see it, you have it all.

245
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,801
Do I? You flatter me too much.

246
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,886
[Mo-eum] It wasn't a compliment.

247
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,931
You're obsessed with success,
neurotic about others' opinions,

248
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,058
-and you have too much ambition--
-Hey!

249
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,518
That's very accurate.

250
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,395
So why would someone like you

251
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,441
give up everything and come back here?

252
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,734
Stuff happens, okay?

253
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,194
[Mo-eum] Sure.

254
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,362
To someone else, maybe.

255
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,740
But not to you.

256
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,326
Come on.

257
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,162
Spit out the truth!

258
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,914
-Come on.
-It's five minutes to 9.

259
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,124
-Tell me. What?
-You're late.

260
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,709
-Go on.
-[Mo-eum] Darn it.

261
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,213
-I'm not done with you.
-[Seok-ryu] Bye.

262
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,297
See you.

263
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,509
If you keep lazing around like that,

264
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,177
you'll go to the Hell of Indolence.

265
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,679
I don't care. I'm in heaven right now.

266
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,098
If this is what heaven is like,
I'd rather not go.

267
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,101
-How do you even sleep here?
-Come here for a second, Choisseung.

268
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,395
-Why?
-I have something to say.

269
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,855
Get up first.

270
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,066
Just come here for a second!

271
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,984
-I don't want to.
-Come on!

272
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,654
It's important! Come on, hurry up!

273
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,990
Stop throwing a tantrum, you nutcase.

274
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,116
What is it now?

275
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,493
Come closer.

276
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,328
-Jeez.
-Hey.

277
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,621
Wanna know something cool?

278
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,915
You traitor.

279
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,543
How could you just hand me
over to my mom like that?

280
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,710
I'll end you today.

281
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,295
I did it for you.

282
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,297
[Seok-ryu] You did it for me?

283
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,924
Is that right?

284
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,717
George Orwell once said:

285
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,638
"The quickest way of ending a war
is to lose it."

286
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,307
Bae Seok-ryu once said:

287
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,810
"A traitor must be punished by death."

288
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,687
I can't breathe. Aunt Mi-suk!

289
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,980
[Mi-suk] What's going on?

290
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,190
-[Seok-ryu] Take that, you jerk.
-You little brat! What are you doing?

291
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,317
-It hurts.
-My goodness.

292
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,069
Are you okay, Seung-hyo?

293
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,237
-Auntie.
-You're nuts!

294
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,697
She tried to kill me.

295
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,074
-Dear me.
-[Seung-hyo groans]

296
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,076
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

297
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,496
Judging by the way you coddle him,
you'd think he's your actual son.

298
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,914
If only that were the case!

299
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,041
Yeah? Then why don't you
exchange me for him?

300
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,587
There's an idea. Should I be your son
from now on, Aunt Mi-suk?

301
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,423
I'm all for it. But what about work?

302
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,549
I have to go now.

303
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,426
It hurts.

304
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,553
[Mi-suk] Hey, get up.

305
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,513
You didn't have to kick me.

306
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,891
You should be grateful
I didn't trample you to death!

307
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,642
You're so mean to me, Mom.

308
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,560
Shut it.

309
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,438
Get up and take these rice cakes
to Seung-hyo's office.

310
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,398
Tell him to do it himself!

311
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,357
-Rice cakes?
-[Mi-suk] Yes.

312
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,277
I ordered some rice cakes for you.

313
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,071
You should hand them out
to everyone in the neighborhood.

314
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,283
-You take such good care of me. Thank you.
-[Seok-ryu sighs]

315
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,659
How touching.

316
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,287
You're moving me to tears.

317
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,204
Get up!

318
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,166
He looks so handsome.

319
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,250
Na-yun!

320
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,963
So the client from Buryeong-dong
wants the windows somewhere else?

321
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,884
Yes. Initially, he wanted them
oriented east for the morning sun.

322
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,054
But now he wants to see sunsets instead.

323
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,641
Why does he keep changing his mind?
We already started construction!

324
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,020
Hey, I called you in
to organize the desks,

325
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,439
but here you are,
organizing Seung-hyo's photos instead.

326
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,274
-Myeong-u.
-Hey.

327
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,901
What did the Buryeong-dong client say?

328
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,152
[Myeong-u] He said…

329
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,154
Oh, is she a new client?

330
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,865
-Hello, welcome.
-Hello.

331
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,909
[Myeong-u] What is this?

332
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,872
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,209
You'll have to wait a bit
since Seung-hyo's on the phone.

334
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,003
Don't worry about it.
I just came to deliver the rice cakes.

335
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,465
You even brought us rice cakes.
We should at least serve you some tea.

336
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,885
These are from my mom.
I'm just delivering them.

337
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,681
[gasps] Wait, are you…

338
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,558
the childhood friend
that Seung-hyo told me about?

339
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,060
Yes, I am. Do you know me?

340
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,147
Of course I do!
I'm thrilled to finally meet you.

341
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,441
-That's right. Next Tuesday…
-Yes?

342
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,610
…we're hosting a grand opening.

343
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,112
You should come.

344
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,613
Oh, okay.

345
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,365
Drink up.

346
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,617
So you've known Seung-hyo for a long time?

347
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,328
I guess we have a long history.

348
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,122
Please enlighten me.

349
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,249
I want to know everything chronologically.

350
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,043
-Well, let's see.
-Don't.

351
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,628
It's going to be very long.

352
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,257
You know he was born in France, right?

353
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,341
Yes.

354
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,553
It all started in 1995.

355
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,097
A summer's day

356
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,267
when the playground dirt was
as hot as coal.

357
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,351
[upbeat music playing]

358
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,270
-Bonjour.
-Seung-hyo.

359
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,648
[Seok-ryu] It was a day like any other.
I came home from playing outside

360
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,775
and found a boy standing
in front of my house.

361
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,527
That was Seung-hyo.

362
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,571
-Get along, okay?
-Okay.

363
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,822
[Hye-suk] Say hello, Seung-hyo.

364
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,907
Hi. What's your name?

365
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,077
He was so short
and couldn't speak any Korean either.

366
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,621
He kept hiding behind his mother.

367
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,331
That was when it hit me.

368
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,416
[Hye-suk] Say hello.

369
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,544
I'd have to help this fragile boy out.

370
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,880
-I'll leave him in your care.
-Don't worry about a thing.

371
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,049
Aunt Hye-suk left Seung-hyo in our care

372
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,301
when she began working
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

373
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,635
because my mom

374
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,763
-used to work as a babysitter.
-Welcome.

375
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,056
You're so cute.

376
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,224
-[Hye-suk] She's a cutie.
-You little brat.

377
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,894
That was when I started looking after him.

378
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,896
[Seung-hyo] Does my baby want
to be a king or a prince?

379
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,064
No, wait.

380
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,149
You should be a princess.

381
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,484
All of this is your castle.

382
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,236
I engaged him in creative play.

383
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,196
It's huge, right?

384
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,199
Do you need to pee, baby?

385
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,120
I protected his dignity as a toddler
and took care of his hygiene.

386
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,582
This will make you grow taller.

387
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,251
And this will make your teeth stronger.

388
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,005
I also encouraged healthy eating habits
so he could get proper nutrition.

389
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,465
This one is just good for you.

390
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,467
Eat up, my baby.

391
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,348
Everyone be nice to him.

392
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,518
You don't have a problem with that, right?

393
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,522
I contributed to his social development
within his peer group.

394
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,818
Yes, I believe we have enough.

395
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,444
Let's go, baby.

396
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,822
I even helped him learn about economics.

397
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,244
I basically raised Seung-hyo.

398
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,123
-That's just what you think.
-[Myeong-u] Huh?

399
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,003
Don't come to my workplace
and spread rumors about me.

400
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,214
I should sue you
for spreading false information.

401
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,675
What an ungrateful jerk.

402
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,010
You should repay me instead of suing me.

403
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,095
[Myeong-u] She's right.

404
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,056
Don't trust her.
Every word she says is a lie.

405
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,975
She's a compulsive liar.

406
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,811
No way.
Her story doesn't sound like a lie.

407
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,354
It has a narrative arc.

408
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,481
-[Seung-hyo] Yes, it does.
-Yes.

409
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,774
But it's been manipulated.

410
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,484
-[Seok-ryu snickers]
-This girl…

411
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,655
was the first lunatic I met in my life.

412
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,573
[Myeong-u] Lunatic?

413
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,118
Seung-hyo, she's my old friend, Mi-suk.

414
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,079
And that girl is her daughter, Seok-ryu.

415
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,372
She's the same age as you.

416
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,459
Hi. What's your name?

417
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,087
You're dirty.

418
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,840
[Seung-hyo] I could tell
since our first encounter.

419
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,383
-Hi, Seok-ryu.
-Hello!

420
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,218
She was so aggressive.

421
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,469
You're so cute.

422
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,679
It was overwhelming.

423
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,389
Gross.

424
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,437
[Seok-ryu] Does my baby want
to be a king or a prince?

425
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,480
You both know me.

426
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,940
I need my alone time.

427
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,358
It's sticky.

428
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,861
But this girl…

429
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,071
-All of this is your castle.
-…never left me alone.

430
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,781
It's so big!

431
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,451
She disrupted my peaceful solitude.

432
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,620
Do you need to pee, baby?

433
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,582
[door closes]

434
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,962
Hey!

435
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,506
-She sexually harassed me…
-Mom! He's speaking Korean!

436
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,425
…leaving me no choice but to speak up.

437
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,761
-I hate beans in rice.
-And she says she taught me Korean.

438
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,222
Aha.

439
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,139
Here.

440
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,433
Eat some beans, Seung-hyo.

441
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,062
She gave me things
that she didn't want to eat.

442
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,146
[Seung-hyo] I don't like them.

443
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,233
A baby shouldn't be picky.

444
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,318
Eat up, my baby.

445
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,986
Who's going to be "it"?

446
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,655
My baby.

447
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,740
He'll do it.

448
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,617
-Red light, green light.
-[Seok-ryu] Baby should be "it."

449
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,743
Red light…

450
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,205
[Seung-hyo] She told everyone to be nice,
but made me be "it" all the time.

451
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,380
Let's go, baby.

452
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,508
That's right. She even began
stealing my money later on.

453
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,676
I'll get my revenge.

454
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,639
All my allowance turned
into chocolates and ice creams

455
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,808
and ended up in that mouth right there.

456
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,477
Says the boy who couldn't even
use the toilet on his own.

457
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,189
You're the little pervert
who followed me into the bathroom.

458
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,607
I was trying to help you.

459
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,192
You couldn't unzip your pants

460
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,986
-and kept wetting yourself.
-[Myeong-u] Goodness.

461
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,321
[Seung-hyo] Stop spewing such nonsense.

462
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,448
I told you,
some water splashed onto my pants.

463
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,908
It didn't look like water.

464
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,576
-[gasps]
-[Na-yun] Oh, dear.

465
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,328
[Myeong-u] My goodness.

466
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,582
I've never seen Seung-hyo act
so childish before.

467
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,169
Me neither. But seeing how they even
went to the bathroom together,

468
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,130
I can tell they're really close friends.

469
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,717
You know, I've been reading
various romance stories for ten years

470
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,927
-from fanfics to fantasy novels.
-Yeah?

471
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,346
And there's one trope I get crazy over.

472
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,974
The one and only childhood-friend trope.

473
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,351
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Mmm.

474
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,354
They should start looking for
English kindergartens for their kids.

475
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,773
Do you have any idea
how expensive English kindergartens are?

476
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,193
And yet my wife wants our twins
to enroll in one!

477
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,655
Hey, where are you going? I'm not done!

478
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,741
[cell phone buzzing]

479
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,160
This is Yoon Myeong-u.

480
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,244
Oh, hello.

481
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,997
Excuse me?

482
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,295
-Did you hear?
-What?

483
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,214
Apparently, Root Diner's daughter
cheated on her fiancé,

484
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,424
so the engagement's off.

485
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,303
Of course I heard about that.
Everyone knows already!

486
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,513
-I knew it.
-Oh, my…

487
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,558
Didn't Mi-suk brag about
her daughter's great job in the U.S.?

488
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,895
I heard she got fired too.
That'll teach her not to brag so much.

489
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,646
I know, right?

490
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,731
[gasps]

491
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,234
Did you go grocery shopping, Mi-suk?

492
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,237
-Yes. I wanted to shred something.
-Oh…

493
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,616
What are you going to shred?

494
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,660
I haven't decided yet.
It could be some vegetables

495
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,954
or someone unlucky.

496
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,089
HYEREUNG REALITY

497
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,133
Hey, Mi-suk.

498
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,011
All right, Hye-suk. Okay.

499
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,972
I'll see what I can do. All right.

500
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,267
-Goodbye.
-[cell phone beeps]

501
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,145
Oh, my.

502
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,439
Why is your face so red?

503
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,941
Those darn gossipers.

504
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,859
They're having a field day.

505
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,071
They were absolutely going at it
behind my back!

506
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,614
They're the worst.

507
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,990
If you didn't want that to happen,

508
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,327
you shouldn't have beat up your daughter
in front of everyone…

509
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,412
What I mean is,

510
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:39,334
it would've been better to discipline her
in the privacy of your own home.

511
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,921
What did Hye-suk say?

512
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,091
Actually, she told me
she invited the Hee Sisters

513
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,801
to Seung-hyo's grand opening.

514
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,469
You mean Yeong-hee, Soon-hee,
Jung-hee, and Min-hee?

515
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,972
-Yes, them.
-Why would she invite those snooty girls?

516
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,100
Don't you remember Hye-suk telling them
about Seung-hyo's new office

517
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,935
at the class reunion?

518
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,105
Why did she blab about it
to people she's not even close to?

519
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,024
"Oh, dear, didn't you guys know?

520
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,360
My daughter works for Greip.

521
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,612
She's getting married too,

522
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,739
and the wedding will be held in the U.S.

523
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,868
My son-in-law is an international lawyer."

524
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,829
It's humid as hell today.

525
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,165
Also, I never spoke that smugly.

526
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,500
"International lawyer. Greip.

527
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,502
-International lawyer…"
-This is so annoying.

528
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,629
-That's enough!
-Jeez, calm down.

529
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,636
Sunsets in Korea are the best.

530
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,988
[mellow music playing]

531
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,088
It's done.

532
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,856
Ooh!

533
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,024
[in English] Bravo!

534
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,984
[in Korean] What was
that cool trick just now?

535
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,569
It's nothing.

536
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,655
Just a survival tactic I learned abroad.

537
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,032
Oh, I see.

538
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,158
Where's Seung-hyo?

539
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,660
Why would I call that jerk?

540
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,536
-[line rings]
-Where are you, Seung-hyo?

541
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,829
Don't call him over!

542
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,539
Come to Seok-ryu's if you're done.

543
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,584
What do you mean, "Why?"
Have dinner with us.

544
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,628
Okay, bye.

545
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,255
Is he coming?

546
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,840
No, he told us to stuff our faces
without him.

547
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,801
Seok-ryu.

548
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,803
Do you have anything to drink?

549
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,179
I don't.

550
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,432
[Dad] We have better soju at home.

551
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,685
I need that for the diner.

552
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,147
[groaning]

553
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,108
I don't want to see Seok-ryu's face.

554
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,192
Really?

555
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,195
I like that she's back home.

556
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,406
Seriously?

557
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,951
Do you also like seeing her
sprawled around doing nothing?

558
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,371
My blood is boiling
just thinking about it.

559
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,082
I also feel like
I've been through a hurricane.

560
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,711
My heart is in pieces,
like it's been hit by a natural disaster.

561
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,798
Then why don't you have
a talk with Seok-ryu?

562
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,717
I bet she's hiding something from us.

563
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,927
Get her to tell you the rest.

564
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,264
Just leave her alone. What's with you?

565
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,809
How could you be so indifferent?
It's like she's a stranger to you.

566
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,561
You're acting
as if she's not your daughter.

567
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,522
-That's out of line!
-I'm just saying.

568
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,694
You're so carefree, sitting on your hands,
while I feel like I'm on a razor's edge.

569
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,741
There you go, being silent again.

570
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,202
You're avoiding the problem
just like you always do.

571
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,919
[bell jingling]

572
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,756
I'm too scared to ask.

573
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,925
I'm afraid her engagement broke off

574
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,346
because I wasn't good enough
for her fiancé's family.

575
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,600
[sighs]

576
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,938
Ooh. Ooh! That was so cool.

577
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,815
-I'm so good at it, right?
-You are!

578
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,108
-Aren't I awesome?
-You are.

579
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,568
It was like watching a circus.

580
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,778
That was a hard one.

581
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,862
-It looked hard.
-Right?

582
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,614
Come on, show me again!

583
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:41,076
You guys are too loud.
I could hear you down the street.

584
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,328
-Hi.
-Look at this party crasher.

585
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,496
You ruined the mood.

586
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,623
Shoo! Shoo!

587
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,041
[Mo-eum] Did you buy something to drink?

588
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,751
-Of course not.
-[sighs]

589
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,920
You guys don't know how to have fun.

590
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:57,634
Listen. We really need some beer
on a lovely spring night like this.

591
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,260
-Should I go buy some?
-Never mind.

592
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,804
I'll go.

593
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,472
Thanks.

594
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,850
Or should I get rice wine
to go with the green-onion pancakes?

595
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,976
Beer for me.

596
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,061
Zip it.

597
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,317
Aren't you too busy
to be here or something?

598
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,444
-Are you picking a fight already?
-No, I mean…

599
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,239
It looked kind of serious earlier.

600
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,159
If you're going to keep lying,
just go home.

601
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,953
Why did you come here anyway?

602
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,496
Watch your mouth.

603
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,248
I carried these all the way here.

604
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,125
-You should be grateful.
-Seung-hyo! [stammers]

605
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,919
I mean, Mr. Choi. We need to talk.

606
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,504
[dramatic music playing]

607
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,344
The townhouse project is being delayed?
Why so suddenly?

608
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,722
Due to the increase in raw materials
and construction costs.

609
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,223
It's been suspended indefinitely.

610
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,351
Then they won't pay us for the designs
until construction resumes.

611
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,229
What do we do?
We still have a lot of expenses to cover.

612
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,692
We'll get paid for the youth center
in Seongjin though.

613
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,778
They said they'll pay us next year
because of budget issues.

614
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,530
The economy must be really bad.

615
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,615
We don't have any new clients either.

616
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,828
Something happened, right?

617
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,455
Something's happening right there.

618
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,665
-It's burning.
-Oh, no.

619
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,462
Damn it, it's burnt.

620
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,758
[burner clicks off]

621
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,845
I'm glad if it's nothing to worry about.

622
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,929
Do you want some?

623
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,931
You want me to eat that?

624
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,975
No, I'll make you another one.

625
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,394
Move over. I'll make my own.

626
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,687
No way.

627
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,606
You just hurt my pride.

628
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,317
I'll have you know that I'm known
as House Cook Master Bae.

629
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,197
I even had a vlog channel
specializing in Korean cooking.

630
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,824
-I see.
-[scoffs]

631
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,659
You don't believe me?

632
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,412
I'll show it to you.

633
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,540
How long are you going to hold out?

634
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,629
You managed to hold them off for two days,

635
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,340
but your parents
and Mo-eum will keep asking

636
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,842
why you did what you did.

637
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,803
They won't stop asking.

638
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,931
What about you?

639
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,309
Are you going to ask?

640
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,813
[tender music playing]

641
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,897
I'm not curious.

642
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,484
Hey, I don't care.

643
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,612
I'll never tell you anyway,

644
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,948
even if I tell everyone else in the world.

645
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,741
Fine.

646
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,663
But still,

647
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,416
you shouldn't wait too long
to tell Aunt Mi-suk.

648
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,838
She's your mother.

649
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,770
What is it?

650
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,647
Did Mom ask you to do this?

651
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,567
-What?
-[playful music playing]

652
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,985
-Hey.
-You little rat.

653
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,945
Get ready for round two.

654
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,239
Let go of me, you nutcase.

655
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,699
I told you not to let your guard down.

656
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,950
Come on, it really hurts.

657
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,036
-Wait, I'm…
-You punk.

658
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,205
[Seung-hyo coughs, then groans]

659
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,874
[Seung-hyo] It really hurts.

660
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,464
MY SON-IN-LAW

661
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,018
[line ringing]

662
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,439
He's not picking up.

663
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,691
Oh.

664
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,903
Why are you hiding your phone?

665
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,071
Who were you calling?

666
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,157
[drink pouring]

667
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,075
I guess she can't hear me.

668
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,540
Your ears aren't failing already,
are they?

669
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,588
Are you going
to Choisseung's grand opening tomorrow?

670
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,756
Of course.

671
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,552
Wait, are you going too?

672
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,887
I was invited, so…

673
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,476
No. Why would I go there?

674
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,229
It's only been a few days,
but I'm already sick of him.

675
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,899
Seung-hyo's like that, you know?

676
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,070
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What were you trying to hide?

677
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,197
Give it back now!

678
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,450
Mom.

679
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,410
Did you call him?

680
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,495
Yes.

681
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,623
What? Did I do something wrong?

682
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,876
I told you we were over, Mom!

683
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,672
You're not telling me everything,
so I was going to ask him about it.

684
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,091
What are you doing? Hey, stop!

685
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,635
Don't call him ever again.

686
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,637
You little--

687
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,889
What the…?

688
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,393
Did she erase his number? My goodness.

689
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,564
Do I really have to do this interview?

690
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,067
It's not a promo. I know you hate those.

691
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,568
It's a special on Social Overhead Capital.

692
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,239
A reporter wanted to ask us
about the senior center we built.

693
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:12,991
Is that so?

694
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,243
What are you reading anyway?

695
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,286
I'm researching precedents.

696
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,665
It's not right
that they're not paying us the design fee.

697
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,584
I'll ask around and meet up
with a lawyer I know.

698
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,378
Would that help?

00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,842
The contract doesn't specify
when the design fee has to be paid.

700
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,343
Still, I should try everything.

701
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,304
I'm worried about the loans too.

703
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,643
Were we being rash
by building our own office?

704
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:42,937
Wait.

705
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,189
I think that's the reporter.

706
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,692
He's going in the wrong direction.

-What…?

708
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,866
-It's dangerous here, ma'am.
-I have to pick these up.

709
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,659
It's such a waste.

710
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,994
Let me. Please wait over there.

711
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,040
Wait here, ma'am.

712
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,876
I'm sorry.

713
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,338
Thank you.

714
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,593
Mr. Choi Seung-hyo?

715
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,677
Let's hurry.

716
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,679
Oh, right.

717
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:21,976
Goodness.

718
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,564
The wheels are worn out,
and the axle is crooked.

719
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,567
I managed to balance it for now,
but it won't last long.

720
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,028
Where were you going?

721
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,821
I'm taking them to a junkyard.

722
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,450
How much can you sell them for?

723
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,287
I used to get at least 130 won for 1 kg,

724
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,664
but now I only get less than 100 won.

725
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:50,088
I've stolen too much of your time.

726
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,631
Thank you for your help.

727
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,176
Will you be okay
with pulling this by yourself?

728
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,804
I'll be fine. I do this every day.

729
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,307
Then please be careful, ma'am.

730
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,434
Let's go and do our interview.

731
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,895
Do you want to push or pull?

732
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,439
I'll push.

00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,966
It's utterly unbelievable.

739
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,384
Sorry?

740
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,720
Oh, do you want some water?
I thought you didn't want any.

741
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,305
I'm not talking about that.

742
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,100
She only got 3000 won
for that much cardboard and paper.

743
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,395
I know, right?

744
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,231
It was hard enough for two grown men.

745
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,358
How does she do it every day?

746
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,820

Does Seok-ryu always work by herself?

750
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,349
She thinks she's capable of solving
everything on her own, does she?

751
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,185
What a conceited egotist!

Hello, sir.

769
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,078
The two of you used to work
at Jangyu Architecture, right?

770
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:13,165
It's the best architecture firm in Korea,
not to mention ranking 11th worldwide.

771
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,294
May I ask why you chose
to branch out so early?

00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,796
[jazz music playing over speakers]

773
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,966
I learned the basic principles
of architecture at Jangyu.

774
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,928
They taught me everything
I needed to know to make a living.

775
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,558
But since it's a huge company
that is departmentalized,

776
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,561
some part were out of my hands.

777
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,062
You're right.

778
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,480
The more experience I gained,

779
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,900
the more I wanted to try handling
the projects by myself,

780
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,486
from start to finish.

781
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,157
It seems like you've achieved success
in a highly competitive field,

with your own architectural firm
opening soon.

783
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,703
How does it feel?

784
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,538
To be honest, I'm regretting it.

785
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,040
Sorry?

786
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,335
What are you talking about?

787
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,088
I doubt my decision a dozen times a day

788
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,215
and wonder if I've made the right choice.

789
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,593
But I still think that it's better

790
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,305
to regret doing something
than to regret not doing something.

You should've cleared your schedule.

I had no choice.

I'll send him flowers and give him a call.

from Tunisia--

-Of course.

878
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,038
Come inside, girls.

879
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,165
-My goodness!
-Seung-hyo.

880
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,834
-Thanks for coming.
-It's amazing!

881
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,419
It's beautiful.

882
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,880
The building looks amazing.

883
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,298
Tell me about it.

884
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,426
-It looks incredible.
-Go on, get inside.

885
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,554
I can't believe that picky, little kid
grew up to be such a success.

886
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,765
I'm proud of you.

887
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,683
I'm just the CEO for show.

888
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,477
This guy here is the real boss.

889
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,270
Hello, ma'am.

890
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,272
I knew you were back in Korea,
but I didn't get to meet you.

891
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,358
She's Seung-hyo's mother, not me.

892
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,901
I'm just her friend.

893
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,946
I'm Seo Hye-suk. Nice to meet you.

894
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,116
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
My name is Yoon Myeong-u.

895
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,077
Looking at you now,

896
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,872
I can see where Seung-hyo got
all his good looks from.

897
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,123
-Really?
-Yes!

898
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,291
I hear that a lot.

899
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,877
Aunt Mi-suk, where's Seok-ryu?

900
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,212
-Well, she's…
-[woman] Hye-suk!

901
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,547
-Hye-suk.
-Yeong-hee.

902
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,882
-Hello.
-They're really here.

903
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,092
-What now?
-Good to see you.

904
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,426
-Hi!
-Hello.

905
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,594
This is my son.

906
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,054
-Say hello.
-Hello.

907
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,889
-My goodness.
-They're my friends.

908
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,059
-Thank you for coming.
-Do you remember me?

909
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,227
It's nice to meet you.

910
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,646
Hye-suk, Mi-suk, Jae-suk, and In-suk.

911
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,898
It's been a while since I've seen you all.

912
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,402
Yes, it's been a while
since the Hee and Suk Sisters met up.

913
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,362
What tacky names. Mmm!

914
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,616
I don't know why we gave ourselves
those nicknames back then.

915
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,743
[jazz music playing over speakers]

916
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,412
Thank you for coming, everyone.

917
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,123
Of course we'd come
to celebrate our friend's good news.

918
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,502
Don't you have some good news too, Mi-suk?

919
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,878
Isn't Seok-ryu getting married?

920
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,172
Well, the thing is…

921
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,842
Didn't you hear?
The engagement was called off.

922
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,430
My, my. It was called off?

923
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,682
I didn't know that.

924
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,850
[Mi-suk] Well,

925
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,810
I announced it in the reunion group chat

926
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,312
since some already sent wedding gifts,
but you must have missed it.

927
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,606
-I'm sure they saw it.
-[laughter]

928
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,152
Didn't you say the ceremony would be
in some fancy resort in Hawaii?

929
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,028
What went wrong?

930
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,072
Nothing went wrong.

931
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,117
We're just being extra cautious
since marriage is such a big deal.

932
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,411
It would have been better
if you'd done that

933
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,913
before the engagement in the first place.

934
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,708
Stop being so old-fashioned.

935
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,170
It's not like she's marrying a king
in the Joseon dynasty or something.

936
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,963
The times have changed.

937
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,840
It's not a crime to change your mind.

938
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,634
Of course not.
It's better than getting married

939
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,052
and divorcing afterward.

940
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,137
-Right?
-Of course.

941
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,389
-It's better this way.
-Your mindsets

942
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,224
are even tackier than our nicknames.

943
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,767
I didn't mean it like that.

944
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,270
Let's not spoil the day
and talk about something else.

945
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,648
-All right. I'll raise my glass to that.
-It's good to see you guys.

946
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,066
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

947
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,451
[Seung-hyo's dad] I'm sorry.
I should've been there.

948
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,245
It's okay. I know how busy you are.

949
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,789
All right. I have to go now.

950
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,834
Okay. Don't skip your meals.

951
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,880
[cell phone beeps]

952
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,007
FATHER

953
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,563
[toilet flushes]

954
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,484
[woman 1] Mi-suk was trying so hard
to look like she was fine.

955
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,444
[chuckles] She's always been like that.

956
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,905
So snobby, even though she's got squat.

957
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,532
[woman 1] I feel sorry for her though.

958
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,742
She was just as smart as Hye-suk

959
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,536
but too poor to go to college.

960
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,706
And, look, she's still
playing second fiddle to her.

961
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,793
Does she think her daughter's success
makes up for her own failure?

962
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,336
"Her daughter's success"?

963
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:23,173
It doesn't look so successful now,
with the engagement broken off.

964
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,258
[woman 1] You're right.

965
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:28,178
As they say, "like mother, like daughter."

966
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,388
[woman 2] Exactly.

967
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,847
[dramatic music playing]

968
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,646
[door closes]

969
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,196
I thought you weren't coming.

970
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,825
I decided to just stop by for a bit.

971
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,410
What's the difference?

972
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,247
Look at all these guests.
Good for you, I guess.

973
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,374
Thanks.

974
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,793
I'll just stay here.
Can you call my mom over?

975
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,878
You're still my guest.

976
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,839
You even got me a gift.

977
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,008
[Seok-ryu] You brought it here?

978
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,134
I can't toss it, can I?

979
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,386
You're probably hungry, right?

980
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,305
It's okay.
I'll just say hi to my mom and go.

981
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,602
-What's with you?
-Something's wrong.

982
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,980
You keep glancing
as if you've done something wrong.

983
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,815
-No, I'm not.
-You're still doing it.

984
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,817
Is someone chasing you?

985
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,360
I said I'm fine.

986
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,445
Are you?

987
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,655
Then wait here.

988
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,699
I'll bring your mom and some food.

989
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,992
I'm really okay.

990
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,453
We used an expensive catering company,
so try some.

991
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,124
[door closes]

992
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,962
-Seok-ryu.
-Mom.

993
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,591
-What are you doing here?
-To give you this.

994
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,384
I found it after you left.

995
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,969
Why would you bring it all the way here?

996
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:54,097
I just thought you'd want this.

997
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,683
-You'd look better with--
-You should go now.

998
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,437
Choisseung was going
to bring me something, so--

999
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,148
-Talk to him later!
-What's wrong?

1000
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,901
People will talk if they see you here.

1001
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:07,819
Mom.

1002
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,489
Are you ashamed of me?

1003
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,617
[woman 1] Mi-suk.

1004
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,786
Oh, it's Seok-ryu.

1005
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,204
Hello, Seok-ryu.

1006
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:21,166
They're about to head out,
so I was going to see them off.

1007
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,709
I see.

1008
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,211
Is this Seok-ryu?

1009
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,587
-My, my.
-Hey.

1010
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,422
You must be Mi-suk's daughter.

1011
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,133
It's nice to meet you.

1012
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,177
We're your mother's
high school classmates.

1013
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,222
I'm glad we ran into you.
I wanted to introduce you to her anyway.

1014
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,848
Say hello to my friends.

1015
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,642
Hello, my name is Bae Seok-ryu.

1016
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,769
-Hello.
-She's so pretty.

1017
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,398
I told you she worked for Greip, didn't I?

1018
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,941
But she recently quit.

1019
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,068
But that's such a prestigious company.

1020
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,778
Yes, she's unemployed now.

1021
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,200
Just kidding, of course!

1022
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,161
She's taking a break between jobs.

1023
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,164
She was scouted by an even better company.

1024
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,250
[woman 2] Really? What company?

1025
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,544
I can't keep track of them all.

1026
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,462
I'll tell you once it's decided.

1027
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,880
Is she going back to the U.S.?

1028
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,925
-Of course. That's her home.
-[dramatic music playing]

1029
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,262
I want to spend as much time with her
as I can while she's here

1030
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,847
and make her lots of good food.

1031
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,182
I feel so bad for how skinny she is.

1032
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,601
-I know, right?
-Yes.

1033
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,395
[Mi-suk] When she told them
she was quitting,

1034
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,189
they offered her more money
to make her stay.

1035
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,275
But she chose to go
to a better place anyway.

1036
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,777
[woman 3] Good for her.

1037
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,286
[door closes]

1038
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:50,922
-[door opens]
-[switch clicks]

1039
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,718
You're very good at lying.

1040
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,263
Did you practice that in advance
in case I disgraced you?

1041
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,266
I didn't lie. You'll go back to the U.S.

1042
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,810
-What?
-I'll buy you a ticket,

1043
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,646
so pack up
and go back to the U.S. right now.

1044
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,149
You don't want me here, do you?

1045
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,943
You never wanted me to come back.

1046
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,445
That's why you got rid of my room.

1047
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,238
That's a different issue.

1048
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,365
Why are you whining about
your room like a child?

1049
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,409
This room tells me
everything I need to know.

1050
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,244
You didn't want me to come back at all!

1051
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,163
That's right! So pack your bags.

1052
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,748
-Mom!
-Aren't you going to?

1053
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,334
Then I'll do it for you. Where's your bag?

1054
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,295
What are you doing, Mom?

1055
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,797
-Let go.
-Don't do this.

1056
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,965
I'm not going!

1057
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,051
-You are.
-No, I'm not!

1058
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,303
-I said, I'm not going!
-Let go!

1059
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,563
Are you out of your mind?

1060
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,982
You're darn right I am.

1061
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,277
You're the one
who drove me out of my mind.

1062
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,988
-What did I even do?
-Do you have to ask?

1063
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,700
I really don't know why you're acting
like I committed some big crime!

1064
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,618
Hey.

1065
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,956
How could you do this to me
after everything I did to raise you right?

1066
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,625
The way I saw it,

1067
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,044
no matter how pathetic my life was,

1068
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,589
I could bear anything
as long as you were doing well.

1069
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,801
So, what if my life is like this?

1070
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,553
My daughter is living a great life.

1071
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,389
But how could you betray me like this?

1072
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,766
You stabbed me in the back.

1073
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,687
Is my breaking off the engagement
and quitting my job

1074
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,146
betraying you?

1075
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,316
Yes, that's right.
I don't even want to see your face.

1076
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,944
You're sleeping all day
and fooling around like an idiot.

1077
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,863
Didn't it ever occur to you to wonder…

1078
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,532
how sleep-deprived I must've been?

1079
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,744
Or how little fun I must have had
all these years

1080
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,996
to fool around like that?

1081
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,248
Everyone has it hard. You're not special.

1082
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,041
Even if that's the case…

1083
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,503
can't you just be on my side?

1084
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,089
Mom!

1085
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,010
I came home because I was exhausted.

1086
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,307
You know how hard I've been working.

1087
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,892
So why can't you…

1088
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,186
just tell me I did a good job

1089
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,855
and let me take a break?

1090
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:15,358
Of course I know
how hard you've been working.

1091
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,943
That's why I'm so mad!

1092
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,820
While other people paid to go to the U.S.,

1093
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,240
you got a full scholarship
and earned your living expenses yourself.

1094
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,368
But now you're letting
all that hard work go to waste.

1095
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,954
I can't just let that stand.

1096
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,664
You're my precious daughter.

1097
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,458
You're my pride and joy!

1098
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,709
Why do I…?

1099
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,880
Why do I always have to be
your pride and joy?

1100
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,258
Can't I just be your daughter for once,

1101
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,011
no matter how pathetic
or flawed I might be?

1102
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,850
Why do I have to cover up for your life?

1103
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,730
[dramatic music playing]

1104
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,781
[door opens, then closes]

1105
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,583
[door opens, then closes]

1106
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,886
[swing creaking]

1107
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,646
Jeez.

1108
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,565
You look like a ghost in a horror movie.

1109
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,067
You scared me.

1110
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,904
[clears throat]
How did you know I was here?

1111
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,281
You're too unimaginative
to go anywhere else.

1112
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,328
The playground got so much nicer.

1113
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,539
It might as well be Disneyland.

1114
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,002
What should I play with next?

1115
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,586
Hey, wanna ride the seesaw with me?

1116
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,963
No, but knock yourself out.

1117
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,673
I can't go on the seesaw by myself.

1118
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,758
What about the jungle gym?

1119
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,678
Oh, that's right.
You used to be scared of that.

1120
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,888
-That's not true.
-You're still scared.

1121
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,515
-No, I'm not!
-You are.

1122
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,606
What's so scary about this?

1123
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,817
-Looking for me?
-You startled me.

1124
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,569
When did you climb up?

1125
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,031
Do you think I'm still
the little kid you used to know?

1126
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,284
No, you're a tall man now.

1127
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,995
You got so tall, old man.

1128
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,956
Of course. I'm 34 already.

1129
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,460
I guess we are.

1130
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,509
This jungle gym looked so big
when I was little. [chuckles]

1131
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,642
Remember what you always said
whenever you were at the top?

1132
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,104
You said you wanted to eat the clouds
like cotton candy

1133
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,607
and crunch on the stars
like they were candies.

1134
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,318
I remember.

1135
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,782
I thought I'd get tall enough
to touch the sky when I got older.

1136
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,161
But there's just no way.

1137
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,712
It's raining.

1138
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,302
[mellow music playing]

1139
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,228
[clears throat] You're such a nuisance.

1140
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,235
Did you only buy one umbrella?

1141
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:49,155
Yeah, I really hate buying umbrellas
at convenience stores.

1142
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,200
You just had to get a tiny one.
Let me get under it.

1143
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,660
[Seung-hyo] Get away.

1144
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,453
[Seok-ryu] Just put up with it!

1145
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,163
[Seung-hyo] I told you we should get down!

1146
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,207
[Seok-ryu] No way. I want to keep playing!

1147
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,219
-Hey.
-What are you laughing at?

1148
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,804
I thought of something funny.

1149
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,055
Do you remember

1150
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:18,393
when I left you up here all alone
and ran away

1151
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,186
when we were little?

1152
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,398
You stayed here all night crying

1153
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:27,026
until some juvenile delinquents
who came for a smoke helped you out.

1154
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,653
They were nice guys.

1155
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,821
"Nice guys"?

1156
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,242
They were a group of thugs!

1157
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,327
-No, they weren't.
-Come on.

1158
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,247
They were obviously thugs
out to have a smoke.

1159
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,498
And do you also remember

1160
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,835
that there used to be
a merry-go-round right there?

1161
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,045
And one time…

1162
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,798
I hit my head against it

1163
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,343
and got a huge bump
that made me look like an alien.

1164
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,596
I couldn't even look…

1165
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,099
I couldn't look in the mirror for a while.

1166
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:02,187
The kids said that the merry-go-round
would turn into a time machine

1167
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,439
if you spun it hard enough.

1168
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,441
I really believed that, you know.

1169
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,234
That's why I…

1170
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,155
It's so funny, I'm about to cry.

1171
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,199
[groans]

1172
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,244
Hey, it's still raining.

1173
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,581
Just pick one thing.

1174
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,665
What?

1175
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,336
Don't force yourself to laugh
if you feel like crying.

1176
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,189
[tender music playing]

1177
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,623
[crying continues]

1178
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:20,950
What an idiot.

1179
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,330
What a complete idiot.

1180
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,298
Gross, you're getting snot
all over your sleeve.

1181
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,593
It's not snot, it's rainwater.

1182
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,845
The rain washed it all away.

1183
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:27,517
Your makeup also got washed away.
You look horrible.

1184
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,522
Who cares?
I don't have to look nice for you.

1185
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,738
You heard our fight, right?

1186
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,157
Your voice was too loud for me to miss it.

1187
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,743
You're so annoying.
Just forget everything.

1188
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,495
Already forgotten.

1189
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,791
[tender music playing]

1190
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,879
My mom hates me.

1191
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,509
You hate her too right now.

1192
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,220
Isn't it pathetic

1193
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,140
that I still hate my mom at my age?

1194
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,399
Did you know…

1195
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,194
just like the moon is Earth's satellite,

1196
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,530
hate has its own satellites?

1197
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,785
Your high expectations, your faith

1198
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:32,123
and your fondness for a certain person
are all interconnected.

1199
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,085
But when any of those elements
leave orbit or retrograde,

1200
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,462
it can turn into hate.

1201
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,467
You can't hate someone
unless you love them.

1202
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,308
-Oh!
-What is it?

1203
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,769
-Did you see that?
-See what?

1204
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,187
A shooting star.

1205
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,814
There was a shooting star just now!

1206
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,777
-You were just seeing things.
-I know what I saw!

1207
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,071
Look! There was another one!

1208
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,698
-I saw it.
-Right?

1209
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,700
-That's so cool.
-Make a wish.

1210
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,495
That's so childish.

1211
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:13,664
[Seung-hyo clears throat]

1212
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,838
[tender music playing]

1213
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,473
What did you wish for?

1214
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,518
I wished that my company
wouldn't go under. [clears throat]

1215
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,645
I know you're just showing off.

1216
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,396
Why would your company go…?

1217
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,526
Something happened, didn't it?
