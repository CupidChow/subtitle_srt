00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,523
For our summer vacation this year,

3
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,484
how about we try Alaska?

4
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,611
I've always wanted to go.

5
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,488
Well, I don't know.

6
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,450
Then…

7
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,953
Want to go hiking
at Yosemite National Park?

8
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,164
Not really.

9
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,917
Really? Then…

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,918
New York?

11
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,170
We can see shows and go to art museums.

12
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,756
-Doesn't that sound nice?
-Not really.

13
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,509
Forget it. Don't go.
We won't go anywhere then.

14
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,721
I mean, we're both always so busy.

15
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,850
So I wanted to at least spend
a proper summer vacation with you. Okay?

16
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,854
But I was the only one excited
and had my hopes up for nothing.

17
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,569
-Open it.
-What is it?

18
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,613
You'll know once you open it.

19
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,208
You haven't been to Korea in a while.

20
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,418
Don't you miss your mom?

21
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,382
Are you going to cry?

22
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,425
There are two tickets. I'm going too.

23
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,136
Hyeon-jun.

24
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,264
I think there's still something left
in the envelope.

25
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:44,289
I didn't think I was going to
ask you this in my pajamas.

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,460
Ever impatient and quick-tempered,
Seok-ryu…

27
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,965
Will you…

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,511
Will you marry me?

29
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,682
Yes.

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,728
I wanted to do this
somewhere nice on a special day.

31
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,399
This moment right now's perfect.

32
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,860
How could it get any better than this?

33
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,316
I didn't get enough sleep.

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,903
I had irregular meals.

35
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,324
I was overexposed to stress.

36
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,537
I was trying to figure out
why I got cancer

37
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,790
when I suddenly looked out the window.

38
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,043
The sky was so clear.

39
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,255
I was 30 years old.

40
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:23,263
DARKNESS IN LIFE

41
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,687
Hey, Mo-eum. It's me.

42
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,856
Tell me all the hospitals
in the area with an ER.

43
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,609
CHOISSEUNG

44
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,073
Do you feel dizzy or nauseous?

45
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,741
No, I'm fine.

46
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,538
This was Jeongheon University Hospital?

47
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,123
You didn't know?

48
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,333
Things were so frantic earlier.

49
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,379
Is Professor Choi Gyeong-jong
here right now by any chance?

50
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,964
He's off today.

51
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,590
Do you know the professor?

52
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,675
No.

53
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,011
I saw him on TV.
You know how famous he is.

54
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,222
I'm fine now, so I'll get going.

55
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,641
Wait. You have to hear your test results.

56
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,226
Okay.

57
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,030
Seok-ryu.

58
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,908
Hyeon-jun.

59
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,452
Why are you still here?

60
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,245
How could I have left you here?

61
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,206
Did you get examined?
What did the doctor say?

62
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,793
Did a recurrence…

63
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,301
Seok-ryu!

64
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,428
Choisseung.

65
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,056
Are you okay?
Does your stomach still hurt?

66
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,140
No.

67
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,726
Why did it hurt? What was wrong?

68
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,394
Well, you know…

69
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,522
How did you know I was here?
Did someone tell you?

70
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,524
Look, no one told me.

71
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,068
So what did they say?

72
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,653
They said I was fine.
Why are you shouting?

73
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,821
I can hear you, okay?

74
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,242
Excuse me? I'm standing here too.
You could acknowledge me.

75
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,703
You were here?

76
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,081
I wasn't concerned with you.

77
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,085
Let's go. I'll take you home.

78
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,336
Come with me.

79
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,714
I don't care who I go with.
Let's just go now.

80
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,133
You really know how to interfere.

81
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,344
But don't cross the line.

82
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,346
This is something between me and her.

83
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,306
What?

84
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,059
Hyeon-jun, I'll go home with Choisseung.

85
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,853
-What?
-It's in the same direction.

86
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,480
Thanks for today.

87
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,572
Call me when you get there.

88
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,532
I'll wait.

89
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,699
Don't wait.

90
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,243
I'm putting her to bed early.

91
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,578
To me, Seok-ryu isn't some child.

92
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,913
She's a woman.

93
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,251
Let's go.

94
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,116
It's stomach cancer?

95
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,331
What do I do now?

96
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,713
I'm so scared.

97
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,050
No, there's no need to be scared.

98
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,011
I'll fix it for you.

99
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,263
I'll do what I can to help cure you.

100
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,183
Medical technology
has improved these days.

101
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,018
You'll be fine
with early detection.

102
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,937
I have a friend who works
at that hospital.

103
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,647
I'll call him right now.

104
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,733
I'll see if we can move up your surgery.

105
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,195
Okay. Starting tomorrow,

106
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,946
let's have you take sick leave.

107
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,908
-I'll apply for a leave of absence too.
-You too?

108
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,038
You're on an important case right now.
You can't do that.

109
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,831
Nothing's more important than you.

110
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,917
Don't worry.

111
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,044
I'll stay by your side.

112
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,386
Hey, just wait one second.

113
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,816
You want me to get out?

114
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,527
Yeah.

115
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,243
What's going on?
Why are you doing this?

116
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,452
I'm just being polite.

117
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,665
If a guy does something
like this for you, just accept it.

118
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,959
Don't do it. It's weird.

119
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,670
You'd always treat me like a servant.

120
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,755
Now, this princess treatment
is bewildering me.

121
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,840
It looked like Hyeon-jun
treated you this way.

122
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,598
Never mind. Go in.

123
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,921
Don't you think

124
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,965
you should tell your parents back home?

125
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,971
What's love

126
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,642
Hey, you brat!

127
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,812
Why is it so hard to reach you?
I thought something happened.

128
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,940
Nothing happened. What are you up to?

129
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,275
What perfect timing.

130
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,235
I'm making kimchi for you.

131
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,529
Forget it. Don't send it.

132
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,656
I can just buy it here if I need to.

133
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,034
It's from another country,
so it won't taste the same.

134
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,578
I got cabbages from Gangwon-do.
They're so good.

135
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,538
No, I said don't send it.

136
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,207
I told you not to last time,
but you sent it anyway.

137
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,793
It leaked out of the box.

138
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,587
Do you know how embarrassed I was?

139
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,340
It's because I was greedy.
I tried to fill it to the top.

140
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,799
I'll be more careful this time.

141
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,301
No, I don't want it.

142
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,802
I told you I don't need it.

143
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,971
Why won't you listen to me?

144
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,223
Listen to me when I tell you something!

145
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,685
Then, eat as much as you want
when you come here.

146
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,728
When's your flight?

147
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,647
I can't go.

148
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,568
I won't be able
to call for a while either.

149
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,071
Why? Are you really busy?

150
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,907
Yeah, I started a new project.

151
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,408
It's very important.

152
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,994
Okay, I get it.

153
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,664
You're doing important work.
I shouldn't bother you.

154
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,748
Even if you have no time,

155
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,584
don't skip meals, drink a lot of water,
and get a lot of sleep.

156
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,336
Call me more often too.

157
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,298
Okay. I think…

158
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,468
I think I'm getting a call from work. Bye.

159
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,594
Okay…

160
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,724
That brat.

161
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,072
It's okay, Seok-ryu. It's not a big deal.

162
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,284
I'll get better.
I'll tell them after I get better.

163
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,496
It's not a big deal. It's nothing.

164
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,119
Hyeon-jun, hold me up.

165
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,245
You can lean on me.

166
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,209
To me, Seok-ryu isn't some child.

167
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,544
She's a woman.

168
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,425
Nice batting stance.
Your timing's perfect too.

169
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,968
Hey.

170
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,303
"Hey"?

171
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:46,515
You're having fun hitting balls alone
after giving me a scare like that?

172
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,351
You can join if you want.
You need some cash?

173
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,936
I have money too, you fool.

174
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,271
It's been a while.

175
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,358
Goodness, how about we loosen up a bit?

176
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,571
Wow.

177
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,907
No matter how I think about it,
it's amazing.

178
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,535
You don't look like someone
who'd be good at sports.

179
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,329
If you're here to pick a fight, save it.

180
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,206
I'm not in the mood.

181
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,042
I'm sure you aren't.

182
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,210
What's wrong?

183
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,462
Is it Seok-ryu again?

184
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,181
So she went to the hospital
with that punk instead of you?

185
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,059
Wow.

186
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,103
I guess I did beam you with a fastball.

187
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,773
-Is this fun for you?
-A little.

188
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,775
So?

189
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,443
Did you ask her?

190
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,530
Why did she choose him in that moment?

191
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,032
No.

192
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,992
Jeez, you're so frustrating and dumb.

193
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,037
You still haven't fixed
that chronic habit.

194
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,916
Do I need to step up to the plate?

195
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,417
Forget it.

196
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,335
You're right.

197
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,380
Whether you hit a home run
or strike out, it's up to you.

198
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,884
Then, say something
so I can at least cheer you on.

199
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,636
Tell me your feelings.

200
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,597
How are you feeling right now?

201
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,517
I feel like crap.

202
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,436
I feel jealous too.

203
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,982
I told Seok-ryu

204
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,776
I wouldn't ask
about why her engagement was called off.

205
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,112
And I told him

206
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,575
I wasn't curious
since things were over between them.

207
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,118
I pretended not to care.

208
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,371
But I want to ask so badly.

209
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,416
I'm so curious it's driving me crazy.

210
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,462
There's a gap
between Seok-ryu and me.

211
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,424
And Hyeon-jun

212
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,969
is inside of it
with a part of her I don't know.

213
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,056
It's… How can I explain it?

214
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,560
It makes me angry.

215
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,105
Think about all the time
you've been together for.

216
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,774
If they're American history,

217
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,527
you two are like
the four great ancient civilizations.

218
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,238
You're like Egypt and Mesopotamia.

219
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,575
So don't be scared. Don't shrink back.

220
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,495
I didn't.

221
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,541
No, you've shrunk
and wrinkled up a lot lately.

222
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,459
You've aged too.

223
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,544
How? Really?

224
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,381
What's the big deal about having a crush?

225
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,553
Hey.

226
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,682
Does your heart start to beat too?

227
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,226
How can someone live
if their heart doesn't beat?

228
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,270
That's not what I meant.

229
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,608
So when a person likes another person,

230
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,529
does your heart beat faster?

231
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,323
Of course.

232
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,117
It races when we're together.

233
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,245
It races when she's with someone else.

234
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,999
Like the fast, rumbling beat
of Korean traditional drums?

235
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,377
What? What are you rambling about?

236
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,920
Forget I said anything.

237
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,714
Never mind.

238
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,467
So how's Seok-ryu? Is she okay?

239
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,511
I don't know.

240
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,932
That brat's been picking
at her food a lot lately.

241
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,266
Is she getting old too?

242
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,978
She could eat dirt and be fine back then.

243
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,564
Seriously.

244
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,115
HYEON-JUN

245
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,574
Make sure to take your medicine.

246
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm so sick of this.

247
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,601
It's late. Go to bed.

248
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,984
Good night, Seok-ryu.

249
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,790
After I got sick,
I'd lie in bed every night and think.

250
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,835
I'd think, "Why is it called cancer?"

251
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,173
Names are important for everything.

252
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,300
"Cancer" sounds so dark and scary.

253
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,179
"Flower." "Moon." "Star."

254
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,100
It would've been better if it had
a brighter and more cheerful name.

255
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,453
He has some nerve.

256
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,624
-Dad, I--
-I'm off.

257
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,292
-Okay, have a good day.
-Bye.

258
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,298
I won't stop you
from taking cooking classes.

259
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,843
Nothing bad can come from learning.

260
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,470
It'll be beneficial to you.

261
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,889
-Really?
-Of course.

262
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,518
It's something we do to survive.
It's a great hobby.

263
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,312
Learn and use those skills
when you get married.

264
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,857
Also, I thought about it.

265
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,193
You don't have to go
to the US if you don't want to.

266
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,779
But instead, get a job here.

267
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,532
You could easily join a major company
with your background.

268
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,574
Mom.

269
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,409
You're allowed to wander for a bit.

270
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,497
But you have all that experience.
Think of your future.

271
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,415
I'll decide my future.

272
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,085
And that's cooking.

273
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,336
Don't be ridiculous.

274
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,338
Your father and I won't ever allow it.

275
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,674
What parent would stand by
and let their child stray?

276
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,551
I'm not straying. I'm on the right path.

277
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,804
I didn't even know
what my path was up until now.

278
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,890
I've just been running like crazy,
but I finally found direction.

279
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,227
It's a path full of thorns.
You'll get stuck in the mud!

280
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,521
Stop wasting time
and focus on getting a job.

281
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,441
My advice
isn't worth listening to anymore?

282
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,695
I worked so hard to raise you.
You think you did it on your own?

283
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,912
What took you so long?

284
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,289
I was starving to death.

285
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,542
What? Did we have a prior engagement
that I don't know about?

286
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,086
-Did you fight with your mom again?
-Mind your own business.

287
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,546
Let's get something to eat.

288
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,716
Like what?

289
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,053
Is this really all you could pick to eat?

290
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,515
You looked beat up like this porridge.
That's why I picked it. What's wrong?

291
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,474
You little…

292
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,270
Just eat. Try it first.

293
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,733
I'm mad I have to spend
a precious meal eating soft food.

294
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,948
What is this?

295
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,326
-Why is it good?
-Right?

296
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,912
This place is good.

297
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,955
I won't bring you to just any place.

298
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,499
What are you talking about?
Hurry up and eat.

299
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,959
Okay.

300
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,486
That was so good.

301
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,324
Remember when you were complaining?
I thought you'd eat the bowl too.

302
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,701
Of course. I could eat steel bars too.

303
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,994
This bowl is nothing.

304
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,750
What? Are you feeling sick again?

305
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,879
Since it was a bit bland,
I'm craving tteokbokki now.

306
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,798
Do you even have room
after eating all that?

307
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,383
I can make room.

308
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,302
I'm going to the restroom.

309
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,141
Ma'am, do you have any toilet paper?

310
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,394
No, take some from the roll here.

311
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,944
Yeah, you have to make room for more.

312
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,698
I must be crazy about her.

313
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,961
Did I eat too quickly?

314
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,006
I'm getting dumping syndrome again.

315
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,685
Wow, he has a great body.

316
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,479
Look at his back.

317
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,276
Wow, I heard you make hundreds
of thousands with just one ad.

318
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,695
I wish I could get just one offer.

319
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,492
WE'D LIKE YOU TO HELP PROMOTE
OUR NEW PRODUCT

320
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,414
It's here! A life-changing opportunity!

321
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,880
Just you wait, Seok-ryu.
I'll succeed. I'll show you.

322
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,675
Thank you.

323
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,927
This is my first promotion.
What do I need to do?

324
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,058
How cute.

325
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,070
What's this?

326
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,655
Did we really not take
that many photos together?

327
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,783
That scared me!

328
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,119
What was that?

329
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,913
What's going on?

330
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,165
Goodness.

331
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,255
My goodness. How did this happen?

332
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,266
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

333
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,935
No, I'm okay.

334
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,106
The washing machine suddenly…

335
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,780
It's dangerous,
so go and sit. I'll clean this.

336
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,033
Yeah, okay.

337
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,174
I'm finished cleaning.

338
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,136
I vacuumed too,
but there still could be some shards.

339
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,595
Don't walk around barefoot.

340
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,931
As for the washing machine,

341
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,142
I'll call for a repair tech.

342
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,561
Wait.

343
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,316
You're bleeding!

344
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,829
I said I could do it.

345
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,080
I'll do it.

346
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,041
Still, I'm a professor of ER medicine.

347
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,837
I guess ER professors bleed
after stepping on glass too.

348
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,798
That stings.

349
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,925
And he's a crybaby.

350
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,263
I get hurt like other people too.

351
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,848
Pain receptors don't discriminate.

352
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,642
-Pain receptors?
-Did you know?

353
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,647
Pain receptors don't distinguish
between physical pain and emotional pain.

354
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,776
Whether it's being cut by glass
or emotionally hurt,

355
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,403
they react the same.

356
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,739
Really?

357
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,867
All done.

358
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,120
Well, I'm just saying.

359
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,539
I'll get going.

360
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,374
Hey.

361
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,212
Do you want some ramyeon?

362
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,978
Stop staring at me.

363
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,188
Right!

364
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,525
Does she have eyes
in the back of her head?

365
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,774
It's good. The noodles are al dente.

366
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,276
-It tastes just right.
-Yeah.

367
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,987
Cooking ramyeon is a science.

368
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,155
I just haven't tried,

369
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,908
but as long as I know the recipe,
I can make anything.

370
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,870
This reminds me of the past.

371
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,124
We ate this often in my dorm near school.

372
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,419
Do you remember?

373
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,587
Back then,

374
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,133
you threw up your ramyeon
after studying anatomy with cadavers.

375
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,511
I never did that.

376
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:40,223
You did. You looked so pale.
You were the one who looked like a corpse.

377
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,683
What are you talking about?

378
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,185
I was a promising young talent
from the start.

379
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,189
Yeah, a promising talent indeed.

380
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,276
I'd never seen anyone study
as well as you did.

381
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,697
Why are you out here?

382
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,699
Because we were done eating.

383
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,951
-Here.
-Thank you.

384
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,370
-Thanks for the meal.
-Take this too.

385
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,250
What is this exciting black bag?

386
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,918
Is it tteokbokki?

387
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,088
Take them according to your symptoms.

388
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,257
What a bummer.

389
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,051
I don't need this stuff.

390
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,345
I have to get to work now.
Tomorrow's chicken porridge.

391
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,555
-Who says I'll eat with you?
-Bye.

392
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,684
Hey, I'm on my way now. Okay.

393
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,731
That fool bought so much. It's so heavy.

394
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,447
Don't move!

395
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,825
What? What's the matter?
What's going on?

396
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,246
That milk!
Did you steal that from my fridge?

397
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,207
-You did.
-Yeah.

398
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,250
Right, I guess you could say that. Why?

399
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,419
Just carefully put it down.

400
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,754
-What?
-No, wait.

401
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,422
Just give it to me.

402
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,466
Seriously? It's just milk.
Don't be stingy--

403
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,592
It's not just milk!

404
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,928
My life depends on this milk.

405
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,889
Hey, why do so many things
in your office depend on something?

406
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,810
Last time, you said our company's success
depended on that tree… My gosh!

407
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:07,852
What now?

408
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,937
Our company.

409
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,856
-What?
-Our company is withering.

410
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,705
We're not open yet--

411
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,416
Hello.

412
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,667
It's this.

413
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,710
Can you save my tree?

414
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,130
This tree?

415
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,006
Yes.

416
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,591
Okay.

417
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,809
I thought it was an emergency.

418
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,019
You sounded so desperate to save it.

419
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,982
It suddenly started to wither,
so I thought it was an emergency.

420
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,943
I guess you don't talk to it often.

421
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,154
Talk to it?

422
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,614
We may not hear them,
but plants can speak too.

423
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,616
They say they're tired or hungry.

424
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,871
This one's saying it's too humid.

425
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,914
This will stop it from bearing fruit.

426
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,667
It can bear fruit?

427
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,086
-Can it bloom flowers too?
-Of course.

428
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,007
Our friend has a lot to do this year.

429
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,426
Then…

430
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,387
What should I do to listen to my tree?

431
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,266
So I was grilling
the dried pollock earlier.

432
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,104
I think meat's better than fish.
I was craving pork belly so badly.

433
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,657
Are you done?

434
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,910
You looked so happy earlier.

435
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,454
What?

436
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,957
You were smiling so beautifully.

437
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,420
It was like you returned
to your familiar usual self.

438
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,257
What was my usual self like?

439
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,092
You're brighter
than California sunshine.

440
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,429
Bright, positive, and full of energy.

441
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,352
Open it.

442
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,608
What is this?

443
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,364
Remember the cooking school
I mentioned last time?

444
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,033
I got these from a study abroad agency.

445
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,910
If you're going to start this,

446
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,914
I want you to take
a proper path so you won't fail.

447
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,087
There's one more thing in there.

448
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,309
-Is this…
-Yeah.

449
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,311
It's the engagement ring

450
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,564
that you left behind.

451
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,360
Just like how you've begun to dream again,

452
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,988
let's start over again too.

453
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,408
I want to continue to support you.

454
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,618
I want to be with you.

455
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,522
Nice reflexes.

456
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,566
That's what we former athletes
pride ourselves on.

457
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,777
Is this for me?

458
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,529
SSING-SSING BAR

459
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,452
You should always split
and share this ice cream.

460
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:53,870
I agree.

461
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,748
There are no stars or moon tonight.

462
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,377
Did you ask her?

463
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,464
Why did she choose him in that moment?

464
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,468
-About that night…
-He proposed to me.

465
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,054
What?

466
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,598
Hyeon-jun proposed to me.

467
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,691
Wow, he must be a lunatic.

468
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,028
I wanted to at least be respectful,

469
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,488
he's really ticking me off.

470
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,824
What on earth is he doing? It's too late.

471
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,785
What if it isn't late?

472
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,288
What?

473
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,585
When he proposed for the second time,
I had this thought.

474
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,338
"Maybe it's not too late."

475
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,469
He keeps taking me back to the good times.

476
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,642
It's like a breeze
blowing through my heart.

477
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,020
And the book I once closed
is open again.

478
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,023
I remember all of my forgotten memories.

479
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,486
The osam bulgogi we ate when we first met.

480
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,114
It was so good.

481
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,281
Things like that.

482
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,870
Even though I'm here?

483
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,040
Yeah.

484
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,377
Even though…

485
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,171
I told you how I felt?

486
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,758
Yeah.

487
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,019
Is that why you went
to the hospital with him and not me?

488
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,187
Yeah, it was like instinct.

489
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,314
Usually,

490
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,067
people become the most vulnerable
and honest when they're sick.

491
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,903
I guess I subconsciously
wanted to lean on him.

492
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,990
You can't lean on me?

493
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,118
To me,

494
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,121
you're still…

495
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,875
a five-year-old kid crying
at the top of a jungle gym.

496
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,504
A childhood friend
I can split ice cream with.

497
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,506
The successful son of my mom's friend.

498
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,853
You're so cruel.

499
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,565
How could you…

500
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,027
How can you make it
so I can't say anything?

501
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,655
I'm letting you know. You're mistaken.

502
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,119
You don't like me. You imprinted on me.

503
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,663
Did you know?

504
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,207
A duckling mistakes

505
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,418
the first thing it sees
for its mother and follows them around.

506
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,212
It's like that.

507
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,884
I'm just like a mother duck to you.

508
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,803
Don't jump to conclusions like that.

509
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,055
It doesn't matter how you feel.

510
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,017
It can't be helped if I'm not the one.

511
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,685
But…

512
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,688
don't tell me how I feel.

513
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,818
No matter how much I like you,

514
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,404
you have no right to do that.

515
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,534
-Seung-hyo…
-The milk hasn't expired yet.

516
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,121
And I'm not scared
of the jungle gym anymore.

517
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,267
Did you see the article?

518
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,270
"They allow us to make it home

519
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,815
to our friends and family
with a smile each day."

520
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,694
"To our heroic paramedics
who protect our precious daily lives,

521
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,571
I'd like to express my respect once more."

522
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,990
They even printed our picture.

523
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,742
I'm glad I used that sheet mask.

524
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,120
Send me that link.

525
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,122
I want to show my wife.

526
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,290
Yes, sir.

527
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,295
-Ms. Jung, isn't the article awesome?
-What?

528
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,964
I don't know. I haven't read it yet.

529
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:18,092
What? It's about us though.

530
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,178
He put a lot of effort into it.
You should read it.

531
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,597
I don't care about stuff like that.

532
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,473
Just get back to work.

533
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,144
By the way,
your picture came out really well.

534
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,106
PARAMEDICS ARE SO COOL

535
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,566
THEY'RE AMAZING
I'M GRATEFUL

536
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,321
MUDFLAT MAN

537
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:05,056
I told you to just come in.
Why make it a hassle and call me out?

538
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,477
Everyone's busy working,
so I didn't want to bother them.

539
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,229
Do I not look busy?

540
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,481
That's not what I meant.

541
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,399
Please share this with the others.

542
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,193
We're civil servants.
We can't accept this.

543
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,154
I'm giving you this
as a fellow colleague, not a reporter,

544
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,698
even if it was just for a day.

545
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,161
You're really good
at making it hard to refuse things.

546
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,705
Thank you.

547
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,501
Thank you for helping me
write that article.

548
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,962
I found my motivation again
thanks to you.

549
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,298
Me? What did I do?

550
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,842
Don't give anything up.

551
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,886
My dad passed away when I was young.

552
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,264
So I know what it's like.

553
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,724
If my mom ever sacrificed
anything for me,

554
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,060
I hated that the most.

555
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,521
Someone got out of his car,

556
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,982
and he directed traffic to clear the road.

557
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,150
He was like a superhero.

558
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,237
-You just did.
-What?

559
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,239
I'll get going now.

560
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,241
Bye.

561
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,579
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

562
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,129
-Dan-ho.
-Yes?

563
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,966
From now on,
don't wear that T-shirt anymore.

564
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,343
What? Why not?

565
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,095
If I say not to wear it, just don't.

566
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,807
Is that the only shirt you have?

567
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,891
Is it your favorite?

568
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,520
No, but it's really soft and stretchy.

569
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,024
Yeah, sure. I'll buy you something nicer,
so don't wear it anymore.

570
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,402
Why would you buy me clothes?

571
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,780
You said we were colleagues.

572
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,408
Colleagues can't buy each other shirts?

573
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,118
No, it's not about that.

574
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,119
Bye.

575
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,829
-What?
-Go on.

576
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,625
I need to get an ECG soon.

577
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,169
Something's wrong.

578
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,343
But…

579
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,812
It's all fixed.

580
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,522
Thank you so much.

581
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,941
But what caused it to break?

582
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,318
Well…

583
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,696
I found this inside the washer.

584
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,573
Goodness.

585
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,492
Wait.

586
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,328
Why would this be in…

587
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,206
I think the spoon caused the issue.

588
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,916
It could've been really bad.

589
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,753
Thank you. Have a nice day.

590
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,672
-All right. Have a good day.
-Thank you very much.

591
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,383
-Thank you for your work.
-No problem.

592
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,760
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

593
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,845
Did something break?

594
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,472
No, it was nothing.

595
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,641
Hey, Seung-hyo.

596
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,311
Have you had trouble sleeping lately?

597
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,063
No. Why?

598
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,607
You look pale,
and your light stays on at night.

599
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,027
I've been busy with work.

600
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,363
I see. Poor thing.

601
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,281
Go ahead. Take it.

602
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,284
Hello?

603
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,370
Hey, Myeong-u.

604
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,748
What?

605
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,211
-Myeong-u!
-Hey, Mr. Choi.

606
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,089
They told us to stop construction?
What's going on?

607
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,842
The district office got a complaint
and said to stop now.

608
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,759
Wait.

609
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,054
We got consent from everyone in the area.
Why would this happen?

610
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,597
Someone next door complained.

611
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,724
Right to light
and obstruction of view or whatever.

612
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,893
That's ridiculous.
I checked several times.

613
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,811
I know.

614
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,937
I discussed things already

615
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,022
with the official in charge
to not violate rules.

616
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,942
You did, but they said
the person in charge changed.

617
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,698
That means we have to
start everything over again.

618
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,326
Let's meet with the people
who filed the complaint first.

619
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,620
Persuading them will be priority.

620
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,830
Well, look at this!

621
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,584
Are the people trying to build
this great building finally here?

622
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,502
Speak of the devil. It's him.

623
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,547
Hello, sir.

624
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,467
I'm the CEO of the architectural firm
that designed this building.

625
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:14,221
May I ask about the kind of inconvenience
you had during construction?

626
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,599
There were so many, I can't name them all!

627
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,018
There's no need to discuss it.
Get rid of this now.

628
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,396
Sir, you agreed
to the construction last time.

629
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,482
I allowed you
to build a house on the land,

630
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,108
not to extend it into the sky!

631
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,943
They say you need
more sunlight as you age,

632
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,154
but this house will shorten my lifespan!

633
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,864
I only get a tiny bit of sun.

634
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,782
Half the sky's covered now.

635
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,159
You think that's all?

636
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,536
The ground has sloped.

637
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,455
And the flowers have wilted
from the noise.

638
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,832
Sure, fine. I can understand all that.

639
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,418
But we made the groundwater suddenly flow?

640
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,046
That's too much, isn't it?

641
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,257
Still, to show us,

642
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,551
wasn't it funny when he came
with a bent wire hanger?

643
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,931
Hey, it really was.

644
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,849
-It started to move!
-Yeah!

645
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,354
You two can both leave.

646
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,189
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

647
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,067
I think this was his plan from the start.

648
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,611
He asked a lot of questions
whenever we came on-site.

649
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,530
He looked at things very closely.

650
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,615
What he really wants is a settlement.

651
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,535
He agreed at first,
but now, he's having second thoughts.

652
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,870
Then, what do we do now?

653
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,501
But didn't we already obtain
the project cooperation agreement?

654
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,088
Yeah, we did
to prepare for something like this.

655
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:33,008
Even if there's a worst-case scenario
of a civil lawsuit, it can be dismissed.

656
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,344
Goodness! Why didn't I think of that?

657
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,845
Right? Hey, who obtained it?

658
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,806
-I did.
-Go and get it.

659
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,017
Let's take this chance to show them
the importance of a signed document.

660
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,019
Stop smiling and go get it!

661
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,938
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

662
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,232
That should do it.

663
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,776
THE NOT-SO-SIMPLE CURIOSITY OF KANG DAN-HO
HEROES OF OUR TIME

664
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,168
Just climb inside your monitor,
why don't you?

665
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,046
Why do you keep popping up behind me?

666
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,381
It's going to cause problems.

667
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,676
-I'll report it as workplace harassment.
-I'll report you too.

668
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,887
I'll say a journalist is writing
with personal bias, not objectivity.

669
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,890
When did I ever do that?

670
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,602
You suddenly wanted
to write about your experiences…

671
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,353
because of her?

672
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,480
The paramedic you know?

673
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,649
-Well…
-I knew it.

674
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,360
I could sense the affection in your words.

675
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,653
And I was right.

676
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,947
It was due to your love for the subject.

677
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,407
It's not like that.

678
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,743
If there's any personal bias
in this article,

679
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,661
it's out of respect and reverence.

680
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,164
-Okay? Yeah.
-Yeah? Okay.

681
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,124
Is that so? I see.

682
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,503
Gosh, but she really is pretty.

683
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,173
Good luck!

684
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,011
Complimenting someone's looks
is a form of judgment too.

685
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,973
And don't wish me luck!

686
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,893
Good luck, Dan-ho.

687
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,688
Hey! Don't eavesdrop.

688
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,357
It's because I can hear you.

689
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,610
-Stop.
-What does she look like?

690
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:20,616
"I could sense the true essence of heroism
from the spirit of these paramedics."

691
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,868
"And I thought about it."

692
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,580
"If the Avengers had paramedics,

693
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,128
wouldn't they have defeated
Thanos more easily?"

694
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,463
Wow.

695
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,507
Nice article.

696
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,424
Hey.

697
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,219
It's not just nice.

698
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,848
This is a masterpiece
that will go down in history.

699
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:49,561
You can feel the authenticity of someone
who experienced things firsthand.

700
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,526
Goodness, he worked so hard that day too.

701
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,113
With these little hands that have
probably only touched keyboards,

702
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,783
he wanted to do all he could to help out.

703
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,037
Goodness.
I think that's how he normally is.

704
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,832
He leads by example, and he's just.

705
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,921
Well, that's probably
why he was Mudflat Man.

706
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,258
You've fallen head over heels
for Mudflat Man.

707
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,761
You're knee-high in mud.
You won't be able to free yourself easily.

708
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,720
What?

709
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,890
Did you know you've been talking
about him for 30 minutes now?

710
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,475
Hey, that's because…

711
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,270
Hey, you!

712
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,232
That was because it's a good article.

713
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,026
It was praise for his professionalism.

714
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,363
Gosh, that's so funny.

715
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:50,664
People usually look cool
when they excel at their job.

716
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,669
Even Seung-hyo looks all right
when he's designing.

717
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,713
What are you talking about?

718
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,799
Seung-hyo? Don't be ridiculous.

719
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,884
Hey.

720
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,219
Has he said anything recently?

721
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,347
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a while.

722
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,141
Really?

723
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,355
Yes, that's right.

724
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,441
Yes.

725
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,153
Yes, I understand.

726
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,198
-What did the official say?
-It's as expected.

727
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,327
They have no choice but to stop things
when they get a complaint.

728
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,579
They said we should reach a settlement.

729
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,165
Should I meet with him again?

730
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,834
If it's not possible, we'll just settle it
at a reasonable price.

731
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:36,752
No.

732
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:41,006
More people will try to exploit us
if we give in to unreasonable demands.

733
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,717
We can't create a bad precedent.

734
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,304
Come in.

735
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,225
Hey.

736
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,560
Did you bring the agreement?

737
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,103
Well…

738
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,399
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

739
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,735
The agreement…

740
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,403
I lost it.

741
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,614
-What?
-What?

742
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,158
Where did it go?

743
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,494
I have no idea.

744
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,746
I got it that day
and put it somewhere safe.

745
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,249
I checked the bookshelf,
my desk, and the trunk of my car.

746
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,668
I spent hours looking for it,
but I can't find it.

747
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,213
Are you kidding me?
Is this the best you can do?

748
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,549
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry's not enough!

749
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,676
You think an apology will fix this?

750
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,969
-Myeong-u, wait.
-I mean…

751
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,303
Don't get worked up. Calm down.

752
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,138
-Hyeong-chan.
-Yes?

753
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,100
Do you understand
the gravity of your mistake?

754
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,686
I've caused significant damage
to the company.

755
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,020
You're not wrong.

756
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,982
Delaying construction
will push the schedule back

757
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,692
and increase costs.

758
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,486
But do you know
what's more important than that?

759
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,072
I don't know, sir.

760
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,865
Go and think about it.

761
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,869
And come back when you find that answer.

762
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,954
Yes, sir.

763
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,832
I'm sorry.

764
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,506
But what's the answer?
I don't know what it is either.

765
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,259
This is driving me crazy.

766
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,557
Did you drop money on the ground?

767
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,270
-Why do you have your head down?
-Hi, Aunt Mi-suk.

768
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,147
Have you had dinner?

769
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,531
Why would you feed me?
Aren't you mad at me for deceiving you?

770
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,075
I don't understand myself either.

771
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,621
But what can I do?
I can tell something's up with you.

772
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,499
How did you know?

773
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,877
I raised you myself.

774
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,420
You're like my child.

775
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,299
Aunt Mi-suk,

776
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,469
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about Seok-ryu.

777
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,721
That wasn't your fault.

778
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,557
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

779
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,101
But the thing is…

780
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,022
Seok-ryu's really serious about it.

781
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,941
You cut me some slack.
Can't you do the same for her?

782
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,570
Eat up.

783
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,782
You're abandoning me
because you don't want to hear it?

784
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,826
There's a neighborhood meeting.
I'll get fined if I miss it.

785
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,744
A fine?

786
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,913
How much is it?

787
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,709
How much will it cost
to sit at a table with you?

788
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,796
You little… How dare you flaunt your money
by impersonating Han Suk-kyu?

789
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,466
-Eat as much as you want.
-Okay.

790
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,704
-I didn't know you were home.
-I didn't know you were here either.

791
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,706
Where's my mom?

792
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,583
-She went to a neighborhood meeting.
-I see.

793
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,420
Eat up.

794
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,380
Why are you avoiding me?

795
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:09,881
I'm not.

796
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,218
I came to the kitchen
to drink something, but I forgot.

797
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,222
DAEHAN MILK

798
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:20,726
Hey, Choisseung.

799
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,437
What?

800
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,440
Throw out that milk.

801
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,568
What?

802
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,778
I'm answering you in advance.

803
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,114
To me,

804
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,283
you can't be more than a friend.

805
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,455
Is that all you have to say?

806
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,206
Yeah, I'm sorry.

807
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,419
There's no room for reconsideration?

808
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,465
No.

809
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,636
It'll be awkward for a few days,
but it'll get better soon.

810
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:02,225
Our friendship wouldn't break that easily
over something like this.

811
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:10,942
Eat and put the dishes
in the sink before you leave.

812
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,197
Friendship?

813
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,658
There's no such thing as that anymore.

814
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,113
Hyeon-jun,

815
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,658
do you remember when I first got sick?

816
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,578
They removed two-thirds of my stomach

817
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,082
and I lost ten kilograms
after starting chemotherapy.

818
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,378
Chemotherapy…

819
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,964
I hear it's hard.

820
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,674
It's okay.

821
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,218
I dealt with surgery pretty easily.

822
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,430
I'm Bae Seok-ryu. I'll overcome this.

823
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,516
Don't worry.

824
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,275
Once I recover,

825
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,111
should we go to Salar de Uyuni?

826
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,696
-Uyuni?
-Yeah.

827
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,865
No, wait.

828
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,954
Should we go to Peru
to visit Machu Picchu?

829
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,747
Machu Picchu.

830
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,499
-Peru.
-Where do you want to go?

831
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,085
-We can visit both.
-Both?

832
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,504
Sounds good.

833
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,515
-I applied to return to work.
-Already?

834
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,561
I'm all better now,
so I should go back to work.

835
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,730
Aren't you overdoing it?

836
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,941
I can't stay like this forever.

837
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,110
So what if I was sick?

838
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,862
I can overcome anything with my will.

839
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,452
Seok-ryu, you're incredible.

840
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,746
It's what I thought as I watched you.

841
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:31,207
You're so much stronger
and more resilient than I thought.

842
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,585
I really respect you.

843
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:35,962
And I love you.

844
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,451
Seok-ryu.

845
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:10,956
Raymond invited us
to his vacation home in Palm Springs.

846
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,082
He said to come with you.

847
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,501
I just want to stay at home.

848
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,044
Don't be like that. Let's go.

849
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,254
We haven't gone anywhere for a while.

850
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,132
It's always been
the hospital, home, and work.

851
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,009
No, I don't want to.

852
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:28,556
The doctor said plenty of sunlight
would help with the depression.

853
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,228
Have you been actively attending
your therapy sessions?

854
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,105
Are you taking your meds?

855
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:36,856
Yeah.

856
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,150
Okay.

857
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,445
That way, you'll get better.

858
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,241
I'll tell Raymond we can't go.

859
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,119
I'll say we're busy with the wedding.

860
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,186
What do you think you're doing?

861
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,272
Seok-ryu?

862
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,247
How could you not trust me?

863
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,750
Why didn't you pick up your phone then?

864
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,545
You're the one who ghosted me first.

865
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,963
Still…

866
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,509
Did you really have to show up like that?

867
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,718
What?

868
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,054
Are you embarrassed of me?

869
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,724
-Are you ashamed?
-No, it's not that.

870
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,561
Everyone I work with was there.

871
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,525
As my fiancée,
you should've considered my perspective.

872
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,276
Am I really your fiancée though?

873
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,947
-What?
-Your fiancée is sick.

874
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,243
She's going through a hard time.
But you wanted to go to a party?

875
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,622
You don't care about how I feel.

876
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,000
Did you want to have fun
with others at that party?

877
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,168
Yeah.

878
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,254
I did.

879
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,173
Please let me breathe!

880
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,596
When you became sick,

881
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,473
I gave up everything.

882
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,143
I took time off work
and cared for you.

883
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,645
I put golf, traveling,
my friends, and my life on hold.

884
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,189
I thought things would be fine
if I endured a little more.

885
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,860
Because you're strong.
Because you're going to beat this!

886
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:27,777
We…

887
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,614
Because we'll overcome it together.

888
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,074
But suddenly, what?

889
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,286
This goddamn depression…

890
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,002
"This goddamn depression"?

891
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,297
Is that what you were thinking?

892
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,468
You said you understood me.

893
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,677
How can I?

894
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,847
How can I understand you?

895
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,767
You finished your treatment,
but now, you're not yourself.

896
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,979
You're not the Seok-ryu I know.
How can I accept that?

897
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,023
Please snap out of it.

898
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,067
How long are you going to struggle
with that depression for?

899
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,029
If you drag me down
with you to the bottom,

900
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,489
are you going to stop then?

901
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,126
Seok-ryu.

902
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,337
Look, what I just said…

903
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,005
I'm already at rock bottom.

904
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,966
Hyeon-jun.

905
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,471
I just witnessed our rock bottom.

906
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,529
The ring's too big.

907
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:57,158
-It fit perfectly back then.
-It's because you've lost weight.

908
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,246
It's okay. Let's go back
to the US and get it resized.

909
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,250
We can fix the ring,

910
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,754
but we can't fix our relationship.

911
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,382
Seok-ryu.

912
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,301
I'm really sorry

913
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,720
for what happened back then.

914
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,139
It was so hard for me.

915
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,644
-I was tired and out of my mind.
-You don't have to apologize to me.

916
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,731
You really tried your best.

917
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,817
I know that better than anyone.

918
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,780
It's just too much for me.

919
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,576
You know,

920
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:43,288
I'm going to worry
about a recurrence next year

921
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,498
and the year after that.

922
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,253
Even if I remain
in complete remission for five years,

923
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,215
I won't be completely free.

924
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,512
I'll always be near death's door.

925
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,350
I'm going to feel
a little anxious and sad.

926
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,523
That's how my life's going to be.

927
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,985
That's why…

928
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,446
I don't need love anymore.

929
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,699
The stomach I have left

930
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,036
can barely handle digesting my dream.

931
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,776
The endoscopy showed some inflammation
where the surgery was.

932
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,986
It's highly likely
to be just inflammation,

933
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,572
but we've conducted a biopsy to be sure.

934
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,282
The results will be out in a few days.

935
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,827
Good job.

936
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,289
It was the right thing to do.

937
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,792
This is right.

938
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,784
What is it?

939
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,661
Is my food not good?

940
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,079
It's not that.

941
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,457
I have no appetite.

942
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,836
Still, you should eat.

943
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:58,798
Balanced growth and development
are a child's responsibility.

944
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:02,051
Children have too many responsibilities.

945
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,388
I have to eat this carrot.

946
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,765
I have to brush my teeth.

947
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,183
And I have to sleep early.

948
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:14,772
YEON-DU'S BABYSITTER

949
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,607
Hello?

950
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,778
Are you okay?

951
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,282
Of course, your health is most important.

952
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,952
You should go to the hospital.
Let me know when you know the results.

953
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,788
Okay.

954
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,708
What was that about?

955
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,503
Your babysitter fell in the bathroom
and hurt her back.

956
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,007
I guess you're hanging out with me today.

957
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,843
You said you had
an important interview today.

958
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,763
There's nothing
more important to me than you.

959
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,058
No, you should go.

960
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,144
I have a friend I can play with.

961
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,396
Who?

962
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,483
You want to hang out with me?

963
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,484
Yes.

964
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,780
I'd love that! I'm so happy! But…

965
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,072
What do I do?

966
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,283
I have something important to do today.

967
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,035
I was on my way out.

968
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,870
I'm sorry.

969
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,955
It was an unreasonable request, wasn't it?

970
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,503
Yeon-du, let's hang out
with Ms. Jung next time.

971
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,338
Wait!

972
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,466
I have a good idea.

973
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,432
Mo-eum called to let me know.

974
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,309
Don't worry. Leave her with us.

975
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,602
-Hi, Yeon-du.
-Thank you.

976
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,103
Sit between them.

977
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,647
You're so cute.

978
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,191
I couldn't come empty-handed,
so please take this.

979
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,819
Goodness. You didn't have to buy this.

980
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,070
But what is it?

981
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:47,657
It's a health supplement.
It helps with managing your blood sugar.

982
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,325
Goodness.

983
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:53,120
My blood sugar does spike after meals.
This is the perfect gift.

984
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,331
Thank you so much.

985
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,834
Can we all try it?

986
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,377
Yes, of course.

987
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,294
Thank you.

988
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,672
I know it's shameless of me,

989
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,383
but please take good care of Yeon-du.

990
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,759
Don't worry.

991
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,261
Yeon-du, I'll be back later.

992
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,720
Have a good day.

993
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,890
Drive carefully and don't trip again.

994
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,684
-Okay.
-Goodness.

995
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,394
Have a great day.

996
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,563
-The scissors.
-Okay.

997
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,189
Can I drink two?

998
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,482
Just drink one.

999
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,860
Jae-suk, who was that?

1000
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,152
-Our neighbor.
-Your client?

1001
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,279
He was.

1002
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,492
-Do you want one?
-No, I'm fine.

1003
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,451
Why not?

1004
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,161
What's your name?

1005
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,330
Kang Yeon-du.

1006
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,875
I was born in the spring.

1007
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,669
My name means "to live with vitality,"

1008
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:45,131
like the vibrant color of the first leaves
that emerge after winter.

1009
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,550
What a great name.

1010
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,468
You're smart and clever, aren't you?

1011
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,804
Her dad's a journalist,
so she's smart too.

1012
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,432
So that's why you said he was off-limits.

1013
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:55,766
Yeah.

1014
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,767
Yeon-du.

1015
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,020
Let's have a blast today.

1016
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:01,606
We can't be the only ones
enjoying something.

1017
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:02,565
Right?

1018
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:03,900
Here.

1019
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,484
Auntie got this as a free gift.

1020
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,612
You seem more like
of a granny than an auntie.

1021
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:08,863
-What?
-Goodness.

1022
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:09,780
Granny?

1023
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,536
Hey, people still think
I'm in my early forties.

1024
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,371
I don't know.

1025
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:20,333
They say the eyes of children
are the most honest.

1026
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,501
I bet she could become
a reporter like her dad.

1027
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,920
She's brutally honest.

1028
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:26,964
I guess I should increase
my collagen intake.

1029
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,717
Anyway, you can have this.

1030
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,136
Thank you.

1031
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,890
-Can kids eat red ginseng?
-Of course.

1032
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,059
It has good ingredients.

1033
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:41,520
What was it called again?

1034
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,730
Saffron.

1035
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,900
You consume so much medicine,
and you still don't know that?

1036
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,943
What?

1037
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:50,655
It's not saffron.
Are you sure it's not saponin?

1038
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,156
Yeah, it is.

1039
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,116
I thought it was saponin too.

1040
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,785
-Saponin…
-I…

1041
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,578
That's what I said too.

1042
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,372
Yeah, right.

1043
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,374
You said it was saffron.

1044
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,793
No, my pronunciation was bad.

1045
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,546
-Hey.
-Are you joking?

1046
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,840
I can see how you could've misheard me.

1047
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:10,925
No way.

1048
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:16,013
The great Seo Hye-suk
falls from her throne.

1049
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,808
It's saffron.
That sounds like the name of a detergent.

1050
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,102
I know it's saponin too.

1051
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,520
Saponin!

1052
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,605
-Saponin!
-Right?

1053
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,778
Saffron is a spice. It's very expensive.

1054
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,905
-How funny!
-I know, right?

1055
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,629
What should I write to reel people in?

1056
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:56,804
"Do you want the muscles
of a bodybuilder?"

1057
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:03,936
"I selected this product
after careful consideration."

1058
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:09,275
"Only this promotion will be held
at the lowest price."

1059
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,155
Where's the nutritional information?

1060
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:15,072
What the hell?

1061
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:16,907
Where's this from?

1062
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,453
Sir, didn't you say
you couldn't make it today?

1063
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:24,498
Are you trying to sell
this unverified product to people?

1064
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,541
What?

1065
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:30,046
I got an offer to promote it,

1066
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,547
but I haven't posted it yet.

1067
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,174
I just took a few pictures.

1068
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,761
-Get out.
-Okay.

1069
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,389
No.

1070
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,350
I want you out of my gym.

1071
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,520
People like you
have no right to be trainers.

1072
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:47,980
Excuse me?

1073
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:52,109
You're all show and no substance.
You only care about appearances.

1074
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,696
You've never seen anything through.

1075
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,239
You only hope for good luck.

1076
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,703
Your life is full of nothing but hot air.

1077
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,292
Isn't that harsh?

1078
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,627
What? Am I wrong?

1079
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,587
You should be helping with sincerity

1080
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,881
and taking responsibility
for someone's health.

1081
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:17,593
But you slack off on your main job
and only care about making easy money.

1082
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,887
-Mr. Go.
-What?

1083
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,764
It's because of punks like you

1084
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,518
that others take our work lightly.

1085
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,978
Jeez, this sucks.

1086
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,314
Fine, I'll quit.

1087
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:32,817
The nerve of lecturing me
with a tiny gym…

1088
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,401
You little brat!

1089
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,862
Hey, Dong-jin!

1090
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,281
Come in.

1091
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:50,960
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

1092
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,924
Is this your answer?

1093
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:57,967
No.

1094
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,511
I haven't found the answer yet.

1095
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,473
This is the only way
I can take responsibility.

1096
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,106
-What?
-Mr. Yoon.

1097
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:18,404
Gosh, this is hot.

1098
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,990
-Hey!
-Jeez.

1099
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:26,162
-Can't you act normally?
-I wanted to try something new and cool.

1100
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,913
It wasn't cool at all.

1101
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,915
What if you'd set the sprinklers off?

1102
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,796
-We took care of Buryeong-dong.
-What?

1103
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,466
-How?
-We settled with the old man.

1104
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,510
We're going to replace his water pipes.

1105
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:45,181
Your uptight boss surprisingly
wanted to do it.

1106
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,308
No, that's ridiculous.

1107
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,684
That wasn't our fault.

1108
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:49,977
You're right.

1109
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,897
I'm not one to compromise
with reality like this.

1110
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,274
But this is my answer.

1111
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:59,820
And you're a valuable member
of Atelier In.

1112
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,991
For us, you're more important
than the company's profits and losses.

1113
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:06,243
Mr. Choi.

1114
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,037
So…

1115
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,581
make sure you learn
and grow from this mistake.

1116
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:14,168
As you make mistakes,
face obstacles, and get scolded here,

1117
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,254
keep looking for your answer.

1118
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,673
Yes, sir. I'll work hard.

1119
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,552
-Go sit down.
-Yes, sir.

1120
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,763
You're the best.

1121
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,057
You're so cool today too.

1122
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,141
I swear!

1123
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,268
He does all the cool things by himself.

1124
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,188
Hey, you think Seung-hyo
was born a genius?

1125
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,397
Not at all.

1126
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,358
He used to make so many mistakes.

1127
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:40,110
He's talking from his own experiences
right now.

1128
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,488
Why would you make that up?

1129
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,031
Doesn't it seem convincing?

1130
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,532
Jeez.

1131
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:49,286
Did the client give you a hard time?

1132
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,121
Don't get me started.

1133
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:55,417
If I think about how he grilled me
day and night for three days.

1134
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,294
-Jeez!
-It wasn't Seung-hyo?

1135
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,754
-What?
-Me?

1136
01:10:58,837 --> 01:10:59,755
Yes.

1137
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,216
I was going to tell you.

1138
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,426
You have bags under your eyes.

1139
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:08,722
Your cheeks are flushed
and you look feverish.

1140
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,808
Hey, get off.

1141
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,768
What's going on?

1142
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,187
Are you sick?

1143
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,897
I'm sick?

1144
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,859
I'm completely fine. What are you saying?

1145
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:22,528
I'm not sick.

1146
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:23,862
You're being so strange.

1147
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:24,947
-Mr. Choi!
-Hey!

1148
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,907
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1149
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,785
What? Yeah.

1150
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:47,970
Mom!

1151
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,889
Mom, don't go!

1152
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,916
Hey, why are you crying?

1153
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,585
Are you still a baby?

1154
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,462
I'm not a baby.

1155
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:24,882
Your mom's going to work.
You're a baby if you cry like that.

1156
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:26,800
I'm not crying.

1157
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,387
These are the ddakjis I won yesterday.

1158
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,473
I'll give all of them to you.

1159
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:35,934
When we play
Red Light, Green Light tomorrow,

1160
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,353
I'll tag you.

1161
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,938
I don't do this for just anyone.

1162
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,107
-Got it?
-It's not good to be tagged.

1163
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:48,030
Then, I'll buy you
a Pikachu-shaped pork cutlet.

1164
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,074
Do you have money?

1165
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,786
Let's just eat tteokbokki.

1166
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,079
We can go to my dad.

1167
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:56,580
Let's go.

1168
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:14,932
Mom.

1169
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,172
Seok-ryu.

1170
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,468
You're really here.

1171
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:55,973
I'm so glad.

1172
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,210
Welcome back.

1173
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,712
Hello.

1174
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:27,629
Hi.

1175
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,132
I'm sure today was sudden. I'm very sorry.

1176
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,758
Was it hard looking after Yeon-du?

1177
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,887
Not at all.

1178
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,097
After dealing with grown,
disgusting kids for so long,

1179
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:42,102
looking after a baby was so pleasant.

1180
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:44,897
-Leave her with us from time to time.
-I appreciate the thought.

1181
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,440
Of course.

1182
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:48,942
Where is Yeon-du now?

1183
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,654
Ms. Jung?

1184
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,615
Be quiet.

1185
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,742
She's sleeping.

1186
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,620
Okay. I have to wake her
and take her home though.

1187
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:01,413
Wake her later.

1188
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,625
-Let me watch her for a little more.
-Yeah, okay.

1189
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:19,181
No matter how much I see her,
I just want to see her some more.

1190
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:23,268
How is she so pretty?

1191
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,272
Her eyes are pretty.

1192
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:28,857
Her nose is pretty.

1193
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,818
Every part of her is pretty.

1194
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,908
Right? I know she's my daughter,
but she amazes me every time I see her.

1195
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:42,371
I wish Yeon-du was my daughter too.

1196
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:43,914
Yeah…

1197
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,294
-What?
-That's not what I meant.

1198
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,588
I just meant she's so pretty.

1199
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,924
Right. I got it.
I didn't get the wrong idea.

1200
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:54,925
Okay.

1201
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,993
How cute. You haven't changed at all.

1202
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:22,953
Excuse me?

1203
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:24,079
What?

1204
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,539
What did I just say?

1205
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,624
You said I was cute.

1206
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:31,128
Well, all animals and people
are cute as babies.

1207
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,589
I see.

1208
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,132
That must be Mr. Choi next to you.

1209
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:37,050
This must be your neighborhood friend.

1210
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,719
The three of you must be very close.

1211
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:39,845
Yes.

1212
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,388
Those two were friends first.

1213
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:44,683
I started hanging out with them
after I moved here.

1214
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,602
You visit each other's houses often too?

1215
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:47,853
Yes, of course.

1216
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,565
That reminds me.

1217
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:55,652
Aside from Seung-hyo,
you're the first man to be in my room.

1218
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,906
Man?

1219
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:00,991
Goodness.

1220
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:04,369
Why did I say that?

1221
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,414
Well… Come to think of it,
this isn't the first time.

1222
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:12,127
A technician came in here to fix
the air conditioner when it broke.

1223
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,046
He was a man.

1224
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,716
All of my nephews are boys too.
I must've overlooked them.

1225
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:18,967
-I see.
-Yeah.

1226
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,766
Mo-eum, come and eat!

1227
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:29,269
Dan-ho, please stay for dinner!

1228
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,396
-Would you like to eat dinner?
-Dinner?

1229
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,482
My mom's a great cook.

1230
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,567
Dinner sounds good.

1231
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,320
-Should I wake Yeon-du first?
-Sure.

1232
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:39,321
Wake her up.

1233
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,074
Yeon-du, wake up.

1234
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,576
Open your eyes.

1235
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,120
Please.

1236
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:25,325
You asked me how I'm always there to see
your life's embarrassing moments.

1237
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,666
How are you always there when I'm sick?

1238
01:18:58,358 --> 01:18:59,401
Are you up?

1239
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,447
Are you okay?

1240
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,240
Why are you here?

1241
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:10,412
-Why would you barge into my room?
-I mean…

1242
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:14,374
Mr. Yoon said you were really out of it.

1243
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:18,670
He called to say
you nearly passed out before going home.

1244
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,339
I came and rang the doorbell.

1245
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,799
No one came to the door.

1246
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:27,721
You could've called me if you were sick.

1247
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:29,848
Why would you suffer on your own?

1248
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,475
I'm not going to call you anymore.

1249
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,435
Even if something happens,

1250
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,145
whatever the reason,

1251
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:37,564
it won't happen again.

1252
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,526
So just go.

1253
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:42,694
Do whatever you want.

1254
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,406
Even if you cut ties with me, eat first.

1255
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,076
Do you have any food in the fridge?
I'll go and check.

1256
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:11,932
What do the people in this house eat?

1257
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:20,649
Seriously?

1258
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,285
What's this?

1259
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,053
DIAGNOSIS

1260
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,433
JUNE 24, 2021
PARTIAL GASTRECTOMY FOR STOMACH CANCER

1261
01:20:57,477 --> 01:20:59,813
ADMITTED WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN
OUTPATIENT SURGERY

1262
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:02,983
BAE SEOK-RYU

1263
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:05,193
Hey, your fridge was totally empty.

1264
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,654
I'll run to my house and get some…

1265
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:13,994
What is this?

1266
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,540
Hey. This is a mistake, right?

1267
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,875
Why is your name on here?

1268
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,835
I should've gone home first.

1269
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,336
It was a hassle, so I just came up.

1270
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,797
What on earth is this?

1271
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,174
Don't you know? It's a diagnosis.

1272
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:30,969
I needed it for something.

1273
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:35,974
I should've taken it that day.
I had to make a second trip there.

1274
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:39,769
Was this it?

1275
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,063
Is this why you came back?

1276
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:47,444
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

1277
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,658
Hey, I don't care.

1278
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:57,162
I'll never tell you anyway
even if I tell everyone else in the world.

1279
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:00,540
Are you sick?

1280
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,667
I was sick.

1281
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,921
-And now?
-I'm okay.

1282
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:09,424
You…

1283
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,261
How could you not tell me about this?

1284
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,139
Because of this.

1285
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:19,976
-I was afraid you'd act like this.
-Hey…

1286
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:23,021
This is how little I meant to you?

1287
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,983
Even as a friend,
I meant this little to you?

1288
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:29,736
You're sick.
I didn't mean to make it worse.

1289
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:30,654
You should rest.

1290
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:33,615
I'll ask Mo-eum to buy you some porridge.

1291
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:35,283
Get some rest!

1292
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,000
I have to go home.

1293
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:45,669
We need to talk.

1294
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:46,920
Let's talk later.

1295
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:48,630
How can I wait until later?

1296
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:52,592
You…

1297
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,053
How could you do this to me?

1298
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:57,639
Seok-ryu.

1299
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,309
How much longer
were you going to put this off for?

1300
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:07,190
How long were you going to hide this for?

1301
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:08,441
Seung-hyo.

1302
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,820
This doesn't make sense!

1303
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:16,950
How could you go through something
like that without telling anyone?

1304
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:24,457
Stomach cancer surgery is serious.
How could you not tell anyone?

1305
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,668
Who has cancer?

1306
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:39,264
I heard it from outside.
Stomach cancer?

1307
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:42,017
Who has cancer?

1308
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:49,691
Who has cancer?

1309
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,120
Is it you?

1310
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,337
Is it really you?

1311
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:38,490
To be honest, the first person
I wanted to call was Seung-hyo.

1312
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,243
Just like when I'd fall
and scrape my knee,

1313
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,413
I wanted my mom to hold me as I cried.

1314
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:51,127
If I had, would it have made the cancer
seem like it was no big deal?

1315
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,797
Could I have brushed it off
and gotten back up?

1316
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:57,550
I mean it when I say

1317
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,261
that I really wanted to live.

1318
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:05,016
DARKNESS IN LIFE

1319
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,895
LIGHT OF LIFE

1320
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:45,932
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1321
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:49,936
Back then, I should've run to Seok-ryu.

1322
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:53,356
She sent all those signals in the dark,

1323
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:54,983
and I missed them all.

1324
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:56,109
Mom!

1325
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:57,360
If their child is sick,

1326
01:25:57,443 --> 01:26:00,029
a parent would go
to the moon or Mars for them.

1327
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,614
You said it was okay to cry.

1328
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,324
I'll keep it secret too.

1329
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:08,413
You hurt the people who love you.

1330
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,708
You don't know anything!

1331
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,918
You don't know how I feel!

1332
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:18,089
When things are really tough,
you lean on the people closest to you.

1333
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:25,263
