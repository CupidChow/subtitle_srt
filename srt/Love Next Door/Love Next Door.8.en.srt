Hear me out first. [panting]

I won't delay it any longer.

7
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,239
I said I'd wait until later,

8
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,535
but that was an excuse I made
to pretend to be considerate.

9
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,538
I lied to myself.

10
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,085
It was out of fear. I was scared.

I'm going to say it this time.

You're the one who made it
so I couldn't be careful.

I didn't know you had water boiling.
I was burning inside.

My body usually gives off a lot of heat.

-Should we go to the hospital?
-No way. It's fine.

Your hands are already a mess.
What if they're scarred too?

You've cried a bunch of times

You get hit and shoved all the time.

Are you a bumper car or something?

This is a kitchen. It's full of sharp
and blunt objects, okay?

60
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,166
That's why I'm worried you might get hurt.

Of course, I did.

Welcome home.

185
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,929
Were you on night duty?
It was Mom's birthday yesterday.

186
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,138
[liquid pouring]

187
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,057
Was it?

188
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,394
I was so busy. I must have forgotten.

189
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,021
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

190
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,440
Birthdays come every year.
They're not important.

191
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,695
-It's late, but let's have a meal--
-I should go in and rest.

192
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,698
I'm a bit tired.

193
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,287
[door opens]

194
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,539
-[sighs softly]
-[door closes]

195
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,463
[sighs]

196
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,802
Jeez, look at these bags under my eyes.

197
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,054
The Grim Reaper would look better than me.

198
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,275
[mellow music playing]

199
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,069
Hey, stop the blood with this.

200
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,863
You'll get blood on it.
Isn't it expensive?

201
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,698
That's not important.

202
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,617
Why would you come here? It's dangerous.

203
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,162
Who wipes a nosebleed
with something like that?

204
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,789
I should give this back.

205
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,301
Gosh, the windows weren't even open.

206
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,220
Where does all this dust come from?

207
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,394
-Mom.
-What?

208
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,188
I was wondering

209
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,941
if you've ever thought about investing?

210
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,151
Investing?

211
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,069
Yeah.

212
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,239
I'm sure you've heard,
but it's the era of marketing these days.

213
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,451
It's become crucial for fitness trainers
to promote themselves.

214
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,371
Have you heard of Instargram?

215
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,540
Yeah. You take pictures
with your phone and post them, right?

216
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,583
I saw it on TV.

217
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,211
-I knew it. You're so trendy.
-[scoffs]

218
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,798
You can become an influencer
if you get famous on Instargram.

219
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,510
Then, you'll be able to take in
all the money in this country-- [grunts]

220
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,554
How dare you go
and spew your nonsense again?

221
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,224
Hey.

222
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,520
Excuse me, my dear older sister.
How about you butt out?

223
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,106
I'm only 13 months older than you.

224
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,484
Where the hell do you get off
acting as if you're some cool kid?

225
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,236
Did you forget what your face value is?

226
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,029
You know,

227
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,409
I was going to live the rest of my life
in a beautiful, nonviolent way…

228
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,326
[Mi-suk] Jeez!

229
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,912
Are you two fighting
in front of your mother this morning?

230
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,791
Mom, let's continue
our deep conversation later.

231
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,126
Mom, don't listen to this punk.

232
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,420
You say that nonsense again,

233
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,797
and I'll end your life. Got it?

234
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,090
-Yeah, right.
-[Mi-suk] Enough.

235
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,551
Hey.

236
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,387
Why aren't you in a T-shirt today?

237
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,222
I put them in the laundry.

238
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,766
No way. I folded several of them
and put them in your room.

239
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,767
No, they're gone.

240
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,477
[Mi-suk sniffing]

241
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,688
You wore perfume too?

242
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,565
Me?

243
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,151
Yeah, you.

244
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,485
[quirky music playing]

245
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,406
Very fragrant. [chuckles softly]

246
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,505
Did… Did you sleep well?

247
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,423
Of course!

248
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,011
I was stretched out comfortably
and slept without any thought. You?

249
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,556
When I lay down and closed my eyes
for a second, it was morning.

250
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,808
I snored so much my nose is sore.

251
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,352
I was grinding my teeth so much
I thought I dislocated my jaw.

252
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,270
[groans softly]

253
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,607
-You grind your teeth in your sleep?
-What?

254
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,109
I almost forgot.

255
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,156
Thanks for letting me use this.
I appreciate it.

256
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,449
Look. I got all the blood out.

257
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,161
I wish it hadn't come out.

258
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,288
Why? To ask for something better?

259
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,373
No, so I could be buried in it later.

260
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,167
It would've looked pretty nice.

261
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,712
Are you insane? Do you think
you're in some melodrama or something?

262
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,799
And why would you be buried?
We have to make it to 100.

263
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,301
Make it to 100? Together?

264
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,137
No, I misspoke.

265
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,641
You know that saying
about living for a long time…

266
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,059
-What?
-Good health and longevity.

267
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,436
Eternal life and 100 years of marital…

268
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,648
I mean, there's a saying
that's about 100 years.

269
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,025
What was it? A hundred years…

270
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,318
What's wrong with me?

271
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,030
So about my answer…

272
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,950
Can I really tell you later?

273
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,703
Yeah, think about it
thoroughly and carefully.

274
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,621
Really?

275
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,835
Does that mean your answer
has no expiration date?

276
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,962
Still,

277
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,965
life is finite,
so no expiration date is a bit unfair.

278
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,299
I guess so.

279
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,885
Then…

280
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,347
[amusing music playing]

281
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,852
We should decide on an item.
How about canned goods?

282
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,646
Aren't there too many kinds?

283
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,316
Peaches, pineapples,

284
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,610
corn, ham.

285
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,904
-Tuna.
-Let's go with whelks.

286
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,741
The expiration date is…

287
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,412
Three years? Hey, that's too long.

288
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,955
Then, what about Pacific saury?

289
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,085
No stainless steel cans.

290
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,759
How about instant rice?

291
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,138
This has six months left.

292
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,016
This one is eight months.

293
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,019
-This one's for a year.
-How about this stuff?

294
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,693
Your period of careful deliberation
lasts as long as refrigerated foods?

295
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,948
You said I could answer later.
You told me to think it through carefully.

296
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,118
The depth of thought is more important
than how long it takes.

297
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,207
Since they're fermented,

298
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,210
don't yogurt drinks have
the longest shelf life?

299
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,295
Let's go with milk.

300
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,380
Why did you even bother to ask then?

301
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,508
But it'll be based on the back row.

302
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,886
Deal.

303
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,310
[heart thumping]

304
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,566
[thumping stops]

305
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,154
Hey, there's plain milk
and strawberry milk.

306
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,783
There's also chocolate, banana,
and coffee. Which one do we pick?

307
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,664
Did she leave? When did she go?

308
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,461
Then, I'm going to pick the one
with the shortest shelf life.

309
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,341
[store clerk] Excuse me.

310
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,885
I've been watching you.

311
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,721
-What are you doing?
-What?

312
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,518
I barely make minimum wage,
and I had neatly arranged all of those.

313
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,437
What am I supposed to do
if you mess them up like that?

314
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,067
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,029
You scared me.

316
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,572
[Na-yun] What's this?

317
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,242
-Snacks. Share them with everyone.
-[both exclaiming]

318
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,911
Oh, darn you. You're so heartless.

319
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,247
Hey, don't you know
I'm lactose intolerant?

320
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,665
There are canned goods too.

321
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,833
[both exclaim]

322
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,875
Hey, wait.

323
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,420
I get why you'd buy
pineapples and peaches,

324
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,256
but why did you buy
Pacific saury and whelks?

325
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,967
I'll take this one. I'm on a diet.

326
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,803
Sorry, but this one's mine.

327
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,430
-But you like banana milk.
-Really?

328
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,514
[Na-yun] Yeah.

329
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:51,685
I normally do,
but this one has the shortest shelf life.

330
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,357
Goodness. Why did he smile like that?

331
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,734
I have butterflies.

332
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,945
Whelks for breakfast? Gosh.

333
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,823
How about a can of beer?

334
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:07,951
Soju?

335
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,037
Soju and beer?

336
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,246
[groans softly]

337
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,833
-You want to write about your experiences?
-Yes, one special per week.

338
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,168
[chuckles softly]

339
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,836
It's a trend these days.

340
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,048
Pick a topic each week, cover it,
and write an article on it.

341
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,509
Can you do it?
Didn't you want to transfer departments?

342
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,055
In movies,
superheroes always have two jobs.

343
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,598
They have two personas too.

344
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,269
I'm just an ordinary person,
but I wanted to give it a try.

345
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,688
Can I ask you why
you suddenly changed your mind?

346
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:41,068
I received the undeserving title
of Mudflat Man. [chuckles softly]

347
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,820
-What?
-You won't kill the idea, will you?

348
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,823
[chuckles softly]
What's with that confidence?

349
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,992
Okay.

350
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,620
Where will you go first?

351
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,663
HYEREUNG 911 SAFETY CENTER

352
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,664
[Mo-eum] Excuse me?

353
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,000
An emergency responder for a day?

354
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,127
Yes, I'm here for the experience,
not an interview.

355
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:03,632
I'm here to participate, not observe.
I'll work your hours and respond to calls.

356
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,426
-But…
-Don't worry.

357
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,720
I won't cause any inconvenience.

358
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,972
Yes, but you can't just
will that to happen.

359
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,393
From what I can see, I don't think
you'll be able to ride the ambulance.

360
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,980
And I don't think you'll be able
to carry anything heavy either.

361
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,149
[quirky music playing]

362
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,609
Goodness.

363
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,361
What are you doing?

364
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,655
I want to clear up
any misunderstandings about me.

365
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,281
I'm confident in my stamina.

366
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,408
Not just anyone can survive
the social affairs team.

367
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,662
[heart thumping]

368
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,580
-[grunts]
-Please help me out!

369
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,457
I want to be in the field,
not behind a desk,

370
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,543
and put my body to use
to write a good article.

371
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,170
All right. I get it.

372
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,422
Goodness. Please get up.
What are you doing?

373
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,509
I said it's not up to me. Please stop.

374
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,885
Who do I need permission from?

375
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,887
What?

376
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,724
Mr. Kang, I look forward to your article.

377
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,686
[chuckling] Thank you, sir. I look forward
to working with you.

378
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,314
[chuckles] Also, feel free to let me know
if you need anything.

379
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,900
-Yes, sir.
-There she is. That's Jung Mo-eum.

380
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,362
-She'll be responsible for helping you.
-[chuckles softly]

381
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,447
I'll be on my way now.

382
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:14,119
Wow, I didn't think he'd be good
with people enough to be a reporter.

383
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,454
But he's totally sociable.

384
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,082
-What was that?
-[Mo-eum] Yeah.

385
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,000
What?

386
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,170
-[door lock chimes]
-[Geun-sik groans]

387
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,924
Why is this here?

388
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,262
Did I leave this here?

389
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,348
[humming]

390
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,271
What on earth?

391
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,859
I wiped everything down before I left.

392
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,776
Why is this dirty?

393
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,487
What?

394
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,282
Gosh.

395
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,451
Did I not wipe it down?

396
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,622
What?

397
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,167
-What is this?
-[delivery man] Your delivery's here, sir!

398
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,710
Hey.

399
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,795
You're already working hard this early.

400
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,380
Well, that's how work is.

401
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,674
Today, it's two radishes,
two cabbages, two carrots,

402
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,176
and a bag of onions, right?

403
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,135
Okay.

404
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,722
[man on TV] Excuse me?

405
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,141
Have we met somewhere…

406
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,810
Watching this show has been
my source of pleasure these days.

407
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,187
-It's so good.
-Yeah.

408
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,732
What was that actress's name?
She's become the nation's sweetheart.

409
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,442
Hey, do you watch this show too?

410
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,653
No, it's such a waste of time to watch TV.

411
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,862
I'd rather read.

412
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,822
Of course, you would. [scoffs]

413
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,115
So, what's it about?

414
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,078
It's a romance story. It's about a man
and woman falling in love.

415
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,121
See? It's so predictable.

416
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,458
Most things are predictable.
And it's what everyone likes.

417
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,834
-Yeah, right.
-[phone vibrating]

418
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,752
Jeez.

419
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,838
Yeah, I like that actor too.

420
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,007
-Yeah, me too.
-Me too.

421
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,218
So, how did the two meet?

422
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,636
They met abroad.

423
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,096
HYEON-JUN: COULD WE MEET?

424
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,848
It was so romantic too. [chuckles]

425
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,892
[pleasant music playing]

426
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,190
[in English] We went over all the items
with the engineer,

427
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,692
including their feasibility.

428
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:13,571
Yes, so we now need to schedule
a time for the briefing before we go live.

429
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,533
Yeah. Hello?

430
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,661
Hello?

431
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,416
[in Korean] My battery's dead.

432
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,087
[sighs] I didn't bring my charger.

433
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,219
-Use mine.
-What?

434
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,724
It seems urgent. You can use my charger.

435
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,644
Okay. Thank you so much.

436
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,234
But it might be too loud
if I take the call here.

437
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,403
It's fine.

438
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,615
Thank you.

439
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,420
[lounge music playing in background]

440
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,936
[Mi-suk sighs]

441
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,398
Thank you for meeting with me.

442
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,900
I didn't come for you.

443
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,278
I wanted to hear what you had to say.

444
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,407
Let's order your coffee first.
We can order some cake too.

445
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,452
You used to love cheesecake.

446
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,787
Why did you do it?

447
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,122
Seeing you two together
made me happy and content.

448
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,333
Why did you do it?

449
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,751
I'm sorry.

450
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,880
I don't have any excuses I can give.

451
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,548
You didn't cheat on each other.

452
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,342
But you both won't tell me why.

453
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,718
[scoffs]

454
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,553
You're all so tight-lipped.

455
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,015
You've already broken up,

456
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,684
so I can't weld
or patch things together again.

457
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,022
But I can't let it go,
because it's all so strange.

458
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,860
If you called off the wedding,
you must've seen each other's worst.

459
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,698
-How come you don't hate each other?
-I've never hated her.

460
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,911
I still love Seok-ryu.

461
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,252
[exhales]

462
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:33,837
[exclaims]

463
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,881
What's this?

464
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,592
What?

465
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,054
Why the hell is she with him?

466
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,185
[phone vibrating]

467
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,775
[Seung-hyo] I took this from the back row.

468
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,736
EXPIRATION DATE JUNE 29

469
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,904
Only 11 days?

470
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,239
[amusing music playing]

471
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,450
My goodness. Excuse me.

472
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,493
-I'm so sorry.
-[all chuckling]

473
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,122
That's okay.
Seok-ryu's roar woke everyone up.

474
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,333
Okay, shall we start class?

475
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,752
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right.

476
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,175
I'll have to store this well.

477
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,975
Stay fresh in here.
I'll see you in 11 days.

478
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,395
[music ends]

479
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,233
You scared me.

480
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,069
Why are you sitting there like that?

481
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,656
Did you close up and come home?

482
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,450
No customers again?

483
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,410
Why did you meet Hyeon-jun?

484
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,163
What?

485
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,001
Did you think I wouldn't know
if you kept it from me?

486
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,214
I'm Seok-ryu's dad.

487
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,675
How much more of a fool
will you make of me?

488
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,636
Don't say it like that.

489
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,097
I met him
because he suddenly contacted me.

490
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,599
I was going to tell you.

491
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,601
[inhales]

492
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,728
What did that punk say?

493
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,564
-He said he still loves Seok-ryu.
-[scoffs]

494
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,817
He wants to go back to the US with her.

495
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,236
How dare that bastard say that?

496
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,905
So, what about you?

497
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,659
You just sat there
and listened to him as he said that?

498
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,037
I told you.
I'm all for Seok-ryu going back.

499
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,206
Jeez, there you go again
with that US nonsense!

500
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,459
Are you obsessed with the US or something?

501
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,337
-Are you trying to sell your daughter off?
-What?

502
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,005
You know how you are.

503
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,634
As long as the conditions are met
and it makes people jealous,

504
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,011
you don't care,
no matter how Seok-ryu feels!

505
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,389
That's right. I am self-serving.

506
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,934
She'd send me bags
from US outlet stores every season.

507
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,229
She even sent shoes,
but I'm heartbroken now that's all gone.

508
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,940
So what? I was hoping to brag
that my son-in-law was a lawyer.

509
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,067
But I'm sad it's over now. Are you happy?

510
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,569
[sighs softly]

511
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,657
Look, I just…

512
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,703
I don't want her
to be a failure and live like me.

513
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,665
I don't want her
to live a poor, shabby life!

514
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,806
[exhales]

515
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,309
-You don't know anything. [sniffles]
-[door opens]

516
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,768
-[door closes]
-Damn it.

517
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,023
[sighs]

518
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,445
[sighs]

519
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,199
Oh, hi.

520
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,415
-Hey, Gyeong-jong…
-Geun-sik…

521
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,752
Do you want to get a drink?

522
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,670
That's what I wanted to ask.

523
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,838
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

524
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,927
[Geun-sik] Gyeong-jong.

525
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,973
What's it like to live as someone

526
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,018
who's successful like you?

527
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,187
Is it nice like this crunchy fried squid?

528
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,024
For me,

529
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,196
my life's like this soggy piece. So soggy.

530
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,657
It's soaked in my feelings of inferiority.

531
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,035

Do you like osam-bulgogi?

709
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,543
What?

710
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,670
-You don't?
-I do.

711
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,089
Let's go then.

712
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,401
It's jasmine tea.

713
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,488
-Why are you giving me this?
-It's good for digestive health.

714
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,741
It looked like
you were drinking too much coffee.

715
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,077
I'll be outside.

716
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,251
[door opens, closes]

717
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,765
I'm going to start over again.

718
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,226
If I do that,

719
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,187
you might smile at me as you did before.

720
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,359
Well, that's it for today.

721
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,361
Bye.

722
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,332
Maybe we shouldn't have done so well.

723
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,418
I can't believe Fresco likes it already.

724
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,836
Isn't that good?

725
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,546
No.

726
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,591
Then, our collaboration
will end too quickly.

727
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,176
You should've drawn them
with your foot so they'd reject us.

728
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,221
I wanted to be pressed by deadlines
so we could pull all-nighters.

729
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,348
I'm way too competent for that.

730
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,266
[scoffs]

731
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,602
You know how to joke now?

732
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,564
I'm mad for some reason. I think
you've become comfortable around me.

733
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,775
I walked into the fire on my own.

734
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,487
Like you said, you won't know
what happens until it goes in the kiln.

735
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,699
Wait, did you…

736
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,287
I told Seok-ryu how I felt about her.

737
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,751
[exhales]

738
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,757
What did she say?

739
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,968
She hasn't answered me yet.

740
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,056
I see you're stuck in that kiln
with nowhere to go.

741
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,140
[exhales]

742
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,142
You could say that.

743
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,603
I hope it cracks.

744
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,522
I hope it swells up inside and bursts.

745
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,526
I'm already burning and suffering.
I don't need your help as it is.

746
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,739
So this is how it turns out.

747
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,202
Is this why people say men
and women can't be friends?

748
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,331
The reason why I can't stay
as Seok-ryu's friend

749
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,916
isn't because she's a woman.

750
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,338
It's because she's Seok-ryu.

751
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,257
[mellow music playing]

752
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,926
It makes me angry, but I agree.

753
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,805
I don't think you deceived me
while having feelings for her either.

754
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,810
You were a great person when we dated.

755
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,191
I was very emotional back then.

756
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,570
I'd be crouched in a dark corner alone,

757
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,156
and you'd always bring me
back into the light.

758
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,410
That's probably why…

759
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,621
I couldn't forget you.

760
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,752
Does this mean I've been dumped?

761
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,507
No, you could be dumped too.

762
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,010
-What?
-The man from the restaurant that day.

763
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,012
He seemed formidable.

764
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,224
They seemed pretty close.

765
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,226
Not to mention,

766
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,813
he's a sexy and mature man who's at ease.

767
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,940
Just out of curiosity,

768
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,484
has the social perception
of what's sexy changed?

769
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,237
Or should I be questioning
your eye for beauty?

770
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,698
You're feeling threatened.

771
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,824
Of course not.

772
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,411
I'm only asking
as a concerned business partner.

773
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,082
Call me if you come out
of the kiln broken.

774
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,292
I'll buy you a drink.

775
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,044
Why are you being so negative--

776
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,337
Let's make it makgeolli.

777
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,466
I'm not drinking. And I never will.

778
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,218
Tell Myeong-u I'll send him
the bowl I promised soon.

779
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,980
[phone vibrating]

780
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,359
BAE DONG-JIN

781
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,320
[Dong-jin] Seung-hyo,
are you free tonight?

782
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,071
TRANSFER 2,000,000 WON?

785
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,119
Please take your card.

786
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,830
Please check if you have
all of your belongings.

787
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,081
Thank you.

788
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,667
Hey, it's been a while.

789
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,253
No, it's just…

790
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,840
I was wondering if you knew
of any good part-time jobs.

791
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,300
That was so fun. [chuckles]

792
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,052
-[lady] It's fun every day.
-What?

793
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,428
No, like last time…

794
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,514
I'll call you back later.

795
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,311
Excuse me. What kind of place is this?

796
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,270
Oh.

797
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,605
It's a cooking school.

798
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,941
We also hold cooking classes.

799
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,275
-Cooking?
-Yes.

800
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,410
[exhales]

801
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:13,997
[exhales]

802
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,087
[muttering]

803
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,050
Good grief.

804
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,058
Mister, can I get an order of tteokbokki?

805
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,269
Goodness, I'm sorry.

806
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,646
I don't think I can sell this to you.

807
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,856
Why not? You have so much.

808
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,569
[chuckles] I don't think
I can sell this in good conscience.

809
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,945
It's too soggy.

810
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,196
What can you do?

811
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,156
Okay. Goodbye.

812
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,074
Goodness.

813
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,118
I'm sorry. Come back next time.

814
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,869
[chuckles]

00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,956
[grunting]

816
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,959
How about we start over again?

817
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,213
That's right. It's the bag from before.

818
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,924
What is this?

819
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,595
What is this? I didn't put this in here.

820
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,096
Honey.

821
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,681
What?

822
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,224
[exhales]

823
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,518
[Seok-ryu] I'm home.

824
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,604
Hi.

825
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,106
Why are you sitting here?

826
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,233
Is no one home?

827
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,111
Dong-jin said he needed to talk to me.

828
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,031
He said he'd be late
and told me to wait inside.

829
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,866
Why would he need to talk to you?

830
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,328
I don't know.
He said he has something to propose.

831
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,956
Damn it. That bastard.

832
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,833
He even asked you?

833
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,502
This punk must be out of his mind.

834
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,671
What? What is it?

835
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,717
Mom, do you know what Dong-jin's doing?

836
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,927
He asked you for money, and now, he asked…

837
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,139
KOREAN FOOD CRAFTSMAN
PRACTICAL SKILLS

838
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,267
What are you doing?

839
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,644
What is all of this?

840
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,897
Mom, don't you think
this is a little much? Come on.

841
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,024
Why are you inspecting stuff in my bag?

842
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,693
What is all of this?

843
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,695
Aunt Mi-suk, you should calm down first.

844
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,946
-Sit down…
-Can't you tell?

845
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,573
It's a cooking book.

846
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,661
Why do you have it?
Why would you have this?

847
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,872
Because I want to cook.

848
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,083
What?

849
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,337
Let's hear what she has to say first.

850
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,797
She's had her reasons.

851
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,300
Seung-hyo, did you know?
You knew she was taking cooking classes?

852
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,262
Yeah.

853
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,931
Goodness.

854
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,351
After running wild
and being reckless together,

855
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,894
were you conspiring together too?

856
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:41,978
I'm sorry.

857
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,189
-But--
-[Seok-ryu] He didn't do anything wrong.

858
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,150
-This is my business. My dream.
-How dare you?

859
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,318
[Geun-sik] So…

860
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,862
that's why you've been coming to my shop?

861
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,532
To secretly use my kitchen?

862
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,243
I'm sorry.

863
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,036
I didn't have a place to practice.

864
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,958
I was going to tell you both
after I got my certification.

865
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,084
[Geun-sik] Certification?

866
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:08,547
Seok-ryu, do you really want
to do this type of work?

867
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,050
Yeah, I do.

868
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,722
I worked really hard to find my dream.

869
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,348
Goodness.

870
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,308
What about your old work?

871
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,102
Well?

872
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,439
What about all the studying you did?
And your experience?

873
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,567
It was a valuable experience.
That time is precious to me.

874
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,609
But…

875
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,739
I think this is where it ends, Dad.

876
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,118
[Mi-suk sighs]

877
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,706
[Geun-sik exhales]

878
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:52,466
We raised a smart fool.

879
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:58,555
Seok-ryu, did all of that praise
go to your head?

880
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,975
-Dad…
-You couldn't stay at a job for ten years.

881
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,644
Do you really think
you can handle this kind of work

882
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,106
with that kind of mentality?

883
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,569
[door opens, closes]

884
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,780
What's going on?

885
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,116
Why is the mood so awful again?

886
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,578
[exhales] Was it you again, Seok-ryu?

887
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,746
[scoffs]

888
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,461
Don't you two ever think
you're being too hard on me?

889
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,464
Why are the standards different for me?

890
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,008
Why are you so strict with me?

891
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,178
What's Dong-jin done up until now?

892
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,223
He wanted to be a soccer player
but ran away from camp.

893
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,600
He wanted to learn music,
so you bought him instruments,

894
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,684
but he quit right after.

895
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,270
He tried four times
and couldn't get into college.

896
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,774
He joined a theater troupe
to be an actor but quit immediately.

897
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,484
Why the hell are you bringing the past?

898
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,861
Do you know why
I've worked so hard up until now?

899
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,825
You've both suffered so much
because of Dong-jin.

900
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,287
I didn't want to add to your worries.

901
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,166
But what is he doing now?

902
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,127
He's got another wild idea,
and he's pestering you, Mom!

903
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,797
Shut your mouth!

904
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,841
Keep quiet.

905
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,759
[Seok-ryu] How do you
always put up with him

906
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,347
but never allow me to make
a single mistake?

907
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,140
Why…

908
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,726
Why can't I do what I want with my life?

909
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,687
-[Mi-suk sighs]
-Fine.

910
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,025
Seok-ryu, do whatever you want.
You can do it all.

911
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,486
But not cooking.

912
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,571
[sighs]

913
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,365
-[Geun-sik] I'm sure it's fun now.
-[sniffles]

914
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,409
[Geun-sik] You imagine your customers

915
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,203
happily eating your food
in a charming restaurant.

916
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,789
-I'm sure it's like a fairy tale.
-[sighs audibly]

917
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,499
[Geun-sik] I was like that too.

918
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,917
That's why you can't.

919
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,337
You can't because I've tried it. Okay?

920
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,631
[sighs wearily]

921
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,174
Hey.

922
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:03,763
You're not the only one who feels wronged.
You're not the only victim!

923
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,725
I've spent my entire life
being criticized by you!

924
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:09,895
Damn it. So annoying.
As if she's the only one feeling wronged.

925
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,314
[exhales]

926
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,357
[door opens, closes]

927
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,359
-[Geun-sik exhales]
-[sighs]

928
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,487
[sniffles]

929
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,161
[sniffles] Don't follow me.

930
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,123
Follow me.

931
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,337
[Seok-ryu] How did you know
about this place?

932
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,715
[Seung-hyo] I've kept it
in mind for times like these.

933
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,468
Times when I'd need to comfort someone.

934
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,221
[Seok-ryu] So you came here with Tae-hui.

935
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,184
[Seok-ryu] There's a thing
called business ethics.

936
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,355
But you know…

937
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:58,151
knowing everything
about each other's past in detail

938
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,571
isn't much of an advantage
for me right now.

939
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,658
Look at those flowers!

940
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,661
They're so white. They look like popcorn.

941
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,749
How does your brain work?
How do you go from flowers to food?

942
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,544
I mean, they look delicious.
I want to drizzle caramel over them.

943
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,047
What do you think they're called?

944
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,966
Bridalwreaths…

945
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:25,470
are neighbors to these, the fringetree.

946
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,931
They say the leaves look like rice.

947
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,140
I see.

948
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,436
Such interesting names.

949
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,939
[pleasant music playing]

950
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,150
[exclaims]

951
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,445
-[Seung-hyo] You're not tall enough.
-[exclaims]

952
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,322
Damn.

953
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,951
Do you feel a little better?

954
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,414
I'm just a little embarrassed.

955
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,377
How do you end up seeing
all of my embarrassing moments in life?

956
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,215
I can recall all of your dark past…

957
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:05,010
Wait, this won't help me much either.

958
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,178
[groans]

959
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,680
This is so annoying.

960
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,225
I've felt so wronged for the longest time.

961
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,521
I thought getting it off my chest

962
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,941
would make me feel better.

963
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,527
I only feel worse.

964
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,987
I know that feeling.

965
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,866
Parents aren't always right.

966
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,285
They make mistakes
with their children too.

967
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,414
When you argue over it,
you end up feeling guilty for no reason.

968
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,166
Exactly.

969
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,794
How did you know that?
Did you fight with your parents too?

970
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,838
No.

971
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,424
I'm so jealous of your family.

972
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:50,847
Your parents are cultured,
and they watch what they say.

973
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:55,935
Also, you don't have a dumbass sibling.

974
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,605
I envy that the most.
When will that punk grow up?

975
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,527
Where am I supposed to
practice cooking now?

976
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,280
Do it at our office.

977
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,409
-What?
-Use the kitchen after everyone leaves.

978
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,079
Everyone's on a business trip this week.

979
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,916
Still, I can't do that at your office.

980
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,293
Did you forget I'm the president?

981
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:23,296
You've gotten a taste for power.

982
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,632
You can't be reckless
just because you're the boss.

983
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,759
-You want to use it or not?
-I'll use it.

984
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,011
-[chuckles softly]
-[Seok-ryu] But just once.

985
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,138
And I didn't ask for this favor.

986
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,640
You offered it to me first.

987
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,974
Who's saying otherwise?

988
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,269
Right. [inhales]

989
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,523
[exhales] The view is nice.

992

00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,582

Welcome to the team!

998
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,686
I heard you were coming,
and I couldn't sleep.

999
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,937
Why?

1000
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,105
Because I was excited.

1001
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,607
Are we taking pictures today?

1002
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,276
I used a sheet mask last night.

1003
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,027
-[Mo-eum] Jeez.
-Are you here to have fun?

1004
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,571
Just act normal.

1005
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,531
That way, he'll know
how serious our job is.

1006
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,326
-Yes, sir.
-We all put our lives on the line.

1007
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,413
-You should know that.
-Yes, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

sounded a bit old-fashioned even for me.

00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,216
He's a great person
when you get to know him.

1011
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,469
He has a very strong sense of duty too.

1012
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,429
I can tell even if you don't tell me.

1013
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,307
Okay. Shall we get going?

1014
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,391

-Okay.
-Your basic equipment.

1019
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,368
You have your safety helmet,
vest, thermal jacket, and camera.

1020
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:21,372
You can put the camera on your vest
wherever it's comfortable for you.

1021
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,707
-Okay.
-Next.

-Let me show you.

-I'll tell you about the first-aid kits.
-Okay.

1026

The smallest bag is the vitals bag.

1027

-Vitals.
-[Mo-eum] The biggest one is for wounds.

1028

This is the cardiac arrest bag.

1029
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,143
This is the fluids bag.

1030

1058
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,193
[inhales]

1059
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,236
[exhales]

1060
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,908
-[Mo-eum] We're paramedics. We got a call.
-[man] Over here!

1061
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,284
[exhilarating music playing]

1062
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,327
[Jeong-u] Are you okay?

1063
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,411
[bees buzzing]

1064
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,832
[man] I think he hurt his back.
He won't move.

1065
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,835
We're doing tree maintenance when he fell.

1066
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,962
There must've been a beehive here.

1067
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,881
[Dan-ho] Should I get the protective gear?

1068
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,926
[Mo-eum] No, we can't delay any longer.
His condition could worsen.

1069
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,637
[Jeong-u] They're not wasps.
You won't die.

1070
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,805
Come here.

1071
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,225
[Mo-eum] Sir, don't move.

1072
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,897
[groans softly]

1073
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,485
[Dan-ho] I'm glad the patient's condition
isn't serious.

1074
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,862
Yeah.

1075
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:46,911
But I can't say the same about your face.

1076
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,957
It doesn't hurt at all. I feel fine.

1077
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,002
Yeah, and you could've just left the scene
if things looked dangerous.

1078
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,088
Why did you keep helping?

1079
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,465
How could I? We're a team today.

1080
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,383
United in purpose.

1081
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,968
[Mo-eum] Whatever.

1082
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,554
Get treated. We have to get back.

1083
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,348
No, I want to complete the day together.

1084
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,644
How can you rescue anyone
looking like that?

1085
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,646
You should speak for yourself, Mo-eum.

1086
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,274
Your face is fine,
but you got stung all over.

1087
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,692
Why did you just say my name?

1088
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:18,776
Oh.

1089
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:22,155
Calling you anything else
feels less personable.

1090
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,116
-What shall I call you?
-[Jeong-u] Captain Jung?

1091
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,701
We got a call from Gongsin-dong.

1092
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,370
I think we can get there faster
than the station.

1093
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,830
-[Mo-eum] Let's go.
-Okay.

1094
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,542
Let's go.

1095
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,169
Yes, Captain Jung!

1096
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,255
[pop song playing]

1097
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,934
[Jeong-u] He has a herniated disk,
but there's no elevator.

1098
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,395
[Mo-eum] But we have legs.

1099
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,189
-Let's go quickly.
-[Jeong-u] Let's go.

1100
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,530
[man 1] This way.

1101
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,534
-[man 2 groans]
-[Mo-eum] Sir?

1102
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,413
[man 2 groans]

1103
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,664
You can't move, can you?

1104
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,624
No.

1105
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,418
[Mo-eum] Can you help us?

1106
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,797
-[Jeong-u] Put some power in it.
-[Dan-ho] Okay!

1107
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,590
[Jeong-u] Go slow.

1108
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,259
[Mo-eum] We're paramedics.

1109
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,677
-Did you call it in?
-[lady] Yes.

1110
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,597
-What did he eat?
-Shrimp. He didn't say he was allergic.

1111
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,350
-[Jeong-u] Give me the oxygen tank.
-[Dan-ho] Okay.

1112
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,019
-Give me that first.
-[Dan-ho] Okay.

1113
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,522
[Mo-eum] Sir, allow me.

1114
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,568
-[Jeong-u] I'll check his pulse.
-Okay.

1115
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:47,240
Doctor, the patient seems
to have anaphylaxis.

1116
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,157
Yes.

1117
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,576
I'll inject him with
the epinephrine saline.

1118
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,703
-Give me the epinephrine injection.
-[Jeong-u] Okay.

1119
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,333
[Mo-eum] Sir,
I'll administer the injection.

1120
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,836
-Grab his arms.
-[Dan-ho] Okay.

1121
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,553
[Mo-eum] Roll up his left sleeve.

1122
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,388
[groans softly]

1123
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,723
[Dan-ho] Can you see his vein?

1124
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,106
I know I contacted you,

1125
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:23,192
but I didn't think you'd be doing
the remodeling project.

1126
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:27,113
These days,
boundaries are blurred more than before.

1127
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,491
Not to mention, I think it'll be fun.

1128
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,952
-A theater is such an exciting place.
-Hmm.

1129
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,956
I want to amplify that excitement

1130
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,126
and turn it into a space where people
can experience a variety of things.

1131
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,794
We're so grateful.

1132
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,339
But it seems you have just as much
affection for the theater as we do.

1133
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,092
I have a lot of memories at the theater.

1134
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,343
You do?

1135
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:53,306
Yeah, the first movie I ever saw
in a theater was Toy Story.

1136
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:57,226
Did you watch it with your parents
when you were a kid?

1137
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,187
No, one of my favorite friends.

1138
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,397
Mmm. [chuckles softly]

1139
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,277
[pleasant music playing]

1140
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:10,990
[inhales]

1141
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,618
Since I'm here,
I want to see the staff areas inside.

1142
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,870
-Is that possible?
-[owner] Sure, of course.

1143
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,121
Let's go.

1144
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,586
I'm on my way back to the office.
Are you coming to practice later?

1145
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,881
Can I really go?

1146
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,717
No one will be there,
and I already told Myeong-u.

1147
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,177
Okay, I'll come.

1148
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,470
See you later.

1149
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,013
[line disconnects]

1150
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,581
What's going on?

1151
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,416
-Why are you with him?
-[clears throat]

1152
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,669
What happened was…

1153
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,630
I waited in front of her cooking class
and we came together.

1154
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,382
-[sighs]
-[Seung-hyo] Look.

1155
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,884
Don't you know this is stalking?

1156
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,221
Will you learn your lesson
after I call the cops?

1157
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,056
I didn't follow Seok-ryu here.

1158
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,058
I came to the architecture office.

1159
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,143
I came for a consult.

1160
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,354
[Myeong-u] Look at that.

1161
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:28,192
Seok-ryu and Mr. Choi
have brought our new client. [chuckles]

1162
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,237
Come up slowly.
We'll serve you with love and care.

1163
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,488
What's going on?

1164
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,502
What's he here for?

1165
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,005
[groans softly]

1166
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,090
I didn't eat anything, but I feel sick.

1167
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:55,094
So you want to build a house.

1168
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,387
[Hyeon-jun] Yes.

1169
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:01,392
My parents just retired,
and they're thinking of coming back home.

1170
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,561
We have some land in Gapyeong.

1171
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:08,190
It'd be nice if we had a house
they could visit like a vacation home.

1172
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:13,029
Oh, my. That sounds nice.
What a beautiful idea, right?

1173
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,905
We at Atelier In

1174
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:18,659
want to gift your parents with
a peaceful and contented retirement.

1175
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:22,621
Did you have a budget
or construction timeline in mind?

1176
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,623
[Hyeon-jun] For now…

1177
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,710
-I'm aiming for next year.
-[phone vibrating]

1178
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,420
Just a moment. Sorry about that.

1179
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,089
Hey, Hye-ran.

1180
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,719
There's a cockroach? Just kill it.

1181
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:38,471
What?

1182
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:42,183
-Okay, I'll be right there.
-[line disconnects]

1183
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,560
Did something happen at home?

1184
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:47,772
I think Ro-hui ingested
some roach pesticides.

1185
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,107
What? Isn't that serious?

1186
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:53,569
[Myeong-u] The kids are playing just fine.
But I think I have to go.

1187
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:58,032
I'm sorry.
You can finish the consult with Mr. Choi.

1188
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,575
Okay, you should go.

1189
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,869
-[Myeong-u] Yeah. I'm going.
-Myeong-u, call me later.

1190
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:02,787
Yeah, I will.

1191
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,163
I'm sorry.

1192
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,874
[door opens]

1193
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:09,752
[door closes]

1194
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,545
[Seung-hyo exhales]

1195
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:12,963
[Hyeon-jun sighs]

1196
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:19,345
Mr. Song Hyeon-jun.

1197
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,973
Is this consult an excuse?

1198
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,975
More of a pretext.

1199
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,602
The plans for my parents are true.

1200
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:27,686
I see.

1201
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,397
Unfortunately,

1202
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,733
I have no intention of taking this on.

1203
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:33,859
[Hyeon-jun] I see.

1204
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:35,820
That's too bad.

1205
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,864
I heard you were a skilled architect.

1206
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,491
Of course, from Seok-ryu.

1207
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,454
Don't say her name anymore.

1208
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,582
Don't show up like this either.

1209
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,460
It's over between you two.

1210
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,921
No, it's not.

1211
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,925
We can't break up that easily.

1212
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,052
That's what you think.

1213
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,846
You'll see it in time.

1214
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,641
You'll see what type of relationship
we had

1215
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,685
and what we meant to one another.

1216
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,479
I'm not curious about what's in the past.

1217
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,190
I only believe what Seok-ryu says.

1218
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:18,154
Is that belief purely based on friendship?

1219
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:22,491
Of course not.

1220
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,952
[tense music playing]

1221
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:25,870
[exhales]

1222
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,001
[Seung-hyo] How's the practice going?

1223
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,128
[Hyeon-jun] Were you waiting long?

1224
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:38,340
-Are you following me? You're not leaving?
-No, I'm not.

1225
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,342
If you keep this up,

1226
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,720
I'll have to report you for trespassing
and squatting.

1227
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:45,264
Are you arguing legal principles
in front of a lawyer?

1228
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,558
Did you forget this was my company?

1229
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:50,269
I'm sorry, but can you both leave?

1230
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,854
You're disrupting my cooking.

1231
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,565
-I'll be good.
-I'll just watch from here.

1232
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,029
[Seung-hyo clears throat]

1233
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:04,033
If you both sit in a chair,

1234
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,367
I would be so grateful.

1235
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,452
Okay.

1236
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,579
-[Seok-ryu] Both of you.
-Okay.

1237
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,999
Thanks.

1238
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,339
[quirky music playing]

1239
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,264
Are you really not leaving?

1240
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,643
No, I cleared my schedule.

1241
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,938
Also, I plan to eat the food
that Seok-ryu makes.

1242
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,024
I'm asking because I'm genuinely curious.

1243
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,319
Was your personality always like this?

1244
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:44,323
Yeah, she liked this about me.

1245
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,201
I'm strategic and have a clear purpose.

1246
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,162
How much longer do I have to wait?

1247
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,206
-Are you done yet?
-Are you hungry?

1248
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:55,876
I just have to fry the pancake
and boil it in the broth.

1249
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,337
Take your time.
I'll wait for as long as it takes.

1250
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,839
Take your time.

1251
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:03,509
[Hyeon-jun] By the way,

1252
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,135
it smells so good.

1253
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:07,763
The aroma is nutty and fragrant.

1254
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:08,764
[sniffs]

1255
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:13,227
-It smells like it's caramelizing.
-That's not my cooking.

1256
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:14,937
I could smell it too.

1257
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,439
Oh, right.

1258
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,986
I bought this for you.

1259
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,239
What? Popcorn!

1260
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:28,033
You said you wanted to eat some,
but what can I say?

1261
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,034
It's cold now.

1262
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,869
It's fine. I was hungry.

1263
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,121
Don't eat that.

1264
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,664
Why would you eat this?

1265
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,249
What are you doing?

1266
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,710
You act like I poisoned it.

1267
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,587
Trans fats aren't exactly healthy food.

1268
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:43,757
[exclaims]

1269
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:45,551
That's so good.

1270
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,887
This devilish sweet-and-salty flavor
flowing through my veins.

1271
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,017
Do you remember watching
Toy Story with me?

1272
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,601
Of course. I remember the lines.

1273
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,313
-"To infinity and beyond!"
-"To infinity and beyond!"

1274
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,023
-[Seok-ryu] You remembered?
-Of course.

1275
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,774
Leave me some.

1276
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,199
Have some.

1277
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:20,127
[grunts]

1278
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:21,920
Great job.

1279
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,630
-Yeah, great job.
-[exclaims]

1280
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:25,799
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1281
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,468
You look like you might pass out.

1282
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,636
You lied about your stamina, didn't you?

1283
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,598
That's because everyone else's stamina
is absurdly good.

1284
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,058
[Mo-eum] I swear.

1285
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,267
[Min-ho] Goodness.

1286
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,436
What happened to your face?

1287
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,521
He was valiantly stung by bees.

1288
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,940
You did great today.

1289
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,943
It wasn't so bad.
You went out in cooler weather.

1290
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,071
Our undies get soaked
in sweat in the summer.

1291
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:50,199
You should've experienced
that dry and flaky feeling.

1292
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,785
Do you prefer the start, middle,
or end of summer?

1293
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:53,702
I'll come back.

1294
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,412
[Min-ho chuckles]

1295
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,247
Did you have lunch?

1296
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,332
[Dan-ho] Well…

1297
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,625
[Min-ho] Go get changed.

1298
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,210
Let's have dinner.

1299

-[Mo-eum exclaims]
-Yes, sir.

1300
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,589
-Let's go.
-What are we eating?

1301
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,842

[sizzling]

1303
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,055
You can eat now.

1304
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:14,765
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1305
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,560
-Mmm.
-[exhales]

1306
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,645
[Jeong-u] Mmm.

1307
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,981
This place is good.
The meat is so tender too.

1308
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,819
Captain Yeon specially brought you
to his favorite place.

1309
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,113
It means he's opened up to you.

1310
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,407
Try the garlic sauce.
It tastes much better.

1311
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,326
-Okay.
-Try it with fresh kimchi too.

1312
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,369
It's like honey.

1313
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,496
I'll pass on the honey.

1314
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,248
I have a grudge against bees now.

1315
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:40,207
[Mo-eum chuckles]

1316
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,585
It seems we'll get a proper article.
You know we lack time to eat.

1317
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,713
It's not just that.
There was no time to go to the bathroom.

1318
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,341
That's where our occupational disease
comes in.

1319
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,384
Bladder infections.

1320
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:53,303
Captain Jung suffered from one
just last month--

1321
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,972
-Eat this!
-[groans]

1322
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:55,973
Eat up.

1323
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,349
My mouth was full.

1324
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,019
Are there other difficulties?

1325
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,813
Feel free to speak openly.

1326
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:05,190
-[all] Mmm.
-[snaps fingers]

1327
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,484
We don't listen to classical music.
Did you hear it?

1328
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,027
It plays over the speaker.

1329
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:09,945
Yeah.

1330
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:12,698
The warning sound startles everyone.

1331
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,618
They changed it for our mental health.
But classical music startles us now.

1332
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,539
I was in the bathroom of a bookstore,
and I was startled

1333
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,708
to hear a cardiac arrest sound playing.

1334
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,960
I forgot my pants were down
and almost left.

1335
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,503
Mozart.

1336
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,213
-Mozart?
-Yeah.

1337
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,341
As one of our occupational diseases,
we suffer from arrhythmia too.

1338
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,177
Since we're always stressed.

1339
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,596
How do you relieve that stress?

1340
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,473
-Dating?
-[Min-ho chuckles]

1341
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:40,309
That's more wishful thinking though.

1342
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:41,477
I'm single right now.

1343
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,353
Do you even have time to date?

1344
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,813
We make time.

1345
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:49,234
Since we work in such small spaces,
we end up dating each other.

1346
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:50,986
Office romances?

1347
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,907
-Do you all have experience in that?
-I married my office romance.

1348
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,117
He dated a girl in the academy.

1349
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,537
What about you?

1350
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:02,372
Excuse me?

1351
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,041
I'm not interested in that.

1352
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,167
[exclaims softly]

1353
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:09,546
Captain Jung likes heroes
from Marvel and DC.

1354
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,216
I've never seen her be impressed
with a real man.

1355
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,802
No! There is one! Back then!

1356
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:17,554
The man who cleared the road.

1357
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,431
-Mudflat Man?
-[Jeong-u] Yeah, Mudflat Man.

1358
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,975
I should've looked at his plates.

1359
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:26,813
If you want to break down her defenses,
you need to be impactful like that man.

1360
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,774
You should eat it while it's hot!

1361
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:29,691
It's hot!

1362
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,860
You're taking such good care of him.

1363
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:33,570
I want one too.

1364
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,072
[amusing music playing]

1365
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:39,409
-[Jeong-u] Gosh, it's hot.
-[Mo-eum groans]

1366
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,661
I'm sorry.

1367
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,329
Have a drink.

1368
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,466
[Hyeon-jun] Oh.

1369
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:56,468
-What?
-[Seok-ryu] Here.

1370
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,595
Why are there two bowls?

1371
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:03,141
-Are you really giving him one?
-The more taste testers, the better.

1372
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,601
Evaluate it objectively.

1373
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:08,313
Will you be understanding
of harsh feedback?

1374
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:11,275
It's a necessary process for growth.

1375
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,902
You're putting a lot of significance

1376
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,405
into tasting the food, aren't you?

1377
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:20,117
We had an ideal relationship where
we constantly helped each other grow.

1378
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,368
-Sure.
-Don't eat it.

1379
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,829
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

1380
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:33,505
It's good.

1381
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,633
[groans softly]

1382
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:37,759
[exhales]

1383
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,054
-Are you okay?
-[Seung-hyo] Hey, Seok-ryu?

1384
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,932
-What's wrong? Does it hurt?
-It's my stomach…

1385
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,809
Where and how does it hurt?

1386
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,271
-What are your symptoms? Can you get up?
-[groans]

1387
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,148
[breathing heavily]

1388
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:53,442
This won't do. Let's go to the hospital.

1389
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,402
-I'll take you.
-[Seok-ryu exhales]

1390
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:02,034
Hyeon-jun, grab me.

1391
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,452
[Hyeon-jun] You can lean on me.

[Seok-ryu exhales]

1394
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,269
Miss, is the abdominal pain severe?

1395
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:30,812
When did it start?

1396
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,731
Can you describe your symptoms?

1397
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:34,900
Three years ago…

1398
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,903
I received surgery in the States.

1399
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:48,914
Just a moment.

1400
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,000
This is Bae Seok-ryu's medical records.

1401
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,669
Give it to her doctor.

1402
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,171
[doctor] What surgery was it?

1403
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,548
Stomach cancer.

1404
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,301
I was diagnosed with stage 2.

1405
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:04,304
They removed 70% of my stomach.

1406
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:07,140
I underwent chemotherapy.

1407
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:15,357
[sighs]

1408
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:24,658
[exhales weakly]

1409
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,288
[labored breathing]

1410
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:32,791
[exhales weakly]

1411
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:39,381
HIS SECRET

1412
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:44,010
HER SECRET

1413
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,012
[gloomy song playing]

1414
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:21,047
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1415
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:24,217
[Hyeon-jun] Seok-ryu isn't a child to me.
She's a woman.

1416
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:27,220
[Mo-eum] How are you feeling right now?

1417
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,806
[Seung-hyo] There's a parenthesis
between Seok-ryu and me.

1418
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,141
And Hyeon-jun

1419
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,770
is inside of it
with a part of her that I don't know.

1420
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,271
[Hyeon-jun] If you're doing this,

1421
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:39,024
I want you to take
a proper path so you won't fail.

1422
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,359
[Seok-ryu] Hyeon-jun proposed to me.

1423
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:45,822
[Seung-hyo] How could you
not tell me that?

1424
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,617
[voice shaking] This is how little
I meant to you?

1425
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,161
Even as a friend,
I meant this little to you?

1426
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,584
