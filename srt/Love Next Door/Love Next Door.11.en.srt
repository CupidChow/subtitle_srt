No, you're right.

-[Seok-ryu] I'm sure it was a joke.

124

You lied about being smart in school,
didn't you?

125

You said you were as smart as Hye-suk,
but you kept falling behind, right?

-[Geun-sik] You did?

129
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,788
No, the rice I used already had beans.

130

I told you a million times I hate beans.

-I had leftover side dishes to clear out.

Putting anchovies in bibimbap
is like committing a cardinal sin!

It's hard to eat around it too.
They're so small.

Give me your spoons.
No one can eat except for Seung-hyo.

00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,430
Why are you studying French?

155
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,559
[Seok-ryu] It's a French cookbook.
The drawings were pretty, so I bought it.

156
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,230
But I have no idea what it says.

157
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,274
Blanquette de veau is veal stew.

158
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,485
It's a famous French home-style dish.

159
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,987
Hey, you haven't forgotten your French?

160
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,614
I bet I could still read that.

161
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,449
Then why haven't you spoken it?

162
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,493
Then, should I go around saying,

163
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,203
"Bonjour, mademoiselle"?

164
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,579
That was so gross.

165

Hey. Read this for me.

It's so thick. It'll take forever.

No, not all of it. Just a little.

Coq au vin means "rooster in wine."

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,719

00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,116
So… I woke up,

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,162
and your face was so close to mine.

191
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,123
But there suddenly was
a rainbow right there.

192
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,210
It was so interesting.
I couldn't help but touch it.

193
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,544
It's hot.

194
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,213

196

Gosh, I almost got heatstroke
while volunteering my services.

197
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,180
You asked me to read you the book,
and you fall asleep?

Well, that was because…

199
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,853
Tell your mom I'll put up
an awning here soon.

200
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,318
Why did the rainbow have to appear there?

201
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,154
Where is the light shining from?

202
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,990

Is it broken?

Did I look like someone who had regrets?

232
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,860
Is that why he isn't bringing up the milk?

233

She cried so much.
I didn't want to pressure her.

234
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,910
Forcing her to answer seems wrong.

235
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,914
So you're taking another step back?

I don't want to make it worse.

If only there was a catalyst
like this for you and Seok-ryu,

there would be zero worries.

Why does a pianist want to open
a bookstore?

She's always liked books.
Her dream is to open one in her hometown.

That whole area is a field of flowers.

We'll make a building

I saw it somewhere.

331
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,118
If you cover different holes

355
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,598
[door opens]

356
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,893
[door closes]

357
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,771
[sniffing]

358
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,779
[Seok-ryu] Oh…

359
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,242
I thought you two went to work,
so I used the kitchen for a little bit.

360
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,286
[sniffs] What are you making?
It smells good.

361
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,248
It's a French dish.
I'm just trying to mimic it.

362
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,209
You want to cook that badly?

363
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,919
Yeah.

364
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,463
The more I try it,
the more I want to do it.

365
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
It's fun and exciting.

366
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,176
[Geun-sik] Still,
I wish you wouldn't do this.

367
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,014
It's hard enough for a healthy person.
I wonder how you'll manage.

368
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,767
[Mi-suk] I feel the same way.

369
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,853
Stress is poison for your stomach.

370
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,148
You know from watching your dad
it's not an easy job.

371
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,817
I understand how you feel.

372
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,986
But I'll take care of myself.

373
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,364
I'll eat well, and I'll work out
to increase my stamina.

374
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,199
I promise not to get sick.

375
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:26,868
[clicks tongue]

376
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,329
[sniffles]

377
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,293
Quit right away if it gets hard.

378
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,962
[Mi-suk] That's right.

379
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,423
If it gets hard,
quit and just hang out at home.

380
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,174
You think we can't take care of you?

381
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,884
-Right, honey?
-You did well.

382
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,970
Whoa, I'm touched.

383
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,180
You promised, Mom.
You have to take care of me.

384
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,974
Okay. [clears throat]

385
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,313
Hang out, and if you get bored,
you can just get a job.

386
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,856
There's Saemsong Electronics.

387
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,108
-And there's Kekeo.
-[Geun-sik] There she goes again.

388
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,444
-She's at it again.
-Right?

389
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,863
That's the Mom I know.
She knows how to ruin the mood.

390
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,239
I'm just saying.

391
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,035
It's just in case you feel bored
and restless to death.

392
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,620
-Honey, how does it taste?
-It's good.

393
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,831
-[Mi-suk] Really? Let me try some.
-[chuckles]

394
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,129
[Dan-ho] Yeon-du, did something happen
at kindergarten today?

395
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,298
You don't look happy.

396
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,759
Today, A-ron said to me…

397
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,678
I didn't have a mom.

398
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,310
I bet that upset you.

399
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,270
So what did you do?

400
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,065
I did what you taught me.

401
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,318
I said not all families
have a mom and dad.

402
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,196
I said it's an ideology created by society

403
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,323
about what they think
"normal families" should be.

404
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,202
You did great.

405
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:54,081
But they're dumb,
so they don't know what ideology is.

406
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:58,335
Dad, are you sure
you can keep leaving work early like this?

407
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:02,255
Your babysitter hurt her back,
so she can't come anymore.

408
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,966
I have no choice
until I find a new babysitter.

409
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,928
When is the new babysitter coming?

410
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,348
[Dan-ho] I don't know.
No one has applied yet.

411
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,226
[Jae-suk] How about…

412
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,979
if I do it?

413
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,273
[amusing music playing]

414
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,279
Ms. Jae-suk!

415
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,656
Hey, Mo-eum.

416
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,783
-Mo-eum!
-Hey, Yeon-du. [chuckles nervously]

417
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,743
[Jae-suk] Hey, I'm glad you're here.

418
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,995
Watch the office for a second.

419
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,414
I'm taking Yeon-du out for some ice cream.

420
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,083
No, that's fine. I'll buy it.

421
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,335
No, I want to buy it for her.
Let's go, Yeon-du.

422
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,838
-Okay!
-[Dan-ho] I'll go too then.

423
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,673
I'd really like to go!

424
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,384
Your dad's a bit overprotective.

425
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,513
Are you sure
you can trust me to watch her?

426
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,723
Who's watching who? You?

427
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,393
Yeah, I'm going to
look after Yeon-du for now.

428
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,563
-[sighs]
-You really don't have to.

429
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,566
Come on. What are neighbors for?

430
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,485
We're here to help one another.
Just wait here for a bit.

431
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,903
-I'll be back.
-[Jae-suk] Bye.

432
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,238
-Let's go.
-[Mo-eum] Mom.

433
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,073
-[chuckles nervously] Mom.
-Yeon-du…

434
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,284
[Mo-eum] Mom…

435
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,786
[amusing music playing]

436
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,498
[exhales]

437
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,381
[chuckles nervously]

438
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,262
I'm sorry about before!

439
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,689
After what happened to Seok-ryu…

440
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:48,778
and after hearing your story,
I must've been swept up by emotions.

441
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,783
I think it was a type
of temporary insanity.

442
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,247
I'm sorry too.

443
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,875
No matter how sudden it was,

444
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,294
I was wrong for failing to avoid it.

445
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,504
Well…

446
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,965
Right.

447
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
Well…

448
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,386
I was more at fault here.

449
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:19,309
How about we agree it was
a mutual mistake made by both of us?

450
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,353
-I fully agree.
-[Mo-eum] Okay.

451
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,480
-Good.
-[Dan-ho] Yes.

452
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,981
[sighs deeply]

453
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,899
Okay.

454
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,442
-Also…
-Yes?

455
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,779
I declined your mother's offer
to watch Yeon-du.

456
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,863
No, it's okay.

457
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:36,660
That's between you and my mom.

458
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,620
Don't worry about me.

459
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,165
Thank you. I'll try to find
a new babysitter as soon as possible.

460
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,208
[exclaims softly]

461
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,127
-[Yeon-du] Dad!
-Hey.

462
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,714
Dad, she bought me a ton of ice cream.

463
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,842
You're so lucky. Did you thank her?

464
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,887
I turned on the air conditioning.
Why is it so hot?

465
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,140
-It's steaming hot. What's going on?
-[Mo-eum exhales]

466
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,476
[AC blows faster]

467
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,436
[lounge music playing in the background]

468
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,982
How's the food?

469
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,235
I came here with our client last time.

470
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,861
I liked it.

471
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,947
Yeah, it's nice.

472
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,158
Yeah, it's good.

473
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,119
That's a relief.

474
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,579
It's usually hard
to get a reservation here.

475
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:26,376
Thankfully, someone canceled,
and they had one spot left. [chuckles]

476
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,920
I see.

477
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,011
To be honest, we asked you to dinner
because we had something to tell you.

478
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,431
[clears throat]

479
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,311
[exclaims softly]

480
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,604
What is it?

481
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,566
I was reassigned.

482
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,861
I see.

483
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,324
Where are you going?
How long is it for this time?

484
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,369
Africa. It's going to be for a while.

485
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,539
Africa…

486
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,172
If I can, I'll take time off to visit.

487
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,591
It'd be nice if you could go too, Dad.

488
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,428
Seung-hyo. [exhales]

489
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,765
We're getting a divorce.

490
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,601
What?

491
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,771
Our marriage fell apart a long time ago.

492
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,524
We've decided there's no point
in forcing ourselves to be together.

493
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,859
[slow music playing]

494
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,489
[Hye-suk] We think ending things here
would be the best for everyone.

495
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,329
Seung-hyo, all I can say is I'm sorry.

496
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,748
We hope you'll understand.

497
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,669
What's there for me to understand?

498
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,296
It's your lives.

499
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,386
Don't worry about me. Do what you want.

500
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,849
I'm sorry.
I forgot about something urgent today.

501
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,311
I'll get going.

502
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,897
[slow music continues playing]

503
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,668
[sighs deeply]

504
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,897
[Gyeong-jong] You're really
going to Africa?

505
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,817
So you don't care about me or Seung-hyo?

506
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,237
You're the one
who has no respect for my career.

507
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,407
You think leaving your family
to go off alone for years makes sense?

508
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,533
Family?

509
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,243
You have no right to say that.

510
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,829
You pretty much live at that hospital
and rarely come home.

511
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,041
When Seung-hyo and I were in France,
you came to see us only once.

512
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,169
So I'm telling you
to stay in Korea!

513
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,920
My goodness.

514
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,338
-[sighs]
-[phone ringing]

515
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,467
Let's discuss this again later.

516
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,096
-Hello?
-[Se-hwan] It's me.

517
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,306
Can you talk?

518
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,474
[Hye-suk] No, I'm sorry.

519
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,267
I'll call you back later.

520
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,311
Yeah, sorry. Bye.

521
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,814
-Who was that?
-The colleague I'm going with.

522
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,857
I have a work call.

523
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,651
You sure it's for work?
And not another reason for wanting to go?

524
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,694
What does that mean?

525
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,071
You had the chance
to be assigned elsewhere.

526
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,574
But there are civil wars
and always talk of terrorism there!

527
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,993
Why are you bent
on going somewhere so dangerous?

528
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,162
Because Koreans live there too.

529
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,998
Why do this job if it's only to go
to safe and comfortable countries?

530
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,708
So it's solely a sense of duty?

531
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,294
Is that why a woman with a child
would be this stubborn?

532
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,629
[screaming]

533
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,507
Seriously! That's enough!
I'm so sick of this!

534
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,051
-Hye-suk!
-[Hye-suk] What?

535
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,804
You want me to stay home,
raise our child, and do housework?

536
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,641
You should've married a woman
who'd support you instead of me.

537
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,725
Is that all you can say?

538
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,770
I should've never married you
to begin with.

539
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,439
No, I should've never had Seung-hyo.

540
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,192
-Hey!
-You clipped my wings!

541
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,111
You've trapped me here with a child!

542
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,822
If only Seung-hyo wasn't around,

543
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,698
this wouldn't have happened to me.

544
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,868
I love Seung-hyo,

545
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,287
but I can't live as just a mom.

546
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,210
[Hye-suk exclaims]

547
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,254
Seung-hyo.

548
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,132

549
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,764

551

[sighs]

552
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,494
[Seung-hyo] Ratatouille is
a representative dish

553
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,787
of the Provence region.

554
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,417
Add herbs and olive oil to eggplants,
zucchini, bell peppers, and tomatoes.

555
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,545
Simmer it into a vegetable stew.

556
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,423
-[Seok-ryu] Ratatouille was a good movie.
-[Seung-hyo] I'm leaving.

557
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,465
[Seok-ryu] Keep going.

558
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,303
[Seung-hyo speaking French]

559
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,054
[phone vibrating]

560
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,349
CHOISSEUNG

561
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,311
Why is he calling me this late?

562
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,646
[clears throat]

563
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,609
Hello?

564
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,028
Sorry?

565
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,821
[mellow music playing]

566
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,120
[sighs]

567
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,372
-Hey, Choisseung.
-[Seung-hyo groans]

568
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,584
-Hey, get up.
-Okay.

569
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,794
Are you the girl
I spoke with on the phone?

570
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,712
Yes.

571
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:07,383
Well, this young man was drinking alone
and he suddenly passed out.

572
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,844
I had a strong feeling this would happen.

573
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,932
He looked very troubled.
He kept drinking with tears in his eyes.

574
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,809
I tried waking him, but he wouldn't budge.

575
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,977
So what could I do?

576
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,147
I pressed the first number
he had on speed dial, and it called you.

577
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,942
Thank you for calling.

578
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,320
-Hey, let's go.
-[Seung-hyo groans]

579
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,906
-Try to get up.
-[Seung-hyo groans]

580
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,284
-[grunts]
-[Seung-hyo groans]

581
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,287
He hasn't paid yet.

582
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,372
What?

583
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,748
[Seung-hyo groans]

584
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,625
Are you kidding me?

585
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,336
[mellow music continues playing]

586
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,755
-Goodness.
-[Seok-ryu] Where's your wallet?

587
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:50,969
[sighs wearily]

588
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,763
How much is it?

589
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,892
Damn it. You just had to order
two dishes you didn't even eat.

590
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,019
[groans]

591
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,271
I can't go any further!

592
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,774
Not even if my life depended on it!

593
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,025
-[Seung-hyo groans]
-[groans]

594
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,819
Whether you spend the night here

595
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,863
or sober up and go home,
you figure it out.

596
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,865
I'm exhausted.

597
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,784
[drunkenly] I'm not going home.

598
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,287
[in normal voice] Hey, are you waking up?

599
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,289
[exhales]

600
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,500
[Seok-ryu sighs]

601
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,546
[breathes deeply]

602
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,506
I said I'm not going home.

603
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,091
Stop being such a drunk.

604
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,010
You're going to sleep here then?

605
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,806
[drunkenly] Hey.

606
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,474
Tonight,

607
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,144
I had dinner

608
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,271
with my mom and dad.

609
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,648
[in normal voice] So what?

610
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,359
[drunkenly] Well…

611
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,822
It was the first time
since I graduated college.

612
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:59,203
Your family does it all the time.

613
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,998
You all have meals together.

614
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,878
But for me,

615
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,965
it was the hardest thing to do.

616
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,386
And I did that today, but…

617
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,056
[chuckles softly] Never mind.

618
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,974
[breathes deeply]

619
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,477
We didn't even finish our meal.

620
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,939
[slow music playing]

621
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,941
Hey.

622
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,279
Every time I go to your house,

623
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,365
there's something I really envy.

624
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,412
Your family picture.

625
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,627
In our house,

626
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,129
we have everything…

627
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,466
except for that.

628
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,094
No, that's not it.

629
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,640
We look like we have everything.

630
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,352
But we have nothing.

631
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,649
Choisseung.

632
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,276
[slow music continues playing]

633
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,746
My parents are getting a divorce.

634
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,457
What?

635
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,418
I was always scared…

636
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,424
that this day would come.

637
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,138
When I was six or seven…

638
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,101
[sighs] …and when I was 18…

639
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,273
[chuckles] But…

640
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,610
I'm 34 now.

641
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,447
It happened later than I expected.

642
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,284
[laughs]

643
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,664

[slow music continues playing]

645
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,419
But I'm still scared.

646
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,261
Even though I'm an adult now,

647
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,515
why does my parents' divorce still hurt?

648
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,812
My mom and dad…

649
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:37,153
I know they have their own lives.

650
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,449
But…

651
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:50,917
Instead of being happy apart…

652
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,506
I still wish they were happy together.

653
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,186

[groans]

657
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,170
[Seok-ryu] Are you sober now?

658
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,966
What's going on?

659
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,885
What happened?

660
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,179
-What are you doing here?
-[sighs]

661
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,140
-Why am I here?
-[Seok-ryu sighs]

662
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,102
[bangs table] Give it to me.

663
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,147
-What?
-Transport and medical expenses.

664
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,775
I had to drag you here from a tent bar

665
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,193
and almost broke my back.

666
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,406
Also, your bill was 47,000 won. Give it.

667
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,324
[groans softly]

668
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,744
Okay, I'll pay you back.

669
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,955
-Do you want it now?
-Forget it.

670
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,417
Do you have a headache? Do you want water?

671
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,669
Yeah, I have a splitting headache.

672
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,589
[groans softly]

673
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,301
Where's the water? Why aren't you…

674
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,178
[Seok-ryu] Hey,
why didn't you toss this out?

675
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,263
It's expired.

676
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,640
This will give you an upset stomach.

677
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,850
[mellow music playing]

678
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,184
Right.

679
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,271
[grunts] I forgot
that I was going to throw it away.

684
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:01,172
I remember drinking.

685
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,674
But I didn't do anything stupid, right?

686
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,346
You almost did something really stupid.

687
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,389
What?

688
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,683
Tell your mom and dad

689
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,478
how you really feel.

690
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,901
Don't cry alone like when you were seven
after your mom left.

691
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,366
"Don't go." Why is that so hard to say?

692
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,370
Let's go. I'm sober now.

693
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,915
You've been nagging me
all this time to lean on you.

694
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,458
But why won't you lean on me?

695
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,878
I did lean on you.

696
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,630
[Seok-ryu] What?

697
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,471
You held me up on the way here.

698
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,474
You have so much strength.
You were born with it.

699
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:58,479
I should've just left you for dead
in the streets, you little…

700
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,566
Straighten your collar, you klutz.
[chuckles softly]

701
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,577
This was because of you.

waiting period would take a month.

We have to appear in court again.
What are you going to do?

705
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,061
I'll take time off and come back.

706
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,439
-[thunder rumbling]
-[rain pattering]

707
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,651
It's raining.

708
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,361
I have an umbrella.

709
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,699
On our wedding day
and when we registered our marriage,

710
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,368
it rained.

711
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,121
It did.

712
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,667
That's why everyone thought
we'd be happy together.

713
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:03,836
[slow music playing]

714
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,838
How did we end up like this?

715
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,507
I don't remember fighting all that much.

716
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,594
We didn't even have a chance to fight.

717
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,390
Are you blaming me?

718
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,269
I'm blaming myself.

719
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,691
Take it.

720
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,610
No, wait…

721
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,801
[sucking air through teeth]

722
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,929
Gosh.

723
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,931
I'm sure there's at least one.

724
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,558
[Mi-suk] What? You're leaving tomorrow?

725
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,521
[Hye-suk] It just turned out that way.
It's urgent.

726
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,607
Hey, but still,

727
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,734
there's no reason to be so sudden.

728
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,237
Wait, let me call Jae-suk and In-suk.

729
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,571
-I'll tell them to come.
-Stop.

730
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,199
Please! Don't make such a fuss.

731
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,951
I saw them a few days ago anyway.

732
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,994
I'll be back soon.

733
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,247
Yeah, but still…

734
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,166
Here. These are some cosmetics.
Share it with the others.

735
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,501
It's from France.

736
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,796
Apply it generously,
and don't age while I'm gone.

737
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,256
You brat.

738
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,260
You better call often when you get there.

739
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:38,389
Call me when you crave kimchi
and when you want to speak Korean.

740
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,017
Call me if anything troubles you, okay?

741
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,228
Fine, I will.

742
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,690
[Mi-suk] Why is it so sudden though?

743
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,402
-[door closes]
-[Seok-ryu] Aunt Hye-suk.

744
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,323
Seok-ryu, were you home?

745
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,118
-I thought I wasn't going to see you.
-Me too.

746
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,078
I would've been sad if you just left.

747
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,454
[chuckles softly]

748
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,039
[exhales]

749
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,918
Seok-ryu, you've been through so much.

750
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,919
[slow music playing]

751
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,715
But I'm not worried about you.
I know you'll do well.

752
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,430
I've always been grateful for
how well you've looked after Seung-hyo.

753
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,852
Check in on him from time to time
while I'm away, okay?

754
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,187
Go on in. Bye.

755
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,066
Goodness. I'm off now. Bye.

756
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,570
Aunt Hye-suk.

757
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,698
Seung-hyo's sad.

758
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,956
Seung-hyo…

759
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,918
has always been waiting
for his mom since he was a kid.

760
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,173
He was like a kid
in a never-ending game of hide-and-seek.

761
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,928
He hid so no one could find him.

762
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:06,143
But I think he was waiting
for his mom to find him.

763
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,067
Thanks for telling me.

764
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,531
[siren blaring]

765
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,991
[dramatic music playing]

766
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,874
The paramedics are here.
Where's the patient?

767
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,171
[muffled voice] I have a piece
of raw octopus stuck in my throat!

768
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,635
The suckers are stuck to your throat.
We have to get it out.

769
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,679
Open your mouth.

770
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,222
[man] She ate a poisonous mushroom!

771
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,557
Why would she eat that here?

772
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,725
[lady] Over here!

773
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,853
She's been bitten
by a blue-ringed octopus!

774
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,773
A blue-ringed octopus in the mudflats?

775
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,483
[breathing heavily]

776
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,693
What do I do?

777
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,488
I can't do this on my own.

778
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,366
[whimpering]

779
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,786
[Mo-eum exclaims]

780
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,287
I LOVE YOU, MUDFLATS

782
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,712

Mudflat Man!

[heroic music continues playing]

787
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,582
You take care of the poisonous mushroom.

788
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,083
I'll handle the raw octopus.

789
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,710
[both exclaiming]

790
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,713

[man grunts]

793
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,851
[Mo-eum] Mudflat Man.
We still have the blue-ringed octopus.

794
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,814
Blue-ringed octopus have
deadly venom containing tetrodotoxin.

795
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,982
We must move her now.

796
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:17,983
[exclaims softly]

[mellow music playing]

799
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,795
All of this wouldn't have been possible
without you, Mudflat Man.

[gasps]

804
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,941
You damn lunatic.

[exhales]

806
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,027
I really must be insane.

807
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,613
Yeah, I've lost my mind.

808
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,538

00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,751

-Mo-eum!
-[gasps]

811
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,130
Are you staying
at our house starting today?

812
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,549
You should've woken me up.

813
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,969
I heard you worked last night
and got home this morning.

814
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,639
You need to sleep well
to rescue people.

815
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,142
You're the only one who worries about me.

816
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,354
But where's my mom? Why are you alone?

817
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,730
I'm right here.

818
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,610
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yeah, and you're coming too.

Yeon-du.

825
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:33,952
When you go to a bathhouse,
eating seaweed soup and sikhye is a must.

826
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:38,832
This is wisdom
that's passed down from an elder.

827
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,292
Make sure to remember that.

828
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,585
-Oh?
-[Yeon-du] Mmm.

829
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,839
Don't forget
these stone-cooked eggs either.

830
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,050
-[Jae-suk] You're right.
-Want me to peel it for you?

831
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,261
I can do it.

832
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,639
Goodness, she's so smart.

833
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,433
Ms. Do! Over here!

834
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,684
Goodness! Hey!

835
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,728
Wait, I'll be right back.

836
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,731
My goodness, I don't believe this!

837
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,400
-You're all here!
-[indistinct chatter]

838
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,611
You know how to do it.

839
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,488
You crushed it hard.

840
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,490
[lady] Do you want to eat eggs or chips?

841
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,951
-[kid] Chips.
-Chips? Okay!

842
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,872
Here it comes! Whoosh!

843
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,707
So yummy!

844
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,335
[mellow music playing]

845
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,128
Yeon-du.

846
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,130
Want to see something cool?

847
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,550
All right.

848
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,013
Usually, when you come to a bathhouse,

849
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:39,810
this is a must too, but I forgot.

850
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,812
Here.

851
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,440
Ta-da! A lamb's head towel hat!

852
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,446
My gosh! You're so cute!

853
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,949
Look. She's got one too.

854
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,035
You're eating so well!

855
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,663
Want me to peel you some eggs?

856
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,040
[Yeon-du] I wasn't looking
because of this.

857
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,251
[Mo-eum] What?

858
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,340
I looked because she has a mom
and I was envious.

859
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,801
I don't have a mom.

860
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,934
[Mo-eum] What do you mean
you don't have a mom?

861
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,770
In your pretty face,

862
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,690
I can see your dad and your mom too.

863
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,152
Yeon-du.

864
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,114
Everyone goes on that trip one day.

865
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,077
Your mom just left a little early.

866
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,455
Hmm.

867
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,834
My dad left for that trip early too.

868
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:50,130
In return, he sent me a lot of friends
so I wouldn't be lonely.

869
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,759
-Really?
-Yeah.

870
00:50:53,842 --> 00:51:00,390
[gasps] Maybe your mom and my dad
met on their trip.

871
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,310
So on the day
you were looking for crop circles,

872
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,145
maybe they brought us together

873
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,813
so that we could have fun together.

874
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,484
So we could become good friends!

875
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,903
I have fun hanging out with you.

876
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,196
Me too.

877
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,157
From now on, let's have fun together.

878
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,452
Let's have a blast every day.

879
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,537
-Okay.
-[exclaims]

880
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,165
All right. How about we have some fun now?

881
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,625
I'll peel one too.

882
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,049
[Hye-suk] It's been hard
to see you lately.

883
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,344
You haven't been home for a few days.

884
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,428
Yeah.

885
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,681
I just came for some clothes.
I have to go.

886
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,558
I see. [chuckles softly]

887
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:46,978
Well…

888
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,482
The thing is…

889
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,654
I'm leaving tomorrow.

890
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,616
Okay, have a safe trip.

891
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,118
I'll keep in touch often.

892
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,205
I'll call and text you.

893
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,624
Your birthday's at the end of the year--

894
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:08,792
You don't have to.

895
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,713
When I'd hear that as a kid,
I looked forward to it.

896
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,007
I waited.

897
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,052
There were days when I needed you.

898
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,598
But not anymore.

899
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,768
[slow music playing]

900
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,648
Seung-hyo.

901
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,245
[door opens]

902
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,541
[door closes]

903
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,763
[exhales]

904
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,320
[slow music continues playing]

905
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,171
[door closes]

906
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,142
[Seung-hyo] What are you doing?

907
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,396
Why are you in my office
and sitting there like that?

908
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,273
Why did you wash your hair at work?
Did you stay out all night?

909
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,692
I was busy with work.

910
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,945
But why are you here? What's up?

911
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,197
I have something to give you.

912
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,540
[Mi-suk] Hey, Seok-ryu!

913
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,208
It's not cooked! You can't eat that!

914
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,876
You want to go to the hospital?

915
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,877
Have some lettuce.

916
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,713
Dong-jin, stop running around
and come here.

917
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,047
It's hot.

918
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,384
-Do we have to eat on the rooftop?
-You have to fight fire with fire.

919
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,386
And it's nice. The atmosphere's great too.

920
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:11,474
[Geun-sik] Gyeong-jong, the bags under
your eyes are drooping all the way down.

921
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,518
I know. He looks like a raccoon.

922
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,228
They'd mistake you for a friend.

923
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,647
-[both laughing]
-I came straight from the night shift.

924
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,983
Goodness, shouldn't you
get some sleep then?

925
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,234
We cluelessly invited you.

926
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,736
No, it's fine.

927
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,031
[Geun-sik] Yeah, fatigue can't be relieved
with just sleep.

928
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,241
You have to have fun
with family like this.

929
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,242
That's how you relax.

930
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:33,997
Yes, you're right.
It's nice being together like this.

931
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,584
[Geun-sik] I heard you two couldn't go
on vacation because you were so busy.

932
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,087
Think of this as a vacation spot, okay?
[chuckles]

933
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,757
[Mi-suk] Let's take a picture.
We have some film left, right?

934
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,760
-Forget it. Why take pictures?
-No, it'll be a keepsake.

935
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,261
-You look nice today too.
-Don't.

936
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,972
-Just take a picture.
-It's so lame.

937
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,099
-Seung-hyo, sit with your parents.
-Come here.

938
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,643
[Geun-sik] Let's take one as a keepsake.
Okay.

939
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,562
Goodness, you look miserable.

940
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:01,107
-[Hye-suk] Is this right? We're eating.
-[Geun-sik] Smile. Get closer.

941
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,734
Hey, smile!

942
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,487
-[Mi-suk] Seung-hyo.
-All right. Smile.

943
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,657
-One, two, three. Cheese! There you go!
-[chuckles softly]

944
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,742
[camera shutter clicks]

945
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,243
[mellow music playing]

946
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,167
[Seok-ryu] I was cleaning out my room,

947
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,587
and I just happened
to come across it by coincidence.

948
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,548
Thanks.

949
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,010
You have one too now. A family picture.

950
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,226
[breathes deeply]

951
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:40,897
Hey. You sure you don't have to
go to the airport to see your mom off?

952
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,483
You know when her flight is?

953
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,779
[Seung-hyo] No.

954
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,697
Wouldn't your dad know?

955
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,450
-I'll call him.
-[phone vibrating]

956
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,369
FATHER

957
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,997
Hello, I was just about to call you.

958
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,292
What?

959
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,088
She did?

960
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,090
[sirens wailing distantly]

961
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,051
Dad.

962
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,219
What happened?

963
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,263
I just got the call too.

964
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,850
We found Seo Hye-suk's suitcase
at the terminal.

965
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,561
It was taken
to the lost and found center at first.

966
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,856
It had a Ministry of Foreign Affairs tag,
so it was brought here.

967
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,358
Her departure's today.
She was on her way to the airport.

968
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,568
[officer] I see.

969
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,777
I'll try calling her.

970
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,238
[line ringing]

971
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,824
[phone ringing]

972
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,076
[officer] We tried to call her too.

973
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,245
We think her phone's in here.

974
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,706
-[officer 2] Officer Kim?
-Yes, sir?

975
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,707
Just a moment.

976
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,333
[serious music playing]

977
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,170
If she lost her suitcase and phone,

978
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,088
isn't she in big trouble then?

979
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,258
All of her contacts would be on her phone.

980
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,844
Do you know the combination on her lock?

981
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,139
Her birthday is June 17.

982
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,935
It didn't work.
Try your birthday and your dad's.

983
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:01,895
[Seung-hyo] Okay.

984
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:10,945
[sighs]

985
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,457
[Seok-ryu] It opened!

986
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,792
What are those numbers?

987
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,962
Their wedding anniversary.

988
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,634
[inhales]

989
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:33,718
[slow music playing]

990
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,094
[exhales]

991
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,554
Where do you think she is?

992
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,681
Is there any way to reach her?

993
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,232
SE-HWAN

994
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,400
[line ringing]

995
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,570
[phone vibrating]

996
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,909
Hey. Did you arrive yet?

997
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:58,952
[Gyeong-jong] Hello?

998
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,332
-Who is this?
-Choi Gyeong-jong.

999
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,376
[Se-hwan] Hello.

1000
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,547
I'll explain
why I have my wife's phone later.

1001
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,507
Do you know where she is right now?

1002
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,885
-What?
-[Gyeong-jong] Did she reach the airport?

1003
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,096
The airport?

1004
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,973
She's departing for her new post today.

1005
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,516
I don't know when her flight is.

1006
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,101
What new post?

1007
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,437
She's decided to retire. Didn't you know?

1008
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,189
What?

1009
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,775
I guess she didn't tell you.

1010
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,156
I don't know
if I should be telling you this,

1011
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,702
but Hye-suk's been acting strange lately.

1012
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,662
-[gasps]
-[chuckles]

1013
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,956
What's with the flowers?

1014
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,792
It's to celebrate your retirement
and hard work over the years.

1015
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,460
Retirement? Who's retiring?

1016
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,629
-What?
-Gosh.

1017
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,257
I love the scent of lily of the valleys.

1018
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,260
But who's retiring?

1019
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,388
Well… [chuckles nervously]

1020
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,933
I almost forgot.
When are you going to reassign me?

1021
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:07,186
I'll grab a meeting with the minister
if you don't tell me soon.

1022
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,896
Hye-suk…

1023
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,649
What are you doing? You're scaring me.

1024
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,651
They're so pretty.

1025
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:17,780
I had told her
she wouldn't be reassigned anymore.

1026
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,034
She clearly accepted it too.

1027
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,785
But she couldn't remember that.

1028
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,288
It was like she was hearing it
for the first time.

1029
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:26,956
[breath trembling]

1030
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:28,958
[inhales]

1031
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,669
I have to find her quickly.

1032
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,505
Do you know where she could've gone?

1033
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,424
[In-suk whimpering]

1034
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,053
[crying] She's so cruel.

1035
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,431
How can she leave without saying goodbye?

1036
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,101
The Ice Princess lived up to her name.

1037
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,145
How could she just leave a gift and go?

1038
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:53,441
She said she was sorry
and that she'd call soon.

1039
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,860
Then, does that mean we can open this now?

1040
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,279
But isn't this Chatin?

1041
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,990
This is expensive.

1042
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,535
Wait! [laughing]

1043
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:08,539
Hey, I'm an expert in cosmetics too.

1044
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,791
[Mi-suk] Is this a cream?

1045
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,751
Let's see what it says.

1046
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,296
-"Suble…"
-[Jae-suk] Toner?

1047
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,840
-[Mi-suk] I think it's sunscreen.
-[In-suk] "Suble…"

1048
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,592
Damn it!

1049
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,886
Hey, this is the land of Hangul!

1050
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,389
Why the hell would they use
these squiggly letters?

1051
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,475
Hey, I'll call Hye-suk later.

1052
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,185
No, I'll ask Seok-ryu later.

1053
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,145
Jeez, I can't even see it.

1054
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,607
Gosh. Hey, Seung-hyo! Seok-ryu!
I'm glad you're here.

1055
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,527
[voice shaking] Aunt Mi-suk, do you know
where my mom went?

1056
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,154
-What?
-Please find her for me.

1057
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,074
[melancholy music playing]

1058
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,200
[birds chirping]

1059
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,546
[Hye-suk] But what caused it to break?

1060
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,382
[mechanic] I found this inside the washer.

1061
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,466
Goodness.

1062
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,302
Wait.

1063
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,679
Saffron.

1064
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,807
You consume so much medicine,
and you still don't know that?

1065
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,891
What?

1066
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,852
It's not saffron.

1067
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,105
-Are you sure it's not saponin?
-[In-suk] Yeah, it is.

1068
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,607
I thought it was saponin too.

1069
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,986
You left a magazine
written in English in my bag.

1070
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,070
A magazine?

1071
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,655
I never did that.

1072
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,198
Retirement? Who's retiring?

1073
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:25,950
[sighs]

1074
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,079
[slow music playing]

1075
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,623
[exhales]

1076
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,506
I'm sure I had my phone with me.

1077
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,053
[exhales]

1078
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,182
You can easily confuse the two.

1079
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,769
[voice shaking] Yeah.
And they're about the same size.

1080
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,061
You can confuse them.

1081
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:55,480
[exhales]

1082
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,113
Where did my suitcase go?

1083
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:05,698
[gasps]

1084
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,711
Why am I up here?

1085
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:20,671
[exhales]

1086
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,216
Damn it.

1087
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,305
[slow music continues playing]

1088
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:42,777
[exclaims softly]

1089
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,820
[screams]

1090
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,869
[Se-hwan] We spoke yesterday.

1091
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,913
She was going
to the mountains for some air.

1092
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,456
I'm not sure where that would be.

1093
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,628
[Mi-suk] The only mountain Hye-suk
could've gone to is Gajeongsan,

1094
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,380
where we visited the temple last time.

1095
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,548
Dad, it's this way.

1096
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,134
Hello.

1097
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,514
I'm sorry,
but did you see this person here?

1098
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,394
Yes, I saw her earlier.

1099
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,396
She came alone.

1100
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,605
Where did you see her?

1101
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,568
She sat over there for a long time.

1102
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,947
-[Gyeong-jong] Thank you.
-Thank you.

1103
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:38,040
She saw her earlier,
so I think she's already left.

1104
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,501
[sighs wearily]

1105
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,086
Let's go.

1106
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,216
Mom wrote this.

1107
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,928
It's her handwriting.

1108
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,513
[serious music playing]

1109
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,406
To be honest, I'm a Catholic.

1110
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,411
But since Buddha has
great compassion and mercy,

1111
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,498
could you please grant my wish?

1112
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,713
Please don't let me forget
my husband and son.

1113
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,013
PLEASE DON'T LET ME FORGET
MY HUSBAND AND SON

1114
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:53,240
Mr. Choi, I think she already left,
so don't worry.

1115
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,370
Hey, Choisseung.

1116
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:01,207
When we make it down, let's search
restaurants, hotels, and other terminals.

1117
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,833
Okay.

1118
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,345
Dad, this is Mom's shoe.

1119
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,429
[Gyeong-jong] What?

1120
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,558
Are you sure?

1121
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,726
I'm sure.

1122
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,938
Do you think something happened to her?

1123
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,691
We should look in this area.

1124
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,943
But it leads to a cliff down there.

1125
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,486
And it's getting dark.

1126
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:32,697
-I'll go down.
-I'll go.

1127
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,616
If there's an emergency,
I'd be better prepared than you.

1128
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,827
Then, let's go down together.

1129
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,537
No, I'll make my way down from the top.

1130
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,289
You two come up
through the hiking trail.

1131
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:44,709
[breathes deeply]

1132
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,795
Seung-hyo, I promise

1133
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:49,964
I'll find your mom.

1134
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,216
Be careful.

1135
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:55,803
[tense music playing]

1136
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,266
Let's go look for her.

1137
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,232
Hey, be careful!

1138
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,861
Sorry.

1139
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,738
This won't do.

1140
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,990
You're being too hasty.
You could get really hurt.

1141
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,617
Grab my hand, and let's go slow.

1142
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,580
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

1143
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,499
She's the smartest member of Lavender.

1144
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,585
Right.

1145
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:28,669
[Seok-ryu] Let's go.

1146
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,005
Let's find your mom.

1147
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,266
Hye-suk!

1148
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:44,977
Hye-suk!

1149
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,104
Hye-suk!

1150
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,690
Hye-suk!

1151
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,986
Hye-suk? Hye-suk!

1152
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,363
Hye-suk!

1153
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,000
-[Hye-suk groans softly]
-[Gyeong-jong grunts]

1154
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,046
Hye-suk, wake up.

1155
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,340
Hye-suk.

1156
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,054
Are you awake?

1157
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,139
Honey.

1158
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,182
Can you hear me?

1159
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:25,601
[weakly] Yeah.

1160
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:30,022
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1161
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,526
Are you hurt? Were you hurt anywhere?

1162
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,445
[exclaiming in pain]

1163
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:39,782
My leg.

1164
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,452
I sprained my ankle.

1165
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,539
It started to get dark,
and no one was around.

1166
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,792
I wanted to call for help,
but I didn't have my phone.

1167
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,377
Why did you come here alone?

1168
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,757
-[crying]
-Why didn't you tell me anything?

1169
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,136
Why did you lie about getting reassigned?

1170
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:07,810
I thought it'd put your mind at ease.

1171
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,687
No.

1172
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,107
No, that's a lie.

1173
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,191
[sniffles]

1174
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,695
I wanted to protect my pride.

1175
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,281
I didn't want to be abandoned.

1176
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,283
Why would I abandon you?

1177
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,911
I knew you weren't in love
with me anymore,

1178
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,165
but I wanted to hold on
to even just your shadow.

1179
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,418
I've spent decades watching you leave.

1180
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,629
That's not true.

1181
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,507
Every time I went to you,
you kept moving further away.

1182
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,760
I was the one
always shuffling towards you.

1183
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,472
I missed you.

1184
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,143
When you were in France,

1185
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,854
when you were in Africa,

1186
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,982
when you were at home in Korea,

1187
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,650
I always missed you.

1188
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:57,735
[chuckles softly]

1189
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,577
Why could we never say things like this?

1190
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,413
How did we end up here?

1191
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:11,415
Goodness.

1192
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,046
[Hye-suk sobbing]

1193
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,675
-[sniffles]
-[Seung-hyo] Mom!

1194
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,885
Dad!

1195
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:23,802
Seung-hyo!

1196
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,805
[Seok-ryu] Mr. Choi! Aunt Hye-suk!

1197
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,725
-[Hye-suk] Seok-ryu.
-Are you okay?

1198
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,894
You came too.

1199
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,147
Seung-hyo, it's okay. [chuckles softly]

1200
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:38,525
I'm not that hurt. I'm sorry.

1201
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,361
-Did I scare you?
-[exhales]

1202
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:41,445
[Hye-suk] Seung-hyo.

1203
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,531
[voice shaking] Why are you
doing this to me?

1204
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,409
The divorce.

1205
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,955
Deciding to leave
without even consulting me…

1206
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,833
Why won't you two ask me?

1207
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:57,628
Why?

1208
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,548
Why don't you care about how I feel?

1209
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:10,391
I'd beg Santa Claus every Christmas.

1210
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,644
[whimpering]

1211
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,396
"I won't cry."

1212
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,605
[slow music playing]

1213
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,232
"I'll be good."

1214
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:24,738
"So…"

1215
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:27,783
"So please give me back my mom."

1216
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:30,995
[exclaims]

1217
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:32,997
[Seung-hyo] "So…

1218
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,626
please let me have
a meal with my mom and dad."

1219
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,381
Do you… [breath trembling]

1220
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,761
Do you know how hard I tried
to be a good kid?

1221
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:52,057
But I'm an adult now.

1222
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,770
I don't even want to care
about stuff like that!

1223
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,773
But…

1224
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,694
when I see you two,

1225
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,324
I still go back
to that day when I was seven.

1226
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,160
[breath trembling]

1227
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,288
I've spent my whole life stuck there.

1228
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:20,419
Even though I've grown up,
like a fool…

1229
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:26,050
I still…

1230
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,015
want to share a meal with my mom and dad.

1231
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,271
[in normal voice] I'm sorry.

1232
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,315
I'm sorry, Seung-hyo.

1233
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,027
[Hye-suk] Seung-hyo.

1234
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,780
I'm so sorry.

1235
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:52,201
I thought you hated me.

1236
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,412
I can't just live as a mom.

1237
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,039

01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,044
[Hye-suk exclaims]

1239
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,256

1241
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:17,726
[voice shaking] Seung-hyo.

1242
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,522
I'm really sorry.

1243
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:28,112
I must've lost my mind earlier.
I didn't mean it.

1244
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:29,613
I'm sorry.

1245
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,365
I'm sorry, Seung-hyo.

1246
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,992
[whimpering]

1247
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,622
I love you.

1248
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:41,625
I love you so much.

1249
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,837
I've made so many mistakes.

1250
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,672
You were always…

1251
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,426
so much more comfortable
around Mi-suk than me.

1252
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,595
You're right.

1253
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,181
I am more comfortable with her.

1254
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,309
But still…

1255
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:01,562
Even still…

1256
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:06,984
I always…

1257
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:11,697
[whimpering]

1258
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,450
I always missed you.

1262
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,257
[continues sobbing]

1263
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,388
Let's go home, Mom.

1264
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,853
I still need you.

1265
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,271
[Hye-suk sobbing]

1266
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:56,492
Seung-hyo, I'm so sorry.

1267
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,787
I made you feel so lonely, didn't I?

1268
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:03,123
I'm so sorry.

1269
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,420
But I love you so much.

1270
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,464
[sobbing]

1271
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:13,884
[Hye-suk] Don't cry, Seung-hyo.

1272
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,388
I won't leave you alone again.

1273
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,266
I love you so much. I'm sorry.

1274
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:24,394
[both sobbing]

[pleasant music playing]

1276
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:41,537
[Seung-hyo] Dad, are you okay?
I'll carry her.

1277
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,621
[Hye-suk] Yeah.

1278
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,082
She's my wife.

1279
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:46,333
I'll carry her.

1280
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,797
[whispering] Take a hint
and stay out of it.

1281
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:53,757
I see.

1282
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,011
[in normal voice] Aren't I heavy?

1283
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:00,556
Not at all.

1284
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,267
You're as light as a feather.

1285
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,019
-No, you're as light as air.
-[chuckles]

1286
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,398
[Hye-suk] Stop it.

1287
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,067
I've thought about this for a while,

1288
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,444
but they really suit each other.

1289
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:24,913
Did you call?

1290
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,415
No, they're coming now.

1291
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,708
-There they come!
-Where?

1292
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:28,875
[In-suk] Hye-suk!

1293
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,502
[Mi-suk] My goodness! You brat!

1294
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,129
-[Hye-suk] Wait.
-[Mi-suk] Hey!

1295
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:33,505
Do you know how worried we were?

1296
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,924
[Jae-suk] Gosh, we thought
something had happened!

1297
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,510
[In-suk] Hey, drink this first!

1298
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,263
This medicine is the best
for calming nerves.

1299
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,098
Stop it!

1300
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:44,933
Why are you all out here this late?

1301
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,602
Don't cause a fuss. Go home.

1302
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,061
Goodness.

1303
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,731
-Hey. You really want us to leave?
-Yeah.

1304
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,774
We don't even get an emotional hug?

1305
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,443
Forget it. I'm hot and sticky.

1306
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,652
I need to take a shower.

1307
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,696
-Honey, help me.
-Okay.

1308
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,032
Thank you for today. Get home safely.

1309
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,158
[all] Good night.

1310
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,075
My goodness.

1311
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,535
-Thanks. Go home.
-Hye-suk!

[playful music playing]

1313
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,413
Hey, come here. Let's shake hands.

1314
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:08,832
Come on. Hey!

1315
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:10,417
Look at that snob.
She's totally fine.

1316
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,169
Lavender, let's call it a night.

1317
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,962
-[In-suk] Really?
-Also, you drink that.

1318
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,256
-You need to calm down more. Go!
-[In-suk] I will.

1319
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,467
[Mi-suk] Seok-ryu, Seung-hyo. Great job.

1320
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,302
[Hye-suk exclaiming in pain]

1321
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,183
It seems simply like a sprain,

1322
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:29,144
but let's go to the hospital tomorrow
for an x-ray.

1323
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,729
Okay.

1324
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:35,275
Also, let's get a brain MRI soon too.

1325
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,614
I heard about what's been going on
with you.

1326
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,951
You didn't tell Seung-hyo yet, right?

1327
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:46,536
No.

1328
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:48,789
It's probably nothing.

1329
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,708
It'll be just to check things out.
Don't be scared.

1330

[exhales]

1331
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,838
Even if you're not okay,

1332
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,049
I'll stay by your side.

[pleasant music playing]

1337
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,228
We made a vow.

1338
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,275
I've forgotten those vows for too long.

1339
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,611
You can just start now.

1340
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:25,033
You must be exhausted from today.
Take a shower and rest.

1341
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,119
You too.

1342
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:30,539
Wait.

1345
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,922
Wait a second. [groans softly]

1346
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:40,841
[Gyeong-jong] Do you…

1347
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,177
want me to take you to the bathroom?

1349
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:50,809
Could you?

Here.

1353
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:20,172
-[Seok-ryu] What's that in your hand?
-A recorder.

1354
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,466
You'll attract snakes
if you play that at night.

1355
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:23,925
I'm not going to play it.

1356
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,846
I have to create a model,
so I'm analyzing its structure.

1357
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:32,184
When we took those apart as kids,
a bunch of spit would come out.

Sorry.

1359
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,941
I have a business trip tomorrow.
I won't be home.

-Where are you going?
-Gangwon Province.

1362
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,821
When will you be back?

1363
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,198
After about two weeks.

1364
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,950
Why is it so long?

It's not overseas.
Who goes on a business trip for two weeks?

It's an important project.

[quirky music playing]

1369
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:03,298
I mean, that's if you're really bored
with nothing to do.

1370
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,009
I don't think that'll happen.

1371
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,389
Have a good trip.

1372
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,058

[teacher] To prepare mussels,

1380
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:55,559
you need to cut and remove
the beard on the inside with scissors.

1381
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,686
Then, we're going to blanch them.

1382
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,771
Make sure not to cook them for too long.

1383
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:00,689

It's not fun hanging out by myself.

Think of the mouthpiece
as the entrance to the building.

[Na-yun] It'll be made from logs.

through the gaps, it'll create sounds.

[continues speaking French]

1410
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:49,774
[in Korean] What on earth is he saying?

1411
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,112
I know!

1412
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,585
[Seung-hyo speaking French]

1413
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,764
THAT MILK EXPIRES TODAY

01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,557
[pleasant music playing]

1415
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,854
BUT MY FEELINGS FOR YOU
WON'T SPOIL TOMORROW OR THE DAY AFTER

01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,370
Mr. Yoon, it's me.

1429
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,372
Do you know
where Seung-hyo is by any chance?

1430
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:31,960
[music ends]

1431

01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:46,182
Seok-ryu?

1437
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,309
Why won't you answer your phone?

1438
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,936
[pleasant music playing]

1439
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:52,147
Ah, I had it on silent.

1440
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,024
But what brings you here?

1441
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:57,318
I was bored.

1442
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:58,653
[breathing heavily]

1443
01:25:58,736 --> 01:25:59,946
You said I could come.

1444
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:01,906
[chuckles softly]

1445
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:04,033
Were you bored?

1446
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:05,910
Yeah.

1447
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:10,707
Without you, time seems to drag on.

1448
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:11,916
[breeze blowing]

1449
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,216
Without you, comic books aren't fun.

1450
01:26:22,051 --> 01:26:24,137
Without you, the playground is quiet too.

1451
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,059
Without you, every day feels bland.

1452
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:34,564
It's like eating unseasoned soup
or dumplings without soy sauce.

1453
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:41,654
Without you, it's like not drinking
banana milk after going to the bathhouse.

1454
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:50,121
So I was wondering.
You want to go drink banana milk with me?

1455
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:52,749
[laughs]

1456
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:55,919
You still think about food
in this kind of situation?

1459
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,742
[breeze blowing]

1460
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,558
I don't think I need
that banana milk anymore.

1461
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:27,343
BELATED

1462
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:33,016
BELATED REALIZATION

1463
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:35,018
