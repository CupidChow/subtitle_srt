-[Geun-sik] Okay, thank you for waiting.
-[Hye-suk] My goodness.

4
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,318
I made some doenjang stew with clams,

5
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,071
-but I'm not sure how it'll taste.
-[both gasp]

6
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,948
-It looks so good.
-I feel bad we're always eating for free.

00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,784
Let's grab a drink later.

8
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,202
Well, you're retired now,

9
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,370
so you should sleep in and relax at home.

10
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,874
From now on, he insists
on cooking at least one meal a day.

He's looking for a way to survive.

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,545
Can't you say things in a nicer way?

13
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,881
My wife's been through a lot,

14
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,091
so I should take good care of her now.

15
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,426
Goodness.

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,262
Why do men act like they come
to their senses when they get old?

17
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,473
He must be scared you'll leave him behind.

18
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,933
[Geun-sik] I'm terrified.

19
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,519
Aunt Mi-suk, I'll never do that.

20
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,437
I'm ready to prostrate myself right now.

21
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,689
Hey, that's something
you should do quietly.

22
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,484
You can't fawn like that
in the presence of your mom.

-Yeah?
-I want some soy braised beef.

33
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,717
Go ahead. It's right near you.

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,262
You're closer than I am.
What are your hands for?

35
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,931
-Is this for me? [groans]
-I use them for this.

36
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,517
Do you have hooks for hands?
That hurts so much!

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,228
It's supposed to hurt.
You think it's supposed to tickle?

[Seok-ryu] Why are you so busy lately?
We haven't had a date in days.

42
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,917
I mean, I just have too much work.

43
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,424
Can you wait just one more week for me?

44
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,093
One week is too long.

45
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,847
One week's going to feel
like a thousand years for me.

00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,434
Did you use my razor…

My eyes! Mom, Dad!
They're doing weird stuff in her room!

49
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,522
Hey, Dong-jin. It's not…

50
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,523
It's not weird stuff.

51
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,736
We legitimately have official approval
from both families now, so get lost.

52
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,070
I can't approve of this.

53
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,947
Seung-hyo,
it's not too late to rethink this.

54
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,158
Who are you to decide if we can or can't?

55
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,118
She's totally like Bigfoot.

56

She keeps stealing my razor.

57

Have you lost your mind? I'll kill you!

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,956
I'm telling you for your own good.

-I don't care.

00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,755
What?

63
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:38,843
I don't care if Seok-ryu
is Bigfoot or an alien.

65
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,639
I've heard this line before.

That's right.
You must've really enjoyed Coffee Prince!

67
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,188
Seung-hyo, get a grip.
That's a TV show, and this is real life.

68
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,191

is coming up soon, right?

-What a waste.

00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,908
Okay. I'll call you
my brother-in-law from now on.

72

Sure thing, my brother-in-law.

73
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,203
On second thought, this…

74
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,539
I mean, my sister
isn't that much of a mess.

75
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,085
Even if you put lipstick on a pig,
it doesn't look so bad, you know.

76
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,002
-Get out.
-My razor…

77
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,755
-I told you I didn't use it!
-[Dong-jin] But the hair…

I swear it wasn't me.

I swear I didn't use it!

Not great.

I'll reschedule for next month
and definitely come then.

Ms. Jung won't be around by then.

Why won't she be around?

What was it? Safety officer?

You didn't tell me you were coming.

I wanted to give you a ride home
right when you got off work.

You weren't joking
about the Wolmido Island amusement rides.

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,226
Well, if you don't like this,
how about the pirate ship ride?

118
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,852
I'll stick with this one.

-Let's go.
-No, it's this way.

120

Okay, let's go.

I'm worried about my hips,
shoulders, and knees…

Won't my glasses fly off?

126
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,163
Oh. Come to think of it,
I've never seen you without glasses.

127
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,124
I'm extremely nearsighted.

Even with glasses on,
my vision isn't good.

Then, you can't see me now?

130

I can see you, Mo-eum.

I won't interfere in their affairs at all.

175
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,921
[Mi-suk] Same here.

176
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,006
Hey, let's have the wedding next spring.

177
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,926
Maybe mid-May
with nice weather and flowers?

178
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,346
Why? Strike while the iron's hot.
Just do it before the year's end.

179
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,139
That's not enough time to prepare.

180
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,101
It'll be quick with a wedding planner.
Let's hold it at a hotel.

181
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,185
Are you crazy?

182
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,729
Meals at hotels are expensive!

183
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,856
We can't afford that.

184
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,026
How about a small wedding then?

185
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
A cozy gathering with those close to us.

186
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,071
We can't do that!

187
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,365
We've given so much money.
We need to receive ours.

188
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,076
You don't want this or that!
What do you want me to do then?

189
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,869
-Let's talk about it!
-[Hye-suk] Come on!

190
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,330
What are you doing in front of Yeon-du?

191
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,665
[Jae-suk] Jeez.

192
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,960
Yeon-du, make sure
you get along with your friends.

193
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,795
Don't fight like these two, okay?

194
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,715
Okay.

195
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,592
[In-suk] At least
there's a lesson in this.

196
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,176
We're actually very close.

197
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,553
We're just talking.

200
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,690
[Na-yun] Hello.

201
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,692
Hello.

202
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,652
Are you studying?

203
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,946
My exam is coming up soon.

204
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,072
Oh.

205
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,782
I see.

206
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,369
Right. I'm thinking of signing up
for personal training sessions.

207
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,871
Who should I ask about that?

208
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,083
Mr. Go, our client wants
a consultation for personal training.

209
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,501
Hello, Na-yun.

210
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,711
-Come this way.
-Okay.

211
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,671
Have you received
personal training before?

212
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,215
-Briefly in the past once.

Wait.

Hey, Mo-eum.

223
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,439
I'm outside right now. Why?

224
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,024
What?

225
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,151
Really?

226
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,864
Congratulations, Mo-eum!

227
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,950
What's this?
Are you a peddler or something?

228
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,203
I'm here to celebrate.

229
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,996
You're leaving for the South Pole,

230
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,748
so how could I come empty-handed?

231
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,627
I prepared some things
with a bit of color.

[Mo-eum chuckles softly]

233
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,677
Hey, when did you find out
you were going to the South Pole? Today?

234
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,554
No, last week.

235
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,640
What? Why are you only
telling me this today?

236
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,308
You weren't itching to tell us?

237
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,227
I would've hung a banner
in the street myself.

238
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,729
Look at this. Isn't it so cute?

239
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,856
[Mo-eum] Should I do that?

240
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,066
Then, Dan-ho would see it too.

00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,193
[exclaims softly]

242
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,363
I can't bring myself to tell him.

Gosh.

246
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,918
I don't get it.
Even with all this sugar,

247
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,462
why isn't my brain working?

248
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:39,091
I don't know
where to even start or what to say.

249
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,677
I think I know.

250
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,678
Really?

251
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,055
Hey, can you tell me then?

252
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,809
"Do it with sincerity."

253
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,436
Is this your revenge?

254
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,729
That's what I told you.

255
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,647
Well, you were right.

256
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,359
For big things,
be honest and straightforward.

257
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,697
Tell him it's something
you really want to do,

258
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,115
so wait just one year.

259
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,746
Jeez.

260
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,918
I wonder how he'll feel
after hearing that.

261
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,006
Was this how Seung-hyo felt
when I went to study abroad?

What do you mean?
I'm sleeping over.

267
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,435
Jeez, just sleep at your own house.

268
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,229
Why are you sending me away?

269
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,648
I want to comfortably sleep
alone in my own bed.

270
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,734
It's more comfortable if I leave?

271
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,694
Seriously?

272
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,488
Yeah, seriously.

273
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,532
Okay, then.

274
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,117
I'll leave.

275
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,203
But this doesn't count.

276
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,038
To me, this isn't a farewell party.

277
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,916
We'll do this again.
I'll throw a huge feast for you.

-Okay.
-I mean it.

I'll make it more extravagant.

-Just you wait.
-Okay. Just go.

-[Seok-ryu] Okay? This doesn't count.
-I got it.

Slow down. You're going to fall.

291
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,749
I wanted to see you a second sooner.

292
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,834
Me too.

293
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,628
Just so I could have more time to see you,

294
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,505
I worked like crazy today.

295
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:42,965
Hurry and praise me.

296
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,052
-You worked so hard. You did great.
-[chuckles softly]

297
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,471
Let's go.

298
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,016
Did you have dinner?

299
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,434
[Seung-hyo] No, not yet.

300
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,603
Want to grab some udon on the way home?

301
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,939
[Seok-ryu] I'd love that.
I feel queasy after eating half a cake.

302
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,316
[Seung-hyo] Cake? Why?

303
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,276
Mo-eum was picked for the South Pole.

304
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,320
-Really?
-[Seok-ryu] Yeah.

305
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,156
[Seung-hyo] Wow, Mo-eum really
follows through on what she says.

306
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,574
[Seok-ryu] She's no joke.

307
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,159
[Seung-hyo] She's so strong-willed.

308
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,709
[Mi-suk] You suddenly told me
to come over.

309
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,337
Was it to show off this bracken?

310
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,838
No.

311
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,798
You promised to teach me how to cook.

312
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,259
-You were serious?
-Of course.

313
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,346
Look. I got dressed
to be fully prepared for this.

314
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,764
Look. Do you see?

315
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,058
Well, I don't think this is a real apron.

316
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,602
Did you go
to the department store to buy this?

317
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,603
[chuckles] Yeah.

318
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,063
Come on. Teach me.

319
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,898
-Quickly.
-Wait. Hey.

320
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,815
[Hye-suk] What?

321
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,861
I will teach you how to cook.

322
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,946
Right.

323
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,282
So teach me something too.

324
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,784
Teach you what?

325
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,119
English.

326
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,706
English? Why all of a sudden?

327
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,127
Well, I don't know when it'll be,
but I want to travel abroad.

328
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,837
I want to try ordering food

329
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,632
and chat with locals in foreign countries.

330
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,801
Okay.

331
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,803
Then, let's be fair
and teach each other.

332
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,098
I'll save on academy fees.

333
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,599
Come here quick.

334
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,518
What should I do? Where do I start?

335
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,019
We need to soak this.

336
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,106
You have to soak
dried bracken a day in advance.

337
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,607
But if you don't have time,

338
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,735
you can boil it in the rice cooker.

339
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,028
I see.

340
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,740
What are you doing? Press the button.

341
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,159
Right. I'll do it. Okay.

342
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,245
[automated voice] Brown rice,
nutritional porridge.

343
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,540
-White… Quick cook.
-What? What do I do?

344
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,624
What's happening?

345
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,084
-Hey.
-[groans softly]

346
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,795
You've never used
this rice cooker before?

[quirky music playing]

348
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,507
I just got it recently.
It's totally brand new.

350
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,890

-Hey, that's scary and dangerous!

351
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,142
You're taking forever.

352
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,271
You've had green onions before.
Cut it right down the middle.

353
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,564
Look at me.

354
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,567
I can chop it without looking
or even while looking at you.

355
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,113
[scoffs]

356
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,576
[door opens]

357
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,624
Close the book.

358
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,169
We don't need any of this.

359
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,879
Then, how are we going to study?

360
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,255
Let's jump right into action.

361
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,757
Conversation is key in English.

362
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,551
Converse… What?

363
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,595
Conversation and speaking.

364
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,346
Conversation.

365
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,766
It's been so long
I've forgotten all the words.

366
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,934
You're right. I just need to communicate.

367
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,062
Then, what should we talk about first?

368
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,981
Okay. What are you
going to do in the afternoon?

369
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,983
I'm going to go to the supermarket.

370
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,652
[in English]
What are you going to do in the afternoon?

371
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,696
What are you going to do…

372
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,614
In the…

373
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,033
[in Korean]
Noon… Can you repeat the last part slowly?

374
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,411
[in English]
What are you going to do in the afternoon?

375
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,663
What are you going to do in the afternoon?

376
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,415
[in Korean] It's not "the." It's "the."

377
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,000
With a few exceptions,

378
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,795
the definite article
is pronounced as "the" before vowels.

379
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,548
-[in English] In the afternoon. "The."
-[Mi-suk exclaims]

380
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,842
[in Korean] Right. I knew that. [chuckles]

381
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,594
It's been so long I've forgotten it all.

382
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,263
All right, then.
"I'm going to go to the supermarket."

383
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,391
[in English]
I'm going to go to the supermarket.

384
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,935
[in Korean] That's easy.

385
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,562
I used to memorize
old comprehension books well.

386
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,023
[in English]
I'm going to go to the supermarket!

387
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,442
No, not "super." It's '"super."

388
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,611
[in Korean]
Don't twist your tongue like a pretzel.

389
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,905
Just keep it straightforward. "Super."

390
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,200
[in English] Super.

391
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:39,952
Super.

392
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,496
[in Korean] Super. You can't do it?

393
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,289
[in English] Super.

394
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,627
[in Korean] I don't want to go anymore.

395
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,505
Our wives are over at your house.

396
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,506
And we're here.

397
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,050
This grouping worked out
pretty well. [chuckles]

398
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,010
Let's do this regularly.

399
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:57,970
[chuckles]

400
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,347
I felt like I'd been leeching off of you,

401
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,516
so I brought something.

402
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,309
My goodness!

403
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,561
Wow! It's blinding!

404
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,521
[chuckling] It's brilliant! My gosh!

405
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,565
Wow, this is…

406
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,985
Gosh, the bottle itself looks so fancy.

407
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,488
It screams, "I'm expensive!" [laughs]

408
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,073
But…

409
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,826
We only have soju and beer glasses here.

410
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,619
We can just use regular cups.

411
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,204
-[Geun-sik] Hold on.
-Like those ones.

412
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,915
[Geun-sik] Well, these are
the prettiest cups we have.

413
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,125
[both laughing]

414
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,254
All right. And this too.

415
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,715
Isn't that a camera bag?

416
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,634
[Gyeong-jong] It's not new,
just something I've had.

417
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,469
But it should be easy to use.

418
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,975
Giving two things at once?
That's not fair.

419
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,435
And isn't the camera

420
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,395
way more expensive than this alcohol?

421
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,564
You said you wanted to learn photography.

422
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,357
You can't go into battle without a weapon.

423
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,902
Well, if you put it that way,
thank you very much.

424
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,570
[laughs boisterously]

425
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,779
Then, should we…

426
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,366
-[drunkenly] Wow, that's great!
-[camera shutter clicks]

427
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,911
[camera shutter clicking]

428
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,871
You must've done this a lot before.

429
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,873
Okay. All right.

430
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,041
I think I'm done.

431
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,751
I think I have a knack for this.

432
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,377
Again!

433
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,504
You need to have it properly leveled.

434
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,839
[camera shutter clicks]

435
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,884
Look. How about this?

436
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,345
The subject is tilted! Do it again!

437
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,014
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Here.

438
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,601
-All set?
-You can't cut it off at the knees.

439
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,354
-What?
-The legs look short! Again!

440
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,147
[camera shutter clicking]

441
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,232
Okay.

442
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,442
Look at this!

443
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,736
The proportions are all wrong!

444
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,073
Instead of centering it,
put it slightly off to the side.

445
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,242
To make them look tall and slender,

446
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,036
bend down and lower your point of view!

447
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,913
You take pictures like this?

448
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,706
Lower! Get down more!

449
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,418
Think of it like boot camp!
Didn't you serve in the military?

450
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,296
I did! I was a defense serviceman.

451
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,340
-Stick to the floor!
-[groans]

452
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,342
[Gyeong-jong] Become one with the camera!

453
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,970
-[groans] Hey, this is…
-[Gyeong-jong] Stick to the floor!

454
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,639
-[Geun-sik] Please let me go!
-[Gyeong-jong] Stop whining!

455
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,640
One, two…

456
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,724
[doorbell rings]

457
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,777
[Mo-eum groans]

458
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,113
Hi, Mo-eum.

459
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,490
I stopped by before work.

460
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,492
This is a gift for you.

461
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,827
Come on in.

462
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,413
[Mo-eum] How did you know it was me?

463
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,624
You're the only one who visits us.

464
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,463
-It's a T-shirt.
-Yeah.

465
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,923
I told you I'd get you one.

466
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,761
Am I still not allowed
to wear the mudflat shirt?

467
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,305
Of course not!

468
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,557
You look the best when you wear that.

469
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,106
I don't look bad in other clothes either.

470
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,651
I can't help it.
Mudflat Man is my first love.

471
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,071
My first love was actually Spider-Man.

472
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:09,870
And then, there's Iron Man, Hulk,
Thor, and Captain whatever.

473
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,875
The competition is so tough,
it makes me lose my fighting spirit.

474
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,878
But my favorite is Mudflat Man.

475
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,421
Try it on and see if it fits.

476
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,505
Okay.

477
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,801
Couple T-shirts?

478
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,178
Oh.

479
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,221
Well, you're half right.

480
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,599
Check underneath.

481
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,188
Ta-da! This one…

482
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,148
[mellow music playing]

483
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,110
This is for Yeon-du. [chuckles]

484
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,696
And this is for my mom.

485
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,616
Matching group shirts.

486
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,368
No. They're matching family shirts.

487
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,794
I have something for you too.

488
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,920
What?

489
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,216
[gasps]

490
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,051
What? Why is there so much?

491
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:08,970
Huh?

492
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,187
[Dan-ho] They say the temperature
at the South Pole

493
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,064
drops to minus 25 degrees in the winter.

494
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,443
Put all of these on,

495
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,656
stay warm, and have a safe trip.

496
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,868
Um…

497
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,749
Dan-ho, how did you find out?

498
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,170
When I went to pick you up last time,

499
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,047
I heard it from your colleagues.

500
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,633
[sighs]

501
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,595
I…

502
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,977
I'm sorry for not telling you.

503
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,187
You should be, Mo-eum.

504
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,190
You thought of me as someone too selfish.

505
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,067
I'm…

506
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,529
I'm not some pathetic guy who holds back

507
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,072
his successful girlfriend.

508
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,283
No, it's not like that.

509
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,704
We just recently confirmed
our feelings for each other.

510
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,623
I was worried it would be too sudden.

511
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,837
I also don't know
how to break it to Yeon-du.

512
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,679
Mo-eum.

513
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,848
I heard everything.

514
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,808
Yeon-du.

515
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,857
Send me pictures of emperor penguins
when you go to the South Pole.

516
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,028
Emperor penguins?

517
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:52,157
Yes. While emperor penguin mothers
go off to find food,

518
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,951
the fathers keep
the eggs warm until they hatch.

519
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,997
Just like my dad.

520
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,835
We'll patiently wait for you.

521
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,385
Come here, Yeon-du.

522
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,305
All right.

523
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,808
I'll be sure…

524
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,395
to come back in style
with plenty of snacks.

525
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,023
Bring back lots of snacks.

526
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,275
Got it.

527
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,989
-[exclaims softly]
-[Yeon-du] What?

528
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,199
Thank you…

529
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,368
for coming into my life.

530
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,704
For coming into our lives.

531
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,791
-[laughing]
-I can't breathe, Mo-eum.

532
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,043
[laughing] I can't breathe!

533
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,337
LENTIL VEGGIE SOUP FOR VEGANS

534
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,256
[notification chimes]

535
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,141
LOTUS LEAF WRAPPED RICE

536
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:06,022
[lady] I hadn't been feeling well lately
and was looking for healthy food.

537
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,692
-I'll give it a try.
-[Seok-ryu] Thank you for watching.

538
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,444
I hope you enjoy
a healthy and delicious meal.

539
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,071
[pleasant music playing]

540
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,741
[man] The instructions were made
so easy to follow.

541
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,785
The eggplant pizza was really good.

542
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,290
[Seok-ryu] I'm glad you found it helpful.

543
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,919
You can try it with zucchini
or potatoes instead as well.

544
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,633
STIR-FRIED TOMATO AND ACORN JELLY

545
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,431
[lady] I'm sick, and I saw your video
while searching for healthy food.

546
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,182
It looks so good.

547
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,060
But I don't have the energy to cook,
so I can't make it.

548
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,062
It'd be nice if I could try your food.

549
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:47,939
[window opens]

550
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,612
Choisseung.

551
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,823
-Want to go out?
-Okay.

552
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,784
-I'll get ready.
-[closes window]

553
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,912
[pleasant music playing]

554
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,083
Choisseung!

555
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,252
[both laughing]

556
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,590
Are you done with your work?
Can you be out during the day?

557
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,507
Yeah.

558
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,303
Should we take a walk
around the neighborhood like old times?

559
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,387
Sure.

560
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,905
[both laughing]

561
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,840
Remember this spot?
It used to be a stationery store.

562
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,175
Of course.

563
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,969
There was a capsule toy
vending machine here.

564
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,514
And all the junk food
was laid out on the stand there.

565
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,726
Every time I got some money,
I'd spend it all here.

566
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,397
It was mostly from my piggy bank.

567
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,357
I was mostly like that.

568
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,025
Let's go, my baby!

569
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,903
[Seok-ryu] My baby!

570
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,615
Call me that one more time,
and you're dead.

571
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,327
[Seok-ryu] Hey, baby!
Let's go to sing karaoke!

572
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,496
Hey! I told you not to call me that.

573
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,499
Come on, let's go!

574
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,251
I'll let you sing the entire bonus time.

575
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,335
Forget it.

576
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,921
You always pick duet songs anyway.

577
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,006
I'm for real this time.

578
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,341
[Seung-hyo] I don't want to.

579
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,052
I'm scared someone might see us
go into a room together alone.

580
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,556
I can't let any more misunderstandings
ruin my life.

581
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,142
You little jerk.

582
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,394
You treat me like I'm contaminated.

583
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,395
[groans]

584
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,896
-My goodness!
-Get back here.

585
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,690
-What's with you? [chuckles]
-Come here!

586
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,691
Stop right there.

587
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,818
-Hey!
-No!

588
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,570
[Seok-ryu] Come on!

589
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,038
Oh.

590
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,707
They must be finished with renovations.

591
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,709
I guess so.

592
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,046
I wonder what will come in.

593
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:18,923
Want to go inside?

594
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,217
What?

595
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,272
Hey, are we allowed
to just walk in like this?

596
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,447
[pleasant music playing]

597
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,746
I wanted to hate whatever came
in place of my dad's store.

598
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,540
But it turned out great.

599
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,755
I guess the new business
will be a restaurant too.

600
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,133
[gasps]

601
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,056
The kitchen looks so cozy and cute.

602
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,977
-Take a look inside.
-No way. it's someone else's kitchen.

603
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,104
Who cares? It's only a quick look.

604
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,565
-You think so?
-[Seung-hyo] Yeah.

605
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,026
Excuse me.

606
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,580
It's your kitchen.

607
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,082
What?

608
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,503
This…

609
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,338
is your shop.

610
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,219
What?

611
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,391
Hello?

612
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,810
-Oh.
-[Geun-sik] Oh.

613
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,520
-Uncle Geun-sik!
-Hey, Seung-hyo.

614
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,897
You were busy.

615
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,440
Am I disturbing you?

616
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,276
Of course not. Come in.

617
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,944
[chuckles]

618
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,239
Wow, Seung-hyo! This is…

619
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,285
I don't think I've ever been here before.

620
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,203
Feel free to look around.

621
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,288
Okay.

622
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,791
Wow, this place is amazing.

623
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,628
Is there something you need though?

624
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,880
Well…

625
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,384
Seung-hyo.

626
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,055
I have a favor to ask of you.

627
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,354
You want to renovate Root Diner?

628
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,481
Yeah.

629
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:45,653
I want to open a restaurant
for Seok-ryu there.

630
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,908
Uncle Geun-sik…

631
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,912
I haven't been able to do
anything for Seok-ryu.

632
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:58,291
When I was younger,
I thought by the time I retired,

633
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:02,211
I'd have a pile of money
to pass down to each of my kids.

634
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,173
But still…

635
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,260
I think I can at least
do this one thing for her.

636
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,973
Seok-ryu will be really happy about this.

637
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,391
You think so?

638
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:22,065
Well, we never had many customers,
and it was in a shabby location,

639
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,776
so I wonder if I'm doing the right thing.

640
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,070
She'll love it more than any other spot.

641
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:30,281
She gets to continue what you started
and begin something new.

642
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,407
Really?

643
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,536
So you'll take charge of it?

644
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,955
Of course.

645
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,459
I'll handle it in complete secrecy.

646
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,920
[Geun-sik] Okay.

647
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,506
[pop song playing]

648
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:47,108
So this is why you've been busy lately?
You were secretly preparing all of this?

649
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,234
Yeah.

650
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,279
I couldn't compromise on anything.

651
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:57,243
It's a collaboration between the two men
who love you the most.

652
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,331
Thank you.

653
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,048
Here, you can create dishes
that truly reflect who you are.

654
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,760
And provide comfort and healing to people.

655
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,221
Okay.

656
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,223
[chuckles softly]

657
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,684
You're incredible, Seung-hyo.

658
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,855
You fixed my room,

659
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,191
my heart…

660
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,862
and now, the restaurant.

661
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,950
I haven't even started yet.

662
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,329
From now on, I'm going to create

663
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,456
every space you'll be in.

664
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,835
[Seok-ryu] Wow.

665
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,171
I guess I'm the one who hit the jackpot.

666
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,843
I…

667
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,388
I love this space so much.

668
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,558
What a relief.

669
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,195
[dance song playing in background]

670
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,620
[sighs]

671
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,873
[Seul-gi] Dong-jin.

672
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,167
Your exam's tomorrow, right?

673
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,085
[Dong-jin] Yes.

674
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,670
Have you prepared well?

675
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,921
This is the first time

676
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,757
I've read this book from start to finish.

677
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,927
[exhales] I feel so proud of myself.

678
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,637
You'll pass this time.

679
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,431
Here, take this.

680
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,183
CHAMPION OF KOREA
SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT

681
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,894
What's this? You want me to shine this?

682
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,062
It's for you to keep.

683
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,940
It means…

684
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,609
I officially recognize you
as my apprentice.

685
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,194
Shouldn't you ask me first?

686
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,363
Hang it up in your room with sincerity.

687
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,203
Where am I going to put
this smelly and ugly thing?

688
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,164
Just give me a raise instead.

689
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,042
Gosh, this is really heavy.

690
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,467
It looks good on you.

691
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,802
[pleasant music playing]

692
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,096
What are you talking about?

693
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,057
-Are you here for a session?
-No.

694
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,560
I decided not to sign up.

695
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,020
Why?

696
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,313
Did you not like something?

697
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,190
I decided to sign up later.

698
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,107
Hmm.

699
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,484
Good luck with your exam.

700
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,280
And after you get certified,
be my personal trainer.

701
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,364
What?

702
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,035
Last time during my run,
you seemed to be a good coach.

703
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,289
So I'll be your first client.

704
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,299
That one doesn't work.

705
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,884
Use the one on the left.

706
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,181
That one's broken.

707
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,395
-Have a seat.
-[Dan-ho] Okay.

708
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,481
All right.

709
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,651
I'm so upset.

710
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,238
I wanted to have a feast. A farewell party
at a convenience store's ridiculous.

711
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,032
Hey, I'm upset too.

712
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,743
You won't be back for a long time.

713
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,078
This is so underwhelming.

714
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,955
Gosh, it's fine.

715
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,748
Hey, if we prepared something big,

716
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,333
Seok-ryu would go…

717
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:39,173
♪ Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind? ♪

718
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,050
And she'd obviously cry her eyes out.

719
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,885
Bye, Mo-eum…

720
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,388
[Mo-eum] Stop! Will you look at her?

721
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,557
Hey, Dan-ho.

722
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,269
They had a lot of these today.
Why are you drinking that?

723
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,062
[Dan-ho] Oh.

724
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,439
I wanted to recreate
exactly how it was back then.

725
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,733
It's like our beginnings.

726
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,777
I'm still amazed when I think about it.

727
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,113
We don't have anything in common.

728
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,990
How did we all end up as friends?

729
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,701
I think if our moms weren't friends,

730
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,287
-we would've never been together.
-[Mo-eum] Hmm.

731
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,330
I still liked our group.

732
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,794
It felt like I was flanked
by the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger.

733
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,129
Hey, what are you doing?

734
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,006
Then, what about me?

735
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,508
The Vermillion Bird? The Black Tortoise?

736
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,427
You are…

737
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,264
You're my love.

738
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:29,932
[Dan-ho chuckles softly]

739
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,976
You're my love too.

740
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,520
I love you, Mo-eum.

741
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,688
Hey, let's leave.

742
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,566
I don't think I can sit here
any longer either.

743
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,069
I've watched you two act
like damn idiots for decades.

744
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:42,987
Sit back down.

745
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,157
Yeah, I think I should sit here
since my leg was hurting.

746
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,450
Just wait one year.

747
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,162
We'll get together like this again
and paint the town red.

748
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,663
Cheers!

749
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,248
-Cheers!
-[Seok-ryu] Come back quick.

750
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,834
-[Mo-eum] Got it.
-[Seung-hyo] Yeah, you better come back.

751
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,003
What do you mean?
My boyfriend will misunderstand.

752
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,547
I think that was a bit harsh.

753
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,799
Hey, why are you two ganging up on him?

754
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,135
-My goodness.
-[Dan-ho] We're not, but what he said was…

755
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,941
[pop song playing]

756
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,447
You'd always been unique
since you were a kid.

757
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,158
Now, you'll finally set foot
on the South Pole.

758
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,451
Thanks, Mom.

759
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,120
You never put limits on my dreams,

760
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,580
so I grew up well.

761
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,957
You should be getting married instead.

762
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,417
Why go to that cold place--

763
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,252
Again with the marriage talk!

764
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:41,712
Way to ruin the mood.

765
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,174
When you get there, send me some salt.

766
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,426
In-suk says
Antarctic sea salt is really good.

767
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,552
Seriously.

768
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,096
Yes, ma'am.

769
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,390
I'll give some
to all four Lavender members.

770
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,432
Oh.

771
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,686
Mo-eum, take care.

772
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:03,025
Watch out so you don't get
laryngitis, tonsillitis, or pneumonia.

773
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,026
[Mo-eum] Okay.

774
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,030
Yeon-du, I'll video call you
as soon as I get there.

775
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,657
[chuckles softly]

776
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,244
Call your mother too, you brat.

777
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,286
Of course!

778
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,914
As if I'd forget you, Mom?

779
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,750
I'm not sure if I've said this before,

780
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,835
but come here.

781
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,211
What's gotten into you?

782
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,466
I'm proud of you.

783
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,387
Of course.

784
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,223
I'm your daughter.

785
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,560
[groans softly]

786
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,272
Dan-ho.

787
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,273
[Dan-ho] Yes.

788
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,233
Hurry and take her. She'll be late.

789
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,319
Yes, ma'am.
I'll take her safely to the airport.

790
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,656
Have a good trip.

791
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,701
Yeon-du, let's head inside and eat.

792
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,037
Mo-eum.

793
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,583
Bye.

794
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,251
How can I leave her like this?

795
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,128
-Yeon-du, let's go together.
-Hey.

796
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,838
Go on in.

797
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:06,922
Hurry and take her away.

798
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,597
Should we go now?

799
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,809
Okay!

800
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,480
[exclaims]

801
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,942
-Thank you.
-Please get in.

802
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,625
[Mo-eum] Have I ever told you
how much I like you, Dan-ho?

803
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,542
[Dan-ho] What?

804
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,795
[Mo-eum] I love you as much as
all the glaciers in Antarctica.

805
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,924
[Dan-ho] But the glaciers are melting
because of global warming.

806
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,135
[Mo-eum] That's why I'm going
to the South Pole! So I can stop it!

807
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,721
[Dan-ho] I love you
as much as all the snowflakes

808
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,724
that will fall at the South Pole
while you're there.

809
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,850
[Mo-eum chuckles softly]

810
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,856
I'M CURRENTLY SICK
IT'D BE NICE IF I COULD TRY YOUR FOOD

811
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,447
[Seok-ryu] I'm opening a restaurant soon.

812
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,282
The name of the place is…

813
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,285
Rainbow Kitchen.

814
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,870
[pleasant music playing]

815
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,374
[Seung-hyo] How do you feel?

816
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,085
Your place will open soon.

817
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,878
I can't sleep.

818
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,547
Did you know?

819
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,007
There are over 1,300 stars
on my room's ceiling.

820
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,051
Wow, you counted all of them?

821
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,346
That's insane. It's so you, Seok-ryu.

822
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,058
As the one who stuck each of them on,
you're not exactly ordinary either.

823
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:45,229
My neck got cramps a few times
while sticking those on.

824
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,690
[Mi-suk] I'm here!

825
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,650
I'm here too!

826
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,859
Hello.

827
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,444
-Hey!
-Wow!

828
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,530
Honestly, when I see this place,

829
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,740
it's like Seung-hyo read my mind

830
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,409
and made it exactly how I imagined it.

831
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,994
Dad.

832
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,080
Thank you. I'll really give it my all.

833
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,917
Seok-ryu.

834
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,460
Don't work too hard.

835
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,713
Just enjoy it as you go.

836
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,592
That would probably
be harder to do though.

837
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,176
[both chuckle]

838
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,012
Would you like some coffee?

839
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,681
It's okay. I already had a cup at home.

840
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,849
I'd like one.

841
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,310
Fill it with ice, so it's nice and cold.

842
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,477
Iced coffee, not hot.

843
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,521
-So hot coffee?
-[both laugh]

844
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,772
Iced Americano!

845
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,024
[Mi-suk] Goodness.

846
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,191
[Geun-sik] It's beautiful.

847
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,112
[automated voice] Getting the ice ready.

848
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,667
[Seung-hyo] Here is your coffee.

849
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,672
It's nice and refreshing.

850
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,760
Seok-ryu, are you sure
you'll be okay on your own?

851
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,845
You have to cook, serve,

852
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,221
take bills, clean…

853
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,473
There's so much to do.

854
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,099
I just have to give it a try.

855
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,018
If you need help,
just call your dad.

856
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,645
Right.

857
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,355
Dad, I need to ask you for a favor.

858
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,273
Dad.

859
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,776
Can you be my advisor for Rainbow Kitchen?

860
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,945
You're not going to torture me
with work, are you?

861
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,614
I just need to give advice, right?

862
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,991
Yeah. You have more experience than I do.

863
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,870
I want your know-how on developing
the menu, running a business,

864
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,413
and dealing with risks.

865
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,207
Give me your guidance and support, okay?

866
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,461
Yeah, instead of bugging me while I cook,

867
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,754
get paid to nag her.

868
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,923
Come on, I just retired not too long ago,

869
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,883
and you want to put me to work again?

870
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,427
Don't be like that. Help Seok-ryu out,

871
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,470
Mr. Advisor.

872
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,055
-Mr. Advisor!
-Mr. Advisor!

873
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,392
All right, then.
Because it's not a full-time job.

874
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,310
-He loves it.
-He really does!

875
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,478
Gosh, I'm suddenly thirsty.

876
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,854
Seung-hyo, give me some coffee.

877
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,147
Would you like instant coffee?

878
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,400
What? You think I'd only drink
the instant stuff?

879
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,443
I like Iced Americanos too!

880
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,529
-Iced Americano is the best.
-[Seung-hyo] Okay.

[pleasant music playing]

882
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,708
For a moment,
you resembled Steve Jobs… No.

883
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,168
Mark Zuckerberg.

884
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,504
This is who I really was.

885
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,214
I love seeing this other side of you.

886
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,799
I love it, but…

887
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,261
This isn't a date.
This is burning the midnight oil.

888
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:27,266
[sighs] I have no choice. I need to get
everything ready before the opening.

889
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,644
So this is an app for Rainbow Kitchen?

890
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,312
Yeah, isn't it cool?

891
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,731
Later on, I can take reservations

892
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,150
and custom requests with this.

893
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,569
According to customers' tastes,
preferences,

894
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,071
and most importantly, health conditions,

895
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,615
they'll be able to make
requests or changes to dishes.

896
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,033
My goodness.

897
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,203
A chef who can write code?
I bet no one would see that coming.

898
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,789
I feel pretty proud.

899
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,335
It feels like the life I lived
in the past wasn't in vain.

900
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:59,256
Of course. Every experience you had
on the path you traveled piled up

901
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,883
and made who you are today.

902
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,719
I've lived a pretty good life.

903
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,472
I'm proud of you, Seok-ryu.

904
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:08,807
[chuckles softly]

905
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,061
By the way, you remember
what we're doing tomorrow, right?

906
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,565
Yeah.

907
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,366
[pleasant music playing]

908
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,251
Does it look bad?

909
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,255
Why aren't you saying anything?

910
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,091
I was trying to think of…

911
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,387
the right word to describe it,

912
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,391
but nothing came to mind.

913
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,602
You're just so beautiful.

914
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,397
I better look good! It's so uncomfortable.

915
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,943
It's tight around my waist,
and it's squeezing my chest.

916
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,861
I can't breathe either.
It's so uncomfortable.

917
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,572
Well, with that dress on,

918
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,157
I bet you can't put me in a headlock.

919
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,160
I'll buy you this dress.
Wear it every day.

920
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,537
It'll be expensive.

921
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,247
We'll get our money's worth.

922
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,458
You can wear it at the grocery store
or to the bathhouse…

923
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,544
Choisseung, come here for a second.

924
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,170
Is something wrong?

925
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,881
-What is it?
-It's pinching me here. It's bothering me.

926
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,341
-Let's see.
-[Seok-ryu] Over here.

927
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,971
Hey! You thought I couldn't do it
in a dress, didn't you?

928
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,722
I told you not to put your guard down.

929
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:34,017
You really want to do this
while buying a wedding dress?

930
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,103
[Seok-ryu laughing]

931
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,230
So why did you doubt me?

932
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,691
It doesn't matter what I wear!

933
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,710
Mom, are you ready?

934
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,045
Honey, they're ready outside…

935
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,631
How do I look?

936
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,009
A wedding dress at my age?
Isn't it a bit foolish?

937
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,051
You're beautiful.

938
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,096
You're radiant.
I can't look directly at you.

939
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,390
Stop saying nonsense
in front of our child.

940
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,602
Mom, I'm 34 now.

941
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,312
You'll forever be a child to me.

942
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,438
[knock on door]

943
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,524
Aunt Hye-suk. [gasps]

944
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,485
-Hey, Seok-ryu!
-[Seok-ryu] You're so pretty!

945
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,487
Thank you so much.

946
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,489
I get to wear a dress thanks to you.

947
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,533
-It's nothing.
-[Hye-suk] Thank you.

948
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,369
-I'm so embarrassed.
-[Seok-ryu] You're so pretty!

949
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,996
Right?

950
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,166
[laughing] Okay! I'll stop!

951
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,251
I'll stop!

952
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,337
[groans] Jeez.

953
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,255
I didn't do it that hard.

954
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,966
So is this going to be my life soon

955
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,052
where I'm threatened
like this every day?

956
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,388
Maybe not soon…

957
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,061
Can we…

958
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,480
postpone our wedding by just a year?

959
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,815
What?

960
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,984
I still have so much to do.

961
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,404
I need to build up the restaurant,

962
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:13,283
and it's ridiculous if Mo-eum
can't come to our wedding.

963
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,368
Also…

964
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,036
most importantly,

965
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,249
I want to catch up on the 30 years
of romance we've missed out on.

966
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,710
Please?

967
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,962
Are you upset?

968
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,047
Yes.

969
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,593
Why are your reasons so valid, right,

970
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,803
and highly reasonable?

971
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,889
It's impossible to say no to that.

972
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,974
So you'll wait for me?

973
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,728
[groans] But you look
so beautiful in that dress!

974
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,066
You're telling me I have to wait a year
to see this again? You're so mean.

975
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,237
There is someone else
who might look better in it than me.

976
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,826
[Hye-suk chuckles]

977
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,494
Did you know?

978
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:01,707
I wanted to hold a bouquet
of lily of the valley at our wedding.

979
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,918
Yeah, but since we got married
in the winter, we couldn't find any.

980
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,044
That's right.

981
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,797
But now, I get to hold one
as we renew our vows.

982
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,798
[mellow music playing]

983
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,926
Do you know what this flower symbolizes?

984
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,223
They say it symbolizes
a return to happiness.

985
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,978
[photographer] We're ready now.
Okay. Look over here, please!

986
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,653
Give us a slight smile!

987
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,741
[camera shutter clicking]

988
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,908
Seung-hyo!

989
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,161
[Hye-suk] Yes, let's get one with our son.

990
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,830
Gosh, you look so nice.

991
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:47,711
-[photographer] Your son is very handsome.
-Right? She has a good eye.

992
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,129
[photographer] One step this way.

993
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,757
Okay, that's great.

994
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,925
All right, smile!

995
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,343
[camera shutter clicking]

996
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,221
Amazing.

997
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,558
We finally have a family photo now.

998
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,727
Not yet. Seok-ryu!

999
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,020
-Yes, Aunt Hye-suk?
-Hold on.

1000
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,314
Do you need something?
Should I get your lipstick?

1001
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,941
No, let's take a photo together.

1002
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,359
-What?
-We're family now.

1003
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,861
-You're right.
-Right, honey?

1004
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,279
-Come over here.
-Stand here.

1005
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,908
[photographer] Gosh,
what a beautiful family.

1006
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,618
All right, here we go!

1007
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,496
[camera shutter clicking]

1008
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,247
Great.

1009
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,208
Hey, why is a family picture
taking so long?

1010
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,584
-Goodness.
-[Mi-suk] Come here.

1011
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,462
-Yeah, I'm about to pass out from waiting.
-Hey.

1012
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,507
She said she hadn't eaten
for two days to take these photos.

1013
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,426
This is my first time
wearing a dress at a wedding.

1014
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,678
My wedding was
a traditional one at a hyanggyo.

1015
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,763
Right, in hanbok.

1016
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,474
Hello! I'm here to take your photos.

1017
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,059
We should step aside now.

1018
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,019
-Right.
-Over here, Lavender!

1019
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,979
[all exclaiming]

1020
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,940
Honey, pose!

1021
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,818
Thank you! We look so good!

1022
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,238
-[In-suk] Throw your bouquet!
-Let's yell, "Lavender!"

1023
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,656
-Okay.
-Good idea.

1024
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,658
[photographer] Now, look this way.

1025
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,784
Ready, set, go!

1026
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,995
-Lavender!
-Lavender!

1027
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,247
[camera shutter clicks]

1028
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,665
[sighs]

1029
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,508
My mom and her friends are so adorable.

1030
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,053
-[Seung-hyo] They are.
-[Seok-ryu] They look so happy.

1031
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,681
-[Seung-hyo] You're right.
-[Seok-ryu] They're not 57.

1032
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,432
They're like 17-year-old girls.

1033
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,851
[Seung-hyo] I know, right?

1034
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,519
[pop song playing]

1035
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,729
[Seok-ryu chuckles]

1036
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,356
Seok-ryu.

1037
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,733
Thank you.

1038
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,153
Without you,
I wouldn't have even thought of this.

1039
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,156
Honestly, sons just don't get their moms.

1040
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,659
Look at this.
Why did you follow me in here?

1041
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,160
You should be by her side.

1042
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,372
I've been her son this whole time.

1043
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,499
Now, it's time…

1044
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,960
to be your partner.

1045
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,216
There's no time to waste if we want to
catch up on 30 years of romance.

1046
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,636
Like what?

1047
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,681
Something like this?

1048
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,516
Yeah.

1049
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:08,935
That's right.

1050
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,437
I've…

1051
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,231
thought of another dream.

1052
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,819
Just like our parents,

1053
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,322
I want to be with you
for as long as I can.

1054
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,618
You only thought of that now?

1055
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,412
I've felt that way for ages.

1056
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,664
No, I probably felt that way
before you did.

1057
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:35,962
I'd been ignoring
my feelings for far too long.

1058
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,383
Looking back,

1059
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,012
I think it was my very first dream.

1060
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,227
I'll take good care of you.

1061
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,501
Let's take…

1062
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,337
a picture like that in 30 years.

1063
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,216
Yeah, I'd like that.

1064
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,261
Affectionate, warm,

1065
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,472
and full of love.

1066
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,363
[song ends]

1067
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,868
10 MONTHS LATER

1068
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,593
Don't be ridiculous.
This is more impressive!

1069
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,722
What are you talking about?
This was way harder to do.

1070
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,349
Seung-hyo was appointed

1071
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,811
as a public architect for Seoul
even with his busy schedule.

1072
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,937
[Hye-suk] Jeez.

1073
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,440
He said he's working
on an urban redevelopment project.

1074
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,234
Even when clients line up
with bags of money,

1075
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,361
gosh, he still puts public interest first!

1076
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,321
Instead of removing the factory equipment,

1077
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,073
it's best to leave them as is.

1078
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,034
[Mi-suk] He said
it was an architect's duty

1079
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,577
to preserve history and culture.

1080
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,746
Seung-hyo should be an elected official.

1081
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,873
Hey, what about Seok-ryu?

1082
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:38,209
She's already earned an Orange Ribbon
six months after opening.

1083
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:42,088
And you all saw the article
about her restaurant

1084
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,798
in The Chungwoo Daily.

1085
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,343
They said it was a restaurant
that heals both body and soul

1086
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,679
with not only delicious
but also healthy food.

1087
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,390
She pulled off that difficult feat!

1088
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,768
Hey, do you see this scarf?

1089
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,812
Seung-hyo brought this back
from his overseas business trip.

1090
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,107
It's from a famous luxury brand.

1091
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,317
-Hey.
-Hey, what?

1092
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,526
-This.
-What about it?

1093
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,280
Seok-ryu said this shade suited me
and gave it as a gift.

1094
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,492
She says I have a cool summer skin tone.

1095
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,827
-[Jae-suk] Girls.
-I have a warm tone.

1096
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,330
Are you two bragging
about your in-laws now?

1097
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:18,333
You two sure find
creative ways to act like fools.

1098
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,626
[Jae-suk] Gosh.

1099
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:25,340
Hey, Yeon-du won an award
at her kindergarten coding competition!

1100
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,634
-Wow!
-She wants to work for NASA later.

1101
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,551
[In-suk] NASA?

1102
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,429
My goodness, that's so amazing.

1103
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,432
Right? We don't stand a chance
against bragging about granddaughters.

1104
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,850
Ki-hoon got a job!

1105
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,353
-Really?
-That's great news! What kind?

1106
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,021
He's a sales rep for a copier company.

1107
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,316
-It's been a week now.
-Why didn't you tell us sooner?

1108
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:46,694
At first, I wasn't sure if he made
the right choice. I had mixed feelings.

1109
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,655
But the other day, Ki-hoon told me

1110
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,992
it was always his dream to wear a tie
and take the subway to work.

1111
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,912
When I heard that, it really woke me up.

1112
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,165
Passing exams isn't the only path in life!

1113
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,752
Exactly, he's a people person.
I'm sure he'll do great.

1114
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,046
[Jae-suk] Of course, he will.
That's great news.

1115
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,549
Our copy machine at the office
is on its last legs.

1116
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,175
I should give Ki-hoon a call.

1117
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,177
I'll buy him a tie!

1118
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,555
He got a job,
so his aunt should give him a gift.

1119
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,472
[In-suk] Okay.

1120
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,641
-Buy one for him right away.
-[Hye-suk] Of course.

1121
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,851
Get him an expensive one.

1122
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,103
Hey, I'm the only one
with just well wishes.

1123
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,771
Tell him I'm so happy for him.

1124
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,565
[in English] Congratulations to Ki-hoon!

1125
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,859
-[in Korean] What great news.
-Thank you!

1126
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,652
[indistinct conversation]

1127
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,490
-[Jae-suk] A barbecue at my office?
-[In-suk] Do it!

1128
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,076
[Dong-jin] Fifteen.

1129
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:36,911
Great.

1130
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,621
Sixteen.

1131
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,001
Seventeen.

1132
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,711
BAE DONG-JIN
CERTIFIED PERSONAL TRAINER

1133
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,796
-Breathe in.
-[Na-yun inhales]

1134
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,548
[Dong-jin] Eighteen.

1135
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,552
Nineteen.

1136
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,222
Okay, one last time.

1137
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,975
Push off both feet
and keep the barbell straight.

1138
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,643
Keep your eyes straight ahead.

1139
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,188
[exhales]

1140
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,482
[groans softly]

1141
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,277
Na-yun, your hips keep going too far back.

1142
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,988
Engage your back muscles
to keep it straight.

1143
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:12,989
Let's do ten more.

1144
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,782
Hey, can we take a break?

1145
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,327
We can't. There's still a lot to do.

1146
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,121
Want to grab some chicken and beer after?

1147
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,792
Na-yun, after all this exercise,
you want to drink beer?

1148
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,296
-Don't you feel bad for your body?
-No, I meant…

1149
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,215
-[claps hands]
-Okay, grab the barbell again.

1150
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,843
Steady upper body, lower your shoulders,
and engage your lats!

1151
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:34,928
Okay, one!

1152
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:36,304
[exhales]

1153
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:37,889
Two!

1154
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,350
Great. Three!

1155
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,895
Focus! Four!

1156
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,944
Seok-ryu wants to add vegan options.

1157
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,112
So I've been researching vegetables.

1158
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,781
What's good for preventing cancer?

1159
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:59,035
Glucosinolates have cancer-fighting
and antioxidant properties.

1160
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,121
I see. What kind of foods
have a lot of that?

1161
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:06,793
Vegetables like broccoli
and cabbage have a lot of them.

1162
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,253
[exhales]

1163
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,588
But they're sensitive to heat,

1164
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,133
so it's better
to eat those raw than cooked.

1165
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,512
I see. Then, she should make a salad.

1166
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,305
That's the best way to do it.

1167
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,349
-[Geun-sik] No!
-Okay!

1168
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,017
[amusing music playing]

1169
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,270
Jeez.

1170
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,563
You're so cheap.

1171
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,565
It's just technique.

1172
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,775
Technique, my foot.

1173
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,490
Then, what should we…

1174
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,451
do tomorrow?

1175
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,369
[grunts]

1176
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,288
I have to go to work.

1177
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,873
Come on. Just retire already, will you?

1178
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:50,128
How long are you planning
to work at that hospital for?

1179
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,255
[panting]

1180
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,675
Am I your only friend?

1181
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,058
Tomorrow, collect samples for research,

1182
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,476
we'll conduct a marine survey.

1183
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,603
Ms. Jung?

1184
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,522
Yes, sir. There will be
a safety briefing beforehand,

1185
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,483
so I'd appreciate it if everyone
could arrive an hour early.

1186
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,651
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1187
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,529
And next week, we'll have fire drills.

1188
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,698
We'll be simulating
a fire outbreak at the base,

1189
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,410
including rescue operations,
first aid, and fire suppression.

1190
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,496
It's going to be super realistic,

1191
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,165
so be ready, everyone.

1192
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,207
-Okay.
-All right.

1193
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,417
-Okay.
-Is that the end?

1194
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,335
That's the end.

1195
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,253
Okay, then. Meeting adjourned.

1196
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,756
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1197
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,642
[line ringing]

1198
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,479
[gasps] Dan-ho! Yeon-du!

1199
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,648
-Mo-eum!
-Mo-eum.

1200
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,276
Wait, isn't that my house?

1201
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,361
You're right.

1202
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,196
[chuckles] Where's Mom?

1203
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,947
She's at a Lavender gathering.

1204
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,284
Wow, people might think you live there.

1205
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,578
[Yeon-du] You're right.
I do practically live here.

1206
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,289
I had a sleepover with Grandma last night.

1207
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,667
I see. Is that so?

1208
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,169
She said there was no point
in having separate houses.

1209
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,797
She wants to put ours
on the market right away.

1210
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,968
What? Are you all becoming
a real family while I'm gone?

1211
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,179
I guess so.

1212
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,139
Yeon-du.

1213
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,434
I miss you so much.

1214
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,811
Me too.

1215
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,816
So I'm going to send you a very big gift.

1216
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,943
A gift?

1217
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,695
Dad, hurry and tell her.

1218
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,363
[mellow music playing]

1219
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,657
[Dan-ho clears throat]

1220
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,452
That gift is me.

1221
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,788
I'll be visiting you next month.

1222
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,666
What are you talking about?

1223
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:55,503
I'm officially going to the South Pole
for a feature article about my experience.

1224
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,380
I got the approval.

1225
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,716
Then…

1226
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,427
We'll get to see each other soon?

1227
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,220
Yes.

1228
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:09,016
At the beautiful ends
of the Earth where you are.

1229
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,862
-[Seok-ryu] Was the food all right?
-Yes, it was so delicious.

1230
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,280
Thank you for the food.

1231
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,115
I should be thanking you.

1232
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:27,493
And here are the recipes
for the dishes you had today.

1233
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,955
Is it okay to just give
these out like this?

1234
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,957
Aren't these trade secrets?

1235
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,877
I posted them
on my vlogs anyway, so it's fine.

1236
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,796
As long as our customers enjoy good food

1237
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,882
and stay healthy, that's enough for me.

1238
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,551
I'll definitely try making it. Thank you.

1239
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:44,552
Have a nice day.

1240
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,220
-[Seok-ryu] You too.
-Thank you.

1241
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,472
[Seok-ryu] Please come again!

[Myeong-u] Mr. Choi.

1245
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,451
You hear that Greip's flagship store
starts construction next week?

1246
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,620
Yeah, I'll keep following up on it.

1247
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:11,537
Don't worry.

1248
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,624
Jeez, you're not even looking at me.

1249
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,375
You're working on that again, aren't you?

Hey, you swore
you'd build my house for me.

1252
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,176
But how can you build yours first?

1253
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,053
Seung-hyo.

1254
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,847
Help me out, Myeong-u.
I want to get married too.

1255
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,432
You're right. Welcome to Hell.

1256
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,519
-You mean heaven.
-Okay. I was joking.

1257
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,731
Gosh, look at the time.

1258
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,692

1260
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,656
[Myeong-u] When you suggested opening
up the first floor,

1261
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,157
I had no clue what you meant.

1262
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,327
I can't tell if this place is
an architectural firm,

1263
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,246
a daycare, or a senior center.

1264
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,914
What? I like it.

1265
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:59,043
We tore down the stereotype
that architectural firms are intimidating.

1266
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,005
-[Hye-suk] I think I worked out too much…
-[Seung-hyo] What? Mom!

1267
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,841
-So you were here.
-[Seung-hyo] Aunt Mi-suk!

1268
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,385
-[in English] Good afternoon.
-[in Korean] Hello.

1269
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,053
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello!

1270
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,181
Wow, you and Seung-hyo
still resemble each other so much.

1271
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,016
-Thank you, Mr. Yoon.
-You're welcome.

1272
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,018
Right.

1273
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,145
I have something for you.

1274
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,232
Oh, right. I heard from Seung-hyo
that you published a book.

1275
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,400
-I did.
-Yes.

1276
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:27,488
It's a memoir about my 30 years
as a diplomat.

1277
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,116
I have a book signing
at a bookstore next week.

1278
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,701
-Really? Can I come?
-Of course.

1279
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,287
-Yes, I'll be there!
-Hey, you should come too if you can.

1280
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,957
How about you treat us first
to celebrate your book coming out?

1281
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,125
To beef, not pork.

1282
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,626
Just sign the card receipt instead.

1283
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,545
-Jeez.
-[Mi-suk] Hey, Seung-hyo.

1284
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,255
Can I stick this up here?

1285
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,173
Of course. Here, I'll do it for you.

1286
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,091
Over here.

[Seung-hyo] "Fairy tale class"?

1289
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,391
Yeah. You know I'm good
at telling stories.

1290
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:58,227
I want to inspire the young sprouts
in Hyereung-dong.

1291
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,813
I liked it when you read
folk tales for us too.

1292
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,608
I'm still learning English from your mom.

1293
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:05,735
Next year,

1294
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,738
I'm going to hold
an English fairy tale class here too.

1295
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,407
Go ahead.
Chase your dreams, Aunt Mi-suk.

[lady] After battling
my illness for a year,

1309
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,637
I went to eat at your restaurant today.

1310
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,765
I was too shy to tell you this,

1311
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,726
but your food gave me
warm comfort and encouragement.

1312
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,437
Thank you for the recipe as well.

[exhales]

1314
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,085
[Seung-hyo] Are you coming?

1315
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,253
That's right!

1316
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,422
Choisseung!

1317
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,598
[Seung-hyo] Why are you so late?

1318
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,559
I'm sorry for making you wait so long.

1319
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,396
When I contacted you, I'd already
been waiting for 30 minutes.

1320
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,231
So it was a total of 45 minutes.

1321
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,566
I'm sorry.

1322
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,155
You seem to have changed a bit though.

1323
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:15,740
Back then,

1324
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:18,743
you'd tell me it was okay to be late
and be careful on my way.

1325
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,369
Now, you're getting mad in the street.

1326
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,456
I wasn't mad. I was just asking.

1327
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,583
You're frowning.

1328
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,418
And your voice has lowered too.

1329
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,961
You're the one who's changed.

1330
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,590
You thought our plans were so trivial
that you were nearly an hour late.

1331
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,508
Do you know how important today was?

1332
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,219
I had to cancel the meeting
with our house's contractor.

1333
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,846
You could've gone alone.

1334
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,767
-What?
-I mean, you're the expert.

1335
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,643
You can handle it alone.

1336
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,520
I'd be of no use.

1337
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,939
Seriously, I'm fine with anything.

1338
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:50,775
Wow.

"Fine with anything"?

1342
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,283
That's how you regard our new home?

1343
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,702
Come on. That's not what I meant.

1344
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:02,620
Hey--

1345
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,664
If a customer walked into your place
and said to you half-heartedly,

1346
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,417
"Just give me anything,"
how would you feel?

1347
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,881
Well, I wouldn't think much of it.
I'd just recommend a dish.

1348
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:17,301
I see. So I'm the only one
being sensitive here?

1349
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,846
You're right. I'm the petty one.
I'm the small-minded one.

1350
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,266
Stop it. Why are you
acting like this? It's tiring.

1351
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,894
As tired as I am after looking
at blueprints all night?

1352
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,896
For crying out loud! Hey!

1353
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,107
Did you always hold grudges like this?

1354
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,109
Do you always nitpick what people say?

1355
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,027
[sighs]

1356
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,744
Are we having a fight right now?

1357
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,455
It doesn't seem like we're on good terms.

1358
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:51,418
Then, we should create
some official rules for when we argue.

1359
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:55,131
Whenever we argue,
we should always hold hands.

1360
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,424
If that fails,
add "honey" to each sentence.

1361
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,431
You can only let go
once the argument is over.

1362
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,144
Should we go?

1363
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:10,479
We should.

1364
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:28,539
[clears throat]

1365
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,958
What are you thinking about?

1366
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,460
Our new house…

1367
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,796
even though you don't care.

1368
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,508
Just say one more thing…

1369
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,385
Honey.

1370
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,763
You could end up living there
all by yourself, honey.

1371
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,557
After I waited for 30 years

1372
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,102
and another ten months,
how could you even say that to me, honey?

1373
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,604
I have another request.

1374
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,147
Honey.

1375
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,484
-Two single beds in our bedroom, honey.
-No way.

1376
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,486
We have to go with a queen size.

1377
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,447
Not a king either. Make it a queen.

1378
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,699
Just look at this.

1379
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,202
Why even ask for my opinion
on things like this then?

1380
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,121
I'm going to stay right next to you,

1381
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,292
like when I'm sad, hot, annoyed,

1382
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,376
or even when we argue.

1383
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,840
We should add another clause
to the rules when we argue.

1384
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,219
No separate rooms and no separate beds.

1385
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,015
Give the contractor a call.

1386
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,850
Ask if we could still meet now.

1387
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:34,146
-Really?
-Yeah.

1388
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,983
I'm just as curious and eager
to see our house as you are.

1389
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,114
What if he says we can't?

Hello, sir. How are you?

If it's not too much trouble,
would it be okay if we stopped by now?
