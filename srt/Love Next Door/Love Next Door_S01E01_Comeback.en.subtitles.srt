1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,904
The weather is so lovely!

3
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,491
Yes, it's a good day to go hiking.

4
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,618
Take off your sunglasses
before you fall on your face.

5
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,535
Okay.

6
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,120
-Hey, In-suk.
-Yeah?

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,706
Your skin looks flawless today.

8
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,791
-You think so?
-Yes.

9
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,627
I guess my Botox injections
are finally working their magic.

10
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,253
Wait, you had Botox? Where?

11
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,547
-On my frown lines, my smile lines…
-And?

12
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,299
and pretty much everywhere.

13
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,468
-I don't approve of it.
-Why not?

14
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,470
It just seems too artificial to me.

15
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,015
What's most beautiful
is getting old naturally.

16
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,226
Says the woman who uses
the most expensive cosmetics.

17
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,061
I'm just respecting my skin.

18
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,022
Sure, since our country
is all about respect.

19
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,609
-Hey, Jae-suk.
-Yes?

20
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,153
Did you do something to your face too?
You're glowing.

21
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,698
I did a prune juice cleanse yesterday.

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,120
I guess it was effective though.

23
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,205
-It was.
-My goodness.

24
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,832
I can't control my sphincter.

25
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,292
What did you eat yesterday?

26
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,877
-Prune juice.
-Prune juice!

27
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,295
I can relate.

28
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,839
I was looking at myself in the mirror

29
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,924
and saw that my buttocks
looked like squashed tofu.

30
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,717
They used to look like peaches, you know?

31
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,718
-They were.
-I'm so upset.

32
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,012
That's why we have to work out at our age.

33
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,515
That's why we're going hiking, right?

34
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,225
I'm not talking about hiking.

35
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,269
-What then?
-Squeeze and release.

36
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,312
-I can't do it well.
-What are you doing?

37
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,564
Kegel exercises.

38
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,108
-I'm off.
-Kegel exercises.

39
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,527
-Squeeze and release.
-The air is so clean.

40
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,530
Oh no!

41
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,865
Hey!

42
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,408
That smells!

43
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,034
Hey, wait for me!

44
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,537
Wait up!

45
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,164
Hey!

46
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,416
Don't come near me!

47
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,879
My goodness. I can't believe you.

48
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,467
Oh my, Mi-suk.
Did you buy a new hiking outfit?

49
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,887
-Wow.
-The color is so pretty!

50
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,723
Yes, I guess my taste changed with age.

51
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,099
I love red clothes now.

52
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,518
It's not a matter of taste but science.

53
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,354
As we age,
changes in the retinal microvasculature

54
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,399
make it harder for us to perceive
colors with short wavelengths like blue,

55
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:15,153
as opposed to colors with long wavelengths
such as the color red.

56
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,364
It must be nice to be so knowledgeable.

57
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,075
This is made out of functional fabric.
You know "Core-Tex"?

58
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,871
You mean "Gore-Tex," right?
Not "Core-Tex."

59
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,082
That's right.
It was just a slip of the tongue.

60
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,252
My daughter sent it to me from the US.
It's really expensive.

61
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,421
-It looks expensive.
-It really does.

62
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,048
Seok-ryu is a wonderful daughter.

63
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,382
She's right.

64
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,845
I don't feel comfortable
receiving gifts that my son bought

65
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,971
with his hard-earned money.

66
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,307
As if he ever gave you anything.

67
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,436
I don't place much value
on such material things.

68
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,316
The fact that my son, Seung-hyo, exists
is a gift in itself.

69
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,985
Are you saying my daughter isn't?

70
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,238
I didn't want to mention it
to avoid bragging,

71
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,783
but Seung-hyo
recently met with the president.

72
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,911
He designed a library that won an award
at an architecture competition,

73
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,454
so the president personally came to visit

74
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,624
and praised it as a superb model
of a public facility.

75
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,209
Seung-hyo is so impressive.

76
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,126
Of course.

77
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,462
Listen, guys.

78
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,173
Do you know who the second richest person
in the world is?

79
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,217
-I do. It's Jaden Becker.
-Right.

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,677
The CEO of Greip?

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,930
Not everyone in the world will know
who the president of South Korea is,

82
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,223
but everyone knows Jaden Becker.

83
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,308
Every Friday night,

84
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,560
he and Seok-ryu
shoot the breeze over some beer.

85
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,606
It's all because she works in
the most prestigious company in the world

86
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,733
after graduating from a top university
in the US.

87
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,363
As you know, Seung-hyo was at the top
of his class at Hanguk University.

88
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,199
Seok-ryu not only graduated early

89
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,868
but also got offers
from all the top companies.

90
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,246
Greip didn't pick Seok-ryu.

91
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,456
She was the one who chose them.

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,710
Seung-hyo helped design
the New York Art Center,

93
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,878
which won an international
architecture award.

94
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,214
He was the first Korean to do so!

95
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,883
Seok-ryu is the best employee

96
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,636
in that global company full of geniuses!

97
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,181
You wouldn't believe
how much she earns just in incentives!

98
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:12,937
You have to remember that Seung-hyo
was on the national swim team too.

99
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,481
It's not easy for people
to excel in multiple areas,

100
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,358
but my son does exactly that.

101
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,612
Hey, Seok-ryu is a gift from heaven.

102
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,032
You know what I dreamed about
when I became pregnant with her?

103
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,951
-I was--
-You were in a rainbow-colored paradise

104
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,578
-and found a huge tree there.
-Yes.

105
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,414
You were entranced by it
and saw a juicy pomegranate.

106
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,416
So you picked it
and got pregnant with Seok-ryu.

107
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,501
-I memorized it all.
-Thanks.

108
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,837
That sounds like some fairytale.
As for Seung-hyo--

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,590
As for Seung-hyo,
you got assigned to work in France

110
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,550
without knowing you were pregnant.

111
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,595
And you dreamed about a blue dragon
rising out of the Seine.

112
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,971
You remember all that?

113
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,808
That's some extravagant founding myth
you have there.

114
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,393
-Let me tell you…
-Unbelievable.

115
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,980
Those two won't stop
talking about the same things.

116
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,107
It's driving me crazy.

117
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,319
They just want to brag
about their successful children.

118
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,238
Who do you think will win today?

119
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,032
-Hye-suk.
-Why her?

120
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,826
Because she's a diplomat
and can be persuasive?

121
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,496
No, because Seung-hyo
is receiving another award today.

122
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,519
CHOI SEUNG-HYO

123
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,312
Seung-hyo!

124
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,233
Oh. It's you, sir.

125
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,609
You're here.

126
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,071
I thought only top celebrities
got to come to parties like this.

127
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,989
Seung-hyo is such a star!

128
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,949
Where is he?

129
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,076
Seung-hyo? I don't know.

130
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,077
What?

131
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,552
CHOI SEUNG-HYO
CEO, REGISTERED ARCHITECT

132
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,097
You want to design a memorial park?

133
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,682
Yes.

134
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,475
But why did you ask me to see me?

135
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,562
I have visited
many funeral homes for research,

136
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,148
but I don't think I've interviewed
any of the workers.

137
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,026
I heard that you've worked
as a funeral director for 20 years.

138
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,278
Has it been that long?

139
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,448
In all my years doing this job,

140
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,367
I've never had anyone
ask to interview me before.

141
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,869
I see.

142
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,539
I want to do a good job.

143
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,207
A proper job

144
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,542
with sincerity.

145
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,506
I don't know how much help I'd be.

146
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,758
Just tell me what you honestly felt

147
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,428
while working on this job.

148
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,434
To tell you the truth,
my mother passed away not long ago.

149
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,021
I'm sorry for your loss.

150
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,357
Everyone has to go through it
sooner or later.

151
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,069
But it was a comfort to me

152
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,031
that I could send her off beautifully
with my own two hands.

153
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,533
I'm sure your mother was glad to know

154
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,577
that her daughter
was there to see her off.

155
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,578
I agree.

156
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,456
That is why

157
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,251
I want people to visit
with a sense of gladness as well.

158
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,472
Memorial parks don't always have to be
so solemn and sad.

159
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,974
The people resting here were once alive.

160
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,228
They are all beloved friends
and family members.

161
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,280
What if we build
a Shelter for Memories in the lobby?

162
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,535
It would look like
a small library or a café.

163
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,705
We'd fill it up with things
that the departed used to love,

164
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,790
like books and music.

165
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,460
So the people who are visiting
their loved ones can reminisce.

166
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,379
Of course they'd be sad,

167
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,132
but I want their tears to be
interspersed with warm smiles too.

168
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,801
I love it.

169
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,346
How did you come up with such an idea?

170
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:17,932
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,268
I have to take this.

172
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,689
Hello.

173
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,401
I can't really talk right now, Myeong-u.

174
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,654
Where the heck are you?
The awards ceremony is starting soon!

175
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
I'll be right there.

176
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,036
Through a design that harmonizes
with the environment…

177
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,497
It's almost Seung-hyo's turn
to go up on stage.

178
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,166
Did he say he'll make it in time?

179
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,044
What are you doing?

180
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,048
I mean, I'm the co-CEO
of Architectural Firm Atelier In,

181
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,134
so I should accept the award in his stead.

182
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,596
Next, we will announce
the winner of the Creative Award.

183
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,763
Oh no.

184
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,933
The Creative Award
for the 2024 Magazine Awards

185
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,727
-goes to…
-No.

186
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:07,106
architect and co-CEO
of the architectural firm, Atelier In,

187
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,441
Choi Seung-hyo.

188
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,693
-I'll be back.
-Wait, no.

189
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,445
-What?
-What?

190
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,196
-Hey, Myeong-u.
-Seung-hyo!

191
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,990
-I'm not late, right?
-Right.

192
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,868
Look who's finally here.

193
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,494
The star got here just in time.

194
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,164
With a face like that,
he has to be a star.

195
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,004
CREATIVE AWARD

196
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,674
Let's hear Mr. Choi Seung-hyo's
acceptance speech.

197
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,597
Thank you.

198
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,311
I told him to prepare
an acceptance speech beforehand.

199
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,979
He should've spoken longer

200
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,065
for the cameras to capture his beauty
from all angles.

201
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,318
Hey! Our name!
You forgot to mention our name!

202
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,823
I'm from the architectural firm,
Atelier In.

203
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,367
Please give him a round of applause.

204
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,503
Yahoo!

205
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,131
Yelling "yahoo" at the top of a mountain
is so old-fashioned.

206
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,384
Who cares if it's old-fashioned?

207
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,760
I'm respecting the mountain.

208
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,512
You'll get reported to the police.

209
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,098
Who's going to report me? You?

210
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,059
Those two are still going at it.

211
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,145
They're wasting energy
fighting and making up all the time.

212
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,271
I know, right?

213
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,356
Hey.

214
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,025
I have something for you guys.

215
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,527
-What?
-What is it?

216
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,487
Seok-ryu's wedding invitation?

217
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,948
Wow, look at this.

218
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,659
I held off giving them to you

219
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,994
because I wanted to present them
in a special place.

220
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,705
Why did you print the invitations
when the wedding will be held in the US?

221
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,374
I didn't want to miss out on anything.

222
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,627
Look at this. It's so beautiful.

223
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,756
You must be so happy
that your daughter's getting married.

224
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,300
You now have a weight off your shoulders!

225
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,468
That's right.

226
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,890
When will I get my loser daughter
out of my house?

227
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,393
-Mo-eum will find someone soon.
-She will.

228
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,813
Oh right. Is Seung-hyo
going out with anyone these days?

229
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,065
-No, he's way too busy.
-I see.

230
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,402
That's just an excuse.
Even busy people can find time to date.

231
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,530
Seok-ryu managed to find someone
even though she was so busy.

232
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,575
I told you that my son-in-law
is an international lawyer, right?

233
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,659
-Hey.
-It's so pretty.

234
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,911
Women are lining up to meet my son.

235
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,455
Is that so?

236
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,207
The minister
and the director of my husband's hospital

237
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,544
both keep begging me
to introduce their daughters to him.

238
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,714
Say that again when you have
your own wedding invitations to give out.

239
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,218
Gosh. My legs fell asleep.

240
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,179
And victory goes to Na Mi-suk.

241
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,099
The wedding is only a month away.

242
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,434
I know.

243
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269
It's so soon.

244
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,063
Yahoo!

245
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,072
We're about to land, ma'am.

246
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,159
Could you open your window shade
and straighten your seat, please?

247
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,328
Excuse me.

248
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,872
Ma'am…

249
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,756
Oh, I'm sorry.

250
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,509
I should be the one to apologize.
I startled you.

251
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,930
No, it's just that I was dreaming
about getting beaten up.

252
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,223
My goodness.

253
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,557
What a nightmare.

254
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,518
Or it could be an omen.

255
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,365
I've arrived.

256
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,790
COMEBACK

257
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,628
Where is she?

258
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,885
What the…

259
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,099
Bae Seok-ryu!

260
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,359
Seeing your face makes me feel like
I'm really back, Mo-eum.

261
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,277
You.

262
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,530
Do you know how startled I was
when you said you were at the airport?

263
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,198
I didn't even get to wash up!

264
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,533
I can see that.

265
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,911
Did you miss me so much
to rush over with soot on your face?

266
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,288
Good grief.

267
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,832
You've become so slimy
after all those years in the US.

268
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,041
I know.

269
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,211
I felt it was over the top
even as I was saying it.

270
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,839
Still, it's been years
since we've seen each other.

271
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,799
Don't pretend you're not happy to see me.

272
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,678
Give me a hug.

273
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,054
Come on.

274
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,858
A thief.

275
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,693
She stole my luggage!

276
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,540
What the…

277
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,086
Warn me before you roll up the window.

278
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,379
I almost hurt myself.

279
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,674
I'm teaching you
to be cautious at all times.

280
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,260
Sticking your head out like that
is dangerous.

281
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,555
You sounded like
a real paramedic just now.

282
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,223
That's because I really am.

283
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,391
Exactly.

284
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,730
Where's the girl I used to know
who'd jump off fences wearing a cape?

285
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,065
I liked that girl.

286
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,944
It's thanks to kids like that
that I get a paycheck.

287
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,862
What was I thinking back then?

288
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,615
Were you near a fire?

289
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,953
Yes. Paramedics accompany
firefighters to the site.

290
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,287
No one died, at least.

291
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,538
That's good.

292
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,624
By the way,

293
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,250
why are you so skinny?

294
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,338
Are you losing weight
for your wedding day?

295
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,422
I'm killing it, right?

296
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,174
This jawline could cut you.

297
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,511
Could you avoid using
dangerous words like "kill" or "cut"?

298
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,346
It's making me antsy.

299
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,347
Sorry.

300
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,807
Did you call your mom?

301
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,394
My mom didn't tell me
you were coming back home.

302
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,645
Sure I did.

303
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,856
Of course you did. What about Seung-hyo?

304
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,233
He must be busy anyway.

305
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,485
How is he anyway?

306
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,404
He's doing good.

307
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,703
You forgot to say my name
in your acceptance speech.

308
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,662
I did.

309
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:40,124
No, you just mentioned the company's name
and not mine!

310
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,711
I can tell from the color of your suit
that you visited another memorial park.

311
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,670
Yes.

312
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,963
Did you take a compass?

313
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,297
No.

314
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,592
Yeah right. You can't deceive me.

315
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,470
You're an architect,
not a feng shui master!

316
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,805
It's part of an architect's job

317
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,142
to learn about the cultural
and historical context of a space.

318
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,519
Don't you know about gravesite feng shui,

319
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,604
a long-standing traditional practice?

320
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,774
You're absolutely right.

321
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,109
Put that camera away.

322
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,446
I can visit a hundred memorial parks
as long as I'm with you.

323
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,948
If you want, I can get buried with you.

324
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,241
No, thank you.

325
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,160
Come on, don't be shy.

326
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,995
I'm scared. I think she means it.

327
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,121
Yes, me too.

328
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,299
Hey, it's Roh Yoon-seo!

329
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,925
Do you know her?

330
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,135
How do you know her?

331
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,762
I don't really know her.

332
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,681
We met briefly
at Oblique's launching ceremony.

333
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,309
Amazing! Let's go say hello to her!

334
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,311
I have to go now. I'm busy.

335
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,438
Hey, where do you think you're going?

336
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,273
She's Roh Yoon-seo,

337
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,567
the woman whom every young man
considers perfect!

338
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,610
You can't leave!

339
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,071
My idea of perfection isn't a person,
but a well-made structure.

340
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,947
-You're going there again, aren't you?
-Of course.

341
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,199
No, I won't let you leave

342
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,077
until you help me get her autograph
and take a photo with her!

343
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,329
Just go. Go on!

344
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,497
-Hey!
-Bye.

345
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,706
Hold on.

346
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,916
Hello.

347
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,624
BAE SEOK-RYU

348
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,715
"Heungbu Sausage Stew."

349
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,176
"Sanshin Ox Bone Soup."

350
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,804
"Grandma Kwon's Pork Wraps."

351
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,681
Did you forget Korean or something?

352
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,724
Why are you reading those shop signs?

353
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,686
The restaurant signs keep catching my eye.

354
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,062
Oh, I see.

355
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,565
I guess I'm hungry.

356
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,649
Right.

357
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,110
It's past lunchtime.

358
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,320
Everything looks so good.

359
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,490
"The In-Law's Fried Chicken."

360
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,910
That one doesn't sound so appetizing.

361
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,538
Don't be greedy and just pick one place.

362
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,706
One place?

363
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,749
Then…

364
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,425
Enjoy your meal.

365
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,509
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

366
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,344
Hey.

367
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,598
I bet the blood of Korean people
is redder than that of others

368
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,724
because it's actually chili paste.

369
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,476
What a scientific theory you have there.

370
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,979
But I thought
we'd go to your family's place.

371
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,773
We came here all the time
during high school.

372
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,153
All right, let's eat these rice cakes
and talk about the good old days.

373
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,362
Wait.

374
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,364
We should have some sundae too.

375
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,366
Get ready.

376
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,826
Begin the battle.

377
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,828
Let's eat!

378
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,751
It's good.

379
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,836
It's so good.

380
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,303
It's spicy though.

381
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,387
Really spicy.

382
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,223
Why is it so spicy?

383
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,726
Jeez, it looks like
I can't handle spicy food now.

384
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,686
Drink some water. Are you okay?

385
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,774
I guess your blood
isn't as red as it used to be.

386
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,026
You're losing your identity as a Korean.

387
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,029
-It's too spicy.
-All right, I know what to do.

388
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,073
Let's wash them in water first.

389
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,991
-What are you doing?
-Say "ah."

390
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,909
It's okay.

391
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,453
Come on. That's sinking too low.

392
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,829
It's okay.

393
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,166
-Hide!
-What?

394
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,796
-Hello.
-Hi, what can I get you?

395
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,131
One portion of tteokbokki, assorted fries,

396
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,009
and sundae
with lots of steamed offals, please.

397
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,594
-All right.
-It's Dong-jin.

398
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,179
-Exactly.
-Looks delicious.

399
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,191
What's the deal with them?

400
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,194
Are they feeling sick?

401
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,117
Your food is ready.

402
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,868
Thank you.

403
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,996
You can pay here.

404
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay.

405
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,668
Thanks.

406
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,837
-Goodbye.
-Enjoy your food.

407
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,463
It looks good.

408
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,218
-Sir!
-What's in that bag?

409
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,720
Let go of my ear first, please.

410
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,180
-Open it.
-Okay.

411
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,141
This tteokbokki has 500 calories.

412
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,477
You also have sundae,
fried seaweed rolls, and fried squid?

413
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,104
That's 1,350 calories in total.

414
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,230
How do you know that?

415
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,858
Listen up.
This is your exercise regimen for today.

416
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,360
A hundred pull-ups, a hundred push-ups,

417
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,154
two hundred lunges and burpees, each.

418
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,864
Then 500 squats, okay?

419
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,700
That's so unfair.
I haven't even eaten them yet!

420
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,286
You ate all these in your mind.

421
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,996
Don't you want your trainer certification?

422
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,414
What about the upcoming contest?

423
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,417
Just the fact that
you considered eating these things

424
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,710
is a crime, all right?

425
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,087
Hand them over.

426
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,423
Come on, hand them over.

427
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,009
I'm confiscating them for your own good.

428
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,595
The offals have protein, though.

429
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,765
Be at the gym in five minutes. Go!

430
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,186
That dimwit.

431
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,148
-I told him squid has more protein.
-Is he gone?

432
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,735
It's delicious, ma'am.

433
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,029
-Have a good day.
-You too.

434
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,864
-He's gone, right?
-Yes.

435
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,826
He should be eating at Dad's diner,
not here.

436
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,827
Hey.

437
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,663
That's the pot calling the kettle black.

438
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,999
Anyway, what was that?

439
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,585
Why did you hide from your brother?

440
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,338
You might not know
since you only have sisters,

441
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,048
but this is what having a brother is like.

442
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,469
Does your family not know
that you're back?

443
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,973
Surprise.

444
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,226
I mean,

445
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,520
it's been a while since I came home.

446
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:20,190
So I thought it would be more fun
to surprise them like this

447
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,401
than just to walk through the front door.

448
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,402
Right.

449
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,488
You're nuts. So you're making
a whole production out of…

450
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,579
Wait, "a whole production"?

451
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,124
We might as well go all-out.

452
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,570
Come on, let's go.

453
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,365
We need to decorate the house
until our moms come back from hiking.

454
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,825
Wait, Mo-eum…

455
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,869
-What?
-Please promise me one thing.

456
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,456
Stay with me until the end of the day,
no matter what happens.

457
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,374
What do you mean?

458
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,835
Even if Mount Baekdu explodes
or the Han River overflows, okay?

459
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,795
Even if the world ends
or the dinosaurs come back!

460
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,713
Hold on.

461
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,381
-What I mean is--
-Hello?

462
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,008
Yes, captain?

463
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,260
Jae-gyeong did what?

464
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,971
Right now?

465
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,891
-All right. I'll be right there.
-You're leaving?

466
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,268
-Where are you going?
-I have to go. It's an emergency.

467
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,978
I have an emergency too.

468
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm going to need you later on!

469
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,982
Then call 911 later! Bye!

470
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,483
Hey, wait! I'm being serious!

471
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,277
Jung Mo-eum!

472
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,445
Hey!

473
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,696
Bye.

474
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,780
But…

475
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,408
That traitor.

476
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,551
There used to be a sauna here.

477
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:19,976
CORNERSTONE

478
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,605
THIS BUILDING WAS FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT
FOR THE RESIDENTS OF HYEREUNG-DONG

479
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,774
TO COMMEMORATE THE HOSTING
OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES

480
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,275
HYEREUNG SAUNA

481
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,361
No!

482
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,655
You really have to take a bath today.

483
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,908
See? You're so grimy with dirt,
I can hardly tell you're a human brat.

484
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,243
Well, I'm your grimy brat!

485
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,786
You're not doing this on purpose, are you?

486
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,163
No! I don't want to take a bath!

487
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,456
Come on!

488
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,916
I don't want to go inside

489
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,252
with Bae Seok-ryu.

490
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,212
It's okay, Seung-hyo.

491
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,130
HYEREUNG SAUNA

492
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,216
-Oh, come on.
-No!

493
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,926
SAUNA OPEN

494
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,804
WOMEN'S BATH

495
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,604
Our mothers were so cruel.

496
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,651
How could they make us share a bath?

497
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,655
It was a violation of our rights.

498
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,201
I used to hate going to the sauna,

499
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,536
but it's a shame it's gone.

500
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,915
What is this place anyway?

501
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,750
There's no sign.

502
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,960
No front door either.

503
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,091
Who are you?

504
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,154
Bae Seok-ryu?

505
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,741
Choisseung?

506
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,166
What are you doing here?

507
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,375
That's my line.

508
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,918
What's up with you?

509
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,670
None of your business.

510
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,964
You're stepping on my land.

511
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,968
Don't make me laugh. This is your land?

512
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,847
Wait, is it?

513
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,891
It is, so go away.

514
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,573
-I do dancesport.
-Your old age is showing.

515
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,039
What the heck?

516
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,878
-What are you doing?
-I can't talk right now.

517
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,129
Just help me out, okay?

518
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,964
What are you going on about?

519
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,175
Help me out just this once.

520
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,220
Just pretend I'm a discarded box, okay?

521
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,555
Don't tell anyone you saw me.

522
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,891
Got it?

523
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,811
Whatever. Get out.

524
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,105
-I said, get out.
-I don't believe you.

525
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,399
You want proof?

526
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,484
-Look at her.
-Hey.

527
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,903
Hey, stop that!

528
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,863
-That's enough!
-Gosh, how embarrassing.

529
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,115
One, two!

530
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,701
What's this luggage doing here
in the middle of the road?

531
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,328
-Seung-hyo.
-Mom.

532
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,081
Give me a hug.

533
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,041
Oh my.

534
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,377
-It's been a while, Seung-hyo.
-You're here.

535
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,712
-You're as handsome as always.
-He is.

536
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,048
I'm In-suk. Do you remember me?

537
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,425
Of course. How have you been?

538
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,051
My goodness!

539
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,095
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

540
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,388
-Hello.
-Hi.

541
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,098
-Why aren't you at the diner?
-What?

542
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,349
Where are you sneaking off to?

543
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,309
Why would I be sneaking?

544
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,770
Is that any way to talk
to your beloved husband?

545
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,813
Wanna try that again?

546
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,189
I just went to the market.

547
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,360
Hey, Seung-hyo! Here, have one.

548
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,529
-Thank you.
-It's good to see you.

549
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,655
Thank you.

550
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,701
You should've called ahead
to say you were coming home.

551
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,954
I came to receive some furniture today.

552
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,622
-I apologize for not letting you know.
-I see.

553
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,250
I understand.

554
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,503
Your firm opens next week,
so you must be busy.

555
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,631
I invited a lot of guests
for the opening party.

556
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,967
-About that--
-So you're saying that this building

557
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,177
is your new office?

558
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,804
-Yes.
-That's impressive, Seung-hyo.

559
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,930
-Thank you.
-Seung-hyo.

560
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,475
-Is this your luggage?
-What? No.

561
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,810
-Really?
-This was just here?

562
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,521
-We should take it to the police.
-We should.

563
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,107
-Let's do it.
-Let me see.

564
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,442
It says something here.

565
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,027
It's in English.

566
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,236
Hold on. It is mine.

567
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,614
It's definitely mine.

568
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,408
Seung-hyo has the same taste as me.

569
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,411
-I suppose.
-Pink is a man's color, you know.

570
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,622
-Right.
-You should take better care of it.

571
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,166
What if you lost it? Here you go.

572
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,793
I'll do it.

573
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,337
Seung-hyo.

574
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,380
Did you eat the beans I sent you?

575
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,425
-Did you eat everything?
-Actually, not yet.

576
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,719
I've been too busy to eat at home.

577
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,555
You need to have healthier eating habits!

578
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,891
You want me to come over
and check your fridge?

579
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,727
I'm sorry. I'll give you an apple
as an apology.

580
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,229
An apology?

581
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,856
I'm only eating beans from today onward.

582
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,194
What are you guarding this box for anyway?
What's in it?

583
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,195
I don't know.

584
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,697
I mean, it can't be a person, can it?

585
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,909
Are you hiding something precious?

586
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,077
Of course not.

587
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,954
It has nothing of value.

588
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,789
I should throw it out.

589
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,500
Really? Then we'll throw it out for you.

590
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,002
-Honey.
-Yes, I can carry it.

591
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,963
You can sell a box like this for money.

592
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,422
Hold on.

593
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,802
Now that I think about it,
I still need it to put all my trash in.

594
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,845
I'll throw it out after that.

595
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,389
Maybe there is
something of value after all.

596
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,182
-Really?
-Okay.

597
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,226
Tell me when you plan to throw it out.

598
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,185
Okay.

599
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,312
Seung-hyo.

600
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,897
Don't forget the beans.

601
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,274
Yes, ma'am.

602
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,733
You should cook it better.

603
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,818
Let's go.

604
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,194
-Bye!
-Goodbye!

605
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,821
-Goodbye.
-Have a good day!

606
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,907
I'll be going too, Seung-hyo.

607
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,284
All right. Goodbye.

608
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,660
-See you later.
-Yes.

609
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,953
Bye.

610
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,005
Are they all gone?

611
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,132
I'm coming out.

612
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,016
Let me out.

613
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,727
Why are you hiding from your mom?

614
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,479
Let me out! It's stuffy in here!

615
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,982
It's just very strange.

616
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,693
I thought you were
supposed to be in the US.

617
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,740
Did you get into trouble?

618
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,035
I have other ways of getting out.

619
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,786
Jeez.

620
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,415
You tore the box?

621
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,418
I can tear you apart too.

622
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,754
Aunt Mi-suk!

623
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,298
Just kidding.

624
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,929
I'm going to end you!

625
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,890
Is that any way to talk to your savior?

626
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,936
So this is your new office?

627
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:18,853
It kind of sucks.

628
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,064
-It's full of bucks though.
-Whatever.

629
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,901
Then why don't you save me one more time?

630
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,818
What?

631
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,070
Let me use your bathroom.

632
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,156
Don't mark it as your territory.

633
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,616
You can't go in there!

634
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,285
Jeez.

635
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,044
Go straight and turn left there.
That's the front door.

636
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,170
Goodbye.

637
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,922
It's actually not that bad.

638
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,383
Just follow the recommended route.

639
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,260
Hey, what are these?

640
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,178
Millstones?

641
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,348
They're stepping stones.

642
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,643
Keep your dirty hands off of them!

643
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,939
Are you doing this on purpose?

644
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,276
Does this place have bad feng shui?

645
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,237
Or are you my bad luck?

646
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,407
You know you're kind of mean, don't you?

647
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,409
You don't know you're immature, do you?

648
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,829
I don't like this at all.

649
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,789
At least you were cute
when you were little.

650
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,083
You weren't cute
even when you were little.

651
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,877
You little…

652
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,587
Look at this.

653
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,965
You immediately start throwing punches.

654
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:33,219
I tell you, you're closer to a beast
than a human being.

655
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,430
Your fiancé must be a saint.

656
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,223
What?

657
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,933
Aunt Mi-suk gave me
your wedding invitation.

658
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,436
She offered to buy my plane ticket,

659
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,896
but I think I'll be too busy to make it.

660
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,484
Congratulations on your marriage.

661
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,486
Thanks.

662
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,948
By the way, where's your office?

663
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,993
Aren't you going to leave?

664
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,954
It's over there, isn't it?

665
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,875
Please just leave!

666
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,419
Just go, please.
Why are you going upstairs?

667
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,505
Hey, come on! Get out of there.

668
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,382
Why would you come in here?

669
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,135
Your office is huge.

670
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,971
Just go home, okay?

671
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,683
That's an impressive ceiling.

672
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,895
I guess you have eyes, after all.

673
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,316
I referred to the ceiling designs
of the Goguryeo mural tombs.

674
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,985
You mean like the Twin Column Tomb
or the Tomb of the Dancers?

675
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:31,903
Exactly.

676
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,447
It's a ceiling
with triangles in each corner,

677
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,282
the most common type of the era.

678
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,409
It holds the principles of

679
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,287
"the sky is round
and the earth is square."

680
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,580
In other words,

681
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,958
you designed your office like a tomb.
What a weirdo.

682
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,627
What? A "weirdo"?

683
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,254
Whatever.

684
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,300
Of course, someone as crude as you
wouldn't understand my art,

685
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,594
which reinterprets
our ancestors' timeless wisdom

686
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,429
with modern sensibilities--

687
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,527
For crying out loud.

688
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,071
Are you okay?

689
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,992
Do I look okay to you?

690
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,829
I can't believe you crawled out alone.

691
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,290
I have a very strong attachment to life.

692
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,419
What was it that fell anyway?

693
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,591
This thing is heavy!

694
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,219
Did you think it'd be
as light as a feather?

695
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,972
Did you hurt yourself?

696
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,557
Let me see.

697
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,100
What are you doing?

698
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,852
Do you have eyes in the back of your head?

699
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,728
If you don't, just stay still.

700
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,814
I knew this would happen.

701
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,859
I always end up getting hurt
when I'm with you.

702
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,902
Be quiet and stay still.

703
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,906
You're completely fine.
Nothing to worry about.

704
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,950
But it might leave a bruise…

705
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:08,040
What did you just say? Say it again!

706
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,586
Stop it!

707
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,670
Don't!

708
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,796
Let me go!

709
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,558
You still have this scar.

710
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,187
I told you, didn't I?

711
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,524
My body is bruised and battered
from everything you put me through.

712
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,568
You're exaggerating.

713
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,236
I don't expect you to apologize.

714
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,865
I just want you to leave now. Please.

715
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,327
Hey, I didn't want to spend
my first day back with you either.

716
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,163
-But something unexpected came up--
-Hey, Seok-ryu.

717
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,041
I couldn't care less
about what you did or didn't do.

718
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,001
I see.

719
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,004
Sorry for inconveniencing you.

720
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,590
But I know one thing.

721
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,595
Knowing Aunt Mi-suk, putting it off
wouldn't do you any favors.

722
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,264
Things are going to escalate
the longer you put it off.

723
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,266
She'll spend a whole day
not talking to you

724
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,893
for what could've been resolved
in 30 minutes.

725
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,230
So stop dawdling
and just get it over with.

726
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,607
You're so annoying when you're right.

727
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,610
You're so pathetic
when you get in trouble.

728
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,613
That's it.

729
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,615
Let me hit you just once.

730
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:23,991
I think

731
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,619
this cost 17 million won.

732
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,120
Not 1,700 won?

733
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,665
A designer friend of mine gave it to me.

734
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,251
If it's broken,
I should claim for damages--

735
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,543
Let me see.

736
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,631
It's not broken. It's fine.

737
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,550
What an expensive chunk of metal.

738
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,721
Look. I gave it a rub so it shines better.

739
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,973
It's so shiny now.

740
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,349
It's totally fine, right?

741
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,642
It's as good as new.

742
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,644
I'll just carefully put it back here.

743
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,812
Don't bother.

744
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,648
There, all done!
It looks even better than before.

745
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,358
-Just go.
-It looks so perfect.

746
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,069
HYEREUNG 911 SAFETY CENTER

747
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,324
Hey.

748
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,869
How could you call me back
after I'd gone home for the day?

749
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,371
I'm not even on this team.

750
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,789
I had no choice.

751
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,833
The newbie got seriously carsick.

752
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:17,378
I told you
Captain Song should drive slower.

753
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,674
You're the only one
who can bear to be in the car with him.

754
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,009
Who would've guessed

755
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,511
that a good paramedic
is one who doesn't get carsick?

756
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,638
I'm leaving.

757
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,515
Emergency dispatch.

758
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:35,146
911 AMBULANCE

759
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,576
Sir.

760
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,412
I'm a paramedic.

761
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,581
Are you okay?

762
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,999
Can you hear me?

763
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,210
What? Who called 911?

764
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,545
Who was it?

765
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,464
Jeez.

766
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,300
We got a call that you collapsed
with a cut on your forehead.

767
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,385
We'll take you to the hospital.

768
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,054
How did you get hurt?

769
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,973
I just fell from a chair.

770
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,100
It's fine. I don't need a doctor.

771
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,518
Yes, you do.

772
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,728
It could be superficial,

773
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,855
but we can't rule out concussion.

774
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,190
You should get checked out.

775
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,316
Get lost.

776
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,692
I said get lost.

777
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:27,198
Jeez, I'm hungry.
When is my mother getting here?

778
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,742
-For crying out loud.
-Sir.

779
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,826
Sir.

780
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,287
Do you have diabetes?

781
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,832
You shouldn't have drunk this much.

782
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,626
I told you to get lost.

783
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,752
Careful.

784
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,671
Come on, Captain Jung.
Let's just call the police.

785
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,882
-Let me check your blood sugar level.
-Why you…

786
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,966
I said no!

787
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,676
I'm not going to the hospital!

788
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,845
Stop bothering me and get lost!

789
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,514
Don't curse at me.

790
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,557
Do you see this camera I'm wearing?

791
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,811
I have no choice but to film your face
if you keep acting like this.

792
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,563
I told you to get lost
and stop bothering me.

793
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,815
Why would you film me?

794
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,275
Who do you think you are to do that?

795
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,529
Get back, Mo-eum.

796
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,030
Sir.

797
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,698
Put down that bottle, please.

798
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,200
And who the hell are you?

799
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,159
I'm just a civilian.

800
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,203
Everyone, please stay out of this.

801
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,371
We'll deal with it.

802
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,873
I wanted to help out
because the situation looked dangerous.

803
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,500
Why? Because I'm a woman?

804
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,626
No,

805
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,461
because I'm a red belt in taekwondo.

806
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,506
-What?
-I'm sorry, sir!

807
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,466
Hold on!

808
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,595
What's the deal with him?

809
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,513
What the…

810
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,107
I'm a black belt.

811
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,317
Can you treat him, please?

812
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,987
Are you okay, sir?

813
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,488
Good grief.

814
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,656
What?

815
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,074
Let me just check your blood.

816
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,909
Oh, all right.

817
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,828
It's going to sting.

818
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,246
-Okay.
-Give me your hand.

819
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,083
Why did you drink so much?

820
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,903
It's so noisy. Don't walk so close to me.

821
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,656
You're the one who's following me.

822
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,744
Do you think I'm following you?

823
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,537
You might have forgotten,

824
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,456
but our parents live
right next to each other.

825
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,665
I'm just going home.

826
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,752
Just take another road. Go on.

827
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,836
This is the quickest.

828
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,671
For crying out loud.

829
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,059
Are you craving fried chicken right now?

830
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,101
THE IN-LAW'S FRIED CHICKEN

831
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,313
I feel sorry for you. I really do.

832
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:09,527
Do you think I could ask
to borrow that helmet right there?

833
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,445
You think they'd lend it to me?

834
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:12,988
What?

835
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,865
I need something
to protect me from my mom.

836
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,950
She'll crack my melon.

837
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,328
You could've picked a more normal word
like "head" or even "skull."

838
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,874
There aren't any helmet shops nearby,
are there?

839
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,001
This lunatic is actually being serious.

840
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,593
What are you doing?

841
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,891
What are you doing
in the middle of the street?

842
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,478
Hold this.

843
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,357
Hey.

844
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,900
You're driving me nuts.

845
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,659
I guess I underestimated you.

846
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,998
You're insane.

847
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,098
You look like a blowfish.

848
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,517
It's only natural to puff up one's body

849
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,144
when faced with incredible danger.

850
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,855
Come on, hit me.

851
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,565
What are you saying?

852
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,610
Just hit me. I need to see
if I'm protected enough.

853
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,613
Why didn't you just buy
a bulletproof vest in the US?

854
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,865
I really should've.

855
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,534
Should I go back and buy one?

856
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,203
Considering the time and money
you'd have to spend,

857
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,372
just get it over with right now.

858
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,128
Hey, do you want to
spend the night with me?

859
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,713
What the hell are you on about?

860
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,922
Stay with me.

861
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:54,923
Stop fooling around.

862
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,676
I'm not asking for much.
Just stay by my side, okay?

863
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,428
Go away! You're scaring me.

864
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,263
I'm the one who's scared.

865
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,516
I really screwed up, Seung-hyo.

866
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,562
I came home to just tell my mom
and get it over with,

867
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,149
but now I can't bear to face her.

868
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,693
What is it? What did you do?

869
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,530
I have to know what it is

870
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,659
if I'm going to help you
decide what to do about it.

871
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,576
Well…

872
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,870
The thing is…

873
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,665
I…

874
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,918
called it off.

875
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,336
What?

876
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,796
I said…

877
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:35,881
I'm not getting married.

878
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,466
Speak up, will you?

879
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,593
I said I broke off my engagement!

880
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:44,890
Aunt Mi-suk.

881
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,645
Hey, you can't fool me twice
with that trick.

882
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,773
What did you just say?

883
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,916
Seok-ryu.

884
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,919
What did you say? Say it again.

885
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,337
Mom.

886
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,091
I must have heard it wrong, right?

887
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,676
Right.

888
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,802
Mom!

889
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,387
-Oh my.
-How have you been?

890
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,890
You must be surprised to see me
out of the blue.

891
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,725
You're still so beautiful.

892
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,354
I'm actually kind of confused
because of jet lag, you know?

893
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,274
The reason I'm back in Korea is…

894
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,191
Yes?

895
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,402
It's…

896
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,779
to tell you
that I broke off my engagement.

897
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,282
Oh my god!

898
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,079
-Dad!
-Geun-sik!

899
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,289
Dad!

900
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,415
Move out of the way.

901
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,627
He must have had a shock.

902
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,046
Goodness!

903
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,091
Are you all right, Geun-sik?

904
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,217
I just had a bad dream.

905
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,220
-I thought Seok-ryu said…
-Are you okay, Dad?

906
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,472
Seok-ryu!

907
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,432
It wasn't a dream?

908
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:12,227
No, this has to be a dream!
Just a bad dream!

909
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,437
Seok-ryu.

910
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,148
What did you say? You did what?

911
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,984
I broke off my engagement.

912
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,986
I canceled everything.

913
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,113
Everyone in the US knows already.

914
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,615
You're out of your mind.

915
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,867
You're completely nuts.

916
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,951
I'm totally fine.

917
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,412
How could you call your own daughter nuts?

918
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,663
I'm calling it as I see it!

919
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,334
Only a nutjob would pull a stunt like this
a month before the wedding!

920
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,294
Come here.

921
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,545
Aunt Mi-suk!

922
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,714
Use your words, please.

923
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,425
-No violence.
-That's right, Mom. Hear me out.

924
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,135
There's a saying in the US.

925
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,930
"There are three types of people
who get married."

926
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:51,391
"The dumb, the poor, and the masochist."

927
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,935
Why you… Get over here.

928
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,686
Wait, I have more.

929
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,772
I have one more thing to say.

930
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,524
There's another saying that goes,

931
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:03,028
"Marriage is leaving a festival
before it begins."

932
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,321
Are you nuts?

933
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,448
What in the world happened?

934
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,408
You sounded so happy

935
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,118
-the last time we talked!
-Stop it.

936
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,248
Don't tell me that my son…

937
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,208
No, he's not my son-in-law anymore.

938
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,461
Did that jerk Song Hyeon-jun call it off?

939
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,047
That dirtbag!

940
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,550
Honey, buy us
two plane tickets right away.

941
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,677
-Okay.
-I'll tear him to pieces!

942
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,053
It's not his fault.

943
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,055
Do you have no pride?

944
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,140
Are you seriously defending him?

945
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,893
It wasn't his fault. It was mine.

946
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,019
That makes no sense.

947
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,355
What could you have possibly…

948
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,817
Did you…

949
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,071
cheat on him?

950
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,119
Goodness.

951
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,371
Dear me.

952
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,708
Be careful.

953
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,376
Now,

954
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,003
breathe in deeply.

955
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,546
You might start hyperventilating.

956
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,006
I need CPR.

957
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,632
You crazy brat!

958
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,175
I can't believe you!

959
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:11,096
-Even I never cheated on anyone,
-Mi-suk!

960
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,056
with a pathetic husband like that!

961
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,475
So how could you do
such an unthinkable thing?

962
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,686
I've had it up to here with you!
I'll end you!

963
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,772
-Aunt Mi-suk!
-You don't have to talk to me like that.

964
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,651
Do you want me to be an unfilial daughter
who dies before her parents?

965
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,777
-Hey.
-What about now?

966
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,613
As if you're a filial daughter now!

967
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,532
-Mi-suk! Stop!
-Auntie! Hold on!

968
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,035
-Let's talk it out like civilized people.
-That's right!

969
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,162
Let's be civilized.
You're being too violent.

970
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,204
Also, I'm a grownup.

971
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,291
You can't just
discipline me like that anymore!

972
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,585
I'll treat you like a grownup
when you act like one!

973
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,295
Come over here, you brat!

974
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,464
-Aunt Mi-suk!
-What are you doing?

975
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,674
Stop hitting me and hit her instead!

976
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,051
That's right!

977
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,261
Why are you hitting my son?

978
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,056
He's taking all the blows
for your daughter!

979
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,643
He's so cruel and ruthless.

980
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,978
He really made me do all the push-ups.

981
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,730
-Come here, you brat!
-Hey!

982
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,148
What's with the ruckus?

983
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,317
-You should go.
-Is someone fighting?

984
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,196
Why do you keep calling me "brat"
instead of the name you gave me?

985
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,572
That's your issue?

986
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,866
How about I call you "bastard" instead?

987
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,744
-I think I prefer "brat."
-Hey, you…

988
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,162
Are you making fun of me?

989
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,373
Aunt Mi-suk! Stop!

990
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,249
Don't hit me there!

991
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,668
Hey!

992
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,837
Are you trying to castrate my son?

993
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,297
I've had enough.

994
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,341
Let me go! Stop it!

995
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,842
-Honey.
-Out of my way!

996
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:31,927
Don't do this.

997
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,429
Uncle Geun-sik.

998
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,058
Honey, please!

999
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,727
Stop hitting her, okay?

1000
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,231
You haven't even heard
Seok-ryu's side of the story yet.

1001
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,734
She wouldn't do something like that
for no reason!

1002
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,237
Dad.

1003
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,448
Oh, my daughter.

1004
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,825
It's okay.

1005
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,036
She basically raised herself
without our help!

1006
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,039
So she must have had a reason
for doing whatever she did!

1007
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,005
Fine, tell me.

1008
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:10,882
Let's hear it.

1009
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,844
Will you stop hitting me if I tell you?

1010
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,429
Fine.

1011
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,890
Will you really listen to
everything I have to say?

1012
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:19,850
Yes.

1013
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,893
I'll listen.

1014
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:23,895
Are you sure?

1015
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,731
-I said yes.
-She said yes.

1016
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,774
Mom.

1017
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,570
I also quit my work.

1018
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,280
I'm unemployed now.

1019
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,579
No way.

1020
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,830
So you're… what?

1021
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,002
-Dad!
-Geun-sik!

1022
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,299
Is he okay?

1023
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,800
Dong-jin!

1024
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,844
-What is it?
-I'm just so…

1025
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:56,762
You little…

1026
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,805
You hopeless brat!

1027
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,141
You quit your job

1028
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,018
on top of all that?

1029
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,227
You're insane!

1030
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,854
-Goodness, Mi-suk!
-Come here!

1031
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:06,897
Seok-ryu!

1032
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,982
-You said you'd hear me out!
-You're hitting Seung-hyo!

1033
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,860
-You're hitting my son!
-This is too ridiculous!

1034
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,987
-You worked so hard to get there!
-Stop it!

1035
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,363
-You had such a good job.
-Stop!

1036
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,073
-Why would you quit?
-Hey!

1037
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,825
-You little brat!
-Stop it.

1038
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,285
-I can't believe…
-It hurts!

1039
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,078
Are you in your right mind?

1040
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,123
-We have to run!
-Hold it right there!

1041
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,917
-Hey!
-I'm not done with you!

1042
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,835
Why did you have to bring me along?

1043
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,295
I have no reason to run!

1044
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,631
I saved you from being beaten to a pulp.

1045
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,634
You're the only reason I got beaten
with a bunch of leeks!

1046
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,802
What's your plan now?

1047
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,804
Just think of it as playing tag.

1048
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,056
-Stop right there!
-We're dead if we get caught.

1049
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:42,849
Hey!

1050
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,351
I'm counting to ten!

1051
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,647
One, two, three, four,

1052
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,067
five, six, seven, eight,

1053
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,902
nine, ten!

1054
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,781
We're dead if we get caught, okay?

1055
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,332
Hey, get back here!

1056
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,668
Stop right there, Bae Seok-ryu!

1057
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,131
Hey!

1058
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,552
That little brat. Get back here!

1059
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,224
Hey.

1060
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,145
She wouldn't follow us here, right?

1061
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,440
We shook her off a long time ago.

1062
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,652
Then why didn't you tell me?
We could've stopped running.

1063
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,279
Why did we come all the way here?

1064
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,282
I'm totally wiped!

1065
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,158
Don't slap me away like that.

1066
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,369
You're the one who grabbed my hand first.

1067
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,247
Hey.

1068
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,540
Buy me something to drink.

1069
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,749
Are you nuts?

1070
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,418
The store is down there!

1071
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,421
I'm so thirsty right now
that I might puke.

1072
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,922
Swallow your spit.

1073
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,007
You heartless jerk.

1074
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:01,970
I'm exhausted.

1075
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,682
You should work out more
if you're exhausted from that.

1076
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,060
You try sitting in front of a computer
for ten years

1077
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,022
and see if your body comes out unscathed.

1078
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,691
That's still just an excuse.
You could've worked out more.

1079
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,443
It's so hot.

1080
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,153
Why isn't there any wind?

1081
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,740
Come here for a second.

1082
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,618
What now? What are you doing?

1083
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,869
Stand right here.

1084
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,832
Are you seriously going to use me
as your human shield again?

1085
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,334
You're my changing room this time.

1086
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,919
Hide me while I take these off.

1087
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,922
Why are you doing this to me?

1088
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,097
Jeez.

1089
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:52,062
How many layers did you wear?
Are you a nesting doll or something?

1090
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,563
What's that?

1091
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,149
You know, the Russian toy
that has dolls inside dolls.

1092
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,694
Are you saying I look like a doll?

1093
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,030
More like a dolt.

1094
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,281
I will end you.

1095
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,116
Just finish your shedding.

1096
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,827
I'm letting you off
for so many things today.

1097
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,050
Can I turn around?

1098
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,137
Hey, I'm turning around.

1099
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,022
Why didn't you answer me?

1100
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,734
I should've listened to you.

1101
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,489
Now Mom won't talk to me for a whole day.

1102
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,117
I'd say two days.

1103
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,036
That sucks.

1104
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,999
I should've looked more closely
at my mom's face then.

1105
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,584
I missed her.

1106
00:54:58,753 --> 00:54:59,963
You should've been honest.

1107
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,382
Why did you tell her that you cheated?

1108
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,510
You don't believe

1109
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,137
that I cheated?

1110
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,681
Why not?

1111
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,519
Maybe I'm an irresistible femme fatale.

1112
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,480
-You?
-Hey.

1113
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:22,777
You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

1114
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,862
The truth is…

1115
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,782
I'm hiding something huge.

1116
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,827
Just keep hiding it then.

1117
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,912
You're so annoying.

1118
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,497
Fine, I don't care.

1119
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,958
You won't guess in a million years anyway.

1120
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,295
It doesn't affect me at all.
I'm completely fine.

1121
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,172
You don't seem fine.

1122
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,304
You made two huge life decisions at once.

1123
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,057
Only a doll would be undamaged by that.

1124
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,269
So you really think I'm a doll, don't you?

1125
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,274
Maybe a satanic doll.

1126
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,442
Shut up.

1127
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:12,952
I just…

1128
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,290
felt like my life was getting overheated.

1129
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,169
You know how hard I've worked.

1130
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,672
I was studying in Korea,

1131
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,342
then I suddenly went to the US

1132
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,802
and had to adapt to that life.

1133
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,428
Then I got a job

1134
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,013
and got engaged too.

1135
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,850
Going at full throttle
all the time like that…

1136
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,687
overloaded my CPU.

1137
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,482
The screen went blank,

1138
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,110
and the keys stopped working.

1139
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,737
So I had no choice

1140
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,199
but to reboot myself.

1141
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,915
That was my excuse for quitting my job
and calling off my engagement.

1142
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,754
That was brave of you.

1143
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,631
It was.

1144
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,051
So I had to come back
before my courage expired

1145
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,930
and my resolve crumbled into nothing.

1146
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,522
Excuse me. Could you take a photo of us?

1147
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,482
-Sure.
-Thank you.

1148
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:26,985
Over there.

1149
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,865
-On three.
-Okay.

1150
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,783
One, two, three.

1151
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:35,827
Take a horizontal one too.

1152
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,911
Okay.

1153
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,832
One, two, three.

1154
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,543
-Here.
-Thanks.

1155
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,878
Thank you.

1156
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,254
Do you want a photo too?

1157
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,297
-No.
-No, thank you.

1158
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,174
It was as if on cue.

1159
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,426
You guys are totally in sync.

1160
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,179
You must have dated a long time
to get that way.

1161
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,263
-No, we're not…
-No.

1162
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,391
Then how do you know each other?

1163
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,185
He's the son of my mom's friend.

1164
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,478
She's the daughter of my mom's friend.

1165
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,856
-Goodbye, then.
-Thank you.

1166
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,283
It's Dong-jin.

1167
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,534
Hey, wait!

1168
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,870
Hello?

1169
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:22,207
Mom wants Seok-ryu to come home.
She says she won't hit her anymore.

1170
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,334
She's out of energy.

1171
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,629
Is that so? All right.

1172
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,507
What did he say?

1173
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,343
Your mother calmed down

1174
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,594
and wants you back home.

1175
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,721
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

1176
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,681
She's not going to be violent anymore

1177
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,934
and wants to resolve this peacefully.

1178
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,186
And I'm saying I don't believe her.

1179
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,563
You saw how she broke her promise
to hear me out.

1180
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,690
She's only going to smack me again.

1181
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,151
She wouldn't.
She has bad shoulders and wrists.

1182
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:54,155
She looked healthy enough earlier
when she was going at it.

1183
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,698
I can come with you if you want.

1184
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,992
Why are you suddenly being nice?

1185
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:01,246
It's just that Aunt Mi-suk
likes me better than you.

1186
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,917
It's so annoying that I can't deny that.

1187
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,502
Wait up!

1188
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,838
Jeez.

1189
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,976
Good work today.

1190
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,144
Can you give this to the patient

1191
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,938
who came in with me earlier?

1192
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,773
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

1193
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,359
Excuse me.

1194
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,194
Oh, hello.

1195
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,280
How is your hand?

1196
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,948
It's fine.

1197
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,117
I'm sorry.

1198
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,327
I shouldn't have interfered like that.

1199
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,829
It's okay.

1200
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,915
You looked a little foolish,
but I have a soft spot for kindness.

1201
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,250
Goodbye then.

1202
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,879
-Excuse me.
-What is it now?

1203
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,716
Is it okay for me to ask your name?

1204
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,927
Listen. I've been a paramedic
for six years.

1205
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:01,389
Of all the people who have asked
for my name and number to thank me,

1206
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,391
no one actually got in touch with me.

1207
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,851
I will, though.

1208
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,561
But I'm not telling you.

1209
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,229
-Goodbye!
-Wait!

1210
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,360
JAESEUNG UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

1211
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:17,655
Here you go.

1212
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,490
What's this?

1213
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,869
The paramedic who brought you in
told me to give you this.

1214
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,208
They're glucose candies.

1215
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,461
Take them if you get dizzy
from low blood sugar.

1216
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,005
Don't drink alcohol anymore, okay?

1217
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,676
Call 911 right away if you need help.

1218
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,944
THE CHUNGWOO DAILY

1219
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,154
As for me…

1220
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,658
I have a soft spot for touching stories.

1221
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:15,963
Wait a second.

1222
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:17,799
Give me a minute.

1223
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,388
I'm not prepared yet.

1224
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,305
You'll never be.

1225
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:25,932
Hey, wait!

1226
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,185
Who is it?

1227
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,729
It's me, Aunt Mi-suk. I brought Seok-ryu.

1228
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,981
Okay. Come in.

1229
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,111
See?

1230
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,449
You go in first.

1231
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,469
I think she's crying.

1232
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,181
Mom.

1233
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,476
Are you crying?

1234
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,480
I'm sorry, Mom.

1235
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,691
Don't cry.

1236
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:26,659
Come here.

1237
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,828
Let's see this out to the end.

1238
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:30,955
Run!

1239
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:32,999
What are you doing?

1240
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,418
I brought her to you,

1241
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,044
so do whatever you want with her.

1242
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,425
Hey! That little… Open up!

1243
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,676
Open up!

1244
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,681
Come on, open the door.

1245
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:52,185
I should've known you'd betray me!
You're dead meat tomorrow!

1246
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,436
Tomorrow?

1247
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,605
Do you think you'll be alive tomorrow?

1248
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:56,522
Mom.

1249
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,108
Just hear me out.

1250
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,819
-Come inside.
-Getting mad is bad for your health.

1251
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,989
Okay, fine! Mom!

1252
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,824
-Come here.
-Mom!

1253
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,619
Just tell it to me straight!
What happened?

1254
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:10,870
Just tell me!

1255
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:21,214
Is it true that you can't speak Korean?

1256
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,591
It's because he was born abroad.

1257
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,218
Then say something in a foreign language.

1258
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,677
Come on!

1259
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,471
Looks like he can't do anything.

1260
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,807
Are you dumb?

1261
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,391
Hey!

1262
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,851
It's Bae Seok-ryu.

1263
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:37,104
She'll kill you
if you make fun of this idiot.

1264
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,065
What did you just say?

1265
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,817
Say it again.

1266
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:45,029
I'll kill you if you bother my baby again!

1267
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,954
Now that she's back,
it's going to get chaotic again.

1268
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:56,958
You already hit me there, Mom!
Hit me somewhere else!

1269
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,669
Does it hurt? Then you know how I feel!

1270
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,671
You're about to reach your 60th birthday.

1271
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,464
Shouldn't that make you more lenient?

1272
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:13,099
Just hear me out, please!

1273
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,810
It hurts!

1274
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,645
COMEBACK

1275
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:23,568
COME BACK HOME

1276
01:04:55,850 --> 01:05:00,229
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1277
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,316
I basically raised Seung-hyo.

1278
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,860
Don't trust her.
Every word she says is a lie.

1279
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,361
This girl was

1280
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,531
the first lunatic I met in my life.

1281
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,951
I can't believe that picky little kid
grew up to be such a successful man.

1282
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:15,703
I'm proud of you.

1283
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,246
Seok-ryu.

1284
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,164
What are you doing here?

1285
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,124
You don't want me here, do you?

1286
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,001
You never wanted me to come back.

1287
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,502
That's why you got rid of my room.

1288
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,838
I turned back time.

1289
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,007
I recreated your embarrassing past.

1290
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:35,181
