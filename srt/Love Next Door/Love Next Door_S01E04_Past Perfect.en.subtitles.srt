1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,977
LOVE NEXT DOOR

2
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,022
Hey, I'm just curious.

3
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,274
Hypothetically.

4
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,404
Let's say you could swim again.

5
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,282
If that were to happen,

6
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,535
would you still be an architect?

7
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:20,872
Yeah.

8
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,332
Really?

9
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,249
Of course.

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,502
What about you?

11
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,129
-What?
-Hypothetically.

12
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,757
Let's say you go back to before you quit.

13
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,177
If you could go back to Greip,

14
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,137
would you go back?

15
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,807
No.

16
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,225
Here's another.

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,144
Hypothetically.

18
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,190
If you could go back to before
your engagement was called off,

19
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,235
what would you do?

20
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:53,863
No.

21
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,782
I wouldn't go back.

22
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:02,997
Okay, then.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,429
Hey.

24
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,433
Seriously?
Should I just kill you right now?

25
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,103
Come on!

26
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,273
Hey!

27
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,736
Okay! I said okay!

28
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,076
Hey, why do you carry around
all of these clothes with you?

29
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,955
I go on a lot of business trips.
I keep a change of clothes in my car.

30
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,545
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

31
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,381
You're so short.

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,343
You insulted me with three little words.
You're so cruel.

33
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,763
That's how big your uniform was
when we started high school, right?

34
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,142
I had to fold my sleeves twice
and my skirt three times.

35
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,978
Jeez, my mom sure did dream big.

36
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,022
She thought I'd grow tall like a model.

37
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,983
Yeah, and in reality,
you came up so short.

38
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,777
Don't look down on me
as you say stuff like that.

39
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,820
It's making me mad.

40
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,406
And up until middle school,
I was taller than you!

41
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,242
Yeah, the Earth must've loved you so much.

42
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,203
I think your body
took the full force of its gravity…

43
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,623
-You little…
-Hey! You don't want to open this?

44
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,417
-Give it to me.
-Put your foot down.

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,506
Damn it.

46
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,841
Drumroll!

47
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:41,804
And now, we'll begin
the time capsule opening ceremony!

48
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,769
Damn it, are you going to play along
or what? I'm trying hard here!

49
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,687
I've already looked, so I'm not excited.

50
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,688
Traitor.

51
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,108
That's right. We should call Mo-eum too.

52
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,652
Call her after, you dummy.

53
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,694
You're right.

54
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,699
I'm opening it.

55
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,664
There are only two letters in here.

56
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,251
Is this yours? Where's Mo-eum's?

57
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,461
Yeah, that's strange. But why?

58
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,966
-That's all there was?
-I don't know. I looked at yours first.

59
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,594
Did it fall out into the water?

60
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,721
These wouldn't be dry then, you dummy.

61
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,683
Let's read our own first.

62
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,395
Okay. It's self-service shame.

63
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,523
TO BAE SEOK-RYU

64
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:38,945
Wow, I really was ridiculous.

65
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,155
How much did all of these stickers cost?

66
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,868
I was still a moody teenager then.

67
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,037
What do you mean "I cry sometimes"?

68
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,457
"First"? I must've been crazy.

69
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,295
I said coming in first was
the only drug I allowed myself to take.

70
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,340
What is this? Look at this font.
It looks like hieroglyphics.

71
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,718
Online social networks
ruined so many people.

72
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,886
-Are you done?
-What?

73
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,264
-What does yours say?
-Nothing much.

74
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,391
Let me see it. You read mine.

75
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,184
-Show me too!
-I said it's nothing!

76
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,313
-Why are you hiding it?
-What?

77
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,106
Did you bad-mouth me?

78
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,694
-You did!
-Wait!

79
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,903
I'll kill you!

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,530
Stop right there!

81
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,991
Choisseung! Stop!

82
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,578
You're dead!

83
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,249
Get back here!

84
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,752
Hey, come back here!

85
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,588
Hey! You little punk!

86
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,465
Damn it. I'm so tired.

87
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,967
I think I taste blood!

88
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,471
What on earth did he write?

89
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,430
Hey!

90
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,808
Gosh, he's so fast.

91
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,685
I'm so tired.

92
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,868
TEN YEARS FROM NOW

93
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,787
YOU PROBABLY TOLD SEOK-RYU HOW YOU FELT

94
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,554
By then, you probably told Seok-ryu
how you felt, right?

95
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,063
I must've been crazy.

96
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,571
Tell her what?

97
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,620
Jeez.

98
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,039
I'm going to lose it.

99
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,334
I was young. A moody teen.
I was all over the place.

100
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,337
I had those feelings.

101
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,714
I did have such feelings.

102
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,802
But still, how could I
leave evidence like that?

103
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,139
I was momentarily out of my mind then.
I was crazy.

104
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,473
It's way in the past now.

105
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,143
Those feelings have long since expired.

106
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,727
I feel nothing now.

107
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,189
I mean it. I had those feelings,

108
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,858
but not anymore.

109
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,633
There's a when, where, and how.

110
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,053
I forgot to add the what.

111
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,767
My dream isn't here either.
There's no hint.

112
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,241
PAST PERFECT

113
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,008
What on earth? What's with
the flowers instead of breakfast?

114
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,595
Do people only live off of food?

115
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,057
We live off of mood and romance too.

116
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,433
Aren't they pretty?

117
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,062
That doesn't sound like you at all.
Give me some rice.

118
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,647
All right!

119
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,528
Also, lend me 300,000 won.

120
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,072
Why do you need so much?

121
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,158
Well, Kwang-man's father passed away.

122
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,284
It's for condolence money.

123
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,787
We can't give that much
in our current situation.

124
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,915
-Just give 200,000 won.
-He's a close friend.

125
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:01,874
It's Kwang-man…

126
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,335
He lives in Jeju, so I can't even go.

127
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,878
I should at least show my sincerity.

128
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:10,049
Whatever. I can't give it to you.
I don't have any money.

129
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,718
Then, why would you buy
these dumb flowers if you're broke?

130
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,262
In-suk bought them for me!

131
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,514
I'm nervous to even buy spinach!

132
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,266
How could I buy flowers?

133
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,559
Jeez, this is pointless.

134
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,272
He used to pick wildflowers
from the street for me.

135
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,524
-You're not going to eat?
-No, I'm not!

136
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,942
I don't have money to eat!

137
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,668
Are you leaving now?

138
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,884
I just got in. Where's Seung-hyo?

139
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,972
He left for work.

140
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,309
-Are you going somewhere?
-To work.

141
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,854
Right now? Is your leave over now?

142
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,066
I have a few days left.
I'm just paying a visit today.

143
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,359
Is that so?

144
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,319
As soon as I hear

145
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,739
the good news
about when I'm going to leave,

146
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,865
I'll let you know.

147
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,908
There's no need
to bother asking me every time.

148
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,660
That's not what I meant.

149
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,120
I'm late.

150
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,209
I guess…

151
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,464
she'll be leaving again soon.

152
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,804
Was that a hit-and-run?

153
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,353
Can't you see the sign on my face?
It says, "Don't mess with me."

154
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,313
No, it says, "My face is very puffy."

155
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,773
I dare you to keep going.

156
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,317
-Where are you going?
-The library. Why?

157
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,735
Okay, bye.

158
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,236
What?

159
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,739
Aren't you curious as to why?

160
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,616
-You can ask me!
-What for?

161
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,410
I'm going to do something amazing!
Do you want to see?

162
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,538
VOCATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIA

163
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,291
Self-exploration. Starting today,
I'm searching for my dream.

164
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,960
You're going to look for it in a book?

165
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,879
Studying came easily to me.

166
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,051
Hey, I read a little in advance.

167
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,096
How about a perfumer?
It has a cool vibe.

168
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,182
No? Then…

169
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,518
A watch repairer!
With a craftsman's attitude.

170
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,812
No? Then…

171
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,023
How about something unique,
like breeding stag beetles? Cool, right?

172
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,151
Or how about opening an antique store?

173
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,114
Hey, I saw TV show once,
and chess players were so cool.

174
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,658
Just take that and get out.

175
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,827
I know you're here for the free coffee.

176
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,831
Was I obvious?
Prices are so inflated these days.

177
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,793
The kitchen here is really nice.

178
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,963
It's for the employees,
but no one uses it.

179
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,756
Look at how shiny the stove is.

180
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,134
I know. This is brand new.

181
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,052
Hey, Seung-hyo!

182
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,138
Hello.

183
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,598
Hey, pinch my cheeks.

184
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,142
No, that's inappropriate.

185
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,268
Don't be like that!

186
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,271
It's because I don't know
if I'm dreaming or not!

187
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,398
-Want me to do it for you?
-No, don't!

188
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,399
Okay.

189
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,442
Hey, Seung-hyo.

190
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,862
Greip contacted us!

191
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,243
Greip's building a new office in Seoul.

192
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,080
They want a draft proposal from us
and Hwawoon Architecture.

193
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,499
I get Hwawoon.
It's one of the five big firms.

194
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,084
But why newbies like us?

195
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,919
Do you know my friend Jin-kyu?

196
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,589
Yeah, he works
for an architecture firm in the US.

197
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah, that firm works a lot with Greip,

198
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,636
and they're in charge
of the project in Korea this time.

199
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,100
They're looking for a local firm
to collaborate with and he recommended us!

200
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,144
Really?

201
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:54,356
Yeah, Greip just sent me an email!

202
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,158
I think my anxiety with English
is an incurable illness.

203
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,701
Can you read this, Seung-hyo?

204
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,704
-I can read it.
-We need to write a reply.

205
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,165
-Do we have to?
-What?

206
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,043
Are you just going to
leave them on read then?

207
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,711
You know a little English.

208
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,755
You went backpacking
in the US during college.

209
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,340
That was a long time ago.

210
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,175
My skills aren't business-level.

211
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,219
What do we do now?

212
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,221
Should we hire an interpreter?

213
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,974
Greip has global standards.

214
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,437
From ceiling height to lighting,
they should be applied to the design.

215
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,608
Greip has complicated procedures,

216
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,235
so there will be a lot of discussions.

217
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,071
Communication skills will be important.

218
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,198
Jennifer's the one who sent the email.

219
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,450
She's pretty meticulous.

220
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,618
Wait!

221
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,913
I heard you worked
for a company in the US.

222
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,872
Was that here?

223
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,207
Yeah, it was Greip.

224
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,000
Goodness.

225
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,296
Seok-ryu, if you have time,
can you save us?

226
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,881
-What?
-How much?

227
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,592
How much would it cost to hire you
as a part-time employee?

228
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,178
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.
Cut it out.

229
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,639
I'm sorry. I'm a little busy.

230
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,058
There's something I really need to find.

231
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,518
Yeah, she's looking for something.

232
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,686
It's urgent too.

233
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,188
Please.

234
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,691
Can't you do us this favor?
This is very important to us.

235
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,736
Myeong-u, I'll sign up
for English classes tomorrow. I can do it.

236
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,574
Yeah, you're Seung-hyo's friend.

237
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,577
Why would you use me like that?
Don't worry about it.

238
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,744
-We'll find a way.
-Stop.

239
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,829
-I'll do it.
-What?

240
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,622
Seok-ryu.

241
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,790
I'll help you.

242
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,638
-Are you snooping?
-My gosh!

243
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,974
I'm keeping an eye out
for potential scandals.

244
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,435
Na-yun, don't tell me.

245
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,312
"Men and women can't be friends."

246
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,521
Are you that kind of person?

247
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,357
Millennials and Gen Z like you
can't think like that.

248
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,320
Mr. Yoon, to be clear,
you're a part of that generation too.

249
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,906
-What?
-You're a millennial.

250
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,783
You were born
between the early 1980s and early 2000s.

251
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,869
Is that so?

252
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,121
That means we're in the same group.

253
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,748
I guess I'm still young.

254
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,710
Did you have to hire
his female friend like this?

255
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,837
Daughter of his mom's friend,
not a female friend.

256
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,590
That's the same thing!

257
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,721
You can yell at me all you want.
We're the same generation.

258
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,400
You sure this won't be a problem?
You'll be involved with Greip again.

259
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,195
That's true.

260
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,033
So why did you agree to help?

261
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,118
Because of me?

262
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,954
Of course.

263
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,291
Hey, it's already 6:00 p.m.
Aren't you going home?

264
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,043
I have a mountain of work to do.

265
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,003
Still, we should eat dinner.

266
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,588
You only had a sandwich for lunch.

267
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,256
I'm not hungry.

268
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,885
Don't skip your meals!
All of this is to survive anyway!

269
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,554
Go if you're going to nag.
You're done for the day.

270
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,931
No, I'm not.

271
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,726
-What are you doing?
-Reading comic books.

272
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,937
It's an advanced version
of doing self-exploration.

273
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,441
"This story has only one main character."

274
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,194
There's a writer and a model.

275
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,322
"Being cool is the only weapon
for those who are powerless."

276
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,784
"This is Wonjoong High School basketball."

277
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,704
-How about basketball?
-You can't play basketball.

278
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,622
Not as a player. I could be a coach.

279
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,833
You're at it again.

280
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,169
-Hey!
-What?

281
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,841
Is your work fun? Is it worth
starving yourself for 24 hours?

282
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,593
I could starve for 72 hours.

283
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,902
VICE MINISTER
KWAK SE-HWAN

284
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,321
How does it feel to be
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs?

285
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,408
Just sit and drink your tea.

286
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,994
Earl Grey?

287
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,040
You were the UK ambassador for so long
that your tastes have changed.

288
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,045
It's because I'm old now.
Too much coffee hurts my stomach.

289
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,838
Did you know?

290
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,300
People call you the Colin Firth
of the Foreign Ministry.

291
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,762
You were more like Alain Delon
when we first joined.

292
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,057
Hey, did you come here to insult me?

293
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,641
Both our names were mentioned.

294
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,352
But only I got the job,
so is this revenge?

295
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,063
What are you saying?

296
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,191
I'm not suited to be stuck
in an office like this.

297
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,401
I want to travel the world.

298
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,613
Yeah, that suits you.

299
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,491
So where will you
send me this time, Vice Minister?

300
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,243
I've been in Korea
for almost two months now.

301
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,830
Already? Time sure flies.

302
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,876
I'm starting to get antsy.

303
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,837
I'm okay with rough areas too.
Just send me anywhere.

304
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,465
I'll work extra hard
for the rest of my term.

305
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,718
Yes, ma'am.
I'll discuss it with the minister.

306
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,055
How about we go eat?

307
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,015
Yeah, sure.

308
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,455
Mi-suk!

309
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,541
Suk!

310
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,210
Hye-suk! This was heavy.
What luck. Give me a ride.

311
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,003
Did you go grocery shopping?

312
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:56,260
Gosh, it's always the same
for a cook like me. Did you have dinner?

313
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,177
Not yet.

314
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,929
Come over and eat.

315
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,806
I'll season bracken for you. You love it.

316
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,558
Forget it. I'd be a nuisance.

317
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,519
It's just another spoon on the table.
It's not a nuisance.

318
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,770
Call your husband too.

319
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,605
He's busy. What for?

320
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,025
Doesn't your husband eat at home?

321
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,570
He needs to work the dinner rush!
He better not come home.

322
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,489
Jeez, why is my ear so itchy?

323
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,325
Is my wife badmouthing me again?

324
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,244
So you were outside.

325
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,204
Hello, Professor!

326
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,542
Well, I should be inside
for the dinner rush,

327
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,043
but there aren't any customers.

328
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,006
Then, can I order something?

329
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,424
There's nothing at home.

330
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,928
Of course. Why would you say it so sadly?
Come on in.

331
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,319
Hey.

332
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,198
Are you okay with some soju?

333
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,783
It's fine with me,
but don't you have to work?

334
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,121
It's no big deal.
I can just close for the night.

335
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,207
Let me.

336
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,583
It's an honor.

337
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,129
The top emergency medicine professor
in the country is pouring me soju.

338
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,590
You're too kind.

339
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,926
You must've had some free time today.

340
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,010
You're always busy.

341
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,888
The kids these days keep leaving me out.

342
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,890
I guess I'm an old-timer now.

343
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,393
You can take this chance to rest.
What's there to worry about?

344
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,985
After you collapsed,
did you have any other symptoms?

345
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,695
No, none.

346
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,074
I'm doing fine thanks to you.

347
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,495
But I'm always getting injured.

348
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,913
You are?

349
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,416
My wife is always poking
and prodding incessantly.

350
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,627
It's a new fatal wound every day.

351
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,047
If only I made good money,

352
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,883
I wouldn't be treated with such disdain.

353
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,641
On that note, I'm so envious of you.

354
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,061
It's pointless. What's money really worth?

355
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,398
So arrogant…

356
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,732
Gosh, I hate you.

357
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,235
It's jerks who have…

358
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,197
People who have everything
always say things like that.

359
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,201
But those who have nothing know
how important money is.

360
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,038
You need a lot of money to look generous.

361
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,083
It's the same when going to buy fruit.

362
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,835
A box of tangerines for 5,000 won

363
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,338
can't compare to the huge hallabongs
that cost 10,000 or 20,000 won.

364
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,009
I can only buy the tangerines.
It's the same with ice cream.

365
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,220
I can't buy the ones in quarts.
I have to buy single popsicles.

366
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,806
Ingeo-ppang! Those always look good.

367
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,350
But I buy the cheap bungeo-ppang.

368
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,271
I envy you.

369
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,939
What?

370
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,484
Why didn't I ever think about
buying something to bring home?

371
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,115
That's because you're busy.

372
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,702
Let's just drink.

373
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,619
Sure.

374
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,845
It's you, right?
The paramedic Jung Mo-eum?

375
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,889
The broken glass from the Han River?

376
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,432
Wait, the rice cakes.

377
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,643
Yes. Did the rice cakes taste all right?

378
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,062
Yes, they did.

379
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,273
But how did you know I worked there?
I didn't tell you my name.

380
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,691
I looked into it.

381
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,902
I'm not the type to forget
to show my gratitude.

382
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,944
I see.

383
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,071
By the way…

384
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,781
-Do you live near here?
-Yes.

385
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,365
I moved here recently.

386
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,161
-It's so nice to run into you.
-Really?

387
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:57,250
I'm sorry, but how long
are you going to hold this for?

388
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,462
I think it can be resolved if you let go.

389
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,341
You just said you never forget
to show gratitude.

390
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,927
You can't let me have this one drink?

391
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,096
That principle's engraved in my bones.

392
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,473
But this is a different issue.

393
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,266
You're very firm.

394
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,477
Just like my name. Kang Dan-ho.

395
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,771
I guess people do live up to their names.

396
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,983
Yes, all right.
Mr. Kang Dan-ho, let me be firm as well.

397
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,402
My hand touched this can first.

398
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,987
And it's my favorite drink.

399
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,823
It's cool and refreshing.

400
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,575
Yes, it's like a stroll through the forest
for your taste buds.

401
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,204
I relieve the day's fatigue with this too.

402
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,874
I really love this drink.
I've been drinking it for 20 years.

403
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,168
I've been drinking it for 21 years now.

404
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,337
Mo-eum?

405
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,380
Mr. Kang?

406
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,259
Mr. Choi?

407
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,393
It's surprising to hear you moved
to our neighborhood.

408
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,521
I had no idea
I'd run into you like this again.

409
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,566
Are you really a reporter
for The Chungwoo Daily?

410
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,735
-You're not an impersonator?
-He did a story on me.

411
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,362
-You want to see?
-Forget it.

412
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:11,074
But you know Choisseung and Mo-eum.

413
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,660
It really is a small world.

414
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,330
It's fate that we met like this,
so how about a toast?

415
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,790
Sure, sounds good.

416
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,625
Toast, my foot.

417
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,880
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

418
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,098
Thanks for letting me have this.

419
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,059
I didn't exactly let you have it.

420
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,396
You took it and paid for it
while I was saying hi to Mr. Choi.

421
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,774
How do you have such similar tastes?

422
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,109
And about little things too.

423
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,569
Is that so?

424
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,031
It's our first time meeting,
but you're strangely familiar.

425
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,118
I haven't been in Korea for ten years.

426
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,162
Is it because I have a pretty face?

427
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,705
Don't go around saying that.

428
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,749
-You'll get hit with a rock.
-Do you want to die?

429
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,209
-What?
-Who asked?

430
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,752
Jeez.

431
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,171
I'm sorry. I must've been mistaken.

432
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,551
So are you all childhood friends?

433
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,386
Yes, you could say that.

434
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,680
To be more precise, our moms were friends.

435
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,598
High school friends.

436
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,476
We've hung out together like this
since we were kids.

437
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,228
Somehow, we're still together.

438
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,355
That's nice.

439
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,565
I was always jealous of people

440
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,525
with neighborhood friends.

441
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,403
Where did you used to live?

442
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,113
Sorry?

443
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,033
Well… Just around.

444
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,871
I have something urgent to take care of.
I should go.

445
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,122
What? All of a sudden?

446
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,540
-Next time… Sorry.
-What?

447
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,583
-See you later.
-What?

448
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,502
-Bye.
-What?

449
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,589
That was so sudden.

450
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,091
Did I say something wrong?

451
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,676
That was suspicious.

452
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,469
You still don't trust people?

453
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,846
I mean, why would he leave so suddenly?

454
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,600
He avoided that question
about where he lived too.

455
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,811
He didn't want to talk
about personal matters.

456
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,187
I just remembered! Hey, Mo-eum.

457
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,107
Do you remember burying that time capsule?

458
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,024
Yeah.

459
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,068
We dug that up recently.

460
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:10,986
Yeah.

461
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,696
Your letter was gone.

462
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,364
That's all?

463
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,242
I dug it up that night. I was curious.

464
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,870
Damn it. Mo-eum was the real traitor!

465
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,123
Do you remember what we wrote?

466
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,503
Seok-ryu's letter was no real surprise.
It was just like you.

467
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,339
As for Seung-hyo…

468
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,051
I don't remember.

469
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,721
You guys are so honest!

470
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,556
You finally opened it after all this time?

471
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,059
Yeah, but you know what Choisseung did?

472
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,061
He read mine and wouldn't show me his.

473
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:45,979
-Really?
-Yeah.

474
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,606
Hello?

475
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,152
I was going to call you later. Yes.

476
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,904
It's a good thing his dream
wasn't to become an actor.

477
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,242
Does Mo-eum remember what I wrote?

478
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,828
No way. That's not possible.

479
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,039
She can't remember. Damn it.

480
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,461
Okay, get home safely.

481
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,340
Did they get home?

482
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,632
-Yeah.
-That's great.

483
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,843
A complaint suddenly came in.

484
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,094
Handling complaints is tough.

485
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,012
Great job.

486
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,472
-Yeah.
-Great job.

487
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,520
Are you going to get up?

488
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,689
Jeez.

489
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,402
What time is it?

490
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,737
It's 9:00 a.m., you fool.

491
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,783
Why did you wake me so late?
I have to get ready for work!

492
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:44,120
If you care so much about work,
why did you close early yesterday?

493
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,039
What? Who said that?

494
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,375
Ms. Kang said she saw
while walking by.

495
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,211
I hate this neighborhood. We should move!

496
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,837
It's full of your spies!

497
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,048
Don't commit any crimes then.

498
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,302
Honey, how did I get home last night?

499
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,261
How would I know?

500
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,391
-Get up!
-She's so angry.

501
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,479
Honey, can I take the day off?

502
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,565
That foolish bum!

503
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,484
I can't even get rid of him!

504
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:17,946
What's this?

505
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,411
I'm exhausted.

506
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,746
What's that smell?

507
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,917
-It's coming from you
-Jeez.

508
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,001
Geun-sik.

509
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,753
-I smell flowers.
-Try to steady yourself.

510
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,006
My goodness! Who are you?

511
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,801
-Wait…
-Roses.

512
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,137
-Roses!
-Geun-sik!

513
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,013
They're roses!

514
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,101
-You look
-Geun-sik!

515
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,229
-Don't do that!
-Just like a rose

516
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,564
Geun-sik!

517
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,899
Hold on a minute!

518
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,569
-When
-Let's go home.

519
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,362
-Come on now.
-I call out for you

520
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,321
All right.

521
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,740
Wait a second!

522
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:06,202
When I call out for you

523
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,245
Geun-sik?

524
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,039
I'll call you a rose

525
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,541
Okay, okay.

526
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,209
-Let's go home.
-I'm going.

527
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,669
-I'm on my way.
-Yeah.

528
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,504
I'm going. I'm not going home!

529
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,882
I'm not going home!

530
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,676
-You'll hurt yourself!
-I won't go home.

531
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,762
-Geun-sik!
-I won't go home!

532
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,473
You look like a rose

533
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,557
Geun-sik, you punk!

534
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,809
Snap out of it, man!

535
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,727
Sir?

536
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,312
Go home!

537
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,314
-I'll go home.
-Go home!

538
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,440
-Yes, sir.
-Stop it.

539
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,900
-Okay.
-Stop it, okay?

540
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:37,901
Go.

541
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,818
-Go!
-Yes, sir.

542
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,322
Let's go.

543
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,032
Let's go home.

544
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,284
-Don't yell at me like that.
-Come on.

545
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,495
I won't go home if you yell at me!

546
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,456
You're dead tonight. Come here!

547
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm getting so fat.

548
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:11,017
Goodness, my dear wife.
She never means what she says.

549
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,727
She loves me so much.

550
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,979
That's hot! Damn! What the heck?

551
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,982
What's wrong with my hands?

552
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,820
They hurt so much! It hurts.

553
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,449
Goodness, Geun-sik.

554
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,994
When did he pick these for me?
This is what I live for.

555
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,352
Wow!

556
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,148
Everything is so much easier
with you here.

557
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,234
It's all flowing smoothly like a stream!

558
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,154
This must be what it feels like to gain
the strength of a thousand armies.

559
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,574
Don't overdo it. It lacks sincerity.

560
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:11,160
Why would you distort my intent like that?

561
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,038
You know I'm being sincere, right?

562
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,707
Of course.

563
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,626
I bet it's hard working
with such a misfit.

564
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,586
It is.

565
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,880
When did you two get so close?

566
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,886
Our friendship started
after we began following each other.

567
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,346
Following each other?

568
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,473
On social media.

569
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,434
He had a lot of followers.

570
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,894
A lot of foreigners too.

571
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,229
I rarely talk about it.

572
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,149
Hey, I'm pretty well-known
around the world.

573
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,442
You can't speak English.

574
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,487
Look, in this world,

575
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,198
we communicate through preferences,
not language.

576
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,618
-Yeah.
-Na-yun and I follow each other too.

577
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,328
I see.

578
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,081
But I think she has
another private account.

579
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,417
She always takes pictures
of food and selfies.

580
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,377
But she hasn't posted in months.

581
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,422
I'm sorry to tell you,

582
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,470
but there's no employee
who wants to be friends with their boss.

583
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:14,265
I wanted to make a company
where everyone was equal and free.

584
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:20,146
That's too bad.
By the way, why did you quit Greip?

585
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,648
Excuse me?

586
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,233
I mean, they say working at Greip
is the best job in the world.

587
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,320
It's everyone's dream
to join that company. So why?

588
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,160
He never quits, does he?

589
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,038
-The single-family home in Buryeong-dong?
-Yeah.

590
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,374
Did I wreck his house in a past life?

591
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,583
Did I burn it down?

592
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,960
You can do it.

593
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,253
You're an expert
of the architecture world.

594
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,630
-Good luck.
-I can do it.

595
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,177
Hello, Mr. Kang. Have you eaten…

596
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,681
You're so angry that you can't eat?

597
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,183
You must be very upset.

598
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,393
You're doing great.

599
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:02,438
I see! You'd like to speak
with President Choi Seung-hyo?

600
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,316
Yes, just a moment.

601
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,491
Hello, Mr. Kang. It's me.

602
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,786
Yes, how about you try to calm down first.

603
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,289
Can you explain everything one at a time?

604
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,003
It's hard to make a living.

605
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,234
Hello!

606
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,610
Goodness.

607
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,195
-Hello.
-Give it to me.

608
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,280
You must be our neighbor.

609
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,657
You're leaving later than usual.

610
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,075
The story I'm covering is nearby.

611
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,243
I see.

612
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,578
Where are you going?

613
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,748
Where else would I go?
I'm going to the real estate office.

614
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,666
Let's go. I'll carry this for you.

615
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,001
You don't have to.

616
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,085
It's fine.

617
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,462
Aren't you busy?

618
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,589
-It's okay.
-Thanks so much.

619
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,257
This is so heavy!

620
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,467
-Yeah.
-What's in here?

621
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,974
REPORTER KANG DAN-HO

622
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,270
I guess he is a reporter.

623
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,903
Hey, kid.

624
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,113
What are you looking for?
Do you want help?

625
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,241
I'm looking for crop circles.

626
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,202
Crop circles?

627
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,412
Traces left by aliens?

628
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,333
Yes, I saw something shine
in the sky last night.

629
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,461
A UFO might've landed.

630
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,047
Do you believe in aliens?
So do I, my friend!

631
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,591
You're more like my aunt.

632
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,719
Sorry, did I overstep?

633
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,845
Yes.

634
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,722
But I believe in aliens too.

635
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,391
In reality, Santa's an alien too.

636
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,309
What?

637
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:08,022
If Santa wants to deliver presents
all over the world on Christmas Eve,

638
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,274
he has to transcend space and time, right?

639
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,944
Wow, you're a genius.

640
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:13,986
I'll look with you.

641
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,614
That's okay. I can do it alone.

642
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,615
Come on.

643
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,701
My dad told me not to talk to strangers.

644
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,289
What?

645
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,003
-Over here.
-Okay.

646
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,592
Come on in. Right there. Okay.

647
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,345
-Here?
-Not there. On the table inside.

648
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,057
Thank you so much.

649
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,560
Did you just get here?

650
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,602
Hey, Mi-suk.

651
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,312
Who's this?

652
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,816
He just moved in next door.

653
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,026
He carried this heavy box for me.

654
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,237
-Hello.
-Hello.

655
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,738
I should get going.

656
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,740
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

657
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,160
All right.

658
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,579
-Thank you!
-No problem.

659
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,372
Bye, see you again.

660
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,417
He looks decent.

661
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,210
Good personality and good-looking.

662
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,128
Handsome, right?

663
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,964
-What does he do?
-He's a reporter for The Chungwoo Daily.

664
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,926
He'd be a good match for Seok-ryu too.

665
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,637
No, not a chance.

666
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,348
Why not?
Do you have dibs on him for Mo-eum?

667
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,310
No, it's not that. He's…

668
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:33,441
Hello! Yes, this is Hyereung Realty.

669
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,068
Goodness. He lifted this heavy thing
that effortlessly?

670
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,488
The young man's strong too.

671
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,492
He's a reporter and he's strong.

672
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,373
You didn't find it?

673
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,419
What?

674
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,551
-Do you want a bite?
-No.

675
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,845
Why not? Take a bite. I'll share.

676
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,222
No.

677
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,640
Fine.

678
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,808
Want some chocolate?

679
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,726
Okay.

680
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,187
No.

681
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:12,939
Here.

682
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,488
My dad told me not to follow strangers
if they give food.

683
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,324
You don't have to follow me. Just take it.

684
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,620
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you trying to lure me?

685
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,830
Are you up to something?

686
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,332
You've seen a lot of TV!

687
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,251
Are you trying to kidnap me?

688
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,045
And a lot of movies.

689
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,507
I'll call the cops.

690
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,591
No!

691
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,636
I'm not a strange person.

692
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,722
I work in a field very similar
to police officers.

693
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,517
My job is when you call 911…

694
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,735
Not the fire truck, but an ambulance.

695
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,071
Are you a paramedic?

696
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,614
Goodness…

697
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,834
Let's get lunch.

698
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,169
Go ahead. I have work to do.

699
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,879
Stop working and let's go eat!

700
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,881
Why are you getting angry?

701
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,302
You know I'm on a tight schedule.

702
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,430
Hey! Don't do that.
Who cares if they're Greip?

703
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,933
-Don't work with those scumbags!
-What's suddenly gotten into you?

704
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,727
It's already been decided.

705
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,981
Greip's new building
was assigned to Hwawoon already.

706
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:37,940
What do you mean?

707
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,484
I was turning off the monitor,

708
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,195
and I guess the call didn't end,
so I could hear their voices.

709
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,075
Since the schedule's tight,
they want Hwawoon to start right away.

710
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,203
They shortlisted Atelier In,
but said it wouldn't work,

711
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,540
because of its short history
and unproven record.

712
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,252
They said you were the control group.

713
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,589
Did you tell Myeong-u?

714
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,424
No, not yet.

715
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,593
Don't tell him.

716
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,095
-Pretend like you don't know.
-Why?

717
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,973
You're going to continue with this?

718
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,017
You know they're going with Hwawoon.

719
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,186
That information I learned unofficially.

720
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,229
I have to act on what's official.

721
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,690
Okay, then.

722
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,859
Just do it half-heartedly and turn it in.

723
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,196
You're a big shot in Korea.

724
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,031
What does Greip know?

725
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,241
"Half-heartedly"?

726
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,119
I won't do that.

727
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,414
My principle
is not to discriminate between tasks.

728
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,168
It doesn't matter if the odds are low
or the project is small.

729
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,546
As long as it's under Atelier In's name,

730
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,340
I will always do my best.

731
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:49,053
So you're going to be a pawn
in this blatantly rigged game?

732
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,846
What are you, an international doormat?

733
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,764
Seok-ryu.

734
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,517
That's harsh.

735
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,894
I'm not harsh. That industry's the issue!

736
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,355
I know them better than anyone.

737
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,357
No matter how hard you try,

738
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,525
it's a waste of time.

739
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,027
Don't talk about my hard work like that.

740
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,946
Who cares if you know them?

741
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,489
You don't know me.

742
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,200
So you're going to continue
this futile effort

743
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,618
and starve in the process?

744
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,828
Just forget about it.

745
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,330
Fine! I'll get lost while I'm at it too!

746
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,499
Count me out of this one.

747
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,087
Hey, doesn't Mr. Yoon deserve to know?

748
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,366
This place is too shabby

749
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,910
for someone like me.

750
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,634
Hello.

751
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,803
-Hello.
-Is this your first time here?

752
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,223
-Do you live in this neighborhood?
-No, I work nearby.

753
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,642
I see.

754
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,020
The equipment here sucks, right?

755
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,730
I can't say it doesn't.

756
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,024
If we want to get new members,

757
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,526
we need to change all the equipment first.

758
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,153
I've said it again and again.

759
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,488
There's no point.

760
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,573
The gym owner is so old-fashioned.

761
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,991
I see.

762
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,785
His name's Go Seul-gi,
and he used to be a boxer.

763
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,121
He switched to bodybuilding
after he got hurt.

764
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,457
He's a burly guy,
but isn't his name feminine?

765
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,374
You're right.

766
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,753
Still, he's skilled
and has won a lot of medals.

767
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,088
He's fit for his age too.

768
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,342
But how can I describe his mindset?

769
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,386
You know what his nickname is?

770
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,554
No.

771
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,639
It's Gold School.

772
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,349
Because he's old school!

773
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,977
He said exercise is more about sincerity
than equipment or whatever.

774
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,895
I swear.

775
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,272
Hello. Are you here to sign up?

776
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,066
-Yes.
-Right this way.

777
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,111
Damn it.

778
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,365
I met an incredible friend today.

779
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,159
Okay, okay. Let's eat as we talk.

780
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,038
You said you were starving,
so I delivered these myself.

781
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,499
I almost forgot I was hungry.

782
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,630
What kind of friend was it?

783
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,344
It's good.

784
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,137
The egg melts in my mouth.

785
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,557
It's still so hot.

786
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,393
What a speedy delivery, friend. Well done!

787
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,310
Right?

788
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,939
See? There's no friend like me, right?

789
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,025
What kind of amazing person did you meet?

790
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,697
What? A six-year-old kid?

791
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,368
Yeah, but mentally,
she's probably older than you.

792
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,661
She was very profound.

793
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,830
You little brat!

794
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,373
I mean it.

795
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,960
She was this tiny!

796
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,921
She was looking
for crop circles in the grass.

797
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,339
A miniature Jung Mo-eum.

798
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,009
You always looked for E.T. as a kid
and went around doing this.

799
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,927
I did used to do that.

800
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,473
Anyway, she was so smart and cute.

801
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,641
What's her name?

802
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,269
I didn't ask.

803
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,812
Are you sure she lives around here?

804
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:27,938
I don't know.

805
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,234
I should've asked her!

806
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,988
I almost lost my best friend
to a random kid.

807
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,699
Hey, Mo-eum?

808
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,787
Didn't you have portraits of Iron Man,
Spider-Man and other superheroes there?

809
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,331
Why suddenly the North Pole?

810
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,374
It's the South Pole.

811
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,918
It's what I'm interested in
the most these days.

812
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,087
I can't believe your love changed.

813
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,631
From men to the South Pole.

814
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,841
It seemed more productive.

815
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,176
I can't deny that.

816
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,221
Since we're done eating,
let's take a walk around the neighborhood.

817
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,932
-Call Seung-hyo too.
-No! No way!

818
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,934
I'm leaving if you call him.

819
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,020
Did you fight again?

820
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,151
The building has no facade.
Something's missing. How do I put it?

821
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,987
I think it lacks impact.

822
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:17,905
Impact?

823
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:24,036
How about making it prism-shaped
so it refracts and absorbs light

824
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,412
as it creates various colors?

825
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:33,671
Like the harmony of thousands of colors
and ever-evolving,

826
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,800
Greip's archive will be transformed
into a physical space.

827
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,928
Yeah, you know how to put words together
so well.

828
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,181
Hey, this is it. We're done now.

829
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,101
Greip's a done deal for sure.

830
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,438
-Let's see.
-Let's not get our hopes up.

831
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,733
How can I not? It's Greip.

832
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,693
Besides that,

833
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,697
the fact that we were given
this opportunity really excites me.

834
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,242
It feels like we're being rewarded
for all of our hard work.

835
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,995
Not to mention, I trust you.

836
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,874
Choi Seung-hyo's architecture
inspires people.

837
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,252
As long as I have you,

838
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,879
I'm not scared of Hwawoon's team at all!

839
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:21,135
Shall we add the finishing touches?

840
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,182
-Myeong-u.
-Yeah?

841
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,188
Move back 30 centimeters.
You'll hurt your eyes.

842
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,152
You sound like my father sometimes.

843
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,530
Dad!

844
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:48,912
Hello.

845
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,128
It's the reporter again.

846
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,671
It's the paramedic again.

847
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,256
Durian-flavored lollipops.

848
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,091
Have our tastes overlapped again?

849
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,509
It seems so.

850
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,094
Okay.

851
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,764
I think I was first again this time.
Please remove your hand.

852
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,017
I remember I let you have it last time.

853
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,435
-Please step away.
-Listen.

854
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,021
You know this flavor is a rare gem, right?

855
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,025
This convenience store carries this flavor
because of me. Why?

856
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,569
-I'm the only one who buys it!
-Not anymore.

857
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,070
I'll buy it from now on.

858
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,780
Why do you always get the last word in?

859
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,282
You're free to say something too.

860
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,658
For crying out loud.

861
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,089
Are you going to pay?

862
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,760
Yes.

863
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,180
The more, the merrier.

864
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,934
We can now experience the sweetness
of candy from various perspectives.

865
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,103
Yes, I'm experiencing
a new flavor today. Frustration.

866
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,189
-Do you want a ride?
-No.

867
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,608
-Be on your way.
-If you'll excuse me.

868
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,696
What? He has the same car as Mudflat Man.

869
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,451
What's the point? He's so petty!

870
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,254
When will I finish unpacking?

871
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,271
I still had this?

872
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,116
MARCH 2007
SEOUL NATIONAL SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS

873
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,979
POMEGRANATE TREE

874
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,290
Seok-ryu's bothering me with trees now.

875
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,138
Here's a picture I found
from a long time ago.

876
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,974
I knew you two looked familiar.

877
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,147
Seung-hyo, it's time. Let's go.

878
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,065
Okay.

879
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,652
POMEGRANATE TREE

880
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,656
Is Seok-ryu meeting us at the hotel?

881
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,075
No, she's not coming today.

882
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,661
What are you talking about?
She's right there.

883
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,162
Hey, Seok-ryu.

884
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,128
Is it happening again?

885
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,509
The bladder must get worked up when
people get nervous. I have to go again.

886
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,720
-Go ahead.
-Yeah, the bathroom.

887
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,566
-Why did you come today?
-Are you complaining?

888
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,527
You said you wouldn't come.

889
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,279
I was worried they'd bad-mouth you
for not knowing English.

890
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,282
If needed,
I can cuss them out in your stead.

891
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,575
You are good at cussing.

892
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,703
Do you want me to practice on you?

893
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,050
Seok-ryu?

894
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:55,010
That's because I immigrated
to the US when I was eight.

895
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,305
No wonder. So you're an overseas Korean.

896
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,222
That's right.

897
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,435
Most of all,
seeing Seok-ryu again

898
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,145
makes me so happy.

899
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,605
Seok-ryu?

900
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,523
You two know each other?

901
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,525
Yes.

902
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,027
We said hello earlier.

903
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,653
She was the project leader at Greip.

904
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,490
Really?

905
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,118
Wow, old colleagues meeting
across the ocean by chance?

906
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,121
Maybe this is destined to work out.

907
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,539
Right?

908
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,960
She suddenly said
she was returning to Korea then.

909
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,504
so I was really disappointed.

910
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,257
Great job.

911
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,259
Thanks for agreeing with me, Chris.

912
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,637
For sure. Of course, I should agree.
We're on the same team.

913
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,601
You know,
even though this office is like a desert,

914
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,104
but we should be each other's genies.

915
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,272
Genie?

916
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:16,401
Yeah. When you're down
and having a hard time,

917
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,612
you can rub the lamp like this.

918
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,697
Are you asking me for a wish?

919
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,410
This means, "I trust you."

920
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,706
You're passionate, and you have
a strong sense of responsibility.

921
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,713
-Go for it!
-Thanks.

922
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,478
I'm sorry.

923
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,313
Don't move. I'll wipe it up.

924
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,859
My hand slipped.

925
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,492
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Sorry.

926
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,785
I need to go to the bathroom.

927
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,752
Should we take a break for a moment?

928
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,669
Sure.

929
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,850
-You bastard!
-Seung-hyo!

930
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,894
-What's with you?
-What the hell did you just say?

931
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,270
I thought you didn't understand.

932
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,646
-How bothersome.
-Hey.

933
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,857
You think I'd just play along?

934
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,527
I didn't expect fairness,
but this is just crude.

935
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,030
Maybe you're the one
who doesn't know their place?

936
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:16,826
How dare a neighborhood dollar store
design Greip's new building?

937
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,789
And they say the employees of a company
speak volumes about its status.

938
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:26,419
I'm starting to doubt your judgment
for hiring such an unsociable guy.

939
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,379
-You little punk!
-Hey!

940
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,048
Don't do it.

941
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,185
How dare you use violence
against someone from headquarters?

942
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,270
I won't let this go.

943
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,356
Go ahead.

944
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,440
-Do it, asshole.
-Hey!

945
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,401
Talk to me, Chris. This is because of me.

946
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,070
Mr. Yoon, I'll quit.

947
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,905
-What?
-You don't have to pay my full wage.

948
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:54,989
Hey, Seok-ryu!

949
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:07,835
Damn it.

950
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,076
Please, my ass!

951
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:44,747
That…

952
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:49,752
was a punch from a free Bae Seok-ryu,
not a part-time Atelier In employee.

953
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:55,216
This is a gift to my former subordinate
with lousy character.

954
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,021
I haven't worn heels in a while.
They hurt a bit.

955
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:14,193
You've seen me work, so you know
how persistent and tenacious I can be.

956
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,114
This company is more than you deserve.

957
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,576
I dare you to mess with Atelier In.

958
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,704
I'll gather all evidence
of your subcontractor exploitation,

959
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,707
product plagiarism,
neglect of duty, and gaslighting.

960
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,336
And I'll send it
as a gift basket to Greip.

961
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,422
Got it?

962
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,775
Seok-ryu!

963
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,610
Bae Seok-ryu!

964
01:00:58,988 --> 01:00:59,989
Where are you going?

965
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:04,035
I want to be alone. Just let me be.

966
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:17,483
I must be insane.
Why did I go hiking at night?

967
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:25,366
What are you doing?

968
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,034
How are your feet?

969
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,912
I lost feeling in them a while back.

970
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,125
That feels so much better. Jeez.

971
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,880
Why would you walk up here in heels?

972
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,549
Well, it's like voluntary self-punishment.

973
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,261
Did you know

974
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,475
that when Jesus died on the cross
for people's sins, he was 33?

975
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,519
He was the same age as us.

976
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,025
You're going to use
our international age right now?

977
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,444
Can't you see I'm serious?

978
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,238
Keep going.

979
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,492
I mean, it's impressive
he did that at our age.

980
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,703
I struggle with even words that cut deep.

981
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,332
Of course. Even the tiniest
of such remarks would hurt.

982
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,669
Hey, Choisseung.

983
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,506
I was an outcast at Greip.

984
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,470
After I left the company,

985
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,181
I blamed Chris and the others at first.

986
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,851
But I realized something
after seeing you work.

987
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,062
It was actually because of me.

988
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,649
If I was doing something
I enjoyed like you,

989
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,194
I would've endured it to the end
no matter what.

990
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,279
No.

991
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,950
What they did to you
was clearly workplace harassment.

992
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,037
It has nothing to do
with whether you like your work or not.

993
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,165
What I'm saying is…

994
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,752
just because you quit your job

995
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,756
doesn't mean you lacked passion
and determination. Okay?

996
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,969
Also, it makes no sense
for the victim to blame herself.

997
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,723
Jeez, I should've killed that jerk.
Damn it.

998
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,397
This won't do.

999
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,941
Come with me.

1000
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,028
-Where are you going?
-Come on.

1001
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,324
I was just getting comfortable though.

1002
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,951
Where are we going?

1003
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,748
Write them here.

1004
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,917
The names of all the people
who harassed you.

1005
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,878
What? Why all of a sudden?

1006
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,462
Let's start with Chris.

1007
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,882
What are you doing?

1008
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,508
CHRIS

1009
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,511
It seemed like he had
a pretty good physique.

1010
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,016
CHRIS OBESE

1011
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,726
I should've figured.

1012
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,312
He had a lot of hair too.

1013
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,439
"Hair loss."

1014
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,192
Stop it.
It's not like you to be this immature.

1015
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,361
Did you forget what he did to you?

1016
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,661
That jerk has super straight teeth.
He had braces as a kid.

1017
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,331
"Dentures."

1018
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,124
Write athlete's foot. And hemorrhoids.

1019
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,876
-And ingrown toenails.
-Athlete's…

1020
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:23,961
There's not enough space.

1021
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,255
You should've bought a bigger lock.

1022
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,591
We need to write ones
for Susan and Peter too.

1023
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:29,717
I'll write smaller.

1024
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,594
-"Athlete's foot."
-Hemorrhoids.

1025
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,970
-"Hemorrhoids."
-Ingrown toenail.

1026
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,221
Ingrown…

1027
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,266
Don't you think
an ingrown toenail is a bit harsh?

1028
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,643
Just write it all down.

1029
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,311
Yeah, okay. "Ingrown toenail."

1030
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,440
All right, you punks.

1031
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,902
Taste the power these curses
coming all the way from Korea.

1032
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:51,906
First, it was K-pop and K-dramas.
Now, it's K-superstitions, you jerks.

1033
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,205
Feeling better now?

1034
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:03,292
Yeah, much better.

1035
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,294
That's a relief.

1036
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:11,842
Hey, Choisseung.

1037
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,178
I was impressed by you.

1038
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,224
Don't tell me you like me. I'll kill you.

1039
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,934
You crazy fool. It's not that!

1040
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:24,397
It was impressive
how you finished the pitch to Greip.

1041
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,817
You knew it wouldn't work out,
but you didn't give up.

1042
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,443
It was marvelous.

1043
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,028
Is that so?

1044
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,948
You had me going there.

1045
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,909
So I've made up my mind.

1046
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,163
I'll find a place
where I can swim to the very end.

1047
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:46,043
Hey, just you wait. I'm going to do
the freestyle and the butterfly.

1048
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:51,132
Sounds good.

1049
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,766
YOON MYEONG-U

1050
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,769
Shouldn't you answer that?

1051
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:12,987
Hey, Myeong-u. Sorry.

1052
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,238
For what?

1053
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,784
-Well…
-Is it…

1054
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,748
an apology for the exhausting nights
of overtime we have ahead of us?

1055
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,708
What do you mean?

1056
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,378
We got the project from Greip.

1057
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,338
What?

1058
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,676
It's not their office building.
It's a flagship store.

1059
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,928
A new one's opening next year in Seoul.

1060
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,472
They're giving us a chance.

1061
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,893
Wait, are you serious?

1062
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,270
But how?

1063
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:48,939
The design team leader liked our proposal.

1064
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,609
What? What is it?

1065
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:54,653
Is Seok-ryu next to you?
Tell her this for me.

1066
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,574
That jerk Chris was fired from Greip.

1067
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,753
I'll make sure you never work
in this industry again.

1068
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:15,549
Well, I think you'll be the one
who won't be able work again.

1069
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:22,765
I have a habit of recording meetings.

1070
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:26,644
It's a way for me to be more attentive
to our clients' feedback.

1071
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:31,774
But I had no idea this would also serve
as evidence to prove the allegations.

1072
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:34,902
That's an illegal wiretap.

1073
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,863
-Legal validity?
-Yeah.

1074
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,865
Yeah, you're right. But…

1075
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,784
I think it'll work for vigilantism.

1076
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,577
What kind of dog crap is that?

1077
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,537
Meow!

1078
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:50,000
I like cats more than dogs.

1079
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,336
I like going on trips and wine too.

1080
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:55,631
And sneakers!
I go crazy for limited editions shoes!

1081
01:08:55,714 --> 01:09:00,886
But the thing is
I know someone who's just like me.

1082
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,139
"Château Ribello"?

1083
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,099
Ro-hui. Ro-a.

1084
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:09,562
This has an exquisite raspberry
and chocolate aroma. My goodness.

1085
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,857
"Domaine Cavalerie Santren."

1086
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,692
Where did he get such fine wine?

1087
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:18,654
Gosh. I thought it was someone else
with the same name at first.

1088
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,823
You see the name here, right?

1089
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,200
Tony Brown.

1090
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,869
Senior Vice President of Greip.

1091
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:28,455
Wow! We follow each other
on social media.

1092
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,624
We also keep
in close touch with each other.

1093
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,044
Sure.

1094
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:38,048
It might not be a big deal to you,
but there's one thing you don't know.

1095
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,633
In this world,

1096
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,721
we know we have soulmates
and people with the same tastes.

1097
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,892
Well, I'm very thorough about separating
my private and professional lives.

1098
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,394
I haven't told Tony yet,

1099
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:53,981
but you won't play fair.

1100
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:56,984
So I've already sent
this recording to everyone.

1101
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:59,278
-Hey, you bastard!
-Watch it, you bastard!

1102
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:03,490
Did being away from Korea this long
make you forget all etiquette?

1103
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:05,576
Look, you little greasy-haired brat.

1104
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:08,996
How dare you speak like that
to someone much older than you?

1105
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,665
You should be respectful. Got it?

1106
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,251
Button your shirt all the way.

1107
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,755
Okay? Fix your tie too.

1108
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,673
You little punk.

1109
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,967
Yes, sir.

1110
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,093
There you go.

1111
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,221
In Korean, damn it.

1112
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,639
I'm sorry.

1113
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,852
What did Mr. Yoon say? What is it?

1114
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,647
Chris is going to be fired.

1115
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,317
It seems Myeong-u was friends
with the VP of Greip.

1116
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,318
What?

1117
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,112
Also, they want us on the project.

1118
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:43,697
What project?

1119
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,449
Greip's flagship store.

1120
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,410
-Really?
-Yeah.

1121
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,955
-For real?
-Yeah.

1122
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,081
My gosh!

1123
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,725
Hey, Seok-ryu. Why did you come here?

1124
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,354
-Didn't you have the mock test today?
-It's just a mock test.

1125
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,314
This is like your entrance exam.

1126
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,194
What about getting the best score
for a new phone?

1127
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,696
You won, so that's enough.

1128
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:28,784
And I don't need
that fancy swivel phone. It's fine.

1129
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,412
Who needs a two-megapixel camera?

1130
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:34,415
It would just show freckles. It's okay.

1131
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,670
Well, I don't have much to give you.

1132
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,384
You can have this.

1133
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,304
What?

1134
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,974
Why would you give this to me?

1135
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,935
You said today's White Day.

1136
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,812
Go and trade it
for some taffy or whatever.

1137
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:02,818
Wait…

1138
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:06,196
Did you…

1139
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:09,700
just tell me…

1140
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,494
to get lost?

1141
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:18,876
-Hey!
-This too.

1142
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:20,711
Let's go home.

1143
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,129
Hey!

1144
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:25,174
Is this real gold?

1145
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:29,428
It's not, right? Is it?

1146
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,597
Can I bite it?

1147
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,561
My mom and dad
didn't come to my meet,

1148
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,315
but as I looked at the girl
who skipped her exam for me, I realized.

1149
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,734
After meeting Bae Seok-ryu,

1150
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,779
there was never a moment
when I didn't like her.

1151
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:49,948
I'm going to lose it.

1152
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,034
But I don't have the courage to tell her

1153
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,286
because I don't want to ruin
our friendship.

1154
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,582
So instead of now,
I'll do it when I'm in my twenties.

1155
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,001
After we become adults,

1156
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,963
I hope I'll be able to tell Seok-ryu
how I feel then.

1157
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:09,468
Hey, Seok-ryu. Are you happy
your wish to go to the US came true?

1158
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,554
Yeah, things are looking up for me.

1159
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,808
But I'm a little lonely.

1160
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:23,607
I'm already out.

1161
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:26,235
Hey, wait. I'll bring more.

1162
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,445
I have a lot of alcohol. A lot more.

1163
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,697
A whole bunch.

1164
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,742
-Damn it.
-Are you okay?

1165
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,370
Your backpack's so annoying.

1166
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:41,375
Are you immigrating?
Why did you pack so much stuff?

1167
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,710
I almost forgot.

1168
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,255
I should've showed you when I got here.

1169
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:48,799
So this…

1170
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,969
Your mom said your hands and feet get cold

1171
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:54,263
and told me to give you
this electric heating mat.

1172
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:58,559
My mom's ridiculous.
It's much warmer here than in Korea.

1173
01:13:59,143 --> 01:13:59,977
Really?

1174
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,814
These are…

1175
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:06,859
dried seaweed…

1176
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,613
and cans of tuna.

1177
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:14,241
They have those here too.
In any case, thanks.

1178
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,702
Here's some gochujang. And this too.

1179
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,955
A poster of DOS.

1180
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,166
I've switched over to Justin Bieber now.

1181
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,212
Okay, last but not least.

1182
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:32,050
Man, it was so hard to bring this over.

1183
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,761
I thought my shoulders
were going to break.

1184
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,056
You cried about leaving
before reading the new releases.

1185
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,308
-The series is done now.
-Hey!

1186
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:43,437
Holy cow!
I wanted to read these so badly!

1187
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,274
Seriously, Choisseung! You're…

1188
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,318
You're the best.

1189
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:52,362
I knew I could count on you!

1190
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,491
Gosh, you sweet kid!

1191
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:14,611
PAST PERFECT

1192
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:21,243
PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS

1193
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:58,280
LOVE NEXT DOOR

1194
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,367
You're a habitual offender.

1195
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,704
Why is Seok-ryu
suddenly looking at me weird like that?

1196
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,748
You should be wary of other people's eyes.

1197
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:09,791
You're showing off
your behind a bit too much.

1198
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,293
Just focus on your own business.

1199
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,503
Are you mad at me about something?

1200
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:15,339
You're so pretty.

1201
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,341
Have you completely moved on from him?

1202
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:18,300
No.

1203
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,177
I still love him.

1204
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,261
Wake up!

1205
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,264
-I said get up!
-That's enough!

1206
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,016
Do you think I'm a pushover?

1207
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,059
I told you.

1208
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,226
We're not kids anymore.

1209
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:34,691
