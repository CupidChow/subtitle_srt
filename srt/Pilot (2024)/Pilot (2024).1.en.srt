1
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,340
Wait! Come back!

2
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,011
Han Jung-woo! Wait!

3
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,101
Hey!

4
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,410
As the Air Force Academy's top graduate,
you have made your dream come true.

5
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:03,123
Did you really receive job offers
from three major airlines?

6
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,083
- Yes, I did.
- Wow!

7
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,669
Every moment must have been very special.

8
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,214
What would you say has been
the most memorable moment in your life?

9
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,799
CAPTAIN HAN JUNG-WOO

10
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,887
I think it's when I went
from co-pilot to captain.

11
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,430
Right.

12
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,349
HANKUK AIR CAPTAIN APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

13
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:24,019
It was the first time my family flew

14
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,104
- on an airplane I operated.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:32,319
The sky was so beautiful,
and I felt so happy.

16
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,737
Of course.

17
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,447
I heard a passenger say

18
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:39,117
they couldn't even tell
the plane was landing, it was so smooth.

19
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,369
Oh, that.

20
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,123
One time, a passenger fell asleep
before takeoff

21
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,460
and later on they asked
why the plane hadn't moved.

22
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,962
- Really?
- Then he realized that we had arrived.

23
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,550
- You flew the plane that smoothly?
- Yes, I did.

24
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,346
It sounds like you might have exaggerated
the story a little.

25
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,472
Oh, not at all.

26
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,598
- It's all true?
- It is.

27
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,437
My mom raised my sister and me on her own.

28
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,981
When I became a father,

29
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:15,779
I realized how hard
it must have been for my mom.

30
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,156
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,743
ANY WORDS FOR YOUR MOTHER?

32
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,245
A message for my mom?

33
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,915
Mom…

34
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,753
You raised me to be who I am.

35
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,591
Thank you.

36
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:39,469
MOM
ANSWER - DECLINE

37
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,389
Stop calling me, Mom.

38
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,892
Nice.

39
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:55,318
I FLEW ON HIS FLIGHT RECENTLY.
SEAMLESS TAKEOFF!

40
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,513
IS HE SINGLE? SO FINE.
PLEASE DROP HIS SOCIALS.

41
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,159
Like it? Is it really good?

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,251
Let's go home.

43
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:43,658
Thank you for choosing
to fly with Hankuk Air today.

44
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,912
This is Flight 499
departing from Nandi International Airport

45
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,916
and en route
to Incheon International Airport.

46
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,918
We are expecting mild weather

47
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,267
- conditions throughout the flight today.
- Would you like anything?

48
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,590
If we pass through any turbulence…

49
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,136
the plane may shake like that.

50
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:08,099
We anticipate a smooth
and comfortable journey

51
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,393
and we should arrive
at our destination safely.

52
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,771
This was your Captain Han Jung-woo.

53
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,318
A funny story. Go!

54
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,239
I had an experience
with the Fijian natives yesterday.

55
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,909
The experience was…

56
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,412
Captain?
Would you like our in-flight meal?

57
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,956
What is it?

58
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,502
FOLLOW

59
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,880
PILOT HAN JUNG-WOO: "THE BEST I CAN BE"

60
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,349
A PILOT WHO TRAVELS FOR WORK

61
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,935
PILOT H UNVEILED!

62
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,444
PILOT HAN JUNG-WOO "I CAN SING WELL TOO"

63
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:18,820
PILOT

64
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,342
How are you, sir?

65
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,177
- You were on TV, right?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,471
Hello, sir.

67
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,767
Sir!

68
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,145
Hi. I enjoyed the show.

69
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,271
Thanks.

70
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,189
- Could we take a picture?
- Sure.

71
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,318
Ready?

72
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,157
Thanks.

73
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,576
Nice selfie, sir.

74
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,579
I'm Seo Hyun-seok
from the 57th class of Eagles.

75
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,375
He's so cool.

76
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,836
Try the good stuff, sir!

77
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,047
Any word this year, sir?

78
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,173
About?

79
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,550
Han Air sometimes sends pilots
to Hankuk Air.

80
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,552
Let me fly with you, sir.

81
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,138
I don't know much about the company.

82
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,850
The word is also out at Han Air.

83
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,812
They say that you, VP Noh,
and the chief of operations are close.

84
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,899
Pilots don't need to worry
about connections.

85
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,151
We just need to be good at flying.

86
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,154
And besides,
Hankuk Air and Han Air are affiliates.

87
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,322
Who cares?

88
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,199
Hey. See this?

89
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,868
Stop racking it, man.

90
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,789
Huh?

91
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,083
What's wrong?

92
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:46,716
MISSED CALL: VP NOH JUNG-WOOK

93
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,177
They must've hired folks
without looking at their faces.

94
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,971
TWO MONTHS AGO

95
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,974
I can't tell the difference
between the pilots and the stewardesses!

96
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,725
Oh, please, sir!

97
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,811
What's gotten into you, sir?

98
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,313
- Did I say something wrong?
- Oh, please.

99
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,775
You know we've gotta watch
what we say these days.

100
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,944
They didn't look at their faces.

101
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,655
They must have only hired
the ones who can handle their drink.

102
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,906
I mean, otherwise,

103
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,996
how could the pilots be prettier
than the stewardesses?

104
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,706
Please, sir!

105
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:23,545
For cabin crew members,
these are top class!

106
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,756
Especially compared to other airlines.

107
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,345
Look, they're beautiful.
How could you say that

108
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,098
about the stewardesses?
They're like a bouquet of flowers.

109
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,434
Am I right or am I wrong, sir?

110
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,730
I just said that they were pretty.
What's wrong with that?

111
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,356
I felt offended.

112
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,777
I didn't train for years to become
a stewardess just to hear that.

113
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,988
It was insulting.

114
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,907
Mom. What does "insulting" mean?

115
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,243
- Public opinion is worsening…
- Hurry up and eat.

116
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,621
…after VP Noh Jung-wook's
previous sexual harassment charges.

117
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,832
A certain Captain Han, also at the scene,

118
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,293
is reported to have been relieved of duty.

119
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,045
HANKUK AIR SET TO CUT STAFF
DUE TO STOCKS PLUNGING

120
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,963
- Shit!
- Did you just curse?

121
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,008
He'll be back on the job within a year.

122
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,305
Si-hoo, if you're done, let's go.
Your school bus won't be long.

123
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,725
There's no need to worry.

124
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,561
There are loads of airlines.

125
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,605
But being on TV may be hard…

126
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,441
Are you going to Pilates after?

127
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,861
I quit Pilates six months ago.

128
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:31,946
You did?

129
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,157
Get some beef on your way back.

130
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,992
I'm craving some beef stew.

131
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,912
See you later.

132
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,246
Si-hoo.

133
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,873
Love you.

134
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,879
I'm such a chump. It's my fault.

136
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,632

137
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,180
Hello, sir. How are you?

138
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,724
Oh, that.

139
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,853
I can't believe what happened.

140
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,730
Hello, there. It's Han Jung-woo.

141
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,860

lt's Han Jung-woo

145
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,706
Hi, Ji-young.
How was your flight to Shanghai?

146
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,084
Any jobs on the China side
at your airline?

147
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,627
Just wondering.

148
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,797
Professor! Go Eagles!

149
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,299
He passed away?

150
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,094

00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,100
Hi, Hyun-seok.

153
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,269
Did you call me?

154
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:48,148
I called you last Friday, man.

155
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,482
Was that last week?

156
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,944
Did you receive my resumé?

157
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,782
I passed it to HR,
but we're only hiring co-pilots.

158
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,576
Come on.

159
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,787
How could I be a co-pilot?

160
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,205
Right?

161
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,749
But that's going to be hard too.

162
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,170
Everyone knows it's your voice
on that recording.

163
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,963
You're blacklisted.

164
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,174
I'm blacklisted?

165
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,383
What?

166
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,887
Everyone was kissing up to me like crazy
when I was flying high.

167
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,307
You can't trust anyone but family.

168
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,766
I want a divorce.

169
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,395
What?

170
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,192
Is this because I got fired?

171
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,612
I've wanted to divorce you
for quite some time.

172
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,823
Now that you're unemployed,
I can't take it any longer.

173
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,868
God damn it.

174
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,540
Did you meet another guy?

175
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,125
- No.
- No, of course not.

176
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,044
But I'll go look for one now!

177
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,006
- How the hell could you ask that?
- Soo-young! Wait! I'm not done talking.

178
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,591
This is the Han River!

179
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,676
Come on. Get in.

180
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,347
Out.

181
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,932
Get out now.

182
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,019
- One, two…
- I don't believe this.

183
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,190
Don't tell Si-hoo!

184
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:17,904
He was so proud that his dad was a pilot.

185
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,906
Hello.

186
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,378
How should I paint my eyes?
Girlish or sexy? Girlish!

187
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,130
Let me show you how it's done.

188
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,550
I do skin care too.

189
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,928
If you come, I'll provide ser…

190
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,179
Shit!

191
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,849
What are you doing?

192
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,728
Why didn't you tell me you were here?

193
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,399
And why wear green of all colors?

194
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,733
Whatever.

195
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,318
You've ruined it.

196
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,655
This is what you do
as a beauty content creator?

197
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,534
- I'm an ASMR beauty content creator.
- What?

198
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,036
Why are you here?

199
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,580
Do I need a reason to visit my home?

200
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,458
Clean up around here, will you?

201
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,168
Where's Mom?

202
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,964
She went on a pilgrimage.
Don't you talk to her?

203
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,132
She did?

204
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,592
Where? The Vatican? Santiago?

205
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,094
I don't know.

206
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,637
Show some interest in her.

207
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,473
That's why they say
men are useless.

208
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,519
Why you!

209
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,396
Fuck! Watch it.

210
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,775
Shit.

211
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,278
Did your wife finally ask for a divorce?

212
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,781
No, we just had a fight
because I lost my job.

213
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,325
You got fired?

214
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,581
You're the one on TV, aren't you?
It's all over the Internet!

215
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,125
I knew that preachy tone
sounded familiar!

216
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,961
It was you! I knew it!

217
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,254
Listen.

218
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,758
- Cool beat, huh?
- What is that?

219
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,676
It's techno.

220
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,637
For cabin crew members,
these are top class!

221
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,098
Especially compared to other airlines!

222
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,558
Here comes the best part.

223
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,435
Shit, this is a total nightmare…

224
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,897
"Like a bouquet of…"

225
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,400
You think it's funny?

226
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,237
And by the way, I bought this place.

227
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,239
Aren't you grateful?

228
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,867
I'm the best brother.
I sent you money regularly.

229
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,065
- I sent you on a trip abroad.
- "I sent you on a trip abroad."

230
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,498
It was just one trip!
I should never have gone.

231
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,753
So you showed off on TV
and then ended up fired and divorced.

232
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,880
- What a great dad you are.
- Hey!

233
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,384
I totally get your wife.
Don't you feel sorry for Si-hoo?

234
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,886
Gossip travels fast.
How can he go to kindergarten now?

235
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,012
What about Mom and me?

236
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,555
- Hey!
- What?

237
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm not divorced yet.

238
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,396
Whatever.

239
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,611
Oh, I forgot. Say hi to Mom's new son.

240
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,239
That son doesn't talk back.

241
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,532
It's great.

242
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,747
Why are you by the door?

243
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,517
Jung-woo, come quickly.

244
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,895
This is Mom, right?

245
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,025
What? This is her pilgrimage?

246
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,236
We found it!

247
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,947
Mom traveled that far for him?

248
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,242
This is the hot-dog
that Chan-won ate in Wolmido!

249
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,494
It has over a million views!

250
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,830
Hot-dogs! Yes!

251
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,206
Chan-won!

252
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,752
Oh my god. I'm exhausted.

253
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,254
Jeez!

254
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,926
Sorry, I was gonna clean up.

255
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,428
It was messy when I got here.

256
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,972
- Why are you here?
- Jung-woo and his wife--

257
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,641
I just stopped by.
I was on my way somewhere.

258
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,435
You're getting divorced?

259
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,103
It was bound to happen.

260
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,523
Poor Soo-young.

261
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,774
You rock, Mom.

262
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,320
- Why you--
- What!

263
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,822
Whose mom are you?

264
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:34,285
I've had enough of both of you.

265
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,536
Move!

266
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,622
Where are you going now?

267
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:42,084
There's a waffle place in Gangneung
that Chan-won went to.

268
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,629
I'll stop by there
before the flower festival.

269
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,756
He said, "May life be a bed of roses!"

270
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,217
Then he coughed three times.

271
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,885
Mom, I said I'm getting divorced.

272
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,346
Mom, do something! He wants to move in.

273
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,724
Don't call me "Mom."
Mom is closed for business.

274
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,267
Jeez.

275
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,894
Is she menopausal again?

276
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,064
She's been through menopause?

277
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,359
Mo-- Ma'am!

278
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,446
So, Ms. Yoon, you trained
at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University?

279
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,782
You were also an instructor there
for two years?

280
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,244
After seven years at United Air,
you turned down a job at Jet Air?

281
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,038
Yes, I had lived in the USA for long.

282
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,166
Why did you come back to Korea
instead of staying there?

283
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,210
Isn't it better to be a pilot
in the States?

284
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,506
I wanted to return to Korea
and settle here.

285
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,676
Besides, I had also had enough
of racial injustice.

286
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,219
Is she married?

287
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,346
What if she gets pregnant?

288
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,056
I have no plans to get married.

289
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,351
I don't have a boyfriend.
And even if I did, I won't get married.

290
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,939
I also have no plans to be a single mother
or to have my eggs frozen.

291
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,696
- Mr. Han Jung-woo?
- Yes?

292
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,781
You graduated from the Air Force Academy?

293
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,242
Correct.

294
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,660
I graduated as the top student

295
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,454
and was discharged
from the Air Force as a major.

296
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,456
- Three airlines scouted--
- Right.

297
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,708
Hankuk Air.

298
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,793
Okay. That'll be all.

299
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,505
It's too bad…

300
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,760
Director Noh ended up
with a budget airline

301
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,138
while her loser
of a brother got a major one.

302
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,892
She does all the work,
but her brother gets all the credit.

303
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,228
Director Noh must be so pissed.

304
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,356
Huh?

305
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,614
You gotta see this.

306
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,786
WAR OF THE HANKUK AIR HEIRS

307
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,912
Go! Go! Go!

308
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,582
HE HITS HER BY MISTAKE

309
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,500
You son of a…

310
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,420
SHE SUDDENLY SPOTS THE CAMERA

311
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,546
OWNER AND SISTER AT A GAME

312
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,631
Right!

313
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,467
Her younger brother
screwed up his chance with Hankuk Air,

314
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,218
so it's hers now.

315
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,765
I think she's reshuffling Han Air
to work her way up.

316
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,975
Like the percentage of female pilots.

317
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,227
Her goal is 50-50 within five years.

318
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:09,315
Rumor has it that she's only hiring
female pilots these days.

319
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,319
- That's crazy, isn't it?
- It's insane.

320
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,154
Pilots should be hired
based on their skills,

321
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,031
not because they're women.

322
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,825
What happens to folks like you
with nowhere to go?

323
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,327
What can you do?

324
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,622
What do you think?

325
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,833
- I think it's wrong.
- Exactly.

326
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,961
It's too bad.

327
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,381
You don't stand a chance.

328
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,384
It's not like you can just become a woman.

329
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,348
Here. Your coffee.

330
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,226
It's cold. You drink it.

331
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,063
Jerk.

332
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,898
The petitioner and respondent
are now divorced.

333
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,026
The respondent will pay child support…

334
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,444
SEOUL DISTRICT COURT

335
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,572
…from May 2023 until the child
reaches the age of majority,

336
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,449
to the sum of two million won per month.

337
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,659
UNSUCCESSFUL JOB APPLICATION

338
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,954
A DEMAND NOTICE HAS BEEN SENT
IMMEDIATE LOAN REPAYMENT IS REQUIRED

339
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,372
Jeez.

340
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:12,628
EVEN KIDS EARN MONEY. DO YOU?

341
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,172
WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER GETTING FIRED & DIVORCED?

342
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,633
SINGLE DADS

343
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,532
ARE YOU DOWN AND OUT?

344
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,303
Damn it.

345
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,639
Are you down and out?

346
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,474
Then listen up.

347
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,729
On Lalilly Island in the Pacific Ocean,

348
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:33,774
whenever life gets tough
and it feels like you're going nuts,

349
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,570
the natives chant a magic spell
in order to achieve happiness.

350
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,202
Don't laugh.

351
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,832
Repeat after me. "You gotta be
crazy about it to achieve it."

352
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,752
You gotta go all-out to achieve something.

353
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,964
You can't fulfill your dream
without being crazy about it.

354
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,675
You gotta be crazy to get there.

355
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,053
Don't have anything?
Don't know what to do?

356
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,764
Don't think. Just do it!

357
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,432
But what if I can't do it?

358
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,225
Stop wasting your time thinking about it.

359
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,907
Be crazy about it to achieve it.

360
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,283
Just do it.

361
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,494
Whatever it takes, just do it.

362
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,871
Don't have anything?
Don't know what to do?

363
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,457
Don't think! Just do it!

364
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,584
"Will it work?" "What if it doesn't?"

365
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,836
Stop wasting your time thinking about it!

366
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,526
Hankuk Air, right?

367
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,363
It's too bad. You don't stand a chance.

368
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,865
My flying skills have reached their peak.

369
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,534
I want a divorce.

370
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,663
They're only hiring female pilots.

371
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,333
It's not like you can just become a woman.

372
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,112
HAN AIR CO-PILOT POSITION:
INTERVIEW INVITATION

373
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,363
Hello?

374
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,699
Hello?

375
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,994
Yes, I applied for a job as a pilot.

376
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,579
May I ask a question?

377
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,916
I've just received a text
asking me to come for an interview.

378
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,961
Actually, in the first round I…

379
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,089
They're only hiring women?

380
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,843
Then I'll make sure that they do.

381
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,720
Hold, please.

382
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,472
Jung-mi, can you take this call?

383
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,057
Me?

384
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,770
This is Han Jung-mi.

385
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,398
Yes.

386
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,192
There must have been
some misunderstanding.

387
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,736
That's not a problem.

388
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,238
I'll see you then.

389
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,990
Thank you.

390
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,578
What the hell?

391
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,419
Oh, you poor bastard.
Finally lost your mind, huh?

392
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,173
You applied to an airline under my name,
using fake credentials?

393
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,050
This is a crime, you know?

394
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,969
That's only if you get the job.

395
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,932
They've invited me for an interview!
What am I supposed to do?

396
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,643
Who says you're going to that interview?
I will…

397
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,978
You're going?

398
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,446
I don't have the money
to pay the mortgage on this place.

399
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,699
And if I don't,
you'll get kicked out of here too.

400
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,910
We won't be able to see Si-hoo.

401
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,413
Exactly! So do something else.
There are other jobs.

402
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,708
Everyone knows about me on the Internet.

403
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,795
Who would hire me,
with all those clips about me out there?

404
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,922
Can't you see? No one calls me.

405
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,843
I can't pay a mortgage and child support
just doing part-time jobs.

406
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,011
There's no way in hell.

407
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,638
I don't believe this.

408
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,141
I had no idea
that you would stoop this low.

409
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,726
Whatever.

410
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,938
Mom's bank account.

411
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,691
I know that you're managing it.

412
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,486
Is there enough money
for a down payment on a rental?

413
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,907
What? It's not that much.

414
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,325
Jeez.

415
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,411
When Street Entertainment went public,

416
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,914
you invested everything
and lost 90% of it.

417
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,499
Am I right?

418
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,794
How did you know about that?

419
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,255
There's nothing I don't know about you.

420
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,134
So give it some thought.
This isn't just for my benefit.

421
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:14,430
What would happen if I told Mom
you lost everything on stocks?

422
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,723
They'll go up in time.

423
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,975
When our boys hit Billboard,
the stocks will go up!

424
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,226
Okay.

425
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,438
That means you gotta stay put. Right?

426
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,110
I guess we could give it a go.

427
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,154
Exactly. Let's see how it goes.

428
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,948
It won't hurt to try it once.

429
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,159
Right. People aren't stupid.

430
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,494
Why do you keep whispering?

431
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,372
Force of habit. ASMR, remember?

432
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,417
It helps people
deal with stress and insomnia.

433
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,586
- It's a healing trend.
- Dang!

434
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,796
Stay still.

435
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,978
Do you have to be so rough?

436
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,146
Yes.

437
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,864
Hey, I can feel the heat.

438
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,624
Wow.

439
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,001
Your face is rejecting the makeup.

440
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,171
How about plastic surgery?

441
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,508
Why didn't you secretly stash
some money for a rainy day?

442
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,926
Why you.

443
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,478
- Ready?
- Why do this if I'm wearing a push-up bra?

444
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,438
Side fat! Armpit fat!

445
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,482
Shoulder fat!
All the fat on your back too!

446
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,486
- You gotta bring it all together.
- Okay.

447
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,493
- Hold it.
- Is this right?

448
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,789
The hell?

449
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,001
Then why gather up all the fat?

450
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,674
Too much?

451
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,342
They're bigger than yours.

452
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,680
Yeah, right.
I wish I could show 'em to you.

453
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,852
Hello, I'm Han Jung-mi.

454
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,106
You think it'll work?

455
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,859
It's nice to meet you.

456
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,488
It's fluttering.

457
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,576
Hey!

458
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,120
You didn't tell me a woman would do it.

459
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,956
You got this!

460
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,166
Hey!

461
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,253
Excuse me.

462
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,256
Is it very painful?

463
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,929
No pain, no gain.

464
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,265
Help me! Help!

465
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,477
It's so clean and smooth.

466
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,397
Let's do it properly.

467
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,733
I heard that some actors use this.

468
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,360
- It's called restructuring.
- Restructuring?

469
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,362
Emergencies can happen, you know?

470
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,115
But I don't think you're gonna need it.

471
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:23,202
Move! Step aside.

472
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:29,499
Hey, this… Hey, but this is just…
Oh, man, there's not enough here.

473
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,835
This works, huh?

474
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,963
How many do I need to buy?

475
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,591
- That's enough.
- Hey!

476
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,684
What?

477
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,688
It's not gonna work, huh?

478
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,233
It's not bad.

479
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,377
Hello! Women-only Pilates here.

480
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,711
Hey, wait, Miss!

481
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,965
It's 50% off for the first month.

482
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,758
Wow, Miss!

483
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,971
Your shoulders are so broad and sturdy,
all the way up to your neck!

484
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,014
You must have been a fighter.

485
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:27,933
Oh my.

486
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,603
The first day is free. Please come by.

487
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,397
Straight shoulders are in these days.

488
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,232
We'll get yours straightened out.

489
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,068
Just like Jennie, Miss!

490
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,114
What did you just say?

491
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,117
- You must have been a fighter?
- Before that.

492
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,662
That we're a women-only Pilates gym?

493
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,247
After that.

494
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,456
Miss?

495
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,087
I'll think about it.

496
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,547
- Please come by.
- Okay.

497
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,132
- You promised!
- Okay.

498
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,383
You're so pretty.

499
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,391
I don't believe this.

503
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,083
Hello.

504
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,502
Hello.

505
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,680
- Bro!
- Hi.

506
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,390
- Are you ready?
- I'm so nervous.

507
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,434
Why? You'll be fine.

508
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,311
Hold on.

509
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,773
My stomach…

510
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,737
The bathroom, was it that way?

511
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,205
Why did I go to the men's bathroom?

512
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,664
How silly of me.

513
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,502
Ms. Han Jung-mi?

514
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,256
- Ms. Han Jung-mi.
- Yes!

515
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,593
INTERVIEW BOARD MEMBER

516
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,220
You have lots of experience.

517
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,679
Yes.

518
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,557
But I've never heard of this airline.

519
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,144
Ukharuka Ranipolo Airline?

520
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,604
Is it in South America?

521
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,481
Well…

522
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,109
It's a small island in the Pacific.

523
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,362
An island?
It's not like Hawaii or Guam?

524
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,489
- Is it near New Zealand?
- Lalilly Island.

525
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,490
Lalilly Island?

526
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,369
There's an island like that
in the Pacific?

527
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,911
What was that?

528
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,040
In the Lalilly language, it means
"I want to bury my bones in this company."

529
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,170
It might be an unknown airline

530
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,423
but I'm a confident airplane pilot.

531
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,596
I'm single and I have no plans
to get married.

532
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,432
I don't have a boyfriend.

533
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,768
I hate marriage.

534
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,604
I hate it so much.

535
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,983
I'm a pilot.
Please take some great pictures.

536
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,110
Especially below the chest.

537
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,403
Stand close to it, please.

538
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,199
You can't be there, sir.

539
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,744
Please…

540
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,829
Please leave.

541
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,583
There are perverts like him?
What is this world coming to?

542
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,210
Congrats on the job.

543
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,087
YOUR JOURNEY, ALWAYS WITH HANKUK AIR.

544
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:11,049
HANKUK AIR'S NEW AMBASSADOR,
PILOT YOON SEUL-KI, LEADING A NEW ERA.

545
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,285
Hello.

546
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,958
Over here!

547
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,210
Come sit with us.

548
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,264
Listen up.

549
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,099
Does everyone have a drink?

550
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,726
Let's have a toast!

551
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,228
Fill any empty glasses.

552
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,273
Let's welcome our new pilots today.

553
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,817
I’d like to propose a toast
on this occasion

554
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:15,739
To Han Air's new pilots! Cheers!

555
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,116
Cheers!

556
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,748
Why didn't you finish it?

557
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,710
I'm saving it for later.

558
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,545
You know me, right?

559
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,757
I swear we've met somewhere.

560
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,134
Oh, really?

561
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,225
Let's not force anyone to drink.

562
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,436
Things are different these days, right?

563
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:52,442
It seems like our cockpits
will finally be blooming with flowers.

564
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,529
I guess I should ask them
for a pretty new uniform too.

565
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,365
- Sir?
- What?

566
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,496
We can't say stuff like that
anymore, right?

567
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:09,751
If I say that someone is fat,
it's considered degrading.

568
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,962
Same as if I say they're ugly.
I understand that.

569
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:16,841
But saying someone is pretty
is also considered degrading?

570
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,220
I gotta be careful with everything I say.

571
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,389
Hey.

572
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,558
Who was that guy from Hankuk Air?

573
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,894
- Han Jung-woo.
- Yes, him.

574
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,022
What happened to him was so unfair.

575
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,901
I don't understand why saying
that they're pretty is problematic.

576
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:39,322
Does that make you mad?

577
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,908
No, it doesn't.

578
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,410
See?

579
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,079
It would be weird if it made you mad.

580
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:50,750
But Captain, my appearance
has nothing to do with my job.

581
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:55,505
So why should I be evaluated on that
and accept it as a compliment?

582
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,718
I don't think anyone should be evaluated
on anything other than their work.

583
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,511
How is that an evaluation?

584
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,721
It's a compliment.

585
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,850
But I haven't done anything
worthy of a compliment from you, sir.

586
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,607
What's up with her?

587
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,943
She's killed the mood.

588
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:30,999
We are the hot-blooded sons of our nation

589
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:36,045
Our seniors' high and shining spirit

590
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,174
We honor and follow

591
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,595
We will rage on

592
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,848
High to the sky

593
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:51,019
We are the proud spirits

594
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,439
Of the Korea Air Force Academy!

595
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,776
Eagles! Eagles!

596
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,154
Fly! Swoop! Fly! Swoop!

597
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,323
Eagles! Eagles! Fly!

598
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:07,619
Air Force Academy rules!

599
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,546
Enjoy! Drink up, sir!

600
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,715
- That was great!
- Let's have a drink.

601
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,555
I didn't know there were
so many of them here.

602
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,558
You're an Eagle?

603
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,019
Yeah-- No, sir.

604
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,438
But I wanted to be one.

605
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,608
I lacked the skills to be accepted.

606
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,859
But you prepared for it?

607
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,029
You're smart.

608
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,490
I wanted to be like you, sir.

609
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,493
I hope to learn a lot from you.

610
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,621
Sure. Let's have a drink.

611
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,289
Yes, sir.

612
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,083
Eagles!

613
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,800
It's taken.

614
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,135
Is that you, Jung-mi?

615
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,514
Yes.

616
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,474
Are you okay?

617
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,351
Yes.

618
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,478
Don't drink too much.

619
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,482
Are you ready to go? I can take you home.

620
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,256
Why did you do that earlier?

621
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,094
Oh, that.

622
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,557
Sometimes it's good to just say yes
and go with the flow.

623
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,893
You know what I mean?

624
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,978
Do you really have to?

625
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,647
Well…

626
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,068
I'd do anything to fly.

627
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,323
After everything I did to become a pilot…

628
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,368
I can handle smaller problems.

629
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,666
Well, thank you.

630
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,628
I know you did that to help me out.

631
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,636
Do you wanna give me your number?
I want us to get close.

632
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,931
- Was that too forward?
- No.

633
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,769
Oh, I replied too quickly, didn't I?

634
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,898
It sounds nice.

635
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,109
Let's get close. Like girlfriends.

636
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,240
Hold on.

637
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:54,994
Hello?

638
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,831
Hello?

639
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,708
Hello?

640
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,504
Who is this?

641
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,882
I called and I answered.

642
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,260
- I'm sorry. How silly of me.
- It's okay.

643
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,096
Where's my head at?

644
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,598
Today we have a passenger in a wheelchair.

645
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,101
Her seat is in Row A Seat 30.

646
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,522
A dog will be traveling
with a passenger in business class.

647
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,315
It's a beagle.

648
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,901
There are no other special notes.

649
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,528
There is something special.

650
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,950
It's our co-pilot Han Jung-mi's
first flight with Han Air.

651
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,369
Let's give her a big hand.

652
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,335
Your first experience is with me.

653
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:20,663
Ever been told that your voice
sounds quite manly?

654
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,207
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

655
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,710
You'd be even more attractive
with a clearer voice.

656
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,842
But I love husky voices.

657
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,683
You have a puppy face.

658
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,809
Pardon?

659
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,228
Born in 1992,
the year of the monkey, right?

660
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,105
- Yes.
- I'm a dragon.

661
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,025
I was born in '88.
That's a four-year age gap.

662
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,110
They say that's the best
for compatibility.

663
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,278
Right.

664
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,489
So I guess we'll get along quite well.

665
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:58,159
Come on. We won't know
if we're a good match until we try.

666
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,870
Adult compatibility, you know?

667
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,997
I love beautiful puppy-like women.

668
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,248
They're…

669
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,796
They're gentle. And nice.

670
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,547
Jung-mi--

671
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,551
You look like the type.

672
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,220
It's so annoying.

673
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,598
That's what they say.

674
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,141
That dog back there.

675
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,435
Beagles are known for being annoying dogs.

676
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,521
It's so noisy.

677
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,566
This is the co-pilot.

678
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,528
That dog is barking non-stop.

679
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,574
Please give its owner
any dog snacks you find on board.

680
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:39,909
Thank you.

681
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,305
You also take a deep breath
when you reach this altitude?

682
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,141
Pardon?

683
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,809
I know someone who does the same thing.

684
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:10,439
He says that when you reach 10,000 feet,
the tension you feel at take-off vanishes.

685
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,526
- Really?
- He's an Air Force Academy senior.

686
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,029
He was famous at our school
for his excellent piloting skills.

687
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,407
He made quick judgments too.

688
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,326
All the airlines
were fighting to hire him.

689
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,329
Wow, he must be really good.

690
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,708
That's right. But he's a damn hypocrite.

691
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,880
The jerk pretends to be neutral
to maintain a good image,

692
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:37,175
And then skillfully picking up
all the leftovers, living off them.

693
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,593
- Me?
- What?

694
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,390
Me, fa, so…

695
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,477
When you are miserable

696
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:55,401
I will comfort you

697
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,781
When you are

698
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:05,369
So sad

699
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:12,543
I will be your tears

700
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,171
So sexy.

701
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,256
There are so many.

702
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,093
Si-hoo, look! Come here.

703
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,639
- This is new. It's a Boeing 777.
- Huh?

704
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,349
Oh.

705
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,934
I used to fly this.

706
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,143
Cool, huh?

707
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:30,895
It's nice.

708
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,481
The engines roar like a beast.

709
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,108
Do I have to get this?

710
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,236
No.

711
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,695
You can get whatever you want.

712
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,949
Look around and choose something.
I'll get it for you.

713
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,290
No, I'll take this one.

714
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,084
The Boeing 777.

715
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,756
Is your mom doing okay?

716
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,802
You're still whining
about wanting to see me, right?

717
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,430
Yup. I am, but…

718
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:10,393
Mom said that you're divorced.

719
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:15,106
Are you crazy? Why did you tell him
that we got divorced?

720
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,609
Si-hoo should know the truth
and accept reality.

721
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,070
He's only six years old.

722
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,447
How is he supposed to understand this?

723
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,242
You divorced me because I lost my job.

724
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,287
You really think that's why?

725
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,164
Then let's hear the real reason.

726
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,334
Do you know what Si-hoo wants to be?

727
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,794
A pilot.

728
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,087
He wants to do ballet.

729
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,758
He wants to become a world-class dancer.

730
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:48,806
I had surgery
for polycystic ovarian syndrome.

731
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,641
That's why I quit Pilates.

732
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,729
After the surgery,
my stomach can't handle anything greasy.

733
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,523
Beef stew?

734
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,150
I'm craving that too.

735
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,487
Did you know
that my dad broke his shoulder?

736
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,073
What about your mother's 70th birthday?

737
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,617
You kept saying you were too busy,

738
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,996
so I arranged the party
for her 70th birthday.

739
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:16,959
Of course you didn't know about all this.
All you care about is yourself.

740
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,878
You don't care about anyone else.

741
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:29,138
I wanted a happy family,
not some hot-shot pilot.

742
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,106
- Is something wrong?
- Jesus!

743
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,697
You startled me.

744
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,661
It's not that annoying dog again, is it?

745
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:57,083
Word is you called Captain Seo
an annoying dog.

746
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,340
That made me laugh.

747
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,719
Captain Seo is known
for poking around, so be careful.

748
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,137
Beware of the dog.

749
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:24,860
Are you hungry?

750
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,239
Not really.

751
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,950
Let's go eat something
and unwind a little.

752
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,076
What?

753
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,204
Where-- My bag.

754
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,749
Where are we going?

755
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,127
Let's look around.

756
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,928
This is nice.

757
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,184
I'll take this.

758
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,812
- Try something different.
- What?

759
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,400
It feels so good!

760
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,319
What size do you wear?

761
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,989
- Big.
- How big?

762
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,409
Size 10 or so.

763
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:23,878
- Let's go there too.
- Sure.

764
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,838
You have such big feet.

765
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,007
They're wide.

766
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,051
- Wanna grab a hamburger?
- That sounds good.

767
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,178
How about sushi?

768
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,888
Hurry!

769
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,556
- Which one?
- Bunny ears for me!

770
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,724
I'll take this!

771
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,939
Cheers!

772
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,351
- Wasn't that fun?
- Totally!

773
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,520
Wait!

774
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,564
I left my phone at the bar.

775
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,858
- I'll go with you.
- No, it's okay.

776
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,860
I'll be right back.

777
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,946
I'll go get our stuff from the locker.

778
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,072
Okay.

779
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,451
Damn.

780
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:38,953
Excuse me.

781
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,330
I've booked a room. Stay with me.

782
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,124
Sorry, I'm exhausted.

783
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:48,087
Wait! I saw you dancing earlier.
Please stay for--

784
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,008
- Do you work out?
- Sorry.

785
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,719
I have to work tomorrow.

786
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,681
Why go home so early?

787
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,266
- Just stay for a bit.
- No.

788
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:03,060
- Play with me for a bit.
- No.

789
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,478
I can't!

790
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,438
- Please…
- Stop!

791
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,275
Damn it. I said no.

792
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,735
It ripped because of you.

793
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,988
I can't go back in now.

794
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,615
I said no, you bastard.

795
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,075
Surprised?

796
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,077
What you're thinking is right.

797
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,453
I'm tired.

798
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,998
These heels are killing me.

799
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,249
Jeez!

800
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,168
- What's wrong?
- My tag ripped.

801
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,046
- What?
- Let's just go.

802
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,385
You're so good at dancing like this.

803
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,928
I love to dance.

804
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:44,393
I can tell that you really love your job.

805
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:50,024
You said you'd do anything
if it meant you can keep being a pilot.

806
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,568
I guess.

807
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:56,697
I wanted to be famous and successful.

808
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,117
But money was the main reason.

809
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,873
My dad died quite young,
so my mom has had to work so hard.

810
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:11,253
In a fatherless household,
as the first-born son--

811
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:20,137
I mean, I had to act like
the first-born son of the household,

812
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:22,306
so I studied really hard.

813
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,725
Since there were no tuition fees,

814
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,685
naturally, I enrolled
in Air Force Academy--

815
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,192
I mean, I tried to enroll
but wasn't accepted.

816
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,364
Because it’s not a situation
where you can rely on just anyone,

817
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:42,576
I felt I had to make it
so I could be a provider for my family.

818
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:47,039
I thought everything would be fine
if I became a pilot.

819
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,806
Maybe you had too many responsibilities
on your shoulders.

820
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,101
My dad felt that way too.

821
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,895
The hardest part is hiding it from others.

822
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,151
There, there…

823
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:25,411
From now on, you can call me "sis."
Let's be like sisters.

824
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,413
It's okay.

825
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,874
- Sis…
- It's okay.

826
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,837
Sis!

827
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:39,174
You are my…

828
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,844
Watch out!

829
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,736
Oh, no.

830
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,128
Jung-mi!

831
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:19,965
Sis, wait! Hold on!

832
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,009
How did she get in there?

833
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,263
Jung-mi!

834
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,765
Proud sons

835
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,268
Of the air

836
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,686
Are you throwing up?

837
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,272
Want me to pat your back?

838
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,982
God protect our nation

839
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,400
Are you pooing?

840
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,778
Until…

841
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:41,904
Hello?

842
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,280
Sis?

843
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,700
I'm sorry to ask,
but if there's a store nearby…

844
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,414
could you buy me some tape?

845
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,257
Hello.

846
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,099
Sis.

847
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,684
- Hello.
- Hi.

848
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,356
Are you flying out? Where are you going?

849
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,149
Hawaii.

850
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,152
- Flying with Captain Baek again?
- Nope.

851
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,362
That's good.

852
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,206
- What?
- Hold still.

853
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,172
What the heck? Is that a bug?

854
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,175
- Eyelashes.
- Oh, right. Oh my god.

855
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,969
You wear fake eyelashes?

856
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,846
The fuller, the prettier, right?

857
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,389
Thanks.

858
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,895
Sis.

859
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,856
Why aren't you dating anyone?

860
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,816
You said you wouldn't get married.

861
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,694
I've been busy with life.

862
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,405
It's hard to support myself.
How can I think about marriage?

863
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,116
I could hook you up with someone.

864
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,870
What type of guys do you like?
I know tons of men.

865
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:21,962
Someone who understands my job,
someone who I can talk to like a friend.

866
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,591
What types don't you like?

867
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,842
People who lie.

868
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,512
It's hard for me
to open up to people at first.

869
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,973
But once I do, I trust them fully.

870
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:35,434
I'd better go.

871
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,643
Fly safe.

872
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:41,481
Sis?

873
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,777
When I return from Hawaii, can we talk?

874
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,781
There's something I have to tell you.

875
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,866
Sure.

876
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,456
This way, please.

877
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,793
Han Air flight 137 to Hawaii.
May I check your boarding pass?

878
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:02,920
Welcome aboard.

879
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,087
Please go inside.

880
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,139
I found a great place for king crabs.
How about it?

881
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,350
I have indigestion from breakfast.

882
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,018
It's a very famous bar in Hawaii.

883
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,645
I don't like to eat out.

884
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,980
Did you lose your phone?
Why don't you take any of my calls?

885
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,816
Oh, no! I forgot to switch it off.

886
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,485
Thank you.

887
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,779
Did you block my number by any chance?

888
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,072
Yes.

889
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,573
What?

890
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,713
I've come across many women like you.

891
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,967
They flirt, enjoy the attention,
but when things go bad,

892
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,511
they make men look like garbage.

893
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,638
- Me?
- You flirted with me first.

894
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,393
You kept looking at me and smiling at me.

895
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,396
- I did?
- Were you just leading me on?

896
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,730
Is that something you often do?

897
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,148
I'm not interested in you.

898
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,026
I don't like what you're doing right now.

899
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,903
You're ugly and have a bad personality.

900
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,196
And you stink a little.

901
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,864
- Ms. Han Jung-mi!
- What?

902
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,867
I'll try harder. Just give me a chance.

903
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,619
I'll wash more often.

904
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,913
I know that you're different
from other women.

905
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,289
Because I'm a man.

906
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:27,546
I mean, because you're a man,
that's why you're acting like this.

907
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,388
Jung-mi, it's okay. We'll be fine.

908
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:46,982
Captain!

909
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,693
It's cracked!

910
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,159
- Yes?
- Captain! Is it just turbulence?

911
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,952
Yes. Keep the passengers calm.

912
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,037
Okay.

913
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,873
What do we do now?

914
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,958
Where's the manual?

915
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,261
The manual…

916
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,929
Don't worry, Jung-mi.

917
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,975
We do emergency drills for
this sort of thing many times each year.

918
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,935
Captain, you don't seem well.
I can take over--

919
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,773
No, no! It's the captain's responsibility
to protect the passengers and cabin crew

920
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,024
till the bitter end.

921
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,108
Oh, shit!

922
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,822
Attention everyone, we might have
to make an emergency landing.

923
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:39,701
- Please try to remain calm as I am.
- It's upside down!

924
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:44,206
Leave behind all of your belongings
so that everyone may escape.

925
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,669
Fuck! We're all gonna die!

926
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,421
What?

927
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,131
Shit!

928
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,774
Mayday! Mayday!

929
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,318
Control tower! Come in!

930
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,498
Just give me a chance!

931
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:27,833
No!

932
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,460
Men should step up
in emergencies, not women.

933
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,338
Shut your damn mouth
and give me the controls!

934
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,551
Jung-woo?

935
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,705
Ready?

936
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,876
Put her in a gown.

937
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:12,878
Miss?

938
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,504
Oh, my!

939
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,924
- Miss?
- I'm fine. It's okay.

940
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,011
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

941
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,512
You may have a concussion.

942
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,805
You need to stay still.

943
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,766
- Let me help you.
- No, it's okay.

944
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,019
- One, two, three…
- Stay still, please!

945
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,147
See? I'm fine.

946
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,485
Oh, no.

947
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,363
Hey!

948
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:41,948
I'm sorry.

949
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,288
There she comes!

950
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,003
What caused the accident?

951
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,963
How soon after takeoff
did the accident occur?

952
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,216
Please tell us everything
you remember about the accident.

953
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,550
Are you okay?

954
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,889
Here.

955
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,436
Wait!

956
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:14,773
You've just saved 215 passengers.

957
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,525
You were the co-pilot.
Tell us what happened.

958
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,488
Move, please.

959
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,336
"Co-pilot Han Jung-mi
offers a hand warmer to the nurses."

960
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,338
You're a hero.

961
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,424
You saved the passengers.

962
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,598
How is Captain Seo Hyun-seok?

963
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,849
Captain Seo?

964
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,061
He has post-traumatic stress disorder.

965
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,689
They say he might have amnesia

966
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,691
caused by the traumatic
and painful incident.

967
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:00,694
It's not life-threatening,
so we'll have to wait and see.

968
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,406
You're being promoted to captain.

969
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,617
Pardon?

970
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,619
You're getting a special promotion.

971
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,371
Captain Han Jung-mi.

972
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,623
Me?

973
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,250
It was a critical situation,

974
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,128
but you made an emergency landing
and saved everyone.

975
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,421
You should be a captain.

976
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:20,797
Right?

977
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,135
If you need anything at all,

978
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,095
just let me know.

979
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:43,361
Hello, I'm Han Jung-mi,
a pilot for Han Air.

980
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,282
It was co-pilot Han Jung-mi
who saved those passengers.

981
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:50,327
It wasn't the captain.
How did this happen?

982
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,370
It was a miracle.

983
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,706
A Korean "Sully" Sullenberger.

984
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,083
- In 2009…
- Good job!

985
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:01,921
a US Airways plane heading
from New York to North Carolina…

986
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,048
Oh, no!

987
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,592
- hit some birds…
- What in the world?

988
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:13,975
The way co-pilot Han Jung-mi
saved those 215 passengers

989
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,518
was very similar.

990
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,811
Hello? Jung-mi!

991
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:18,563
Sis!

992
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,732
Did you see the news?

993
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,777
I almost died. Seriously…

994
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:26,154
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

995
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:29,324
Seo Hyun-seok, that bastard…

996
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:33,787
He lost his mind
and wouldn't give me the controls.

997
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,665
I thought something had happened to you.

998
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,584
I was so worried.

999
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:45,632
I just have some muscle pain.
I'm absolutely fine. Don't worry.

1000
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:46,800
That's great.

1001
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,135
What a relief.

1002
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,889
Are you at the airport? Wanna meet up?

1003
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,641
You should get some rest.

1004
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,268
Just go home and get some rest.

1005
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:00,230
I'm glad to hear your voice.
I'll call you later.

1006
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,731
Okay, got it.

1007
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,780
"Are you at the airport? Wanna meet up?"

1008
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,948
Jeez!

1009
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,950
Are you dating someone in that getup?

1010
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,243
No.

1011
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,496
That's crazy.

1012
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:22,168
What if you get caught?
Your face is all over the Internet!

1013
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,796
It's not like I asked for that.
Let's go inside.

1014
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,172
Wait.

1015
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,803
You crazy jerk! I thought you had died.

1016
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,389
I was so worried!

1017
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:40,145
Look, I'm here in one piece.

1018
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:49,446
You gotta live, no matter what,
at least until the mortgage is paid off.

1019
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:57,829
I should just die.

1020
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,999
What a relief
that you're still in one piece.

1021
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,250
- Let go!
- I'm so happy.

1022
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,877
Good! Natural pose!

1023
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,463
Great! More daring!

1024
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,506
HAN JUNG-MI

1025
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,973
"I'D PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE
FOR THE PASSENGERS"

1026
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,225
THE IMPORTANCE OF A LEADER!

1027
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,395
"I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF BEING A PILOT"

1028
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,981
HAN JUNG-MI, THE QUEEN OF ADS

1029
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,361
UNFORGETTABLE BEAUTY!

1030
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,905
HAN JUNG-MI GOES VIRAL!

1031
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:45,877
Si-hoo.

1032
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,129
All of this came for you.

1033
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,800
TELL ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
DADDY WILL BUY IT!

1034
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,056
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes.

1035
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,516
- Do you like it?
- Yes!

1036
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:05,438
"She's so pretty.
Must be plastic surgery."

1037
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,651
"She looks quite masculine."

1038
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,031
LOOKS MID, BUT PRETTIER WITH MAKEUP

1039
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:17,784
HI, JUNG-MI FROM DAEHAN HIGH

1040
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:18,868
What?

1041
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:19,869
JUNG-MI PULLED UP LOL

1042
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,080
Damn bitches. Fuck you all.

1043
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,215
Why take so many different pills?

1044
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,805
Just take one and be pain free!

1045
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,057
For headaches, toothaches, and cramps,

1046
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:45,019
this painkiller is made
from natural ingredients.

1047
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,187
THATDAY!

1048
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,192
Yes! I got your email.

1049
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:55,071
I'll check it and I'll be in touch soon.
Thank you.

1050
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,755
- You two are friends?
- Yes.

1051
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,967
We started around the same time
and became friends.

1052
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,721
You must have been upset
that she became a captain before you did.

1053
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,433
Of course not,
because Jung-mi is a great pilot.

1054
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:29,105
It's good to see you two.

1055
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,025
Two female pilots to lead Han Air.

1056
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,276
You'll make headlines.

1057
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:36,279
A hero who saved hundreds
and a women's rights activist.

1058
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,160
Oh, you didn't know?

1059
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:43,953
But you're friends. Didn't you tell her?

1060
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:50,710
Remember the Hankuk Air incident
involving my brother, Noh Jung-wook?

1061
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,880
I can't tell the difference between
the pilots and the stewardesses!

1062
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:56,883
The recording of those demeaning comments…

1063
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,177
Seul-ki is the one who exposed it.

1064
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,347
Look, they're beautiful!

1065
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,641
How could you say that
about the stewardesses?

1066
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,309
They're like a bouquet of flowers.

1067
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,227
Am I right or am I wrong, sir?

1068
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,729
It's wrong.

1069
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,522
That's right, sir.

1070
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:18,321
The stewardess here
will pour you a drink, sir.

1071
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,448
Really? Go ahead.

1072
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,993
Give her a big hand!

1073
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:31,459
She must really like you, sir!

1074
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:32,710
Drink it slowly, sir.

1075
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,215
Let's all have a drink!

1076
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,343
People are all the same.

1077
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:44,722
At first, they applaud you,
and then people talk.

1078
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,976
"She records things? That's creepy."

1079
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,313
"She must have had a crush on Han Jung-woo

1080
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,649
and got her revenge on him
when he rejected her."

1081
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,321
Seul-ki has had a really hard time.

1082
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,450
So I tried to recruit her for Han Air,
but she refused to--

1083
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:07,662
Director. Please refrain
from sharing about that.

1084
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,748
You promised not to bring that up.

1085
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:12,667
Very well.

1086
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,713
Don't trust her.

1087
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,090
I didn't come here because of her.

1088
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:23,010
I just wanted to keep being a pilot.

1089
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,559
That man in the recording…

1090
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:35,606
Have you ever thought
that maybe he's not that terrible?

1091
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:36,858
Who?

1092
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,111
Han Jung-woo?

1093
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:42,905
I don't know.

1094
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:48,911
He was fired because of one mistake,
divorced, and lost custody of his kid.

1095
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,582
Those are things that could have happened.

1096
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,711
Enough about that.

1097
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,340
Didn't you say
you had something to tell me?

1098
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,553
No. It's nothing.

1099
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,140
Actually, I understand Han Jung-woo.

1100
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,809
Not everyone can live like you do.

1101
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:24,739
Han Jung-woo!

1102
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,663
Ready, Dad?

1103
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:33,915
Catch!

1104
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,628
Aren't you and Mom getting married again?

1105
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,547
I don't think so.

1106
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,092
- Does that make you sad?
- Yeah.

1107
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:49,472
It's kind of embarrassing at kindergarten.

1108
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,225
Daddy's sorry.

1109
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,811
- But it has its good side too.
- How so?

1110
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:01,734
You pay more attention to me now
than you used to.

1111
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,070
You like that?

1112
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,490
Let's take a picture.

1113
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,035
Ready? One, two, three…

1114
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,829
SEUL-KI
BUSY? CAN WE TALK FOR A SEC?

1115
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,875
SEUL-KI
I'M ON MY WAY TO YOUR PLACE

1116
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,797
- Jung-mi!
- Oh, hi.

1117
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,678
What are you doing here?

1118
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,516
Are you angry at me over something?

1119
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:39,480
No, I'm not.

1120
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,318
Why aren't you on the flight schedule?

1121
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,903
Oh, that.

1122
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,365
Director Noh suggested
I should take a short break.

1123
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:53,995
All of those interviews
and photo shoots are so tough.

1124
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,163
Posing like this isn't easy.

1125
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,125
I see.

1126
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:02,628
You came all this way to ask me that?

1127
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,006
Why didn't you just call me?

1128
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,217
- Are you okay?
- About what?

1129
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:12,805
When you're famous and make lots of money,
won't you miss flying?

1130
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,022
Chan-won has countless fans.

1131
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:22,398
I LOVE CHAN-WON

1132
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:26,193
Grannies wake up early
to wait for him from dawn.

1133
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,113
We gotta go there
and set up camp the day before to…

1134
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:31,741
Hold on.

1135
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:37,830
Excuse me.

1136
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:41,167
I knew it. It's you!

1137
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:44,337
It's Han Jung-mi, the pilot!
My daughter has the same name.

1138
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,421
Hello.

1139
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,631
Oh, my!

1140
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,674
It's so good to meet you!

1141
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:52,303
You're my second favorite, after Chan-won.

1142
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,096
Thank you.

1143
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,348
Wow!

1144
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,308
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

1145
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,643
- Could you take a picture?
- Sure.

1146
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,770
- Thank you very much!
- Sure.

1147
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:03,522
- Can we link arms?
- Sure.

1148
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,066
Thank you!

1149
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,235
- One, two, three…
- Wait! Hold on!

1150
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,571
- Can we do a heart, please?
- Okay.

1151
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,323
One, two, three!

1152
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,283
Next, the Cherry Peace.

1153
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,328
- This is the Cherry Peace.
- Okay.

1154
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,955
There.

1155
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,415
Thank you!

1156
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:32,969
So my daughter Han Jung-mi
and this Han Jung-mi

1157
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,095
are roommates?

1158
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,347
- Yes.
- Yes!

1159
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:37,807
Really?

1160
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:41,602
You're never home
and we had an empty room.

1161
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:42,770
Why waste it?

1162
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:44,271
Really?

1163
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,732
Your brother comes and goes
whenever he wants.

1164
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,359
Mom, who are you calling?

1165
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,986
Your brother.

1166
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,032
MOM

1167
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,035
Hello?

1168
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,288
You can't fool me.

1169
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,709
If you call me again,
I'm calling the police.

1170
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,419
What's the matter?

1171
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,130
He said he kidnapped my kid.

1172
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,590
He asked for 30 million won.

1173
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,926
You don't even have a kid!
You're still single.

1174
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,345
- I know!
- Voice phishing is scary these days.

1175
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,555
- That's right.
- Yup.

1176
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:18,931
Voice phishing?

1177
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,266
The line is busy…

1178
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:23,185
You gotta be careful.
Why isn't he picking up?

1179
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,814
Damn it! Stop calling me!

1180
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,733
Stop it!

1181
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:29,984
Stop calling me! Damn it!

1182
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,529
Damn voice phishing bastards!

1183
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:34,697
Just break it!

1184
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:37,033
Crush those evil bastards!

1185
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:40,494
I'm sorry. I got overexcited.

1186
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,956
That's some temper.
Are all Han Jung-mis the same?

1187
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,167
Jung-woo must be flying right now.

1188
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,294
- Oh, my!
- Crazy jerk.

1189
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,004
Why isn't he answering?

1190
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,672
MOM

1191
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,175
It's not dead yet? Damn zombie!

1192
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,469
He didn't forget my birthday, did he?

1193
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,471
- It stopped.
- Is it your birthday, ma'am?

1194
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:02,266
It's my 70th birthday next week.

1195
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:06,771
I don't like birthday parties
and I made that quite clear,

1196
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:09,398
but my ex-daughter-in-law
arranged one for me.

1197
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,817
- Please come if you can.
- Me?

1198
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,986
Yes! It's a party.

1199
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,322
The more the merrier.

1200
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:19,492
I don't have any friends.
It'll be embarrassing.

1201
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,202
- Come on, Mom…
- Really?

1202
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,496
I'm sure you have loads of friends.

1203
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,539
Nope. They're all dead.

1204
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:27,208
Oh.

1205
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,877
At my age, these things happen.

1206
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:35,716
It would be so nice if you would come too.

1207
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:40,930
Come on, Mom. She's busy.
Why would she go there?

1208
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:42,723
- I'm busy.
- She's not coming.

1209
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,058
No way!

1210
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:53,651
My poor, poor mom…

1211
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:58,114
She worked so hard to support us.

1212
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,657
Are you okay?

1213
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:05,037
My mom is so unlucky.

1214
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:09,041
If she had been born 30 years later,
she would be a famous YouTuber.

1215
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,918
- Why you!
- Ouch.

1216
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,046
If I had been born 30 years later,
you wouldn't exist.

1217
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,299
- Where's your brother?
- Jung-woo?

1218
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,760
Jung-woo!

1219
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:24,056
Oh, Jung-woo!

1220
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,891
Be quiet, will you?

1221
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,394
Where did your dad go?

1222
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:30,229
Don't know?

1223
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:32,857
That twerp. Jeez!

1224
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,609
Where is he off to again?

1225
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:36,902
Jeez…

1226
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,947
I'm so sorry, Mom.

1227
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,577
- Going somewhere?
- Yes.

1228
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:46,871
My stomach hurts. I'll be right back.

1229
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,541
- Menstrual cramps?
- Yes, I think so.

1230
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:53,961
Stay here. I'll go to the pharmacy.

1231
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:02,428
You have menstrual cramps?

1232
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,138
Shut up.

1233
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:09,435
Oh, my! Seriously!

1234
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:13,606
That's crazy!

1235
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:14,940
See ya.

1236
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,283
EXPOSED!
HERO HAN AIR PILOT "H" IS A MAN!

1237
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,826
Who wrote this?

1238
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:27,995
Find out more about this.

1239
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:40,507
Si…

1240
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:43,177
She was here. Where's my mom?

1241
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:56,607
You must be the type
who loves passionately, Mr. Han Jung-woo.

1242
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,497
People don't recognize me much these days.

1243
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,333
I could tell it was you
behind those sunglasses.

1244
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:18,629
I used to work at Hankuk Air.

1245
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,353
I apologize for that night.

1246
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,063
When did you get here?

1247
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,566
My friend wants a picture
with Ms. Han Jung-mi.

1248
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,818
I'm not sure.

1249
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:43,654
She wasn't feeling well. Where is she?

1250
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:44,905
Isn't that Ms. Han Jung-mi?

1251
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,282
Where?

1252
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:47,866
Where?

1253
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:49,910
I saw her. I'll bring her over.

1254
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,705
Okay. Make sure you bring her here.

1255
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,956
Okay, Mom.

1256
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,375
- You can take a picture later.
- Thank you.

1257
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,547
Why you little…

1258
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,966
I drank too much.

1259
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:12,891
HAN JUNG-WOO

1260
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,852
HAN JUNG-MI

1261
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:20,482
Hey!

1262
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:23,902
I'm sorry.

1263
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:58,228
Have you seen my son by any chance?

1264
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,073
Love you!

1265
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:16,663
Cheer up! Cheer up!

1266
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,957
No matter how hard it is!

1267
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,340
THATDAY

1268
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,070
- Dad.
- Yeah?

1269
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:53,283
Why do you dress up and act like a woman?

1270
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:55,494
You knew?

1271
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:58,956
Of course!
I can tell by the way you smell.

1272
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:10,175
It's because people want me
to act like that.

1273
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:11,468
Really?

1274
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:16,682
But I still love you,
even if you don't act like a woman.

1275
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:36,994
There's your mom.

1276
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:38,704
We're here.

1277
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,457
Mom!

1278
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,460
Bye, Dad.

1279
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:46,128
Take care, Si-hoo.

1280
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:48,255
See you next time.

1281
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,676
- Bye.
- Soo-young?

1282
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,973
Thank you for arranging Mom's party.

1283
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:03,270
I should have done it. I'm sorry.

1284
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:06,940
And about Si-hoo…

1285
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,027
He's got talent.

1286
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,321
You were right.

1287
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:18,744
Take care.

1288
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:21,830
I mean it.

1289
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,001
Jung-woo…

1290
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,886
- Si-hoo's bag.
- Oh, right.

1291
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,105
Take good care of yourself too.

1292
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:01,495
I can't believe it. How could this happen?

1293
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,455
This is crazy!

1294
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,290
It doesn't make sense.

1295
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:06,917
It's true. I'm serious.

1296
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,377
It can't be.

1297
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:10,837
I had a bad feeling about her.

1298
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,381
How could she?

1299
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:15,926
HAN AIR'S WHISTLEBLOWER IS A FEMALE PILOT?

1300
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,971
Hey, she is the whistleblower.

1301
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,765
I heard she had a crush on him.

1302
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:24,935
I SAW HER IN THE MEETING ROOM

1303
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:36,113
Sis? What's going on?

1304
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:39,658
Why are you quitting?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1305
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:43,328
You're a strong woman who speaks her mind.

1306
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,585
Who cares about stupid rumors?

1307
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,924
- Jung-mi.
- Yeah?

1308
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,844
Is there anything you want to tell me?

1309
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:00,554
Like what?

1310
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:05,142
What did you want to tell me
after your flight to Hawaii?

1311
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:13,317
What was I going to say?
I don't know. I forgot, sis.

1312
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:14,985
Forget about that and…

1313
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:20,616
I've had enough.

1314
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,581
Thanks to the Han Jung-mi effect,

1315
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,167
the demand for long-distance flights
has increased.

1316
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,210
Han Air is…

1317
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,214
Han Jung-mi.

1318
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,017
I was about to call you here.

1319
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:50,562
Han Air's Q3 sales have hit
a new ten-year high!

1320
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,189
And it's all because of her!

1321
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:54,858
Wow!

1322
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:56,943
I need your help, Director.

1323
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,782
Let's take a break.

1324
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,877
Did you hear about that rumor
that's going around?

1325
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:17,714
You know how hard it was
for Seul-ki back then.

1326
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,634
Oh, that.

1327
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:24,137
Captain Seo posted it online.

1328
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:28,183
He said that Han Jung-mi is a man.

1329
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:35,649
And some passengers claimed
that the co-pilot sounded like a man.

1330
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:39,528
But anyone could have gone crazy
in that situation.

1331
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:42,572
Fortunately, I've dealt with Captain Seo.

1332
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:46,076
But people love a good conspiracy theory.

1333
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:49,996
So, I had no other choice.

1334
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:55,377
I will not let anyone tarnish
Han Jung-mi's image.

1335
01:26:55,585 --> 01:27:00,465
Because the senior pilot of my new airline
must be a noble Joan of Arc.

1336
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:05,387
Han Jung-mi can't be
the subject of wild rumors.

1337
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,684
So those rumors about Seul-ki…

1338
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:17,065
You can't distract people
from watching a fire

1339
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:19,818
unless there's another fire elsewhere.

1340
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,488
This is wrong.

1341
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,906
What?

1342
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,658
I can't do this.

1343
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:35,542
Men should step up in emergencies,
not women!

1344
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:38,670
Shut your damn mouth
and give me the controls!

1345
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,840
Jung-woo?

1346
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:52,017
Did you really think that I didn't know?

1347
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,695
When you're filthy rich,
you see all kinds of shit.

1348
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,739
This doesn't surprise me.

1349
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:10,786
None of this matters to me,
but what would others think?

1350
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,455
You scammed the entire country.

1351
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:16,333
You knew?

1352
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:19,544
And Yoon Seul-ki must feel
so betrayed by you.

1353
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:24,299
So? Are you going to quit?

1354
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,053
Think it over.

1355
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:32,891
Han Jung-mi is still useful to me.

1356
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,519
Just wait a year.

1357
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:41,316
I'll give you back your position
at Hankuk Air as Han Jung-woo.

1358
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:46,238
Then you can stop parading around
as a woman.

1359
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:53,829
Soon I'll be announced as the new CEO
of Hankuk Air and Han Air.

1360
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:57,541
I'll fill the board with my people.

1361
01:28:58,124 --> 01:29:01,086
And, of course, Han Jung-mi too.

1362
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,131
I need a break.

1363
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:07,843
Go inside and rest.

1364
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,720
Look at it squirming!

1365
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:17,143
Fishing is so much fun!
Oh, no, really.

1366
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:20,605
Who's calling me this late?

1367
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,859
What a surprise.

1368
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:27,529
Hello?

1369
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:30,699
This is new, you calling me first.

1370
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,951
I can hardly hear you. Where are you?

1371
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:34,578
On a pilgrimage!

1372
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:37,414
I'm out at sea. The connection is bad.

1373
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:40,834
- Mom.
- What?

1374
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:47,340
I wasn't that bad of a son, right?

1375
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:53,221
I graduated top of the Air Force Academy,
made a lot of money,

1376
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,141
and I gave you a cute grandson.

1377
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:01,730
I worked really hard.
I hope you know that.

1378
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:04,774
At getting fired and divorced?

1379
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,152
Why leave out the bit
about losing custody?

1380
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,029
You knew about everything?

1381
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:12,240
Of course I did.
I saw the news and knew it was you.

1382
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:14,659
Think I wouldn't recognize you as a woman?

1383
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:23,126
I should never have become a pilot.

1384
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:31,384
I should've just found myself
a regular company job.

1385
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:40,143
Even if I didn't make as much money,
I should have done what I wanted.

1386
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:44,648
My life is ruined.

1387
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:48,944
I don't know where to begin fixing this.

1388
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:53,156
Nobody pushed you into doing anything.
Don't you remember?

1389
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,576
When you were a kid,

1390
01:30:56,785 --> 01:31:01,331
you went on a big airplane
and fell in love with flying.

1391
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:05,210
You always said
that you wanted to be a pilot.

1392
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:07,170
You did what you wanted.

1393
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:08,922
Son…

1394
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:13,510
you can live for yourself,
but don't embarrass yourself.

1395
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:15,512
Okay? Ciao!

1396
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:35,031
FLYING BEYOND THE PACIFIC TO EUROPE

1397
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,868
WE'LL BE THERE FOR YOUR SPECIAL MOMENTS

1398
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:57,887
A new era of airlines.

1399
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:05,562
And a new CEO to lead
both Hankuk Air and Han Air.

1400
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,022
I'm Noh Mun-young.

1401
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:16,656
We will continue to lead the way
in innovation and change,

1402
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:20,452
and we will strengthen our position
as a global airline.

1403
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:24,914
And here's the senior pilot
who will be leading both airlines.

1404
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:29,711
Please welcome Captain Han Jung-mi.

1405
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:55,236
Be good.

1406
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:16,424
Hello, I'm Captain Han Jung-mi.

1407
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:22,764
Han Jung…

1408
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,727
What are you doing? Snap out of it.

1409
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:30,021
Han Jung-mi.

1410
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:33,066
Han Jung-mi?

1411
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,530
Are you out of your mind?

1412
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,742
Why you--

1413
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:45,161
Han Jung-woo.

1414
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:49,541
Han Jung-woo…

1415
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,919
is who I am.

1416
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:01,761
I'm the one…

1417
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:10,603
I'm the one who compared
those stewardesses to a flower bouquet.

1418
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,733
I'm a man.

1419
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:21,698
What?

1420
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:25,660
I needed a job.

1421
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,999
I'm very sorry for deceiving everybody.

1422
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:38,006
I was scared of losing what I had.

1423
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:43,303
But I ended up losing everything anyway.

1424
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,097
Including myself.

1425
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:51,019
To all the flight attendants
who were there that night,

1426
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:56,524
I would like to offer
my sincere apologies.

1427
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:02,071
I've hurt you deeply
with my thoughtless words and actions.

1428
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:05,033
If I hadn't disguised myself like this,

1429
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:07,452
I never would have realized that.

1430
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:24,427
It's urgent.

1431
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:27,388
You should see this, ma'am.

1432
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:31,059
Female pilot Han Jung-mi
saved 215 people and rose to stardom.

1433
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:35,730
We've acquired an exclusive recording
from that flight, and here it is.

1434
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:42,278
- Just give me a chance!
- No!

1435
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,739
Men should step up in emergencies,
not women.

1436
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:47,825
Shut your damn mouth
and give me the controls!

1437
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:52,956
This is the co-pilot.

1438
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:59,128
We'll be making an emergency landing.

1439
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,547
- Brace!
- If you're traveling with children…

1440
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,716
- Brace!
- …our cabin crew will assist you.

1441
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,301
Please keep your heads down low.

1442
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:07,929
I repeat.

1443
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:10,348
Please bend over
and keep your heads down low.

1444
01:36:10,473 --> 01:36:13,184
We'll be making an emergency landing.

1445
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:15,937
We can survive this.

1446
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:18,606
I promise.

1447
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,068
We'll make it.

1448
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,706
Please…

1449
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:37,834
Please…

1450
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:41,254
Please…

1451
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:50,221
This was not sent to us by Han Jung-mi,
but by Han Jung-woo.

1452
01:37:02,147 --> 01:37:03,693
HAN JUNG-MI'S SHOCKING REVELATION

1453
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:09,615
You know…

1454
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:16,080
I've lived like this for a few months.

1455
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:21,419
It was really hard and uncomfortable.

1456
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:23,504
Jeez!

1457
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:27,383
I've experienced things
that I never imagined.

1458
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,594
Perhaps you won't even believe me.

1459
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:32,680
But please let me finish.

1460
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:40,355
I only lived for myself until now,

1461
01:37:41,481 --> 01:37:43,900
but I'm not living an embarrassing life.

1462
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,155
That crazy bastard.

1463
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,450
Are you watching?

1464
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:54,619
Co-pilot Yoon Seul-ki.

1465
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:56,621
I'm Han Jung-woo.

1466
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:59,248
I'd like to apologize to you in person.

1467
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:02,877
I'll meet you where we last met.
I'm on my way.

1468
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:05,922
THE DISPLAY IS UNDER MAINTENANCE

1469
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:10,718
Stay back!

1470
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:13,054
If you come any closer,
I'll take off my underwear!

1471
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,482
Wait! Move!

1472
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,486
- Everyone, this is a sham!
- Out of my way!

1473
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,866
What's happening?

1474
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,329
The hell?

1475
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:54,554
I'm sorry!

1476
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:00,077
I'm beat.

1477
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:05,458
Oh, come on!

1478
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:10,087
Why do you keep following me?

1479
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:11,839
Because you were running.

1480
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:13,090
I gotta go.

1481
01:40:32,068 --> 01:40:33,945
I've heard Han Jung-woo's apology.

1482
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:36,948
What about Han Jung-mi's?

1483
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:41,202
I'm sorry.

1484
01:40:57,969 --> 01:40:59,178
Did it hurt?

1485
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:03,891
Stop taking pictures, please.

1486
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:11,399
HAN JUNG-WOO'S CONFESSION

SUPPORTERS VS. CRITICIZERS

1493
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,879

ONE YEAR LATER

1504
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,420
Her life changed
after discovering Lee Chan-won.

1505
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,048
Today's star is Ms. Kim Ahn-ja!

1506
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,968
Hello, I'm Kim Ahn-ja.

1507
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:22,720
GOLD BUTTON YOUTUBER
CHAN-WON'S NO. 1 FAN!

1508
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:23,804
Hold on.

1509
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:27,141
I'm filming now. I can't talk right now.

1510
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:31,562
Okay, okay. I'll call you later.

1511
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:34,357
Dad, how are you?

1512
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:38,027
Granny was on TV today.

1513
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:42,156
She's almost as famous as Lee Chan-won.

1514
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:43,616
CELEBRATING 100K!

1515
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:47,745
She says that it's all thanks
to the camera you bought her.

1516
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:53,167
Aunt Jung-mi finally got
the silver button.

1517
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,169
…and final touch-ups.

1518
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:58,881
She says she's popular,
though not as popular as Granny.

1519
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:04,136
And last but not least…

1520
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:07,139
I received the top prize
at a dance competition.

1521
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:09,684
This is supposed to be a secret,

1522
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:12,353
but Mom cried
and said it was worth teaching me.

1523
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:18,943
We all celebrated at that restaurant
you booked for us today.

1524
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,487
The pizza was so yummy!

1525
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:23,614
Let's go together.

1526
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:25,866
See you soon!

1527
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,378
Hi, sir. I arrived safely.

1528
01:43:39,588 --> 01:43:41,841
Well, I'm happy here.

1529
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:43,426
It's nice.

1530
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:48,139
No, no, it's not about the money.

1531
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:49,932
It's just…

1532
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:53,602
I'll call you back.

1533
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,367
Ms. Yoon!

1534
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:25,134
Just "Onni."

1535
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:30,097
"Onni"?

1536
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:03,607
PILOT

1537
01:46:15,744 --> 01:46:18,789
Hi! You came for a makeover, right?

1538
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:21,041
Welcome.

1539
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:26,005
Take off your glasses, please.
And your hat.

1540
01:46:29,633 --> 01:46:31,135
Choose one.

1541
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:33,095
This one, please.

1542
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:34,722
- This one?
- Yes.

1543
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:35,681
Sky!

1544
01:46:35,764 --> 01:46:38,267
There will be subtitles
and some touch-ups.

1545
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:41,103
- Actually, I'm a cop.
- Really?

1546
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:44,398
I'm going undercover for a case.

1547
01:46:44,648 --> 01:46:47,735
You look like a female warrior
for justice now.

1548
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:52,865
DONE

1549
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:58,871
GIVE US A CALL!
FILMING AND MAKEUP CONSULTATIONS

1550
01:46:58,954 --> 01:47:01,165
What is this?

1551
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:03,375
Where did she go?

1552
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,714
What did she do?
