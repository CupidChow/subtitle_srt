00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:45,080
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,600
Run! Gu Yiye!

3
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,360
Back off!

4
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,880
Back off!

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,759
Get back, all of you!

6
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,160
Comrades.

7
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,240
We are new recruits,

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,560
we do not have guns,

9
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
but we are here to be soldiers.

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,140
Never be afraid!

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,760
Never be afraid!

12
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,360
Gu Yiye!

13
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,920
Hang in there!

14
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
Hang in there!

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Gao Liang!

16
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,960
You were killed in battle.

17
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
Don't play games!

18
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,280
It's no fun that way.

19
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,360
Go!

20
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
It was the first time in my entire life

21
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,640
that I had hugged a boy,

22
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,240
and the first time that I had been

23
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,520
saved by a boy, or rather, a male soldier.

24
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,240
The feeling was strange,

25
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,520
and made me appreciate the meaning of

26
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
the comradeship for the first time.

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,120
More importantly,

28
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,040
as comrade-in-arms,

29
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,960
we should bravely save

30
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,000
the Division 234 together.

31
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,560
Where are we going?

32
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,800
To find the main force of the Division 234.

33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,560
How are we supposed to find them

34
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,720
in the wilderness without a map?

35
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,120
What's wrong?

36
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,880
Be quiet!

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,480
What happened?

38
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,080
Wild rabbits?

39
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Run!

40
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,800
Don't move! Get down!

41
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,720
Don't move! Get down! Don't move!

42
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,240
Drop the weapon!

43
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,800
Tie them up!

44
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,840
Wait, wait a minute.

45
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,120
He’s the leader of

46
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,760
our team.

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
Tie him up if you need to.

48
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,040
This female soldier and I are both innocent.

49
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,320
Get the hardest part done first.

50
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,760
Let me help you tie him up.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
Enough talk. Tie them up!

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
Come on, don't tie me up.

53
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,960
You're supposed to tie him up. Why me?

54
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,280
You cunning veterans,

55
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,159
you must not have seen my magical powers!

56
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,120
Let me tell you something.

57
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,920
You better not cut me loose!

58
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,800
If you are men,

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
then untie me!

60
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,159
I'm sure you guys will be wrapped into buns

61
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,280
and planted in the ground as fertilizer!

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,960
Untie me now!

63
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,520
Shut your mouth!

64
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,920
Who gave you permission to speak?

65
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,800
Come on, have some water.

66
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,840
Thanks.

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,680
Comrade, can I give him some water?

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,280
I'll do it.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,200
Veterans are kindness.

70
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,800
You see, a veteran’s awareness.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
Although he tied me up,

72
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,840
at the critical moment,

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,880
the revolutionary friendship is earth-shaking!

74
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,600
I can't reach it.

75
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,560
Come closer.

76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,520
Closer.

77
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,840
Don't you dare fool me!

78
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,800
I'm telling you, you better cut me loose!

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,520
Don't untie me today.

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,760
If I get untied,

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm gonna be your worst nightmare!

82
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,680
I'll haunt you for the rest of your life!

83
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,320
Be careful when you go to the bathroom at midnight!

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,840
I'll kick you into the toilet and drown you!

85
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
Gu Yiye. How dare you laugh!

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,480
You bastard.

87
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
How dare you!

88
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,520
I’m gonna kick your ass!

89
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
How dare you!

90
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,480
You traitor, let go!

91
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
How dare you laugh!

92
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,280
Stop it!

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,320
How dare you laugh!

94
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,800
Stop fighting, you two.

95
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
Comrade veterans.

96
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,320
Come here!

97
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,480
Stand aside!

98
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,640
You cunning veterans,

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
put all your guns down!

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
What are you humming for?

101
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,320
What?

102
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,200
I can't believe you told us to put the gun down!

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,640
You are too young!

104
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,000
Rookie!

105
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
Every new recruit thinks he's special.

106
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,040
You're the only one who plays tricks.

107
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,480
Come on, tie it on.

108
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,280
Turn around!

109
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,120
Hey, veteran.

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,080
Look, what is this?

111
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,320
A hand grenade!

112
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,200
A hand grenade!

113
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,800
Lie down!

114
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,960
A hand grenade! Lie down!

115
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,320
Are you crazy?

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,320
Are you okay?

117
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
You rookie,

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,840
don't you know paper grenades can hurt people?

119
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,320
You're a veteran, why are you messing with me?

120
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:19,880
You!

121
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,360
Go away!

122
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,960
Get lost as far as you can!

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,880
Let's go!

124
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,640
Go!

125
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
That guy is a daredevil.

126
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,360
Why don't you kick his ass?

127
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
Gu Yiye, you're bleeding again.

128
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
It's okay.

129
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
Go and check if Gao Liang is injured.

130
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Gao Liang,

131
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,360
Are you alright?

132
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,720
Are you kidding me? Look at his body type.

133
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
I could kick his ass!

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,320
I can take him as a turnip and put him in the ground!

135
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,320
What's the big deal!

136
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,200
Gao Liang!

137
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,360
Hey Gao Liang, what's wrong with your ears?

138
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm fine, leave me alone.

139
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,840
Let me see.

140
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,920
Let go of me!

141
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,960
Are you guys going to get rough with me?

142
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
Don't move.

143
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,160
Check him out.

144
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,760
Don't move.

145
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,680
It's hurts!

146
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,800
It's bleeding, don't move!

147
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,120
He's got a perforated eardrum.

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,720
I think it was the paper grenade.

149
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,240
Check the other side, don't move!

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,600
- Let go! - Don’t move!

151
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,000
It's the same over here.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,559
Let me go.

153
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,720
You're strangling me.

154
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,920
What a big deal, just a little blood.

155
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,320
Let me tell you something serious.

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,600
If I had been blown up just now,

157
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,240
I would have died to save you both.

158
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,280
Gao Liang.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,280
Eardrum perforation is not a big deal.

160
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,240
It usually recovers in 20 days and a month.

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm not afraid!

162
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,120
Let's just finish the job and

163
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,360
say goodbye.

164
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
Gao Liang,

165
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,520
Gu Yiye is worried about you.

166
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,680
Why don't you understand?

167
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,280
I just don't like him, okay?

168
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm telling you,

169
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,520
you like the way he pretends to be,

170
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,920
and I'm not buying it.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,920
And I'm telling you,

172
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,640
I hate you.

173
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,160
People's Army!

174
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
That's People's Army!

175
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,400
I, the people,

176
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,160
take precedence over you, the Army!

177
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,800
I'll surpass you sooner or later.

178
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,520
I'm gonna prove it to everyone.

179
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,840
Gao Liang.

180
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,040
Gao Liang.

181
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,640
I'm gonna correct a mistake you made.

182
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,400
People and army,

183
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,680
they're not constellation.

184
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,120
The people are the source of the PLA

185
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,160
and the purpose of the PLA.

186
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,600
Ten years ago,

187
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,120
I wanted to be a soldier,

188
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,840
and I wanted to be a general.

189
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,720
That was my glory.

190
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,440
But that war

191
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,400
changed me

192
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
and made me understand that

193
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,320
I became a soldier

194
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,680
for this country

195
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
and for the people of

196
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,920
this country.

197
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,160
This

198
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,440
is my glory!

199
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,690
Oh My!

200
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,600
Jiang Nanzheng.

201
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,360
This guy is so eloquent.

202
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,120
If I were a girl,

203
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,760
I'd like him too.

204
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
I'm not as eloquent as he is.

205
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,560
So good at talking.

206
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
So much nonsense!

207
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
How do you know everything!

208
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,320
Talk too much.

209
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,560
Shh.

210
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,120
Be quiet!

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,400
Go.

212
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,320
Let's go.

213
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,440
You're very alert.

214
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,880
How did you find it?

215
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,360
She's a female soldier.

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,760
What's wrong with being careful?

217
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
Do you think female soldiers

218
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,560
should be inferior to you in every way?

219
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,240
Don't look down on people.

220
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
You male soldiers are too slow.

221
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,210
Prepare to outflank.

222
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,080
What are you doing?

223
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,200
Why are you here?

224
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,320
Go away.

225
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,960
Comrade Veteran.

226
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,240
Well, listen to me.

227
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,080
Look over there!

228
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,960
You've been captured, don't move.

229
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
Out of the way!

230
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,640
Well, veteran.

231
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
You've been captured.

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,240
Please respect the drill rules.

233
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,280
Stay there!

234
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,640
Speak up if you have something to say.

235
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,960
I can hear you.

236
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,440
I know what you want to say.

237
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,120
You want to ask,

238
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,000
what changed him

239
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,120
a few years ago, right?

240
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
How do you know that?

241
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
Let me tell you

242
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,160
whether it’s urban

243
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,840
or rural,

244
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,680
military cadres or peasant,

245
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,280
it’s a secret

246
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,600
that all boys

247
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,720
in our age shared.

248
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,640
What were you doing

249
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,000
a few years ago?

250
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,200
I was in junior high school.

251
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,520
A few years ago,

252
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,920
I really felt

253
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,320
the brutality of real war.

254
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,920
The heroes who died in the movie

255
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
became my relatives

256
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,640
who could never come back.

257
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,240
- Gao Shan. - Yes sir!

258
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,000
Is your father also...

259
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,800
No.

260
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,720
It's my brother.

261
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,240
My brother was a soldier.

262
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,880
He died in battle.

263
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,840
My childhood was over completely

264
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,040
from the moment my brother died.

265
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,720
I felt that

266
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,240
I have grown into an adult overnight.

267
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,280
What's wrong?

268
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,640
You two look like

269
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,560
I've been captured.

270
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't stand there. Who will question him?

271
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
You rookie,

272
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,960
If you break the radio, you'll be in big trouble.

273
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,160
Be in big trouble?

274
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,480
Am I in trouble now?

275
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,360
Am I?

276
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,080
You rookie!

277
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,840
I'd rather kill you than be a soldier!

278
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,840
What did you just do with this ambition?

279
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,640
You’re gonna be tied up here. Stay right here!

280
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,440
Say something nice.

281
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Hey, brother.

282
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,320
I called you brother.

283
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,120
Shut your mouth!

284
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,880
Who's your brother?

285
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,000
You are so old, who is your brother?

286
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
Report your

287
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,000
intelligence,

288
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,360
deployments,

289
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,360
what else?

290
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,760
Anyway, report all the information

291
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,760
to me.

292
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,040
Say something!

293
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,400
Tough talker, huh?

294
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,680
Are you guys tough talkers?

295
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,440
Gao Liang,

296
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,840
enough.

297
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,320
Two veterans.

298
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
The dilemma you are experiencing

300
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,440
is the same one we are experiencing.

301
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,480
Even if we don't get the information, we can't kill you.

302
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
This is fine for drills,

303
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,280
but not on the battlefield.

304
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,120
Please follow the rules of the drill.

305
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,520
Lend us the motorcycle.

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,800
We promise not to break it.

307
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,960
The equipment is intact.

308
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,600
My buddy is making fun of you guys.

309
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,360
You're free now.

310
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,880
But with one condition.

311
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Take off

312
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,240
both of your uniforms.

313
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,480
And all the uniforms

314
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,120
in the satchel too.

315
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,040
Take it off.

316
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,720
Two heads, don't hesitate.

317
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,800
You rookie,

318
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,400
We have been killed in battle.

319
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,440
Don't worry, guys.

320
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,520
We won't tell anyone we ran into you.

321
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,960
There is a helmet in the sidecar.

322
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,040
Okay, fine.

323
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,200
Long live understanding, veteran comrades!

324
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,080
You rookie,

325
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,040
next time I see you, I'll kick your ass.

326
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,880
All right!

327
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Comrade Gao Liang.

328
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,480
Good performance this time.

329
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,320
You deserve credit.

330
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,400
As a reward, I'll let you sit in the sidecar.

331
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,440
What kind of reward is this?

332
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,080
This is the treatment I should have!

333
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,880
A leader like me...

334
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,880
I think

335
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,680
this seat is more appropriate for female soldiers.

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,600
It's too dangerous for you to sit here. Get down.

337
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
Come down.

338
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,000
You sit in the sidecar.

339
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,320
It's safe and comfortable here.

340
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,120
Leave the dangerous position

341
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,280
to me.

342
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
You don't have to hold that tight,

343
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,440
loose it.

344
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,720
I might fall.

345
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,880
Let's go.

346
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,119
Gu,

347
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,359
you are a quite

348
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
good rider, huh?

349
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,319
When I was a child, I often saw people riding this in the infantry college.

350
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,200
And change the tire while marching,

351
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,599
cross the canoe bridge unilaterally, etc.

352
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,440
What, you wanna try?

353
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,960
I'm a senior officer,

354
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,000
I can just sit, you ride.

355
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,920
Do you think our troops

356
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,240
will be full of big motorcycles in the future?

357
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,280
Mechanization

358
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,400
is way better than our feet.

359
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,800
Two feet is good, but not as good as two tires.

360
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,400
Army B scouts is coming.

361
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,320
Say hi.

362
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,160
Ok, let me do this.

363
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,280
Don't act like you're higher than them.

364
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,760
We're rookies, just give a salute.

365
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,920
Their uniforms are different from us.

366
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,360
I don't recognize that gun either.

367
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,280
That's what Commissar Lu said

368
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,560
"The most famous scout in the whole army".

369
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,200
They're wearing type 81 camouflage clothing,

370
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,120
which is only for the combat troops

371
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,120
and a small number of reconnaissance units.

372
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,720
Oh, take off your armband.

373
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,040
We'll be in trouble if we're caught by our own people, so hurry up.

374
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
It might out of fuel.

375
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
It ran out of fuel.

376
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,390
Gao Liang,

377
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,120
look at you.

378
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Just a few scouts

379
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,480
will scare you out.

380
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,760
Don't blame him.

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,880
When people are afraid and nervous,

382
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,670
they will secrete a lot of stomach acid to stimulate vomiting.

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,880
It's normal.

384
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,200
You're alright?

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,120
Jiang Nanzheng,

386
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,600
I'm telling you don't get me wrong,

387
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm not afraid of them,

388
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,520
I'm just getting carsick,

389
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,040
motorcycle-sick.

390
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,200
Enough.

391
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,560
You gotta be hurry.

392
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,600
The scouts will be here soon.

393
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,680
Who?

394
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,880
Come on.

395
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
Put your gun down.

396
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,400
I,

397
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,960
Qin Hanyong from Regiment 720.

398
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,200
All of you! Attention!

399
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,240
Be quiet!

400
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,480
Sir,

401
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,720
I'm Mao Jiajia from the 9th class of the 9th company.

402
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,200
I've read about you from

403
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
the PLA Daily newspaper.

404
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,400
You were the company commander of the Night Tiger Company.

405
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,000
You are our role model.

406
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,920
Please give us instruction.

407
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Everybody listen!

408
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,120
Find a cover immediately! Someone is coming!

409
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,360
- Hurry up! - Hurry!

410
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,680
Come, come, come.

411
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,000
Gao Liang, wait!

412
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,280
I'm exhausted,

413
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,440
Freeze!

414
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,440
Who are you guys?

415
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Which part do you belong to?

416
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,680
Wu Yong from Communication company of Regiment 686.

417
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,800
They are our friends huh?

418
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,000
Come on bros,

419
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,320
Hold them firm! Welcome to our friends!

420
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,080
No, no, no.

421
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:31,960
No.

422
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,400
We aren't from Regiment 686.

423
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,600
Gao Liang, shut up.

424
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
Just shut up, can't you tell it?

425
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,400
Look how sloppy they are,

426
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,320
they are definitely not the Army B.

427
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,920
Are you insulting us?

428
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,400
You little bastard how dare you?

429
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,440
Are you insulting us?

430
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,280
Boys they are insulting us!

431
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,760
Hold them firm!

432
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,360
I'm not wrong.

433
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,640
Don't mess up with him!

434
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
We are indeed the recruits from regiment 720.

435
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,680
Don't fool me.

436
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
Recruits from regiment 720

437
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,560
wearing a hat from regiment 686?

438
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,360
And,

439
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,880
I've been regiment 720 for so long,

440
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,840
never seen you guys.

441
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,640
We are indeed the recruits from regiment 720.

442
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,360
We just got off the train at noon yesterday.

443
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,160
We stunned

444
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,080
two regiment 686

445
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,840
signalers and got

446
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,640
this uniform.

447
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,440
Give me five minutes,

448
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
I'll tell you

449
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,560
everything.

450
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,400
If you found something wrong,

451
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,600
you can shoot us down immediately.

452
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,840
Want one?

453
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,240
You just said you had information to report to the division.

454
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,960
What information?

455
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,120
I can only say it in front of the division commander

456
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,720
You are kidding us, right?

457
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,440
Daguo, make him stand there.

458
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,080
Sir,

459
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
he seems too smart.

460
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,360
You may not be familiar with this because you're new to regiment 720.

461
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,360
You saw what

462
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,240
he just did, right？

463
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,160
None of us veterans are like that.

464
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,040
He is definitely not our person.

465
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,640
Shut them up first.

466
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,800
Yes, sir.

467
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,720
Daguo.

468
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,080
Tie them up.

469
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,800
Yes!

470
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,480
Stop it! I'm telling you guys,

471
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,880
you are making a mistake!

472
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,920
You guys have done great damage to the revolution!

473
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,080
Tie them up!

474
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,520
I think they are from regiment 720 indeed.

475
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,360
Just tell them!

476
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,160
I agree,

477
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,880
just tell them!

478
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,000
No.

479
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,800
Don't forget what

480
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,680
Army B just did.

481
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,400
If they lie to us,

482
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,080
we're done.

483
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,320
Just forget it!

484
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,480
If we continue to hesitate, by the time the exercise is over,

485
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,360
we're all done.

486
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,040
Are you guys arguing?

487
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,880
I like it.

488
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,800
How about this?

489
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,080
Let that female soldier

490
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,320
help you guys make decision.

491
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,360
If you have something to do, come to me.

492
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,800
I'm not afraid of any kind of torture.

493
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,920
Don't scare her!

494
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,320
Enough.

495
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,480
Get out of the way.

496
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,640
You remind me of someone.

497
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,920
The one I respect the most.

498
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,760
These two guys are braver than recruit,

499
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,320
smarter than veteran.

500
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Sir, I've tried my best.

501
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,960
Never mind.

502
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,880
They said they'd met the signaler of the Army B,

503
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,920
not the scouts.

504
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,480
If that was the case,

505
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,480
it meant that the main force of Army B

506
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,720
and the frontline command were not far behind.

507
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,360
There might be something happened at the Zhangmu train station.

508
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,880
Stop finding the 3rd Battalion.

509
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,800
Take them with you to

510
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,960
the Zhangmu train station to check the situation.

511
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,560
If there is something strange,

512
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,680
inform the division immediately.

513
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,480
Yes, Sir.

514
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,840
Where are they?

515
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,080
Sir.

516
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,720
What happened?

517
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,640
Who did he say you looked like just now?

518
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,000
Your father used to teach him at the infantry college.

519
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,120
He admires your father.

520
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
My father is ten times prouder than him.

521
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,960
As his student, he is so headstrong

522
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,120
and foolhardy.

523
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,400
My dad didn't look up to him.

524
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,200
Why do I sound like you're

525
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,400
being sarcastic about me?

526
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,760
If you think you are too, just correct it.

527
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,320
According to you,

528
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
the man

529
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,320
he admires is not as good as your dad.

530
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Not really.

531
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
People who can make people like him look up to,

532
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,360
must have a great personality.

533
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,600
My dad is a soldier.

534
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,280
But more like a scholar.

535
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,840
This is his weakness.

536
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,280
Then you can't learn this from your dad.

537
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
Just tell me who he is!

538
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,600
You're not gonna say it until I ask you huh?

539
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,320
He is the one we gonna see,

540
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,280
Zheng Yuan, from division 234.

541
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,280
Reporting to the division commander.

542
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,920
There's a landslide two hundred meters ahead.

543
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,840
The amount of dirt and stone that slipped down was too large,

544
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,480
and the progress of our engineering battalion in the rush repairs has been slow.

545
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,800
We need half a day to get by.

546
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,080
This kind of army collapses as soon as it is fought.

547
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,480
Don't get angry, commander, this is an exercise.

548
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,480
I'm still being polite in saying that.

549
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,800
I was afraid that the army would collapse before there was a war.

550
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,280
Staff officer Wang.

551
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,960
Here!

552
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,080
Tell Leng Rui to lead his regiment 700

553
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,840
drop all the heavy weapons

554
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,440
follow the divisional front command

555
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,120
cross the Sanling Mountain lightly

556
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
to the Zhangmu train station.

557
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,760
Even if you lose, you have to lose in the enemy's crater,

558
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,280
not in your own territory.

559
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,800
Yes, Sir.

560
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,920
What about the regiment 720?

561
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,000
Make them wait.

562
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,840
The battlefield can be cleared

563
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,960
after engineering battalion break through the road.

564
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,800
Go.

565
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,360
Yes, Sir.

566
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Call the Regiment 700.

567
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,560
Regiment 700 please reply if you got the message.

568
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,760
Division commander has instructions.

569
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,120
Everyone unloads all the heavy armament and travels light.

570
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,760
Follow the division go to Sanling Mountain.

571
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,320
To the Zhangmu train station.

572
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,120
Please reply if you got the message.

573
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,080
Our country needs an army that

574
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,200
will reinvigorate its might.

575
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,120
There is a lot of resistance

576
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,240
This resistance is not given by others,

577
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,200
but by ourselves.

578
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,560
Step back.

579
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,040
Back.

580
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,960
Go there.

581
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,080
You know the rule?

582
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,240
My rank is higher than yours.

583
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,360
So You'll introduce yourself to me first.

584
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,360
We are

585
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,640
from the Army B.

586
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,680
Army B, the regiment 686 of Army B.

587
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,760
Great.

588
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,600
I'm from regiment 720.

589
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,120
We are enemy.

590
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,000
According to the regulations of the exercise,

591
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,840
Two-on-one can't use weapons, you can only fight with your bare hands.

592
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,280
Come on.

593
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,760
No no no.

594
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,280
Don't get me wrong, we are on one side.

595
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,120
I'm not on your side.

596
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,400
We are from the regiment 720 indeed!

597
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,040
We are the recruits from regiment 720.

598
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,520
We were captured at the Zhangmu Train Station by enemy.

599
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,560
And we ran away.

600
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,760
We captured two signaler of the

601
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,280
regiment 686 on the road.

602
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,280
We subdued them,

603
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,480
took their uniforms off and we put them on.

604
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,520
And we just got here.

605
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,440
What he said was true, and we didn't lie to you.

606
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,680
What's wrong? Sir?

607
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,440
I am Wang Song of the scout company of the Regiment 720.

608
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,880
I took a few soldiers out on a mission.

609
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,160
We encountered scouts of the Army B,

610
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,160
and then the group got separated.

611
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,880
My foot

612
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,560
were caught in the trap of wild boar.

613
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,240
Sir.

614
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Do you know where is the division headquarters?

615
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,080
What?

616
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
We need to talk to the division commander.

617
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,000
What do you recruits have to do with the division commander?

618
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,240
We got important information.

619
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,680
What information?

620
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Important information.

621
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,200
Ask him.

622
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,320
He will tell you.

623
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,720
It's a very important information.

624
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,900
[Wang Song]

625
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,880
It's Wang Song.

626
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,560
Of course, it's Wang Song.

627
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,040
Give it back.

628
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,000
You guys seems

629
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,240
don't trust me.

630
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,480
Fine.

631
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,080
I don't want to know either.

632
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,280
You two go find division commander yourselves.

633
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,960
Sir.

634
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,320
We didn't doubt you.

635
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,080
You see, we were recruits.

636
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
What about the information

637
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,600
if we got caught?

638
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,440
You belong to the reconnaissance company.

639
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,840
Let us give you the information.

640
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,200
We split up

641
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,880
and go to the division together, so that's a solid plan.

642
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Enough.

643
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,120
I'm not gonna listen to you guys.

644
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,400
Army B set up an ambush at the train station,

645
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,640
Gao Liang.

646
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,160
It's ok, he is a senior officer.

647
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,040
It's true!

648
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,560
There are cannons and tanks.

649
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,320
- Stop it! - We’ll all be dead.

650
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,400
It's ok.

651
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,080
Great.

652
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,640
Leave the names of both of you.

653
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,880
When the exercise is over, I will prove for your performance.

654
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
Not only did you not become prisoners of the Army B

655
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,880
but you sent important information

656
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,400
from enemy-held territory.

657
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,840
Our division commander is a real man.

658
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,200
He'll be fond of you guys.

659
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,480
Run! Run!

660
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,320
My foot!

661
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:16,960
Foot!

662
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,040
Hurry! Hurry up!

663
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,760
Foot!

664
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
Hurry! Get up and go!

665
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,720
I can't hold it.

666
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,960
Hold on, Sir.

667
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,240
I can't, just take a break, I can't walk anymore.

668
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,240
Take a break.

669
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,560
Help him over.

670
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,160
Slowly.

671
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,800
This scout from Army B

672
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,280
is weak.

673
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,240
He can't walk as fast as I can.

674
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,400
Sir,

675
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,360
What kind of person is the division

676
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,350
commander you just mentioned?

677
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,240
Our division commander,

678
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,320
he once went abroad as a military delegation

679
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,680
to engage in defense diplomacy.

680
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,800
What delegation?

681
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,240
Military assistance delegation.

682
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,520
It is said that

683
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,120
he had dealt with the U.S. military.

684
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,640
That's awesome.

685
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,400
There are more legendary ones.

686
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,120
There is still

687
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,000
a bullet left in his body.

688
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,680
Whenever the weather gets bad,

689
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,440
it hurts.

690
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,440
It might be a pistol bullet,

691
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,040
a pistol, I supposed.

692
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,160
The bullets in the rifle were too big,

693
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
its high-speed spinning

694
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:35,840
the human body can't take it.

695
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
You'll have to do amputation if you take one,

696
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,160
it's not that easy.

697
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
If it is a pistol bullet,

698
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,880
it is easy to understand.

699
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
Many foreign troops use nine-millimeter bullets.

700
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,240
Parabellum pistol cartridge

701
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,760
The name is derived from

702
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,240
a Latin proverb.

703
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,880
If you want peace,

704
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,520
prepare for war.

705
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,200
You know a lot

706
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,720
as a recruit.

707
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,240
I will remember this performance of yours.

708
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,680
You can brag about this later.

709
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,520
This is the scout squad you selected.

710
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,560
Tie up the chief of staff.

711
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,480
Stop.

712
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,520
I know you.

713
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240
You were the first place in the last military district

714
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,440
fighting, shooting and off-road single event.

715
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,280
But why missed assassination

716
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,000
and civil engineering projects?

717
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,800
Reporting for duty, sir!

718
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,520
Hurt.

719
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,640
Are you healed now?

720
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,080
Not me.

721
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,400
I was the one who stabbed the assassination champion.

722
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,640
He was punished for causing such accident,

723
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,280
and was removed from the competition.

724
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,280
So the first prize went to a injured one,

725
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,360
instead of the most capable?

726
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,080
It was tough for the injured to still participate in the training.

727
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,560
Had to give credit to his resolution.

728

Yes sir.

Yes sir.

734
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,200
The main force of the division is going to board at Zhangmu Train Station

735
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
and raid the HQ of Army B by train,

736
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,320
and we are vulnerable between the boarding

737
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,640
and the arrival,

738
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,000
and must be secured at all cost.

739
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,480
The train station is currently under our control.

740
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,400
However,

741
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,840
the telephone lines are sabotaged.

742
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,200
You will lead a squad

743
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,360
and scout to Zhangmu Train Station.

744

Yes sir.

745

746
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,320
launch a red flare immediately.

748

first time you ever met us.

863
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
I've been checking in recruits for 3 years

864
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,800
in the Army B.

865
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,440
Everybody knows my face.

866
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,760
But you two needed to ask who I am.

867
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,640
So you're definitely not

868
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,920
signal corps of Regiment 686.

869
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,960
Got it?

870
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,600
Divisional commander.

871
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:07,420
[Mabang trail]

872
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,560
I observed the marching column

873
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,000
and their vehicles.

874
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,040
There are at least 2 infantry regiments

875
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,120
and there are 122 mm howitzers

876
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,520
supposedly belong to the artillery regiment.

877
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,560
Are you sure this is the main force of Zheng Yuan?

878
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,560
Yes sir.

879
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,560
Zheng is not admitting defeat.

880
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,880
He will definitely take this risk.

881
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,200
We shall wait at Zhangmu Train Station.

882
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,740
[South Town, Train Station]

883
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
We wait for his main force,

884
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,880
and go toe to toe.

885
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,200
Divisional commander,

886
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,920
our ambush in Zhangmu Train Station

887
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
has been spotted.

888
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,200
It was some fleeting new recruits.

889
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,440
I brought them back,

890
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,120
and the word didn't go out.

891
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,400
We must expect a second scout.

892
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,120
What if Zheng Yuan know

893
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,280
that there's ambush in Zhangmu Train Station?

894
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,920
What would he think?

895
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:47,740
Divisional commander.

896
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,900
[813 Highland]

897
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,880
They have ambushes in Zhangmu Train Station.

898
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,040
Even if we're well-prepared,

899
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,160
and go toe to toe with them,

900
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,800
it will just be a less humiliating defeat.

901
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,770
We've lost our chance to stop them at Hongshikou,

902
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,640
and there's only one way left.

903
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,620
[Mabang trail, Hongshikou, Mt. Dawei]

904
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,520
That is to go through Mabang trail,

905
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,640
go over Mt. Dawei,

906
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,040
cross Xiaonan river,

907
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,160
and hit South Town before dawn.

908
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,760
If I was him,

909
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,960
I'll change my object,

910
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,240
and take down South Town HQ.

911
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,080
There's only that much soldiers.

912
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,000
Either Zhangmu or South Town,

913
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,960
to feint or to strike,

914
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,360
there's only one he can choose.

915
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,880
But the train is under our control.

916
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,640
If he bet on South Town,

917
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,920
Zheng yuan the Iron Hiker

918
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,200
will not stand a chance.

919
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,000
Last winter,

920
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,760
when we were poldering

921
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,160
for Bayi farm of the military region,

922
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,960
I took some guys out for logging

923
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,240
and walked that trail.

924
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,560
It's hard to walk even for a few empty-handed,

925
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,840
and would not be easy for a large group

926
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,880
with their equipment.

927
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,680
That depends on who's walking it.

928
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,280
Don't forget that our regiment,

929
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,800
who are known as Iron Hikers.

930
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,240
I've sent my man to scout the trail.

931
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,720
we can reach our destination

932
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,320
within 24 hours.

934
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,560
Are you saying that he'll focus on

935
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,440

[South Town, Train Station]

00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,760
The South Town.

938
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,640
It's the only chance of him winning this.

939
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,480
Even if he can't confront us now

940
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,560
he'll find a way.

Leng Rui.

942
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,000
The only chance we have

943
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,240
is the Iron Hikers of Regiment 700.

944
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,600
It's our last chance. Are you confident?

It's not sure,

946
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,840
but I am confident.

947
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,440
Didn't send the message out.

948

for these injured.

The message didn't go out.

959

We met a cunning reconnaissance staff,

960
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
and he got us.
