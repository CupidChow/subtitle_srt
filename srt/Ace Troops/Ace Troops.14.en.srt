What a beautiful script!

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,070
It’s definitely from a girl, right?

3
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,670
How’s your arm?

4
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,150
Don’t worry.

5
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,350
It’s much better.

for us,

10
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,310
is a chance to bring about an upswing.

put our platoon at the most front,

00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,470
and our platoon

14
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,710
put our squad at the most front.

15
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,550
You trained so hard,

16
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,350
and I think this is a great opportunity.

17
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,550

There’s something

21
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,030
I’ve been thinking for a long time,

22
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,750
and I have to tell you.

23
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,950
We are not suitable to go further.

24
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,390
We should put more energy

25
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,150

Where do you want?

33

I don’t want anywhere.

I’m working.

If you don’t have anything else I’ll hang up.

I’m sorry comrade,

I don’t know what you are talking about.

is easy to keep and hard to conquer,

60

a good plan yet.

Everyone, listen.

and get the mountain at once.

and both times stopped at 200 meters away.

111
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,890
He didn’t really attack, there’s a trap.

112

and go to the highland at the back mountain.

115
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,770
But that’s a cliff,

116
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,730
there’s no way people can come up there.

117

It may be so,

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:04,930
but if I’m attacking,

121
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,930
I’ll take the risk too.

122
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,950
Everyone, look out!

123
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,780

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,770
Get him! Use your grenade!

128
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,690
You didn’t pull the plug, fool!

129
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,650
What were you doing?

130
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,210

131
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,570

132
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,370
Keep them here.

133
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,010
We can’t! There are too many!

134
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,370
We have to keep them here.

135
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,930

136
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,130
What’s he waiting for?

137
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,010
Why hasn’t he got the highland at the back mountain?

138
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,610
Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon!

139
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,970
What was your grenade about?

140
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,490
You wanted to blow me up,

141
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,650
or hit me with it, huh?

Cleared out completely.

you haven’t failed like this

147

since you joined the army, right?

148
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,650
You were trying to bring about an upswing like this, huh?

149
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,570
You were bringing about an upswing like this, right?

150
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,890
You put us to shame.

151
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,090
Report!

152
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,010
Come in.

153
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,940
Stand up.

154
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,390
Turn backwards.

155
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,850
Zhang Fei, Zhang Fei.

156
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,770
You...

157
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,610
Is this how you attacked our highland 308?

158
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,130
Company commander.

159
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,930
It’s my fault.

160
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,570
One mistake and the whole game is lost.

161
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,730
I trusted you and the Ninth Squad so much.

162
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,690
But you have ruined the whole company.

163
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,130
Report!

164
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,230
Come in.

165

Reporting to the company commander,

166
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,010
I should take the responsibility.

167
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,210
You...

168
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,050
It's me who didn't get ready

169
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,050
and delayed the timing.

170
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,570
Why are you not ready?

171
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,210
I had hesitated.

172
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,090
Hesitated?

173
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,210
Who are you to hesitate?

174
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,210
You loser!

322

What does that have to do with the maneuver?

323
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,210
We train together,

324
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,250
everybody is training the same.

325
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,690
The key is to boost their motivation.

326
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,089
I’m in a rush, be straight!

327
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,609
I mean,

328
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,450

329
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,170
You are vulgar.

330
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,050
All that you think about everyday is the female soldiers.

331
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,010
It’s not like that.

332
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:14,890
Staff officer,

333
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,250
that was a positive encouragement,

334
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,329
but we can do it in an opposite way this time.

335
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:20,609
Look,

336
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,010
the lying position shooting of female soldiers

337
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,930
does not lose the male soldiers at all.

338
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,490
If male soldiers see female soldiers

339
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,490
are better than themselves,

340
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,050
they would feel the pressure.

341
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,610
And they will certainly go back to practice hard.

342
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,810
But the training

343
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,210
is not just about the shooting training.

344
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,690
Use this one thing to bring up their overall motivation.

345
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,770
This can be a good start.

346
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,770
You can’t treat them like they’re kids.

Besides, female soldiers

348
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,610
can’t outrun male soldiers in the obstacle run.

349

410
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,690
no.

Why?

413
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,130
Because we are Training Company,

414
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,650
and we are supposed to win.

415
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,090
But

416
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,450
competing our advantage to other’s shortcoming

417
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,490
does not count as winning.

418
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,410
If we compete with Communication Company

419
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,410

420
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,810
and wins,

421
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,130
that’s bringing about our upswing.

422
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,050
When did you have that thought?

423
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,090
When we were informed

424
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,010
to compete with the Communication Company,

425
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,210
I told commissar

426

that we lost.

427
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,970
Then why did you agree?

428
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,050
Obeying orders!

429
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,130
If we are ordered we should do it.

430
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,530
Field forces

431
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,050

432
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,650
That’s still fighting.

433
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,090
If we still lose,

434
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,730
we, the Ninth Company should either

435
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,490
chop ourselves with tri-fold shovels,

436
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,730
or learn from failures

437
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,410
and be a qualified soldier from the beginning.

438
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,210
Sir,

439
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,410
please have Commander Qin make it clear,

440
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,490
who is the partisan troop?

441
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:21,610
Chen Dashan!

442
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,530
Here.

443
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,490
Did you hear that?

444
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,250
Sir,

445
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,650
I did.

446
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,610
Winning female soldiers who are trained for wiring connecting

447
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,130
does not mean anything.

448
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,690
With your disappointing skills,

449
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,970
do you wish that you can call your enemies

450
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,650
and ask them to send women soldiers

451
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,370
when you go on battles?

452
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,770
What’s the point of training like this?

453
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,210
This is superfluous.

454
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,370
Nonsense!

455
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,890
Who came up with this idea?

456
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,690
Here,

457
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:54,570
chief.

458
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,530
I suggested that to Deputy Staff Officer Song.

459
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,090
Interesting,

460
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,290
a soldier decides a company,

461
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,570
and a main force regiment’s training.

462
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,170
Then where is the commander

463
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,450
of this company, this main force company?

464
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,130
A soldier

465
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,050
gives suggestions actively

466
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,890
out of concerns towards his old troop,

467
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:13,770
that is good.

468
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,250
The problem is not about the soldiers,

469
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,130
but about the leaders!

470
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,850
When leaders got an advice like this,

471
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,370
did they think about it?

472
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,810
Did they consider how to improve?

473
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,010
Did they see the real core

474
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,970
of the problem.

475
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,410
I heard that the Ninth Company’s failure

476
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,290
has a specific cause,

477
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,490
which is a soldier’s emotions got affected.

478
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,130
Let’s put it this way,

479
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,370
what emotion?

480
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,010
Affections,

481
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,890
family affections

482
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,770
to soldiers

483
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,810
are your own problems.

484
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,930
You have to take up the responsibility,

485
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,370
to get through them.

486
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,690
No compromises!

487
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,210
And definitely can’t let those affect your combat effectiveness.

488
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,970
You might think

489
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,330
I’m unreasonable saying these,

490
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,250
then

491
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,650
I’ll tell you

492
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,730
a real story.

493
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,930
Five years ago, right in your regiment,

494
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,450
there was this leader, who got the news,

495
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,690
just before going on to battlefield,

496
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,570
that his father passed away.

497
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,290
This comrade,

498
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,130
he didn’t say a word,

499
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,410
and put the telegram in his pocket

500
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,250
and went to the battlefield and fought with his life.

501
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,450
His company almost got wiped out,

502
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,570
and only three soldiers came back alive.

503
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,610
Coming back from the battlefield,

504
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,850
he cried.

505
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,770
He cried really hard.

506
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,290
He held his father’s deadee in his arms

507
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,930
and kneeled in front of his father’s grave

508
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,370
for three whole days.

509
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,750
His knees

510
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,970
were all swelling up.

511
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,930
This is a soldier!

512
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,210
A soldier who puts his country on his shoulders,

513
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,730
and holds his family in his arms.

514
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,730
I have to ask,

515
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,490
what was he thinking?

516
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,810
Song Jianshe!

517
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,130
Here!

518
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,370
You tell us,

519
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,210
what were you thinking?

520
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,730
Chief,

obeying orders is a soldier’s bounden duty.

522
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,090
Soldiers’ duty

523
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,210
is winning battles in wars.

524
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,770
For that,

525
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,650
we shouldn’t care for whatever pressure we are under,

526
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,210
even if

527
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,730
we will be smashed into pieces.

528
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,170
That’s all!

529
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,450
I’ve said repeatedly

530
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,850
that what the training is in troops.

531
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,730
It’s prolusion of the war.

532
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,610
We can’t afford any untruthfulness.

533
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,970
Someone asked me

534
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,930
that dogs are loyal, and cats are delicate,

535
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,690
but why dogs can be beaten to death easily,

536
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,570
and cats can’t.

537
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,090
I told him

538
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,130
that dogs follow disciplines.

539
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,770
Cats aren’t delicate,

540
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,090
they go up trees and rooftops all day,

541
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,850
and are vigilant all the time.

542
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,490
Our troops,

543
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,930
should be loyal all the time,

544
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,490
and raise vigilance every moment.

545
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,850
Everyone says cats have 9 lives,

546
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,690
but I say 10.

547
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,410
If you want to learn from the cats,

548
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,250
do not be easy on yourselves.

549
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,650
You lose 9 lives on the training field,

550
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,010
and with that last life,

551
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,490
you walk to the battlefield.

00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,050
Never mind.

692
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,890
We’ll have a second chance to fight for it.

693
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,810
I was stuck whenever comes to the Ninth Company.

694
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,010
Why’s that?

695
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,810
You two are no difference.

696
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,530
You both want to be heroes,

697
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,210
want to be noble,

698
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,770
and want others to guess your thoughts

699
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:10,969
instead of telling them the truth.

700
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,170
And you don’t want to

701
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,210
have your heads down in a relationship.

702
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,130
You have all the good things.

703
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,650
Not just that.

704
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,730
You’re mean as well.

705
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,210
I, being an outsider,

706
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,130
have to do all the dirty works

707
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,449
for both of you.

708
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,050
Right?

709
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,889
What did Gu Yiye tell you?

710
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,409
I’ll not be a messenger.

711
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,409
It’s your own business.

712
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,610
Go guess for it.

713
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,889
I’d say just give up.

714
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,730
I’m telling you as a comrade.

715
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,330
Gu Yiye,

716
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,810
due to these emotional ups and downs,

717
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,449
did poorly in the maneuver.

718
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:52,330
But I think he’s moved on

719
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,690
as to what happened in the shooting range.

720
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,050
If that’s why you’re upsetting,

721
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,010
I think that you need to move on as well.

722
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,130
Both Gu Yiye and I

723
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,410
agree with it.

724
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,090
Is it true

725
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,970
that prices have to be paid

726
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,530
for becoming better

727
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,610
in the army?

728
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,050
Including relationship.

729
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,490
I think that

730
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,090
it’s not a deal.

731
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,890
An outstanding soldier

732
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,890
don’t need relationship as a bargain.

733
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,890
But to be outstanding,

734
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,850
we need to be strong,

735
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,650
overcoming the emotional obstacles.

736
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,210
Pickles from the former sergeant.

737
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,210
Take it.

738
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,570
Reminisce the new recruit company.

739
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:48,690
I’m going.

740
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,690
[Raise vigilance and strengthen combat readiness.]

741
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,670
One, two, three, four.

742
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,930
One, two.

743
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,130
Division Commander Zheng, Political Commissar Wang.

744
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,970
The main purpose of

745
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,810
Military Working Group of Logistics this time

746
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,850
is conducting an investigation

747
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,210
for barrack reconstruction.

748
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,850
Most of the barracks of Division 2, 3 and 4

749
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,330
were constructed in the early times of China’s foundation

750
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,410
when we first stationed here.

751
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,570
It will turn into Water Curtain Cave when raining

752
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,970
if not reconstructed sooner.

753
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,770
That’s right.

754
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:24,650
Director You,

755
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,850
tell us,

756
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,370
what kind of reconstruction will it be?

757
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,370
Large-scale or small-scale?

758
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,110
Large-scale.

759
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,090
Thank you so much.

760
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,300
Don’t thank me.

761
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,130
It’s Deputy Commander Xiao from military district

762
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,650
who got the special funds

763
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,650
from Military Logistics Headquarter.

764
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,210
Thank him instead.

765
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,650
You,

766
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,890
don’t submitted the report

767
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,740
you handed in previously

768
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,850
on the construction of combat readiness road

769
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,490
to military district.

770
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,010
Why?

771
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,010
The military district is still working on the report from last time.

772
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,970
Barrack reconstruction

773
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,170
will be the most important project

774
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,920
for the construction of logistics in the military district,

775
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,410
as well as a project concerning for the livelihood of grass-roots level soldiers.

776
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,890
Deputy Commander Xiao will be in command.

777
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,490
Other projects will not be a priority.

778
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,330
Deputy Commander Xiao leads this reconstruction.

779
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,850
He is our former Division Commander.

780
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,210
They are two different things.

781
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,450
I respect him for sure.

782
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,650
But,

783
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,970
it doesn’t mean that I shall not offer my advice in public.

784
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,490
Our purposes are all for our work.

785
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,730
Most comrades in the army

786
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,090
and in the division support him for this reconstruction.

787
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,450
If the road repairing project

788
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,850
holds back this barrack reconstruction,

789
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,410
how many people will be offended by it?

790
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,850
I’m aware of that.

791
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,050
I understand.

792
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,730
We are combat armies.

793
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,410
Which is more important,

794
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,770
combat readiness

795
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,410
or daily well-beings?

796
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,430
Zheng,

797
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,010
I’m afraid that

798
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,970
it’ll have a negative effect on rank relationships

799
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,610
and the unity of the party committee.

800
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,560
Wang,

801
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,650
I see.

802
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,850
You’re afraid that offending others

803
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,610
will influence your own official career.

804
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,530
You surely think things over

805
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,890
for yourself.

806
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,930
But what about those for our country, and for our army?

807
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,930
Are these less important than your career?

808
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,260
It’s a sickness,

809
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,090
a sickness yearning for peace.

810
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,170
It’s a sickness

811
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,330
commonly seen on soldiers

812
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,610
when there’s no war and in a peaceful time.

813
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,410
Minor sickness will be fatal without treating it well.

814
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,290
I’m afraid that our army

815
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,090
formed after fighting battles

816
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,170
throughout the country

817
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,930
will die at peace

818
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,410
rather than at battlefield.

819
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,810
What kind of army are we?

820
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,330
We are the leading division.

821
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,890
You do the math.

822
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,650
How many divisions like us are there in the military district?

823
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,450
We have to keep in mind that

824
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,970
how we can win the battle,

825
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,610
how we can face the enemies

826
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,330
when the war is coming.

827
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,490
We are the backbone in the army,

828
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,010
thus have to assume greater responsibilities.

829
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,640
This combat readiness road is a must-do!

830
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,170
Wang,

831
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,450
I suggest to submit this report

832
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,730
in my own name.

833
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,410
Then I’ll write the report

834
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,010
jointly signed by division commander and political commissar.

835
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,930
You’ve changed your mind.

836
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:22,970
Instead of changing my mind,

837
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,810
I’m reconfirming your mind.

838
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,020
I have to make sure

839
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,890
how determined you are.

840
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,490
As the old saying goes,

841
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,970
a peaceful world will be dangerous again if forgetting the war.

842
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,930
Wang,

843
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,850
you have the ambition,

844
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,930
the strategic perspective,

845
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,410
the charm and justice.

846
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,010
You are the backbone of our divisional Communist Party Committee.

847
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,290
Zheng,

848
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,650
we have to schedule

849
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,110
some free-time activities this evening

850
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,330
for the sake of your words just now.

851
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,610
That’s for sure.

852
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,120
Gao Liang.

853
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:51,970
Yes sir.

854
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:52,810
Bring us wine.

855
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:53,580
Yes sir.

856
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,900
Chief.

857
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,850
[Guilin Sanhua Liquor]

858
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,210
For the combat readiness road,

859
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,890
political commissar has risked all

860
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,690
and tied his own benefits with us

861
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,690
without regrets.

862
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,490
That’s your wine for this sacrifice, huh?

863
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,170
Bring out the good wine.

864
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:08,930
Yes sir.

865
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,520
Hello.

866
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,130
What?

867
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:17,970
Noted.

868
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,330
I’ll report to division commander right away.

869
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:21,860
Take this...

870
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:23,490
Division commander,

871
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,650
Deputy Commander Xiao from military district is here.

872
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,410
As I said,

873
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,330
we have submitted three reports.

874
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,450
It should be time for the condemnation.

875
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,970
Then why are you standing there?

876
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,210
Tell political commissar and welcome.

877
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,090
No.

878
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,930
Deputy Commander Xiao is not coming to our division.

879
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,170
Then where is he?

880
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,290
He goes straight to Regiment 720.

881
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,130
Wang,

882
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,450
bring more dried firewood.

883
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,930
Yes sir.

884
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,090
Chief.

885
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,130
The firewood may be too wet

886
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,250
to make fire.

887
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,890
- Reporting! - Reporting!

888
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,770
Deputy Commander Xiao.

889
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,570
The firewood is too wet, right?

890
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,850
You’re just in time.

891
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,050
Let’s have a field meeting.

892
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,090
Comrade Zheng Yuan.

893
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,370
Comrade Wang Tianming.

894
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,330
Yes sir.

895
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,290
Tell me,

896
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,450
what is the foundation of an army?

897
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,690
It’s the soldiers at community-level.

898
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,730
Without them,

899
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,370
the army will be a tree with no roots.

900
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,650
That’s right.

901
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,050
Chief,

902
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,850
the soldiers at community-level

903
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,660
really appreciate your barrack reconstruction project this time,

904
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,610
including us.

905
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,650
What’s the use of the appreciation?

906
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,850
Do you have any idea

907
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,770
how many times I went to the headquarter

908
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,650
and begged for it,

909
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,130
just for this special funds?

910
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,090
The project has not started yet.

911
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,610
And you are asking for more funds on road repairing.

912
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,170
No.

913
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,050
Do you know that

914
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,650
how much money is needed for the road repairing?

915
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,250
Have you done the math?

916
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,530
Actually, I have.

917
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,610
The funds for the road repairing

918
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,050
is more than enough

919
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,690
for tripling the funds of the barrack reconstruction

920
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,330
of the whole military district.

921
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,290
What’s more,

922
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,650
the Central Government has decided that the strategic focus

923
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,090
will be transferred to economic construction.

924
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,050
The armies have to endure the current situation.

925
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,680
Do you think

926
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,530
the headquarter will approve the application?

927
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,370
Not a chance.

928
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,540
Let alone to disapprove the application,

929
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,730
but you’ve made such a big scene,

930
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,010
and drawn all the attentions here.

931
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,410
If there is anyone

932
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,490
who makes a fuss about barrack reconstruction,

933
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,930
you will be doomed.

934
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,210
You’ll be damned by all of them.

935
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,400
Chief,

936
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,770
I insist on repairing the road

937
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,250
even for being damned.
