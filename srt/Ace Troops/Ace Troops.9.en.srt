[Unit 53082 of People's Liberation Army]

175
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,860
Commander Lu.

176
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,860
What's going on?

177
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,420
Have all of your soldiers recovered?

178
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,020
Qin Dapao,

179
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,020
I saw you teach your soldiers

180
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,500
how to heal the wounds.

181
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,700
You're an example to them.

182
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,140
Four words.

183
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,580
You have my respect.

184
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,900
After hearing what you said,

185
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,020
I feel like there's a critical situation ahead.

186
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,340
No, no, no. There's no critical situation.

187
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,620
It's all in your mind.

188
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,700
We're not of the same tier.

189
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,820
In other words,

190
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,100
I don't have to be your rival.

191
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,100
But I want to remind you that

192
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,820
if your soldiers are too wild,

193
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,900
it'll be very hard for you to control them.

194
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,300
Yes.

195
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,660
We're indeed of different tiers.

196
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,580
Thank you for your praise.

197
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,340
You said my soldiers are wild.

198
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,020
In other words,

199
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,460
they're ambitious

200
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,940
instead of wild.

201
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,140
Ambitious?

202
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,940
Qin Dapao,

203
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,580
you misunderstood it.

204
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,100
They're savage.

205
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,740
The ethos of a company

206
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,100
depends on the commander's

207
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,940
concepts and methods of training troops.

208
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,580
I hate preaching,

209
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,780
but I know

210
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,420
their cohesion and combat effectiveness

211
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,460
are not related to my control over them.

212
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,340
After they fall down and suffer setbacks,

213
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,300
they try their best
to improve the two things.

214
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,460
OK. Fine.

215
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,980
Let's stop it.

216
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,140
Tell me. Why did you want to see me?

217
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,660
Our division's long-range raid exercise

218
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,980
will start soon.

219
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,660
I care about your company

220
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,580
so I won't compete with you.

221
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,540
I'll let you take the chance.

222
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,020
Are you offering an apology?

223
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,340
Qin Dapao,

224
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,900
use your vigilance

225
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,460
to improve your strategic planning.

226
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,540
Stop focusing on me.

227
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,020
Here is a book for you.

228
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,900
Read it.

229
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,620

231
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
and read more books about strategies.

232
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,580
Great Strategy.

233
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,300
By the way,

234
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,620
I've also given you the chance to

235
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,660
train male and female soldiers together.

236
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,420

Commander Zhao.

We welcome your Communication Company

to our regiment.

245
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,420
Thanks.

246
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,940
Why are you grinning?

247
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,180
I feel nervous
as long as I see a female soldier.

248
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,940
Colonel has taught me how to
overcome nervousness.

249
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
When I feel nervous,

250
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,300
I should laugh.

251
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,300
Well, I'm sorry

252
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,340

It seems that we shouldn't have come here.

255

No, no, no.

It's good to have you here.

257

During the new recruit training,

258
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,180
we were together.

259
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,620
We helped and encouraged each other.

260
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,740
We improved ourselves together.

261
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,260
Well,

262
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,700
you train those guys like this.

263
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,140
They seem to be unhappy.

264
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,460
It's not about me.

265
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
It's about themselves.

266
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,740

you should control those troublemakers.

Don't let them mislead my soldiers.

272

273

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,820
have you selected your

278
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,620
long-range raid exercise's companion company?

279
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,580
Not yet.

280
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
We wanted to
join Night Tiger Company of Regiment 700.

281
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,940
However, someone took action before us.

282
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,260
So you came to our Regiment 720, right?

283
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,580
Commander Zhao,

284
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
it's not right.

285
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,620
You're not doing grocery shopping
in a wet market.

286
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,580
Why are you so picky?

287
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,180
Go to Pacesetter Company.

288
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,340
Their company commander is Lu Pingfan.

289
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,100
He's been chasing you.

290
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,740
You're a boring man.

291
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,460
No, I'm not.

292
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,620
If there's also a rumor that

293
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,900
I've been chasing you,

294
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,740
I think it'll be the best assist.

295
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,780
There will not be a rumor like that.

296
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,940
Do you think others are all as boring as you?

297
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Not me.

298
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,660
Hi, colonel.

299
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,380
You moved perfectly together.

300
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,900
That means you really get each other
when you exercise together.

301
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,980
Is there anything I can do for you?

302
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,620
- Yes, there is.
- Yes, there is.

303
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,180
Please come in.

304
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,820
Colonel,

305
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,700
the long-range raid has been added

306
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,180
to this exam.

307
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,140
It's a little hard for female soldiers

308
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,260
because the physical fitness
of female soldiers

309
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,380
is not as good as that of male soldiers.

310
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,820
Besides, I heard

311
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,780
it's also hard for scouts to pass the test.

312
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,900
Could you please...

313
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,220
The military district

314
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,160
added this new subject because of

315
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,820
the combats in recent years.

316
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,380
The main purpose is to improve

317
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,700
the stay-behind survival skills

318
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,740
of individual soldiers or groups

319
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,460
when they go missing on the battlefield.

320
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,100
The difficulty of the exercise is very high

321
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,300
but it's the same
for both male and female soldiers.

322
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,420
There's no exception.

323
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,060
Colonel,

324
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,740
I have a suggestion.

325
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,180
The miles

326
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,660
can be the same

327
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,100
but the time frames

328
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,100
can be different.

329
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,380
After all, different genders

330
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
have different features.

331
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,980
We should take a scientific approach
to exercise.

332
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,180
I'll consider your suggestion.

333
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,740
Colonel, can you do me a favor?

334
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,140
Could you please dispatch an

335
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,140
excellent company at the grassroots
to help us with training?

336
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,580
I hope my request is not too much.

337
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,900
The two of you came to see me together.

338
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,220
Didn't you talk to each other in advance?

339
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,540
- No.
- I'm okay with it.

340
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,660
Look.

341
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,500
Nothing has happened

342
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,860

they'll teach female soldiers.

but he can still teach female soldiers.
Will Commander Qin accept that?

00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,500
is too hard and painful

517
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,100
and also has caused some injuries.

518
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,380
It's said one of the soldiers hurts quite badly.

519
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,020
So they all suggest to cancel it.

520
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,060
This exercise is meant to

521
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,940
see the willpower

522
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,340
and the unique fighting spirit of the soldiers.

523
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,820
It can help you pick out

524
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,020
the soldiers with the strongest willpower and

525
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,860
fighting spirit.

526
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,020
I got it.

527
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,780
I heard that your soldier

528
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,780
fought with Lu's soldiers.

529
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,340

530
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,740
but not lose.

531
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,340
I give a chance for test trial in every regiment,

532
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,260
Night Tiger in Regiment 700.

533
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,140
In Regiment 720, I asked Chen Dashan

534
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,180
give your company this test..

535
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,780
The first company agrees with this decision?

536
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,100
How smart is Lu Pingfan.

537
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,100
The time he saw the exercise outline he knew everything.

538
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,660
He said that his company is not suitable for the test

539
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,980
with its current situation.

540
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,700
So he agreed.

541
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,540
He's okay with the arrangement.

542
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,220
He is too smart.

543
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,060
I thought he was scared by our fight.

544
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,340
Scared?

545
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,540
He is the rational one.

546
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,060
As the model company,

547
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,540
he can follow the rules and do what are told.

548
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,500
But it's not the thing for your backward company.

549
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,060
If you want to change your fate,

550
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,380
you have to try either with sweet or with blood.

551
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,260
Sergeant,

552
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,140
I am just confused.

553
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,460
Encountering enemy on the battlefield

554
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,740
just shoot them.

555
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,100
Don't always think about shooting,

556
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,020
amateurs!

557
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,820
Do you know the theory of retreating when the enemy comes,

558
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,660
disturbing when they stay, battling when they are tired

559
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,860
and chasing when they retreat?

560
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,300
You need to march long distance.

561
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,340
With out this ability how can you reach them?

562
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,820
Battle with whom?

563
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,460
Right?

564
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,340
So we need strong marching ability.

565
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,540
That's the basic requirement.

566
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,500
Right.

567
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,860
I heard there's a test.

568
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,860

569

the results don't count.

570
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,460
It's only for reference.

571
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,500
Yes,

572
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,900
I also heard that

573
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,620
the distance is different.

574

Stop it. No room for request.

576

Gao Liang,

584
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,860
after you finish washing your feet,

585
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,340
apply some ointment to prevent inflammation.

586

This is Vaseline.

587

Apply some in your socks next time.

588

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,780
How about I demote you further?

861
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,060
Please don’t.

862
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,660
But I’m not afraid either.

863
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,860
I have a practical problem.

864
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,380
We can try to solve

865
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,900
other problems ourselves,

866
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,820
but…

867
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,620
Just say it.

868
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,180
As long as I can do it,

869
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,300
I’ll give you my full support.

870
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,820
The training is more intense,

871
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,620
but the food is not enough.

872
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,860
I reluctantly slaughtered

873
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,100
the two feeder pigs we had.

874
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,140
Now one week has passed

875
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,180
and they still can’t forget the taste.

876
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,500
Well,

877
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,340
go to the Military Supplies Section.

878
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,020
Just say I asked them

879
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,940
to figure it out.

880
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,580
What for?

881
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,260
Please call them.

882
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,580
I’ll do what you said immediately.

883
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,900
Qin Hanyong.

884
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,380
How dare you?

885
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,420
Asking me to do that?

886
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,420
I don’t.

887
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,420
I don’t.

888
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,980
Qin the Cannon.

889
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,460
Why are you still here?

890
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,420
I’ve told you many times.

891
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,340
I’m just a section chief,

892
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,020
I can’t help you

893
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,980
on this.

894
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,740
The food budget is the same for everyone.

895
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,820
It’s limited.

896
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,140
If you get extra food,

897
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,140
others will have less.

898
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,820
This is an order from the Colonel.

899
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,220
How dare you not follow?

900
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,220
Even if

901
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,700
the Division Commander calls me,

902
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,540
the story would still be the same.

903
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,980
Just

904
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,420
leave me alone.

905
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,860
Sir.

906
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:16,980
Sir.

907
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,820
Sir.

908
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,260
How’s it?

909
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,500
What…

910
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,260
My salary this month.

911
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,420
I’ve remitted some home

912
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,780
and that’s all I have now.

913
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,180
Buy some meat

914
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,340
to treat everyone.

915
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,220
Sir…

916
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,460
We can’t use

917
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,540
your own money.

918
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,180
Forget about that.

919
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,620
We’ve been saying
that the Company is like a family.

920
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,260
I’m the commander,

921
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,260
what’s wrong with me

922
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,740
treating my family to a meal?

923
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,700
No…

924
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:58,900
Sir,

925
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,460
I’m sorry,

926
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,500
but

927
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,740
this amount of money can’t buy

928
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,060
much pork.

929
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,740
There are over 100 soldiers,

930
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,620
everyone

931
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,900
can only get a bite.

932
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,980
Well,

933
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
buy some pork bones then.

934
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,980
Get the meat off

935
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,380
and simmer the bones

936
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,700
with potatoes in water

937
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,940
to make soup.

938
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,740
If we can’t afford meat,

939
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,260
at least have some fat.

940
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,380
Just listen to me.

941
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,620
No, sir…

942
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,220
Hello Gu Yiye.

943
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,380
Three months have passed in a blink.

944
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,820
I miss you a lot.

945
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,940
I’ve heard

946
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,220
that your training is
even more intense than before.

947
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,220
Company Commander Qin

948
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,700
will be even stricter with you.

949
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,340
Take good care of yourself.

950
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,780
I really miss the days

951
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
when we practiced and trained together.

952
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,660
At that time,

953
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,020
I felt the world was so big

954
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,740
and so lively.

955
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,820
Come on! Faster!

956
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,980
Hurry up! Let’s go!

957
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,940
Gu Yiye,

958
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,700
I really like the poetry you gave me.

959
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,020
I like the freedom

960
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,540
and vigor of the poems.

961
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,860
But, here in the Communication Company,

962
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,100
Sergeant Han is also harsh on us.

963
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,940
I’m trying my best to adapt,

964
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,580
since I remember our promise.

965
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,340
We’ll work hard together.

966
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,940
The 8th day of next month is a Sunday

967
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,140
and happens to be my 19th birthday.

968
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,980
If you can go out,

969
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,620
let’s go to the August Town together.

970
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,660
I have a veteran’s story to tell you.

971
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,460
Salute,

972
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,620
comrade Jiang Nanzheng
