a company commander in the Third Red Company.

although he did not die,

207

he left everything on the battlefield.

208
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,540
And there was nothing left for my mom and me.

209
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,180
So they separated.

210

When he left,

he didn’t know my mom was pregnant with me.

212
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,700
Later, I grew up with my mom

213
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,860
and took her surname.

214
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,380
Mom never told me

why they got married

216
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,100
and why they separated.

217

I asked her many times,

218
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,820
but every time she shook her head

219
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,660
and said it was a mistake.

Not exactly.

223
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,980
When I was a child, I was very thin

224
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,140
and always bullied by boys.

225
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,660
At that time,

226
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,100
I decided that I would join the army when I grew up,

227
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,460
so that no one dares to bully me

228
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,060
and I can protect others.

229
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,740
No one will dare to bully you in the future.

In fact,

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,500
it was not until I made this decision

233
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,580
that my mom had a serious talk with me.

Marrying a man like your dad,

235

236
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,590
is both lucky and unlucky.

I’m not ready to tell him.

He should not be ready either.

263
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,580
He should not be ready to know that he has a daughter.

won’t he recognize you immediately?

Why would he recognize me?

Couldn’t he recognize his own daughter?

348
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,140
How persistent. A letter every day.

349
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,340
It’s like an overripe banana.

350
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,780
Mushy.

351
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,820
I met Gao Liang when I was going

352
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,900
back to the barrack.

353

His car’s broken too.

354

We didn’t make it

355

357

Gao Liang was worse.

358
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,260
He was punished to clean toilets for a week.

359
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,100
But I think it’s OK.

360
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,740
I sang happy birthday for you

And in the brand new 80s,

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,340
but all we got was some verbal praise from the company commander.

514
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,420
Yeah.

515
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,740
If we get a promotion, we can have relationships.

516
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,700
The promotion quota

517
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,860
is rarer than pandas.

518
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,700
Jiang Weixing told me that

519
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,060
sergeant Zhang of the Ninth company

520
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,340
has been a soldier for 10 years.

521
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,420
and has never got a quota of promotion.

522
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,780
So

523
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,620
do we new recruits even have a chance?

524
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,540
No.

525
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,340
Conventionally,

526
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,020
it’s gonna be one of the veterans.

527
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,540
Then there’s no need for a contest.

528
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,860
It has to be either sergeant Han

529
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,740
or sergeant Song Xiaoluo from the third squad.

530
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,460
That’s bad.

531
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,580
Sergeant Han is popular,

532
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,540
and Song Xiaoluo is the Number one

533
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,660
when it comes to switchboard operating.

534
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,020
No one can beat them.

The telecommunication contest

536
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,900
is more than sitting in the room and operate.

537
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,740
There’s the part of setting up antennas in the field.

538
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,700
I thought female soldiers’ score are not counted.

539
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,420
Our work is not counted,

540
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,680
but the contest is.

542
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,100
I remember last time when we were cross country running,

543
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,380
you were way faster than Song Xiaoluo.

544
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
If the gap of operating is not too big,

545
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,140
you may have a chance, right?

546
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,180
Nanzheng, did you get the message from the company?

547
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,420
You’re assigned by the company to participate.

I’d like to know more about telecommunication contest.

555
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,700
It’s not sergeant Han who told me.

556
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,900
It’s a big deal.

557
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,060
Words are flying around the company.

Can we new recruits have a quota of backup member

in the telecommunication contest of the region?

560

Let me make it clear.

561
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,820
You new recruits just joined the company

with the elite communication soldiers of the whole region?

565

It’s no child’s play.

566
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,420
You’ll be representing the communication soldiers of the Division 234

before he showered down his criticism.

What’s to thank for?

683
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,100
The soldiers and people are bonded, I did what I should.

684
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,060
Now that the soldier is back here,

685
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,820
I won’t interfere your work.

686
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,530
I’ll just go.

687
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,490
We’ll write a thank-you letter to you later.

688
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,430
That’s not necessary.

689
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,180
See you!

690
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,980
Thank you!

691
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,540
Thank you!

692
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,380
See you!

693
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,700
How did you fulfill your sergeant’s responsibilities?

694
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,660
Your soldier went for a shorter route

695
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,500
into the woods,

696
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,700
fell into an animal trap,

697
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,480
and couldn’t get out, and you had no idea.

698
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,580
Luckily that fellow saved him!

00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,740
Alright,

701
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,900
he’s back, then everything’s fine.

702
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,550
Don’t expand on this.

703
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,420
Take him back.

704
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,660
Take back!

00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,220
Hongliu,

708
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,860
don’t get freak out,

709
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,140
just tell us.

710
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,580
I failed my leaders.

711
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,140
I failed my comrades.

712
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,860
I was helping company commander wash his clothes

713
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,700
when there’s the emergency muster.

714
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,740
Commander didn’t have clothes and was embarrassed.

715
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,860
I made a mistake while on stand guard.

716
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,140
My gun discharged accidentally,

717
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,340
ending up with the company got searched.

718
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Also cutting the short route.

719
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,820
I cut the short route

720
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,540
so that I could improve my grades.

721
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,659
I was drawing everyone’s back every time.

722
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,420
I need to inspect myself.

723
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,300
Hongliu,

724
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,460
don’t be sad.

725
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,260
Your intentions were nice.

726
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,659
Also,

727
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,020
you didn’t draw our back.

728
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,460
Right, Hongliu,

729
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,179
we are in the troop together, we are brothers.

730
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,659
Brothers experience happiness

731
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,900
and pain together.

732
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,940
Plus,

733
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,679
that’s what brothers should suffer

734
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,179
or how can we be brothers.

735
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,070
I really,

736
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,940
really want to improve myself.

737
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,739
I don’t want draw the team’s back anymore.

738
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,460
But I am just bad.

739
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,260
I’m bad at everthing.

740
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,659
Hongliu, you are not bad at everything!

741
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,139
If it wasn’t for Honliu,

742
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,620
how could we get first place in the internal affairs competition?

743
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,540
Exactly!

744
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,420
That’s right!

745
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,420
Just tell me,

746
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,060
why could you fell in the pit and not get out?

747
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,220
For this, I,

748
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,660
I really have to tell you all about it.

749
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,500
The pit I fell into,

750
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,100
I saw it ahead,

751
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,180
so I went around it.

752
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,340
But not before I could take two steps,

753
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,820
I heard some noise from behind.

754
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,540
So I turned around,

755
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,620
and I saw the giant wild boar, this big, really big!

756
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,820
It ran straightly towards me.

757
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,180
Who am I?

758
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,380
I’m a soldier of people’s liberation army!

759
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,420
Could I be a coward?

760
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,420
Of course not!

761
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,780
I went directly to fight it.

762
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,060
But I got slippery, and failed.

763
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,260
Then it got me in the pit.

764
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,420
Boar!

765
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,340
How long has it been since we smelled any meat!

766
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,380
If there’s a bowl of braised pork at noon,

767
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
that would be so nice!

768
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,380
Add some green capsicum, garlic seedling.

769
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,180
Boar!

770
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,500
Boar!

771
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,460
Get it.

772
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,860
I can’t work anymore.

773
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,900
I’m starving now.

774
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,820
How can I get something so exhausting done!

775
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,140
I’m tired out!

776
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,940
Keep up! Don’t stop, hurry up!

777
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,060
I can’t work anymore. I’m exhausted.

778
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,140
Think about the boar!

779
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,020
Wouldn’t it be nice if we can catch that thing and have some meat?

780
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,300
Hurry up!

781
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,740
You can get two pieces of meat when we get it.

782
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,940
Your words!

783
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,140
Give me two extra pieces

784
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,420
to compensate the energy

785
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,820
I wasted.

786
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,540
How is that wasted?

787
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,420
We are investing!

788
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,780
Do you understand? Investing!

789
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,180
Alright, investing.

790
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,900
Just give me two extra pieces of meat.

791
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,140
[Never shed tears even for bloody sweat. Never be left behind even being peeled of the meat.]

792
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,100
Hey, get up!

793
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,220
Get up! Hurry!

794
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,100
Let’s go!

795
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,860
Comrades.

796
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,860
Comrade Gao Liang,

797
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,500
[Be frugal and against waste.]

798
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,580
led the other comrades in the squad

799
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,660
to dig a trap outside

800
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,310
in their spare time.

801
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,460
They caught a big wild boar

802
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,330
with a weight of 250 jin.

803
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,100
It has solved

804
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,940
the problem of insufficient food and water

805
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,300
caused by

806
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,140
the high intensity of training in our company.

807
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,460
Right now,

808
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,780
I would like to

809
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,100
praise comrade Gao Liang.

810
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,500
Don’t shout so hard,

811
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,420
you should save your energy to eat meat.

812
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,260
- Dinner time!
- Yes, sir!

813
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,940
Sergeant, have a fat one.

814
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,380
The meat tastes so good.

815
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,660
What a hearty meal!

816
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,660
Chief Song.

817
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,940
I smelled it at the regiment headquarter.

818
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,380
Chief Song’s nose is so sensitive.

819
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,620
Come on, have a taste.

820
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,580
I've already had dinner.

821
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,140
You’ve come over, so have a taste of the meat.

822
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,980
No, no.

823
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,540
No, thanks.

824
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,540
Are you guys full?

825
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,180
I'm in a hurry.

826
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,140
Save some meat for me and the commissar.

827
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,260
Don’t eat them all.

828
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,180
Gorge on meat.

829
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,700
What’s the chief doing here?

830
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
I don’t think he’s here to share the meat.

831
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,180
That’s the boar we just ate.

832
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,220
It’s not a wild boar.

833
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,580
It’s a domestic pig.

834
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,180
How is that possible?

835
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,180
Can domestic pigs run into the woods in the middle of the night?

836
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,220
Do wild boars have such short teeth?

837
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,380
Wild boars have tusks, don't you know?

838
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,380
Today, a villager

839
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
lost a pig.

840
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,220
He followed the footprints and

841
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,790
found the company nearby.

842
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,970
Now it can be basically concluded that

843
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,460
it is the one you ate.

844
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,020
This is gonna be

845
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
a big problem.

846
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,060
Seriously?

847
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,150
We already ate. What are we gonna do?

848
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,460
Come on.

849
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,180
Why didn’t you say earlier?

850
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,540
We already ate.

851
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,500
How could I say?

852
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,660
The villager hadn’t confirmed yet.

853
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,260
Can I ask the whole company to wait and not eat?

854
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:53,180
[Raise vigilance and strengthen combat readiness. Contribute to the construction of safeguarding the Four Modernizations.]

855
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,500
You guys have to be reasonable.

856
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,460
How can this happen?

857
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,460
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

858
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,700
I found the soldier and sent him back to the army.

859
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,380
What have you done?

860
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,720
You found my big pig and

861
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,740
stewed it directly!

862
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,660
Don’t worry.

863
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,420
We must criticize and educate the soldiers.

864
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,540
It was supposed to be the harmious fish-water relationship between Army and People. You guys are so wrong.

865
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,740
Yeah, you're right.

866
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,020
You can take this.

867
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,900
See the villager to the door, Wang.

868
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,740
Yes sir.

869
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,580
I’m so sorry.

870
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,460
Goodbye.

871
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,940
A pig that big,

872
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,860
and you three caught it?

873
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,100
Report!

874
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,100
Report!

875
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,330
This has nothing to do with Niu Mancang.

876
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,350
I forced him to go.

877
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,060
Okay,

878
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,500
you can go.

879
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,370
Get out of here, don’t you understand?

880
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:38,940
Yes sir.

881
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:46,940
Report!

882
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,820
I didn’t ask you to talk.

883
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,940
Come here, Qin.

884
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,980
I'm thirsty.

885
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,060
I've tried to minimize the impact.

886
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,140
This is gonna help me a lot, Song.

887
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,860
Thank you so much!

888
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Now someone has to take responsibility.

889
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,380
It’s just a pig.

890
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,740
Is it that serious?

891
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,460
What do you mean it’s not that serious?

892
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,260
To tell you the truth,

893
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,260
you hit the muzzle this time.

894
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,740
It's your muzzle again.

895
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,650
Oh, my goodness!

896
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,580
You think too highly of me.

897
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,020
Do you know what month it is?

898
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,980
Month of rectification of style and discipline in the military region.

899
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,860
The newly transferred commander is personally responsible for this discipline.

900
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,220
The commander said that

901
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,260
negative examples should be caught

902
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,260
in all divisions and regiments.

903
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,100
You’re in trouble.

904
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,220
No need for others to catch,

905
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,500
you are ready-made living teaching materials.

906
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,540
Have you heard of

907
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,500
the new commander’s style?

908
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,540
He can turn his back on his flesh and blood, and remain result oriented.

909
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,540
The pig farmer

910
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,580
is also a tough guy.

911
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,500
He complained directly to the military region.

912
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,420
Now the leader has said that

913
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,100
this matter is serious and

914
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,340
bad in nature and

915
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,100
must be dealt with seriously!

916
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,740
Maybe someone has to

917
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,540
take off their uniform.

918
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,420
I'll take the responsibility.

919
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,700
What a righteous man!

920
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,460
But I want to ask you,

921
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,780
can you, a person who has been demoted and punished,

922
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,820
bear the burden for them this time?

923
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,260
I'll be a platoon leader if I have to.

924
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,620
Qin Dapao, I am telling you,

925
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,420
I am a man of principle.

926
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,340
Disciplines must be observed!

927
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,860
Of course, sometimes you can handle it at your discretion.

928
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,740
But

929
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,540
don’t bargain with me!
