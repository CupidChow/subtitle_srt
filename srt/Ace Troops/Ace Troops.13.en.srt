1
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,229
Oops, my teeth!

2
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,070
I’m telling you,

3
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,030
Qin Dapao and Commander Zhao

4
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,670
are plotting.

5
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,910
If you let her

6
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,950
take the blame again this time,

7
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,070
I’ll break

8
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,710
all three of your remaining legs.

9
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,630
Then you can rest forever.

10
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,509
I can’t stand it anymore, and I can’t talk nonsense with you.

11
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,789
I have to go to the bathroom.

12
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,950
Eat up!

13
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,509
I’ve been to the bathroom three or four times in the afternoon.

14
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,790
You have diarrhea, so don’t eat it.

15
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,150
You wish.

16
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,150
These are bought by Jiang Nanzheng.

17
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,550
If I don’t eat it, will I keep them for you?

18
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,430
There’s one more thing I need to tell you.

19
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,669
This failed prisoner capture operation

20
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,750
was your idea, right?

21
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,230
You’d better figure out what you’re gonna do.

22
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,990
Are you transporting human waste or guarding the pigsty?

23
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,510
Think about it.

24
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,030
I accept any kind of punishment.

25
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,670
You always show off.

26
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,070
Don’t spit! Don’t spit!

27
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,550
These are all paid for.

28
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,310
Put it back in.

29
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,190
Eat up!

30
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,710
You deserve to have diarrhea!

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,090
Hello.

32
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,590
You must be very picky

33
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,630
when you are used to the food cooked by the new public servant.

34
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,700
If you don’t have food, come to my place.

35
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,550
Never mind.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,700
I’m going to dinner.

37
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,630
Don’t walk around.

38
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,510
He’s gone to take an X-ray,

39
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,710
and won’t be back for a while.

40
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,750
Did you come out to ask for leave from the company?

41
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,110
No.

42
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,829
The sergeant asked me to take her back.

43
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,750
Nanzheng, look how late it is.

44
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,390
We really have to go back.

45
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,710
There’s no reason for us

46
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,630
to go back at this hour.

47
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,760
Tongbing,

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,710
how about you go back first.

49
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,490
I’ll take care of my own business.

50
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,230
This is not about you or her taking the responsibility.

51
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,510
And you can’t afford it.

52
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,710
This is a violation of discipline.

53
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,710
Who can afford it?

54
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,910
You must wait, huh?

55
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,310
I’ll go and have a look. Why hasn’t he come back yet?

56
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,710
- Chief.
- Hi, chief.

57
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,430
Are you planning to live here?

58
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,430
Didn’t we agree to cook pancakes at night?

59
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,110
What’s the time?

60
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,150
I’m going back now.

61
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,650
[Wish you health!]

62
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,750
Hail, Chief!

63
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,070
What are you doing here?

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,909
I…

65
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,030
I came to visit Gu Yiye.

66
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,470
Chief, we’ll go back.

67
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,430
Jiang Nanzheng.

68
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,550
Hail, commander!

69
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,990
Tongbing, go back to rest.

70
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,510
Yes, Commander.

71
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,630
Nanzheng,

72
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,730
let’s have a chat.

73
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,570
[Raise vigilance, defend the motherland, be strict with requirements, and make solid preparations.]

74
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,910
I can’t.

75
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,110
What I am saying to you now,

76
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,190
the Ninth Company are also saying to Gu Yiye.

77
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,910
The two of you will be dealt with

78
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,670
in violation of discipline in the company.

79
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,990
This is the end.

80
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,670
This thing can’t get any worse.

81
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,909
Then even if you don’t care about your military uniform,

82
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,510
you should care about Gu Yiye’s military uniform.

83
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,790
What you are saying is,

84
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,390
learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones and cure diseases to save lives.

85
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,070
What you are doing is conquering one’s mind rather than destroy his body.

86
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,030
Jiang Nanzheng.

87
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,510
If it is someone you care about,

88
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,950
lying in the hospital at this moment.

89
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,390
You don’t know if he can stand up

90
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,590
or if he has a disability.

91
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,990
When he needed care

92
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,150
and help,

93
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,110
and you told him that

94
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,710
the relationship was over,

95
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,350
and you became strangers from now on.

96
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,830
You are not even ordinary comrades.

97
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,390
What would he think?

98
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,990
Is this saving lives?

99
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,190
But this is the only way

100
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,310
to save the future of both of you.

101
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,390
The future?

102
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,630
Give up someone you love for a future?

103
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,230
Nanzheng,

104
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,630
if you really know what love is

105
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,390
and really care about it,

106
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,910
then please protect it

107
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,790
and don’t ruin it.

108
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,390
My understanding of love

109
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,390
is to destroy oneself

110
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,950
rather than destroy it.

111
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,590
Report.

112
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,470
Say it.

113
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:47,909
- Go back.
- Yes, commander.

114
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,510
Go to the headquarters office

115
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,190
tomorrow morning.

116
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:59,590
Division commander wants to see you.

117
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:17,930
[Create a better tomorrow for the motherland.]

118
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,780
Comrade,

119
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,630
which ward is Gu Yiye in, please?

120
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,190
No visitation allowed during morning check-in hours.

121
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,230
I’m his girlfriend.

122
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,390
I came here specially from Beijing.

123
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,630
I have to take the afternoon train back.

124
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,790
Please make an exception.

125
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,030
Room 206, bed 36.

126
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,790
Thank you.

127
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,430
You’re welcome.

128
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,230
You’ve learned to scout in costume, huh?

129
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,110
You play the trick of going deep behind enemy lines with me, right?

130
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:54,330
[Impatient Ward]

131
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,950
Sorry, I’m so sorry.

132
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,750
I thought you were someone else.

133
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,150
Have a seat, please.

134
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,190
Make yourself at home.

135
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,630
Look at me.

136
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,910
We’ve met before, remember?

137
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,990
At that time in the train station,

138
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,030
a hero

139
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:06,950
promised you that

140
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,790
he would kick Gu Yiye off the train.

141
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,390
Don’t cry,

142
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,070
your tears won’t catch up with the train wheels.

143
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,030
Don’t cry,

144
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,910
it’s cold and your face doesn’t look good when you cry.

145
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,510
Come on,

146
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,230
I’ll give you a soda

147
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,510
to calm down, okay?

148
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,309
Here you are.

149
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,429
Take it, come on, take it.

150
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,270
It’s just a recruit.

151
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,980
I’ll get on the train later,

152
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,429
kick him out

153
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,710
and let him run back along the tracks

154
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,470
to apologize to you, how about that?

155
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,030
Seriously?

156
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,110
But I have a request.

157
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,550
You have to call me Brother Gao.

158
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,310
Come on.

159
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,350
Gao…

160
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,310
It’s too late. Forget it.

161
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,030
I'm Zorro.

162
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,390
I want you to get down on your knees

163
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,710
and beg the lady’s forgiveness.

164
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,630
When I’m tired of scratching,

165
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,870
I’ll pull out your heart.

166
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,790
I’m Zorro.

167
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,150
You’re the combat hero.

168
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:13,950
That’s right.

169
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,430
To be honest with you,

170
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,470
the combat hero

171
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,510
is my brother.

to pick him up, right?

175
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,990
You should have come earlier.

176
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,510
Why did you come so late?

177

You’re late now.

what are you two?

183
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,790
What breed of horse is it?

184
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,350
Childhood sweetheart.

At the railway station

191
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,310
that day,

192
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,190
the soldiers on our train

193
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,350
watched a girl

194
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,790
standing on the platform

195
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,350
and crying alone

196
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,470
in the direction of the train.

197
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,110
It’s hard for everyone.

198
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,310

[Hygiene, health, four Modernizations]

200
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,430
We all said later that

201
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,270
Gu Yiye was too heartless.

202
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,990
They were singing and clapping.

203
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,350
Is there such a thing?

204
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,310
That’s a part of comrades who don’t want to make progress.

205
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,190
Understand?

206
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,670

Write every day, without fail.

After reading the letter,

227

Otherwise, your relationship for so many years

is the eight-cent stamp.

Since you were born,

I have never cared about you.

267

As a father,

268
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,350

Just mistakes?

270

You never cared about me,

271
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,230
you never cared about my mother either.

272

But none of these matters.

It must be something you don’t want to say.

I have no right to ask.

278
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,510
I just want to know

279
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,630
why you called me here.

280
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,030
You’re not going to tell me that, right?

281
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,430
If so,

282
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,870
you can go talk to my mom.

283
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,230
It seems that

284
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,710
you are not going to accept me for a while.

285
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,510
Then take your time.

286
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,270
Let me ask you one more thing.

287
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,710
What is the relationship between

288
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,350
Gu Yiye of the Regiment 720 and you?

289
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,390
What did Gao Liang say to you?

290
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,030
Do I need to hear it from Gao Liang?

291
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,150
Can’t I see with my own eyes?

292
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,790
If you are questioning the soldier

293
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,830
as a chief,

294
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,430
I can tell you that,

295
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,310
we are ordinary comrades in arms.

296
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,510
But if you’re asking me in any other status,

297
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,030
sorry, I don’t want to talk to you.

298
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,510
But you’re my daughter.

299
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,510
Daughter?

300
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,430
Is it the daughter who met

301
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,630
for the third or fourth time?

302
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,470
You can go back.

303
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,470
Hold on.

304
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,270
I’ll remind you of one thing

305
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,910
as a veteran.

306
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,030
Just now I asked you about your relationship with Gu Yiye,

307
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,750
and you immediately asked

308
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,990
what Gao Liang said,

309
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,070
which was very bad.

310
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,190
You should trust your comrades.

311
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,590
In some cases,

312
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,070
this rhetorical question is equivalent to selling out.

313
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,590
Yes, chief.

314
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,070
The intracranial swelling went down quickly,

315
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,150
and Director Zhou said there would be no after-effects.

316
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,710
If tomorrow’s surgery goes well,

317
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,070
he’ll be able to get out of the hospital after he recovers from injuries.

318
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,310
Out of the hospital so soon.

319
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,230
Look, comrade nurse,

320
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,630
this comrade’s health

321
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,870
is a serious concern.

322
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,110
No matter how big or trivial,

323
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,350
you can tell her

324
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,750
anything.

325
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,510
They’re in the romantic relationship,

326
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,430
and have been childhood friends for many years.

327
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,310
At ordinary times, she can help him take a bath,

328
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,670
get water and urine.

329

330
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,870
Get out of my face.

331

It's okay, is there anything else?

332
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,790
You can take care of him to sleep well

333
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,950
and not eat in the afternoon.

334
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,270
Don’t drink water at night.

335
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,590
I’ll check in later.

336
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,270
Thanks, Nurse Wang.

337
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,990
We’ll watch him for you.

338
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,590
Do you hear that?

339
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,350
No eating, no drinking.

Let me see if your legs still work.

341

It’s the division commander’s idea.

Well, as her company commander,

which can be said to be rapid.

375

At this rate, it is very likely

So, what is it about?

386

If it is because the romantic relationship between male and female soldiers,

387

But I don’t understand why the division commander

390
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,430
should be involved in this matter.

00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,950
She likes being a soldier.

688
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,110
She’s just threatening me.

689
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,310
Both courageous and prudent,

690
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,910
and scare you to death.

691
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,190
Just the fact that

692
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,150
you have a daughter for nothing

693
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,310
makes everything worth it.

694
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,710
You two, being father and daughter,

695
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,310
are in fact the same.

696
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,830
Where are you going?

697
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,270
How come a new comrade

698
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,750
makes you the Director for Logistics?

699
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,870
Get a chair and sit down right here.

700
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,150
I haven’t seen you all day.

701
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,190
Chief,

702
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,750
you told me to care for the comrades, didn’t you?

703
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,310
Chief, you two take your time.

704
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,150
I’ll be in the kitchen.

705
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:38,910
Just call me if you need me.

706
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,150
Political commissar, have some more.

707
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,950
Come on, political commissar.

708
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,150
You’re right.

709
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,470
I have a daughter for nothing.

710
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,590
It’s worth for

711
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,590
all the guilt

712
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,830
that I suffered.

713
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,750
Ever since I found out the truth,

714
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,710
I could not close my eyes

715
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,630
without seeing this girl

716
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,510
standing there and staring at me.

717
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,870
I’m such ashamed.

718
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,510
She was doing well here,

719
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,710
and worked so hard

720
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,810
to be a reserve member in the company,

721
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,190
but had to be transferred

722
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,830
due to me being her father.

723
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,950
I’ve done nothing for her

724
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,110
since she was born,

725
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,790
not even making a meal,

726
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,590
cooking a bowl of noodles, or helping her with a cup of water.

727
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,390
I did nothing but sent her away.

728
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,470
Who else would accept that?

729
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,550
But I could not play dumb.

730
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,950
She’s my daughter,

731
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,630
even not registered,

732
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,550
but my biological daughter.

733
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,230
I have to go by the rules.

734
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,710
That’s our principle.

735
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,870
I understand that you are a man of principle

736
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,030
being impartial and selfless.

737
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,270
But as the old saying goes,

738
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,630
the style of work is led by the higher authorities, while the worldly customs formed by the civilians.

739
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,590
The style of an army

740
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,390
should be led by the higher authorities,

741
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,910
and then passed on to the soldiers.

742
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,870
Take our division as an example,

743
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,110
you and I should be the role models.

744
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,270
An army cannot make laws

745
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,670
without being strict.

746
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,190
Strictness is the key to sweep away all obstacles,

747
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,590
unless the army will be completely routed.

748
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,150
When you come down to it,

749
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,810
it’s...

750
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,270
with reason but without humanity.

751
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,790
But as a soldier,

752
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,590
I’m on your side.

753
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,550
Being a political commissar

754
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,790
is indeed persuasive.

755
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,590
You have the strategic perspective.

756
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,550
I was enlightened upon hearing your words.

757
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,910
Just one suggestion,

758
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,270
as for the time

759
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,590
of the transfer,

760
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,110
we should re-consider it.

761
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,270
Could we give Jiang a chance

762
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,150
to finish

763
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,630
the competition of the military district

764
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,270
before the transfer?

765
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,190
She’ll have more time to accept the truth.

766
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,670
Moreover, she will probably

767
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,350
win the gold medal for our division.

768
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,270
In the meantime, when she’s fighting for our honor,

769
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,470
she’ll understand the situation.

770
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,710
Then we can transfer her.

771
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,150
What do you think?

772
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,430
Great.

773
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,030
For political commissar,

774
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,070
whatever problem it is,

775
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,550
it’ll be our victory.

776
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,710
Okay.

how to confess with Gu Yiye?

What a beautiful script!

860
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,270
It is definitely from a girl, right?

861
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,870
How is your arm?

862
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:02,350
Don’t worry.

00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,550
It’s much better.
