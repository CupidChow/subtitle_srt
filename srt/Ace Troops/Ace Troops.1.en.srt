177

Say yes.

Yes.

185

Matter

186
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,640
is a thing that exists in the world.

187
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
Chief, as soon as I did a handstand,

188
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,800
my blood flew to my brain

189
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,320
and I've got a bee in my bonnet.

190
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,560
I'm thinking about my unhappy childhood

191
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,080
and tragic past.

192
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,880
When I was young,
people often beat me outside.

193
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,540
- Did he frighten you just now?
- Well, separate.

194
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,570
- Chief.
- Separate.

195
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,320
- I knew he's fake.
- Stow

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,860
your backpacks overhead.

197
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,520
Stow them overhead.

198
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,280
Tell me.

199
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,840
There.

200
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,920
How did you find that?

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,560
He's arrogant. He was just bluffing.

202
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,600
He didn't stand straight.

203
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
He's always trying to keep his back straight.

204
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,440
The jacket and the pants are not a match.

205
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,750
The hat and the Sam Browne belt

206
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,890
don't fit him.

207
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,870
He saw things.

208
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,680
He has the potential to become a scout.

209
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,640
And there's a problem
of his speeches and thoughts.

210
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,520
He's irritable and stupid.

211
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,040
He tends to play a passive role.

212

You want to use these to tell me

your goal is not just to be a soldier.

Let go of me. Let's have a fight.

I'll kick you and make you fall
off the train.

Do you dare fight with me?

Would you like to fight with him?

244

Fight with him, Gu Yiye.

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,160
I'll let him go. Beat him.

I want to fight but I will not do it.

If he's an enemy,

I won't fight

because he's already captured by us.

What we're going to do next

253

is to interrogate the captive.

254

If he still doesn't obey us,

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,520
we'll shoot him.

Why are you so talkative?

257
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,800
Can you fight?

If you can, ask them to let go of me.

It's the basic respect.

Right.

We'd better use our remaining courage
to chase the captive.

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,520
What is the military for?

515
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
The military is for war.

516
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
If the military doesn't fight a war,

517
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,400
both of the money of our country

518
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,800
and our people will be wasted.

519
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,720
Division commander,

520
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,120
it's just an exercise.

521
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,240
You don't have to be so serious.

522
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,960
There's no exercise for Division 234.

523
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,280
As long as I hear the cannon booming,

524
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,760
I think there's a real bloody battle.

525
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,120
How to confront them?

526
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,240
Active defense.

527
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,800
Replace defense by attack.

528
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,960
Order Regiment 720

529
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,280
to pretend to be the main force
of our division

530
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,080
and attract Army B.

531
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,680
I'll lead the main force of our division

532
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,960
to No. 6 Highway.

533
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,000
Then go to

534
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
the command office of Army B.

535
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
Destroy its command center

536
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
and supplement center.

537
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,240
How experienced you are!

[Combat Map of Nanjiang]

539
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,640
The key of the whole battle is Hongshikou.

540
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,880
It's vital to No. 6 Highway.

541
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,920
Defending it is easy
but attacking it is hard.

542
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,680
If Army B occupies it before us

543
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,040
and deploy a battalion there

544
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,200
and we dispatch a powerful regiment,

545
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,240
we'll still have to
spend at least three days and three nights

546
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
on conquering it.

547
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,480
Among all the regiments of our division,

548
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,120
the distance between Hongshikou

549
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,160
and Regiment 720 is the shortest.

550
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,160
Division commander,

551
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,040
you know

552
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,840
that regiment joined us recently

553
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,600
and these years,

554
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,880
it has been focusing on the agriculture.

555
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,640
Cut the crap!

556
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,380
[Combat Map of Nanjiang]

557
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,400
Give the order to battle now.

558
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,800
Order Regiment 720 to depart now.

559
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,680
Arrive at Hongshikou

560
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,000
before 14:00.

561
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,360
Build fortifications.

562
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,960
Help and cover the main force
of our division.

563
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,240
Make them pass No. 6 Highway.

564
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,280
Yes!

565
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Pick Commander Chen Dashan
of Regiment 720 up.

566
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Staff Officer Wang,

567
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,840
there are still over 70 kilometers left.

568
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,520
Well, Staff Officer Wang, listen.

569
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,400
It's really hard for us this time.

570
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,680
During these years, our regiment

571
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,000
farmed over 10,000 mu of land

572
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,360
for Bayi Farm of the military district.

573
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,960
Over 10,000 mu!

574
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,840
Statistics show that.

575
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,160
Think about my cadres and soldiers.

576
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,280
They're very good at farming.

577
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,560
We didn't have time to exercise.

578
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,320
Today I spent three hours

579
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,640
gathering troops.

580
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,960
There's still a battalion

581
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,440
which hasn't caught up with
the main force of our division yet.

582
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,040
Chen Dashan.

583
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,880
Division commander!

584
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,960
I don't care which force your Regiment 720

585
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,680
used to belong to.

586
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,840
Now your title

587
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,640
includes Division 234.

588
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,840
Now you belong to People's Liberation Army.

589
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,560
You're the colonel of Regiment 720
of Division 234 of Army A.

590
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,880
Remember,

591
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,440
Division 234 is an ace.

592
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,840
You can never be a coward.

593
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,520
Yes, division commander.

594
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,400
I want to
report an unforeseen problem to you.

595
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,720
At Zhangmu Train Station,

596
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,280
several hundred new recruits

597
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,640
are trapped.

598
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,960
Please advise.

599
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,560
Order them to stay there.

600
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,000
Let them hear the cannon booming

601
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,440
and smell the gunfire.

602
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
It's also the first lesson
of their military career.

603
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,200
Yes.

604
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,720
Public line.

605
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,680
Please tell us

606
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,800
the security code of your unit.

607
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,920
Thunderbolt.

608
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,400
Thunderbolt?

609
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,840
Hi, chief.

610
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,120
Sir,

611
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,760
Song Jianshe, Chief of Military Affairs Unit
of Regiment 720

612
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,400
is picking new recruits up
at Zhangmu Train Station.

613
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,640
Please advise.

614
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,720
Song Jianshe.

615
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,560
Yes.

616
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,160
Is there any enemy?

617
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,360
Chief,

618
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,440
at 14:38,

619
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
there were 5 shots
from 85-mm divisional cannons.

620
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,080
They came from the southeast
and the distance is about 4 kilometers.

621
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,960
Others are normal.

622
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,200
Did the train
that carried new recruits leave?

623
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,280
Not yet, sir.

624
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,360
According to the original plan,

625
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,320
it'll depart tomorrow

626
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,680
for Huixi with a batch of machines
for making steel

627
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,440
which was from August Port.

628
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,520
How many trains

629
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,680
will pass the railway
between Hongshikou and Zhangmu

630
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,640
within 48 hours?

631
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,440
Zero.

632
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,160
I used to work at
the railway's military representative office.

633
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,320
Huixi Steelworks has exclusive use

634
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,360
of this railway.

635
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,400
The military representative office
borrows a train

636
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,680
from steelworks
to transport new recruits every time.

637
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,040
Watch the train.

638
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Prevent it from leaving Zhangmu Train Station

639
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,320
unless I give orders.

640
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,080
Yes.

641
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,320
I have a question.

642
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,560
What does "lightning thunderbolt" mean?

643
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,810
If it's about
the typhoon and the thunderstorm,

644
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,480
I think it means a kind of weather.

645
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,920
If it's only about the thunderbolt,

646
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
I think it's a password
or the number of a radio station.

647
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,280
Have you ever seen a war film?

648
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,320
Yangtze River,
Yangtze River, I'm Yellow River.

649
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,200
Like this.

650
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,280
Which unit does the thunderbolt belong to?

651
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,920
Tell me.

652
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,840
What did you get?

653
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,840
There's a situation! Get ready to fight!

654
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,440
New recruits, stay there and hide!

655
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,840
Lu Pingfan!

656
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,360
Why are you running?

657
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,960
There's a situation! Get ready to fight!

658
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,440
You're surrounded!

659
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,080
Don't move!

660
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,520
Don't move!

661
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,080
Who are you?

662
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,080
It's a local office.

663
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,320
You can't break it.

664
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,040
Get out.

665
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,080
We're with Army B.

666
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,080
We're ordered
to occupy Zhangmu Train Station.

667
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,880
Hands up!

668
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,440
OK. Let's go.

669
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,120
Please follow the exercise rules.

670
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,320
Enough. Stop it.

671
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,920
You're surrounded. Stay there.

672
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,320
You're not allowed to go away.

673
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,360
Repeat.

674
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,960
- You're surrounded.
- Is it an exercise?

675
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,280
- You're surrounded.
- Stay there.

676
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,560
You're not allowed to go away.

677
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,760
You're surrounded. Stay there.

678
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,240
You're not allowed to go away.

679
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,840
We're captured
by people who're in military uniforms.

680
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,520
Why is it so weird?

681
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,680
This is the first day
we put on military uniforms.

682
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
We were captured by them.

683
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,680
It's embarrassing.

684
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,680
Fight against them.

685
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,880
Sergeant, give orders.

686
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,720
Give orders, sergeant.

687
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,400
Give orders, sergeant.

688
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,400
I don't know what happened.

689
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200
How could I give orders?

690
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,920
They're fighting!

691
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,840
What are you doing?

692
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,080
Go back!

693
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,680

Commissar Lu knelt down
after being hit by someone.

695
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,440
He knelt down.

New recruits,

don't be captives even if we have to die!

Our country and people

699
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,280
need us now.

Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

You're surrounded.

710

Stop running.

00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,360
Just go with us.

I will never surrender!

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,960
You're challenging us.

715
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840

They're bullying our female soldiers.

They're taunting us.

Don't move!

737

Squat down.

You're wrong. The stone is injured.

Go!

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,720
- Go.
- Don't move!

Behave yourself.

746
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,680
Bro,

747
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,200
I was never so brave before.

748
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,960
I'm satisfied with myself.

749
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,440
This is the first time I didn't run away.

750
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,800
I'm not sure
if it's because I'm in the military uniform

751
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,560
or

752
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,120
there's a group
of different comrades-in-arms.

753
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,720
But I know I like this.

754
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,740
There's no need
to separate cadres from soldiers.

755
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,800
But female soldiers should be held alone.

756
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,040
Those new recruits

757
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,600
will fight against us
if they see female soldiers.

758
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,230
She

759
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,200
is the most troublesome woman.

760
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,360
Hold her alone.

761
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,880
Yes!

762
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,400
Wait!

763
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,840
Where are you taking her to?

764
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,160
Sorry, I can't tell you.

765
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,480
Please follow the exercise rules.

766
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,080
Go.

767
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,000
Where are they going?

768
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,240
Get up, everyone. Go.

769
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,840
- Hurry up.
- Go.

770
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,080
It's good to be held together.

771
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,120
Tell me.

772
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,480
Are we dead soldiers

773
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,600
or captives?

774
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,200
I think it's actually good to be dead.

775
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,800
I choose to be a dead soldier.

776
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,880
This is my first day in the military.
I don't want to be a captive.

777
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,080
It's a little unlucky.

778
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,520
You know what?

779
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,760
You were captured because you're stupid

780
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,400
but I'm different.

781
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,040
I came back to save female soldiers.

782
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,640
But you failed to save them.

783
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,360
Shut up.

784
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,400
Why are you so talkative?

785
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,280
Beihai.

786
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,080
Wake everyone up.

787
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,160
Let's have a meeting.

788
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,800
Sergeant.

789
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,160
I have something to tell you.

790
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,240
Mancang.

791
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,880
Mancang.

792
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,160
Take me here.

793
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,240
Comrades, please move.

794
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,000
Downward.

795
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,720
All right. Let's get started.

796
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,880
Hongliu,

797
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,880
watch the door.

798
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,520
According to what happened during the day,

799
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,200
it's just that...

800
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,520
It's mainly because

801
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,040
I got important intelligence

802
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
at the duty room.

803
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,400
About the intelligence...

804
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,000
Lower your voice.

805
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,480
Do you want the sentry to come in?

806
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,840
Gu,

807
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,480
keep going.

808
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,760
OK.

809
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,600
Comrades,

810
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,320
We fell into the eye of the exercise

811
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,280
of Regiment 720

812
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,680
and Division 234

813
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
by accident.

814
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
The division office

815
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,360
called Zhangmu Train Station.

816
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,720
They ordered chief of Military Affairs Unit
of Regiment 720

817
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,760
to take care of the new recruits

818
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,560
and

819
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,160
control the train

820
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,360
we took.

821
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,000
That train is special.

822
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,600
It's not in the civil train timetable.

823
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,760
The enemy staff officer tends to overlook it.

824
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,920
Then why does Division 234

825
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,680
want this train?

826
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,840
The division

827
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,560
wants to use this train

828
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,080
to transport a powerful army

829
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,200
and affect the exercise.

830
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,680
Beihai,

831
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,360
you're with the Railway Corps.

832
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,320
You're knowledgeable about railway.

833
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,040
Tell us.

834
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,760
OK.

835
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,160
Let me see.

836
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,280
If we're here, then

837
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,560
the route should be about

838
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,640
Zhangmu,

839
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,880
Hongshikou, South Town
and free economic zones.

840
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,120
You're right.

841
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,840
Therefore,

842
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,960
Hongshikou is the most likely place.

843
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,199
If people of Division 234

844
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,440
want to reinforce themselves here,

845
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,560
it'll take them a long time

846
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840
to go to Hongshikou

847
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,719
unless they go along this railway.

848
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,520
So I believe Division 234

849
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,920
will take this train

850
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,040
and use it

851
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,840
to transport a powerful army secretly.

852
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,360
But the scariest thing
about our enemies is that

853
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,440
they expected

854
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,600
Division 234 would do that

855
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
so they conquered the railway station
in advance.

856
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,480
But they didn't blow up the train.

857
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,320
Instead, they set up an artillery position

858
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,000
on the ridge which is close to the railway

859
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,400
and ordered two tank battalions

860
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,080
to ambush in the southern woods.

861
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,159
Therefore,

862
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,280
they can't wait

863
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,000
to defeat the main force of Division 234

864
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,960
at Zhangmu Train Station.

865
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,800
Colonel!

866
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,760
What are you doing?

867
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,200
Colonel!

868
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,160
Lights were off while driving

869
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,680
but the Third Battalion still didn't catch up
with us.

870
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,240
Didn’t they still catch up with us?

871
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,400
The division commander will cut my head

872
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,320
and treat it as a football.

873
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,920
Don't worry!

874
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,270
It's a stroke of luck this time.

875
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,440
I believe they'll show up in front of

876
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,520
all people of our division.

877
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,480
Show up for what?

878
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,920
What do you mean?

879
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Qin Hanyong, listen.

880
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,520
You're no longer the commander of

881
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,600
Night Tiger Company of Regiment 700.

882
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,400
You're the staff officer
for Regiment 720's exercises.

883
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,880
Whom are you laughing at? Me?

884
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,160
- No, colonel.
- Enough.

885
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Stop talking!

886
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,310
I know what you mean.

887
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,000
Your Regiment 700 is very powerful.

888
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,000
And you were a member of

889
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,000
the main force of their division.

890
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,560
What do you think of Regiment 720?

891
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,960
We're very weak.

892
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
We're like your step mother, right?

893
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,710
If you don't want to be here,

894
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,480
just go back!

895
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,840
Go back!

896
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,640
Take off the uniform!

897
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,600
No!

898
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,920
Colonel!

899
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,270
I'll raise my voice

900
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,920
and report to you again

901
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,200
based on my comprehension.

902
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,920
Tell me!

903
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,640
The division's latest order is that

904
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,160
we should arrive at Zhangmu Train Station

905
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,880
as soon as possible.

906
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,270
All the main forces of our division

907
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,790
are going there.

908
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,040
Therefore,

909
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,160
the Third Battalion
which is always the last one

910
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,280
will become

911
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,960
the pioneer of the whole division

912
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,000
because the distance between them

913
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,800
and Zhangmu Train Station is the shortest.

914
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,800
It's the first time, colonel.

915
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,040
Hurry up. Contact the Third Battalion.

916
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,040
I couldn't reach out to the Third Battalion.

917
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,600
You have to send someone to go there.

918
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,560
What should we do?

919
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,000
Are you going there?

920
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,240
I've exercised with Night Tiger Company here.

921
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,200
The terrain is familiar to me.

922
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,360
Then go!

923
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,400
Qin!

924
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,040
Be careful.

925
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,600
Beware of scouts of Army B.

926
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,040
Colonel.

927
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,200
Don't worry.

928
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,560
They can't make it.

929
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,120
You imitated me.

930
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,080
Comrades,

931
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,040
Now only us can save

932
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,120
Division 234.

933
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,520
You're a veteran now.

934
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,960
How could you know so many things?

935
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,720
My family is with the infantry college.

936
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,160
I knew Division 234 would come here

937
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,760
so I prepared in advance.

938
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,240
I checked some related materials.

939
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,240
Did you study the jungle warfare?

940
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,360
Of course.

941
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,280
It's the main combat task of Army A.

942
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,440
Is Gu Heng who's an instructor your father?

943
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,480
Chief.

944
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,680
We're having a meeting.

945
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
We're talking about something serious.

946
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,840
Don't be curious about his father.

947
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,560
Think of a combat plan as soon as possible.

948
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,720
What Gu Yiye said

949
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,080
is almost the same as what I thought.

950
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
There's only one solution.

951
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,400
We have to try to get out,

952
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,120
report what happened here to our division

953
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,480
and prevent them from

954
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,760
falling into the trap
at Zhangmu Train Station.

955
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,000
Leader, anything you say.

956
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,760
We'll follow you.

957
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,960
Cadres cannot participate in it.

958
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,500
It's the principle.

959
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,360
Comrades,

960
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,240
let me introduce myself to you first.

961
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,680
I'm the chief of Military Affairs Unit

962
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,080
of Regiment 720 of Division 234

963
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,560
that he mentioned just now.

964
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,400
I'm here to

965
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,920
popularize general knowledge.

966
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,680
It's also a rule of the battlefield.

967
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,120
It's not that

968
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
we cadres

969
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,440
pass the buck.

970
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,080
It's just that there's a rule.

971
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,200
If we participate in it,

972
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,320
it'll be considered as a cheat

973
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,880
or a trick.

974
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,880
Even if we win, it's not fair.

975
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,560
In the future,

976
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,800
we'll be punished

977
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,040
on the real battlefield.

978
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,160
So there's such a rule.

979
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,840
Am I clear?

980
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,080
But...

981
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,080
But

982
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,880
as new recruits, you can save the day.

983
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,440
Strictly speaking,

984
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,880
you're not new recruits.

985
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,200
If you succeed to flee,

986
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,280
Army B will not

987
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,800
report it to the Exercise Command.

988
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
But it's a bit risky to do that.

989
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,600
If you succeed,

990
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,840
you'll be praised and rewarded.

991
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,040
If you fail,

992
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,360
you'll be kicked out.

993
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
Think about it.

994
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,600
I want to stress that

995
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
the reason why Commissar Lu and me

996
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,000
said those things

997
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,080
is that we wanted to
tell you the truth you didn't know.

998
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,000
But they're not suggestions

999
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,360
or commands.

1000
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,080
To go or not to go,

1001
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,080
it's up to you. OK?

1002
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,400
We don't know anything.

1003
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,640
I got it.

1004
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,760
You mean

1005
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,640
cadres and leaders are not responsible
for anything.

1006
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,720
I talked for a long time.

1007
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Why didn't you get it?

1008
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,800
We can't participate in it.

1009
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm in.

1010
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,560
I have a headache.

1011
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,040
Gu Yiye,

1012
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,360
I'd like to remind you.

1013
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,800
You said you would never leave the army,
right?

1014
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,520
If something goes wrong this time,

1015
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,280
just sleep in front of the military gate.

1016
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,840
I'm not here to be a coward.

1017
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,360
If we cheat,

1018
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,840
the fruits will be meaningless.

1019
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,400
But I have to tell you something.

1020
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,240
The biggest problem might be about

1021
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,200
scouts of Army B instead of

1022
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,440
the pursuers that you meet on the way.

1023
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Their division commander

1024
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Mr. Meng

1025
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,320
loves sending scouts

1026
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
to do his dirty work.

1027
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,920
All people in the military know that.

1028
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,320
OK.

1029
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,920
Let's get ready to go.

1030
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,600
Wait!

1031
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,320
As a wounded soldier...

1032
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,400
- Lower your voice.
- Are you stupid?

1033
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,320
Don't hit my head. It hurts.

1034
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,520
Yiye,

1035
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,680
please do me a favor.

1036
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,680
Yiye.

1037
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,720
Tell me now.

1038
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,600
Yiye,

1039
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,120
when you go out to send letters,

1040
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
can you

1041
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,400
rescue female soldiers?

1042
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Let me finish.

1043
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,440
To be precise,

1044
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,960
rescue the female soldier
who has been held alone.

1045
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,960
Well, I can't set my mind at rest.

1046
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,760
I'm worried about her.

1047
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,800
Are you kidding me?

1048
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,920
I'm going to send letters.

1049
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,240
I don't have time to rescue female soldiers.

1050
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,840
Will rescuing a female soldier stop you...

1051
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Wounded comrade,

1052
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,080
listen.

1053
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,560
Don't worry.

1054
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,040
Army B is also with People's Liberation Army.

1055
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
It's an exercise.

1056
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,920
Don't worry.

1057
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,720
Female soldiers will not get hurt.

1058
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,920
Besides,

1059
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,600
it has nothing to do with you.

1060
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,480
I'm afraid that she'll be bullied.

1061
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,280
Chief, those young female soldiers

1062
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,960
are our comrades-in-arms.

1063
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,040
They're like our family.

1064
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,560
If you see enemies capture

1065
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,040
your family members,

1066
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,360
won't you feel bad?

1067
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,360
Thinking of that, my heart is broken.

1068
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,120
Our division commander

1069
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,040
can only rely on

1070
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,240
us now.

1071
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,280
And those female soldiers can only rely on

1072
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,600
us.

1073
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,760
I would rather be beaten to death

1074
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,520
than allow enemies to

1075
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
capture our female soldiers.

1076
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,560
To us, they're the beautiful scenery,

1077
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,880
the honor

1078
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,080
and the hope.

1079
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,320
This tall guy is a bit stupid.

1080
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,360
Yiye,

1081
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,360
we must rescue female soldiers.

1082
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Let's keep up

1083
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,600
the good traditions of our army.

1084
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,840
A show of hands.

1085
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,680
Let people make a decision. OK?

1086
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Cadres don't need to participate in it.

1087
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,600
Just look at us.

1088
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,320
I'll go first.

1089
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,520
I agree.

1090
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,840
- Count me in.
- I agree.

1091
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,680
I'll go, too.

1092
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,560
I agree, too.

1093
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,240
We heard everything you said.

1094
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,840
- We all agree.
- Yes.

1095
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,560
OK.

1096
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,000
Dude,

1097
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,680
please rescue female soldiers.

1098
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,560
Comrades, protect female soldiers!
Rescue our comrades-in-arms!

1099
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,200
Let's go!

1100
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,720
Let's go!

1101
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,120
Let's go!

1102
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,900
Let's go!
