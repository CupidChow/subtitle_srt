How'd you find me?

12
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:53,297
You can't serve the leader
on an empty stomach.

13
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:58,042
Aren't we doing all this for food anyway?

14
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,875
Does anyone know you're here?

15
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,541
Don't worry, I reported to the captain.

16
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,833
I hope it's seasoned properly.

17
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,750

let's wait for backup.

00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,874
And watch the sunrise?

33
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,666
Don't move!

34
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:29,792
Clean it up.

35
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:35,792
Freeze!

36
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,792
Freeze, he said.

00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,375

00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,333
If you don't drop your guns,

39
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,791
you'll get a bullet each to the head.

40
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,875

Do you ever listen?

45
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:12,458
No need for bloodshed among comrades.

46
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,333
Lower your gun and come down.

47
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,416
We need a little face-to-face.

48
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,041
Think about it.

49
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:27,542
With these plates, we could
all live like kings.

51
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,208

52
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Yeah?

53
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,125

00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,083
Stop!

55
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,500
Lower your gun.

56
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:54,083
Rest of you too.

57
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,417

58
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,416
Take cover!

59
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,208
Hwa-ryung...

60
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:14,167
Cheol-ryung, you okay?

61
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:21,625
This may sound weird,
but I never liked you all.

62
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,249

63

My graceful mercy...

67
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:56,042
is the only reason you get to live,

68
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,624
and not because of the leader you serve.

69
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,416
I got a job for you, go tell the Republic.

70
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:08,125
I'm taking the plates as the
price of people's blood.

71
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,499

all security measures,

75
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,458
and can bypass any counterfeit detection

76
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,958
by the newest technology
available around the world.

77
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:43,124
The engraved plates that are
used to print supernotes

78
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:47,625
were made by our best technicians
over the course of many years,

79
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,583
and within 1 micrometer...

80
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:50,833
I'm not here to hear you boast.

81
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Get to your point.

82
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:56,458
The plates were stolen...

83
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,207
After the counterfeit scandal of 2010,

84
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,207
we've denied the existence
of the supernotes,

85
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,124
but if these plates are
exposed, it would...

86
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,125
Start a war.

87
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,791

88
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,208
Who's the suspect?

89
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:16,999
Cha Gi-sung, age 44, born in Hoeryong,

90
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,082

a weapons specialist,

91
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:25,208
returned last September
to lead a special police squad.

92
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,958
But he was demoted for stealing
drugs from the Republic.

93
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:33,625
His wife was punished for family
liability and died in prison.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,332
It's presumed that he brought
his old squad together...

95
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,333
God damn it.

96
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,250
Ministry of security has detected
his route out of the Republic,

97
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,958
and he reached Chungdo on the 12th.

98
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,791
Passing through Beijing
and reached Dalian...

99
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,916
China? Are you serious?

100
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:53,458
Request their cooperation to extradite him!

101
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,791
We're in talks with MSS,
but China is just a stopover,

102
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,583
and he boarded a plane from Dalian today.

103
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,333
The destination is...

104
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,208

Okay, okay, don't come.

00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:25,958
<i>What about my iPhone?</i>

126
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,374

<i>When will you buy me?</i>

129
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,625
Let's be frank.

130
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,999
Did you take bribes from him?

131
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,166
What bribe? I would never!

132
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,875
Then why call it in after letting him go?

133
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,457
I wasn't in a situation to call in first.

134
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,041
You worked so hard to catch that bastard.

135
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,083
You got your boys on stakeouts for weeks.

136
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,167
I know, I was on it too.

137
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:58,583

You can't leave our conversation like that!

Things are bad.

141
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,416
Internal affairs are up my ass.

142
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,292
I'll suspend you for 3 months
until things cool down.

143
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,208
Really?

144
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:22,083
He came after me with a knife,
I'm not a Robocop!

145
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,250
Chief Pyo!

146
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,250
Det. Kang!

147
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,124
You idiot, I told you to call it
in to the chief first.

148
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,375
Why didn't you?

149
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,875
I thought the arrest came first.

150
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,624
You stupid idiot...

151
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,291
This isn't the academy.

152
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:42,667
I'll go talk to the chief, sir.

153
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,125
What about?

154
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,083
It was my mistake.

155
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,541
Forget it, asshole.

156
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,166
A rookie can't start out with a strike.

157
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,541
Go on in, it's a done deal.

158
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,208
It's part of being a cop.

159
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,667
It's okay, go inside.

160
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,583
So squad leader of district 12,
Cpt. Cha Gi-sung

161
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,666
fled the country,

162
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:20,124
but Major Lim Cheol-ryung in his squad!

163
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,792
Why were you kept alive?

164
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,374
What's your plan with Cha?

165
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,458
Kill me.

166
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,374
If you don't,

167
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,874
I'll go after Cha to the cliffs of hell.

168
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,333
Leave us.

00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:01,625
A North-South ministerial talk
will be held in Seoul next week.

170
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,291
It's an unprecedented
event that we initiated.

171
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,875
I'm going to include you in the delegation.

172
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,624
Go and capture Cha.

173
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,375
I didn't take the bribe!

174
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,249
Yeon-ah, my Princess, come here!

175
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,333
Daddy, my iPhone!

176
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,416
Okay, close the curtains.

177
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,042
iPhone!

178
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,874
When will you buy me?! You promised!

179
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,958
- When, when, when?!
- Okay!

180
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,249
I'll buy it today!

181
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,291
Today?

182
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,166
Close the curtain, okay?

183
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:54,167
- Mom said breakfast!
- I don't want any!

184
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:01,124
Brother-in-law! It's an emergency!

185
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,541
What is it?

186
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,750
I need $1,000 ASAP, can I borrow it?

187
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,833
Jesus, $1,000 is...

188
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,874
Shush! Be quiet.

189
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,332
I had a busy last month,

190
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,707
so my cards are all maxed out.

191
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,458
Go talk to your sister!

192
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,917
Bro, we're better than this.

193
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,708
Talk to your sister!

194
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,874
Send it to my account, got it?

195
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What's going on here?

196
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:34,041
Did you see his face?
He must be overworked.

197
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,791
Be good to him, I feel terrible for him.

198
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,791
You must want something.

199
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:40,333
Hey, hey, wake up.

200
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,499
Hey, dumbass, aren't you going to work?

201
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,207
What's with you all today?!

202
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,499
I'm off duty today!

203
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,458
- It's Chief Pyo.
- I don't care!

204
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,250
I'll take it then, hello?

205
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,825
- He won't answer...
- Give it!

206
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,791
I knew you'd take it.

207
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,249
Come eat breakfast!

208
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,625
Don't want any.

209
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,208
Hello?

210
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:01,708
Good morning.

211
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,249
Jin-tae!

212
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,124
So much trash!

213
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,208
- Why are you here?
- Let me help.

214
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:08,541
Forget it.

215
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,207
Are you rested?

216
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:14,208
Like hell, I need to look
for a part-time job.

217
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,874
15 years of partnership means shit.

218
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,041
This is what loyalty is all about?

219
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,832
I took easy on you because of our loyalty.

220
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,207
Remember how you lost
a suspect during a stakeout?

221
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,874
And the missing $5,000
after the Ssangmun raid.

222
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,250
You came to tell me that?

223
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,957
Don't worry, really.

224
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,832
I made sure there's no
strikes on your record.

225
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,708
- Bullshit.
- Come on!

226
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,250
Joint investigation?

227
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:39,292
Heard about next week's ministerial talk?

228
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Their delegation will include a detective.

229
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,875
A censor bureau agent.

230
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,999
Anyway, there was a criminal
who defected to the South,

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,750
and they want to catch him themselves.

232
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,958
What crime did he commit?

233
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,374
I dunno.

234
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,791
It's an order from the commissioner.

235
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,624
Everyone's going rabid to take this case.

236
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,291
But I managed to secure it.

237
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,708
Cover their detective,
you'll get my support.

238
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,541
You want me to babysit a commie?

239
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,999
- Don't call them that.
- Forget it!

240
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,416
I worked towards a just society,
but I'm just a corrupt cop.

241
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,167
But now you want me to do what?

242
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,833
How long must I sacrifice for my country?

243
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,457
You're hopeless, you really are.

244
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,166
What?

245
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,458
You don't get it, do you?

246
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,416
I'm trying to get you back in good graces.

247
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,207
Forget it, I won't beg.

248
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,374
If you don't want it,
I'll get the rookie on it.

249
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:41,875
I never said no to this case!

250
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,791
And you can't trust this
detail to a rookie.

251
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,582
Right, he's not up for it!

252
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,249
- I'll think about it.
- Okay, good.

253
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,583
So much trash...

254
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:57,250
<i>Today at 12:50 PM...</i>

255
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,083
Bro, pass me the remote.

256
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,000
There, there.

257
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,416
<i>Inter-Korean ministerial
talks will proceed...</i>

258
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,708
- Hold on.
- <i>in Seoul for 3 days.</i>

259
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,208
<i>After a long dormant period,</i>

260
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:15,042
<i>the North Korea-initiated talk
is receiving much attention.</i>

261
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:21,082
<i>With this case, you'll get reinstated,</i>

262
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,457
<i>and if it wraps well,
we'll all get promoted.</i>

263
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,041
<i>Special promotion!</i>

264
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,582
<i>Your salary will get a boost too!</i>

265
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,166
<i>When will we ever get a chance like this?</i>

266
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,875
Honey.

267
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,249
Thanks for everything,
things will get better.

268
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,291
What?

269
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,375
Thanks for everything,
things will get better.

270
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,458
Get it yourself, it's in the fridge.

271
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,249
Get what? I'm thanking you.

272
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,375
Out of the way!

273
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:51,541
Why are you following me?

274
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,041
I said it's in the fridge.

275
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,291
No good, we're no good.

276
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,791
You've been investigated?

277
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,917
Yes, that was an administrative error.

278
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,416
That case was wrapped up nicely.

279
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,832
He used to be a hot shot.

280
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,791
Even got a commissioner award.

281
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,333
He's an undercover specialist.

282
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,166
That's why he's perfect for this detail.

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,750
In any case, very good.

284
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:27,333
Your task is to stay with the
North Korean detective 24/7,

285
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,082
and report anything unusual.

286
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,749
Chief Pyo, support him in
whatever ways you can.

287
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:35,792
Of course.

288
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,625
Like I said earlier,

289
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:42,166
this is a joint and a covert operation.

290
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,499
<i>They mustn't know the
intelligence is involved.</i>

291
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,666
<i>Not only the South, but the North too.</i>

292
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,750
<i>Do you understand?</i>

293
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,875
Find Cha and secure the plates.

294
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,041
Did you learn to use this hand phone?

295
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,666
The South controls the people with this.

296
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,000
You may give up the gun, but never this.

297
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,916
<i>You only have 3 days.</i>

298
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,958
<i>Look for Park Myung-ho first.</i>

299
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,291
<i>He was one of Cha's men,
he's a smuggler in the South.</i>

300
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:36,708
<i>He will lead you to Cha.</i>

301
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,625
<i>Leave your personal vendetta out of this.</i>

302
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:41,958
<i>Don't forget.</i>

303
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,958
What a stud.

304
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,749
Aren't you Det. Lim?

305
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,208
Welcome to the South, nice to meet you.

306
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,083
I'm Kang Jin-tae from Homicide.

307
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:28,707
North's weapon is confiscated

308
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,833
until the case wraps.

309
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,833
That's rule #1 of our joint detail.

310
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,083
It's a property of the
Republic, give it back.

311
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:37,999
That's the rule, and you have to obey.

312
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,458
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

313
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,583
Let's move.

314
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,666
Eat some.

315
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,541
Our tax money is feeding
you to catch the criminal.

316
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:01,750
Go on.

317
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,291
<i>The South will assign a snake to you.</i>

318
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,291
<i>He cannot find out about the plates.</i>

319
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:13,291
<i>The North's target is Cha Gi-sung,</i>

320
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:17,249
<i>they wouldn't initiate a talk
and request a joint detail</i>

321
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,500
for a petty killer, at least
that's our assumption.

322
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,207
I've been at this for 20 years.

323
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,374
I can read between the lines.

324
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,999
I feel the weight on my shoulders.

325
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,916
I'll wrap this case nicely as a
honorable detective of South Korea.

326
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:35,917
Don't you worry.

327
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,042
No...

328
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:38,749
Sit, sit.

329
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,458
We'll locate and arrest Cha Gi-sung.

330
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:47,083
Your job is to pretend to cooperate fully,

331
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,458
<i>and steer him away.</i>

332
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,458
What brought you here?

333
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,708
I read the dossier on this joint case.

334
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:03,083
An ordinary killer wouldn't
initiate a North-South detail.

335
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:08,082
Shouldn't you celebrate
that a killer defected?

336
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,041
I certainly would.

337
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:13,582
It just doesn't make any sense.

338
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,249
It doesn't have to, just do your job.

339
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,958
Is that so?

340
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,874
That flag.

341
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,791
If you leave it on...

342
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:39,791
Rule #2, this is a covert case.

343
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:43,832
I wanted to give you a heads up
about the detail,

344
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,166
but you twisted my arm!

345
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,707
Good thing I suppressed myself,

346
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:52,624
we could have started out on a bad note.

347
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,916
So embarrassing...

348
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,875
Look around.

349
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,249
South is full of CCTVs.

350
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,750
There are over 3 million of them,
we're always being watched.

351
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,124
So since we're...

352
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,999
Right, the North is
always being watched too.

353
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,208
I guess we're all the same.

354
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:18,292
It's too early in the day for these flyers.

355
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,541
Hey.

356
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,583
Ever seen one of these?

357
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,333
Give them a call.

358
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,875
Use this cell phone.

359
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:34,082
I favorited my number.

360
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,124
I got one too.

361
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,916
You do?

362
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,416
You can use this.

363
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,333
Then what's your number?

364
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,666
No need.

365
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:48,667
Give it to me, in case of emergency.

366
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,374
Bastard...

367
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,332
Take it back when you return home.

368
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,333
What do we do now?

369
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,667
Anywhere you want to go?
Seoul Tower, or Itaewon?

370
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,458
This might be your last trip to Seoul.

371
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:09,958
Are you really a special investigator?

372
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,958
Is that what you heard? Yes, why you ask?

373
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:16,625
You feel more like a tour guide.

374
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,082
You think I don't know how to investigate?

375
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,124
We have no clues to go on.

376
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:27,082
My bosses are tracking Cha's location,

377
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,499
- so we need to standby...
- Go to Myeong-dong.

378
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,833
You like shopping? Okay, why not.

379
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,999
Aren't you better off as a soldier?

380
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,708
Why a cap?

381
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,017
Find another route, one without traffic.

382
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,707
I wish I could, but there isn't one.

383
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,291
GPS tells us the best route.

384
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:05,167
For a country without any oil,
why are there so many cars?

385
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,750
Are the Southern cops always like this?

386
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:13,332
Yielding to all traffic,
playing with the hand phone

387
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,458
while chasing a criminal?

388
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:18,332
In Seoul, there's no way
out of a traffic jam.

389
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,499
How do I get through that?

390
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:23,874
That death stare of yours...

391
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,874
I better yield.

392
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,667
Only ambulances can do that.

393
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:39,582
What were you saying?

394
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,708
We're going to Myeong-dong
to look for a suspect?

395
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,041
We're partners, fill me in.

396
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,166
DaeMyung condo, #1108.

397
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,916
Cha's associate lives there.

398
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,624
Park Myung-ho.

399
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,000
That's all I needed to know.

400
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,166
<i>Hostage situation in Mapo district.</i>

401
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,750
<i>A man in his 40s holding a
woman hostage with a knife.</i>

402
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:21,750
What a world we're living in.

403
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:27,542
D-1 is nearby, we'll check it out.

404
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,417
What are you doing?

405
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,583
You heard the radio, we got a hostage.

406
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,041
Did you forget your orders?

407
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:35,917
Where's your priority?

408
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,833
A citizen's safety is a cop's #1 priority.

409
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:41,708
If we don't go, she could get stabbed...

410
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:43,583
Stop this bullshit!

411
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:46,458
Goddamn...

412
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,917
You better let go of me.

413
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:53,874
We're not close enough
for this level of intimacy!

414
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,666
Okay, fine, let's talk it over.

415
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,041
Let go!

416
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,082
Goddammit!

417
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,291
Wait, okay, let go!

418
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,875
Get out of the car.

419
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,707
What do you take me for?

420
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:10,082
All this twisting and
grabbing over nothing!

421
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,874
If we weren't assigned to...

422
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:17,542
You're making a huge mistake.

423
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:19,833
Give that back!

424
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,042
Okay, fine, fine.

425
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:22,458
Truce, ceasefire.

426
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,124
Uncuff me and let's talk
like Democratic people.

427
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,000
Or like communists?

428
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,875
Cheol-ryung, hey, listen to me.

429
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,583
Cheol-ryung!

430
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:37,916
Hey, hey!

431
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,167
Wait!

432
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,249
Lim Cheol-ryung!

433
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,250
What?!

434
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,333
That's one crazy motherfucker!

435
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:53,916
Even if he's a special forces,
this isn't the place!

436
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,666
Det. Lee, I need to track a taxi!

437
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:01,250
Seoul 19 BA 6918.

438
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,833
Sixty-nine fucking eighteen.

439
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,207
<i>DAEMYUNG CONDO</i>

440
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,208
<i>DaeMyung Condo #1108</i>

441
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,041
Hey!

442
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,833
You got here in one piece.

443
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:53,582
Detective, let's have a chat.

444
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,708
We need to talk!

445
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,832
Why are you so gung-ho?

446
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,082
No one investigates on foot anymore.

447
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,083
It's all about CSI.

448
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:02,999
We need to talk about...

449
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,791
How we deal with the suspect...

450
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,791
Det. Lee, Seoul 32SA 2914.

451
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:33,875
Myeong-dong to Jongro!

452
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,625
Call me when you track it!

453
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:43,249
Made in the North?

454
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,958
Commonly known

455
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,583
bingdu.

456
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,499
Asshole, whether it's
Chinese or North Korean,

457
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,166
one large per kilo is too much!

458
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:56,958
It's not the fake shit that you get here,

459
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,749
it's the authentic,
genuine North Korean ice.

460
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:01,917
Look here.

461
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,166
You lived too long with the fake shit.

462
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:09,124
The dirty and ragged
defector has all grown up.

463
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,416
You're just a drug fiend chaser.

464
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,124
Give it to him.

465
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,625
Asshole.

466
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:24,875
Oh, yeah.

467
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,083
Let me know if you're in
the market for these.

468
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:32,874
I don't only deal drugs.

469
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,541
Lots of stuff.

470
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,625
Park Myung-ho.

471
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,125
Where's Cha Gi-sung?

472
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:50,250
Arm!

473
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,250
My arm!

474
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,167
Who are you?

475
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,000
Does this look fake?

476
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:02,458
It'll blow your head off.

477
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:11,833
Lim Cheol-ryung!

478
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,707
- Where?
- Itaewon!

479
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:17,708
Itaewon?

480
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,666
It's dangerous, go inside!

481
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,249
- Ha-young!
- Daddy!

482
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,083
Come here!

483
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:45,917
Ha-young!

484
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,166
- You okay?
- Daddy!

485
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:56,124
Look at this...

486
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,958
Lim Cheol-ryung!

487
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,124
Stop!

488
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,125
Goddammit!

489
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,375
I got a hit!

490
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:26,708
Dalian A257 on the 18th under
the alias 'Hwang Wui-wan.'

491
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,207
Search the exit gate.

492
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,249
Okay.

493
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,416
Check the car's owner.

494
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:42,667
Yes, sir.

495
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,458
Park's here, sir.

496
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Park Myung-ho reporting.

497
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:17,292
Aren't you sick of it? Stop saluting.

498
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,791
It's a free country.

499
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,041
The boat and weapons
will be ready tomorrow.

500
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:24,333
Good.

501
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,166
But we got a problem.

502
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:31,791
He must be from the homeland,
he's searching for you.

503
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,333
Probably from facility #5014.

504
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:36,916
There were two.

505
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,500
The South Korean called
him 'Lim Cheol-ryung.'

506
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,625
Have you gone mad?!

507
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:55,277
Why don't you tell the whole
world we're on a covert detail!

508
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:57,333
I could've gotten killed!

509
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,582
When I caught up to Lim,
he was in an action film.

510
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:04,166
Then a kid jumped out, and
she could've gotten killed!

511
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:06,041
- I jumped for her...
- Okay, forget it.

512
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:07,042
What about Park?

513
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,792
He fled, he was long gone.

514
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:13,542
You let him flee? You didn't interrogate?

515
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,750
You wanted me to do that?

516
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,750
I don't believe it...

517
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:22,457
We got Cha Gi-sung's dossier.

518
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,208
He's a North Korean officer.

519
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:29,167
Stay on Lim 24/7, don't
let him cause trouble!

520
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,666
That's a bit much...

521
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,500
No, take him home and sleep with him!

522
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:38,457
This could be an exile of a VIP.

523
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:42,958
Imagine what'd happen
if Lim finds him first?

524
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,333
And assassinates him
while on this joint detail?

525
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,125
We'd be so fucked.

526
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,875
Did you give him the phone?

527
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:55,958
He wants to use his.

528
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,457
What?

529
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,749
You should've given it to him!

530
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,500
He knows he'll be tracked!
How can I force him?!

531
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,250
Dammit...

532
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,042
Where's Lim?

533
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,583
Det. Lim?

534
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:25,125
I'm Det. Lee Dong-hoon.

535
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,792
I'm Det. Kang's partner.

536
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,583
In other words, we're on the same team.

537
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,291
Good to meet you.

538
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,250
Our countries may be divided,
but we share the same blood.

539
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,416
As a joint detail, we can
wrap this up nicely...

540
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:46,542
That'd be nice, wrapping it nicely.

541
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,795
- Nothing to report.
- It'd be weird, if you did.

542
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,041
Jesus.

543
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,541
Let's go out.

544
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,499
Come.

545
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,333
What will you do now?

546
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:00,666
Park's gone and no break on Cha.

547
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:03,416
Will you go door-to-door?

548
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:07,124
That'd only take 50 years.

549
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,332
If you had not interfered,
I could've had him.

550
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,833
Come on.

551
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:14,583
This way.

552
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:18,416
You lost the suspect,
and terrorized the streets.

553
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,042
How's that a covert op? Get in.

554
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:32,958
Your legs, please.

555
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:36,458
I'll hop over, move your legs.

556
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,083
Spread them a bit.

557
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,541
Too much!

558
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:45,583
Legs together...

559
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:57,749
Hold on...

560
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,375
I'm getting sweaty.

561
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,041
Holy cow...

562
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,541
When will this day ever end?

563
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:17,958
Detective, this is hard for me too.

564
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:21,082
Can't we trust each other?

565
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,457
We're partners for a little while.

566
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,874
We have to catch Cha together.

567
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,125
We can triangulate him right away.

568
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:32,207
Don't underestimate the power of our reach.

569
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,666
If you find him, let me know first.

570
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,291
If you do that,

571
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,083
I'll follow South Korean
investigation rules.

572
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,624
That's what I'll do.

573
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:46,792
Uncuff me.

574
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,791
And run off on your own?

575
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,625
I want to trust our joint detail.

576
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:59,042
I got so much shit from
the top because of you.

577
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,541
Let's stop being so formal.

578
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:07,042
I noticed that you're
much younger than I am.

579
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:11,832
I usually share a drink and become friends.

580
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,374
Let's do that, okay?

581
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:16,208
Alright.

582
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:18,666
That was unexpectedly easy.

583
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,416
Very good.

584
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:24,291
As a commemoration of our
new friendship, here.

585
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:27,167
Show me your leg.

586
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:31,417
Very nice.

587
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,124
That device is,

588
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:40,250
it's a discreet sign that
you're a detective here.

589
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,041
Isn't this a GPS tracker?

590
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,374
There is a small function like that.

591
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:49,875
How do I explain this?

592
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:52,958
Let's say you arrive at a crime scene.

593
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,166
You can't tell who's who.

594
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:58,832
Then a man comes over and asks who you are.

595
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,124
Me? Take a look.

596
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,374
You're a detective?

597
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,332
Yes, I am. And you?

598
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,874
Then you show him yours.

599
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,832
You're a detective too? Great work here.

600
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:14,124
We are one, we are comrades.

601
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,707
That's what that represents, okay?

602
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,583
Then where's yours?

603
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:23,582
Mine's being charged. I wear it everyday.

604
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,666
Allow me.

605
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:28,832
I will gladly accept, thank you.

606
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,583
I'll return the favor.

607
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,666
- Take a shot.
- I'm okay.

608
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:36,958
Have just one drink.

609
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:43,167
Since we're on this detail,
it's game over for bad guys.

610
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,124
If I catch Cha, what'll you do for me?

611
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:49,625
What would you like?

612
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,916
Let me think, anything in the world?

613
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,917
Give me just $100k.

614
00:42:56,167 --> 00:43:00,667
I can send my kid to a private prep
school, marry my sis-in-law off,

615
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:04,582
and give the rest to my wife,

616
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:08,166
and say buy a bigger
house, what do you think?

617
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:13,375
That's a chump change for slaving
a Southern cop for 3 days.

618
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:17,416
Do you know what my wage is?

619
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,583
You'll be shocked to hear it.

620
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:26,125
After taxes, about $38,000.

621
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:30,333
Divide that by 12,

622
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,874
then it's about $3,000.

623
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:35,208
Divide that by 30,

624
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:41,041
damn it! That's like minimum wages!

625
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:43,083
Good evening, ma'am.

626
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,707
Honey, we got a guest.

627
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,791
Come in, come in, he's my new partner.

628
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:53,167
Handsome, right?

629
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,499
He hasn't got a room yet.

630
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,166
So I told him he could
stay with us for a bit.

631
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:03,208
He insisted that we buy something you like,

632
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,125
so he got fried chicken.

633
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:07,375
This is my wife!

634
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,374
And my Princess.

635
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:12,832
How was your day?

636
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:13,999
Whose daughter?

637
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,708
Mom's, of course.

638
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:16,041
When will you become mine?

639
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,832
Say hello to Mr. Lim.

640
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,499
Good evening.

641
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:26,124
- Hello there.
- What is it?

642
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,375
You could've got him a motel.

643
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,249
Dumb! And dumber!

644
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,791
He can hear you.

645
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:36,124
You can't talk about him
when he's standing here.

646
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,000
So what?

647
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:43,791
Come inside, come!

648
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,417
It's okay, come in.

649
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,166
We live like this.

650
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:50,167
I'm the head of this family,
make yourself at home.

651
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,875
Says who?!

652
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:54,041
You're being rude to our guest!

653
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:56,125
That woman...

654
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,666
She's got a sharp tongue, but she's kind.

655
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:01,042
Please come in, it's okay.

656
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,458
I wouldn't have invited you otherwise.

657
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,333
He's so hot...

658
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:21,958
Is he in there?

659
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,291
Yeah, why?

660
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:28,042
What, what?!

661
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:31,773
He's not getting the master bedroom!

662
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:04,208
You can sleep here, it's Yeon-ah's room.

663
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,957
I hope it's not too uncomfortable.

664
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,999
If you need anything, please let me know.

665
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:14,792
This is my room.

666
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:18,583
Have a good night.

667
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:41,499
Once we locate Cha,

668
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,832
I'll abandon the detail and go dark.

669
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:46,499
<i>Remember, you got 48 hours left.</i>

670
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,416
<i>If you can't secure the
plates, destroy them.</i>

671
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,250
I will risk my life for this mission.

672
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:00,916
I hope you like it, I made this for you.

673
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:02,917
Please try it.

674
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,874
Do you have any favorites?

675
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:09,582
If you have any requests,
feel free to let me know.

676
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,749
Listen to her.

677
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:15,541
I've never seen you cook
anything in the last 3 years.

678
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,125
He's a guest, sis.

679
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,332
I hope it's to your liking.

680
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,249
Don't worry, I'm not a picky eater.

681
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:24,708
North Korean?

682
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:32,042
He defected because it's
hard to live there.

683
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,666
He's a North Korean cop, so be nice to him.

684
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:37,582
Yeon-ah, eat this.

685
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,166
Whose daughter?

686
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:40,417
Mom's.

687
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:44,042
Good girl.

688
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:48,832
Huh, it's for him?

689
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,291
So kind.

690
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,666
It'd be nice to give me some too.

691
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:53,833
You eat plenty.

692
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,166
Please dig in.

693
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,624
No need for back and forth,

694
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,999
there's enough food in the South.

695
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,375
So insensitive.

696
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:06,083
Who starves to death nowadays.

697
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:08,999
Get with the times, go read some papers.

698
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,832
There are plenty.

699
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,999
Don't mind your brother-in-law.

700
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:14,666
What?

701
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:16,499
He's right here.

702
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,916
- Don't mind him.
- Don't listen to him.

703
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:20,457
Daddy's bad.

704
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:21,791
- Bad!
- So bad!

705
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,874
Not all North Koreans are starving.

706
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:25,250
It depends on the person.

707
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:29,749
He's not the starving kind,
look at his perfect skin.

708
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,874
Huh?

709
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,832
Allow me to apologize on his behalf.

710
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:34,249
He's like that.

711
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:36,957
Stop staring at him, eat your breakfast.

712
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:38,291
Go on, eat.

713
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,166
- Please eat.
- We need to go.

714
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,375
Have some.

715
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:43,042
Go ahead.

716
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,125
My wife is a great cook.

717
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:49,541
Boss, we got the car owner.

718
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:50,791
I'll call you back.

719
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:51,625
Go on.

720
00:48:51,626 --> 00:48:53,166
His name is Jang Sung-tae,

721
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,624
COO of DS holdings.

722
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:55,416
DS holdings?

723
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:58,207
Yes, it's a sister company
of DS Resort and Hotel.

724
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:00,666
CEO Yoon Dae-hyub is a Chinese migrant,

725
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:03,125
and he's known as the
Korean boss of the Triad.

726
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,292
Put our men on Yoon and Jang.

727
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,791
Report when they contact Cha.

728
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:22,874
How do you like free life?

729
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,583
Are you comfortable here?

730
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,666
I sleep and eat well as a free man.

731
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:31,499
If you have the money,
freedom can easily be bought.

732
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:36,791
Left and right wings don't really exist.

733
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:40,291
But there is top and bottom,
those with and without.

734
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:43,417
Let's cut the chitchat,
and get to the point.

735
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,458
Come on, this doesn't prove shit.

736
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:53,541
I have to see the plates printing the cash.

737
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:56,749
We're not dealing petty sum here.

738
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:00,208
Let's see what the plates can do.

739
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:03,749
We gotta make sure it's genuine as well.

740
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:05,583
What do you take me for?

741
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:08,667
Counterfeit detection has
advanced quite a bit.

742
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:12,582
We need specialists and equipment too.

743
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:14,708
I don't have a lot of time.

744
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,625
I just need 2 days.

745
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:19,958
Whether we verify or not is up to you.

746
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:23,333
But this deal is up to me.

747
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,500
You got balls.

748
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,541
Motherfucker.

749
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,458
Mr. Yoon,

750
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:40,416
I betrayed my country,

751
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:44,875
my family and my youth for these plates.

752
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:49,833
Do you want my organs too?

753
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:53,458
You worked so hard, you
deserve to get paid.

754
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,291
I'm the only one who has
the resources anyway.

755
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:01,374
Right.

756
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,499
Then I shall wait.

757
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,041
You get 24 hours.

758
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:11,458
Bring your specialists,
and whatever you need.

759
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:14,583
We'll meet back here
tomorrow with the plates.

760
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,749
Very wise.

761
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,416
But you also get a warning.

762
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,583
If you fuck around, I will kill you.

763
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,250
Rewind, please.

764
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:29,250
Stop!

765
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:31,333
Where is that man going?

766
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,250
To the basement.

767
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,207
What's there?

768
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,458
A duty-free shop, but it's not open yet.

769
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,374
- Duty-free shop?
- Yes.

770
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,083
- Thank you.
- No problem.

771
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:44,833
We can't barge in without evidence.

772
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,624
Park is carrying a different bag.

773
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:50,500
That can happen, so what?

774
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:52,333
What?

775
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:04,791
Down here, suspects are
innocent until proven guilty,

776
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,582
so they're free until he's convicted.

777
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,749
You have to follow our laws.

778
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,875
I'm not a Southern detective.

779
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:18,917
So I have to take point
to make things legit.

780
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,749
Good day.

781
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,082
Let me ask you something.

782
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,083
What is it?

783
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:29,207
We're here for Park Myung-ho,
he was here around 3 PM yesterday.

784
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:30,249
You know him, right?

785
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,000
The one with fat head and weird hair.

786
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:39,083
We saw him on security
cams, so don't pretend...

787
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:41,208
Why is he here?

788
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:42,292
Buddy!

789
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:45,249
Knife swinger, you know me, come over here.

790
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,375
- Goddammit!
- Come here!

791
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,500
Get back here, asshole!

792
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,832
Boss, it's bad!

793
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,457
Over here!

794
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:55,541
Boss, boss. That hurts!

795
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:56,832
It really hurts!

796
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,666
What is this place?

797
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:04,082
What's going on here?

798
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:07,457
The government granted you
to setup an honest shop,

799
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:10,333
aren't these all fakes?

800
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:12,958
Yo, who are you?

801
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:15,250
Are you the boss here?

802
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,749
I'd like to ask you for your cooperation.

803
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,125
Do you know Park Myung-ho?

804
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:23,375
Did you bring a warrant?

805
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:26,958
It's being mailed out,
but we can talk it over.

806
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:30,125
You skipped due process
and came without one?

807
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,749
You got shit for common sense.

808
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,083
Mr. Po-po.

809
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:38,957
Are we already starting
off on the wrong foot?

810
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:39,958
Det. Lim,

811
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:43,625
do I deserve this kind of treatment...

812
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,625
Is this real?

813
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:49,026
Don't joke around and give it back.

814
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,082
Give it, asshole!

815
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:53,957
- Give it back!
- You got no power here.

816
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:56,624
You can't do shit without a warrant.

817
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,374
Where's Park?

818
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,957
You got a way with that suit.

819
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,083
I won't ask twice.

820
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:09,124
You got terrible manners.

821
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,458
What if I don't talk?

822
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,582
Obstruction of justice
is an applicable law.

823
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,624
If you do not cooperate with the law...

824
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,750
We can take appropriate action.

825
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:24,583
Boss!

826
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,124
A detective

827
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:30,791
is not a po-po, but an official
who carries out the law.

828
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:33,374
You must treat him accordingly.

829
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:23,791
Bastards...

830
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,458
Is that toilet paper?

831
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:32,208
Back home, toilet paper isn't a weapon.

832
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:37,333
No one will look at it
as such down here too.

833
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:40,875
How did you...

834
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:44,541
They were coming at me,
it was self-defense.

835
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:47,583
Yeah, you had that right, but this is...

836
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,250
Park's number is on it, track his location.

837
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,083
Chief.

838
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:01,624
Can you drop me from this detail?

839
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:04,333
Do you know what happened just now?

840
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:09,207
Lim knocked out a bunch of huge henchmen

841
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:13,333
with a roll of toilet paper, in a flash.

842
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,541
What?

843
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,250
The Triad?

844
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:22,500
DS Holdings is a corporate gang,

845
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:27,124
and Cha got in touch with
them after landing here.

846
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:28,916
- <i>Seriously?</i>
- Yeah.

847
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:33,292
Did you really plant a
bug in Lim's cell phone?

848
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,249
I did!

849
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,666
<i>Then how come we get no signal?</i>

850
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:40,417
How should I know?

851
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,000
Jin-tae.

852
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,416
Let's solve this first.

853
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:51,166
Why Cha defected, the Triad and his goal.

854
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:55,124
<i>We could be getting
so much more than a promotion.</i>

855
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:59,082
<i>Leech some intel from Lim,
even the agency is clueless.</i>

856
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,249
I got it, sir.

857
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,708
Okay, listen, I got Park's location.

858
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,541
Yeongdeungpo district, 66 Dosin St.

859
00:57:06,542 --> 00:57:07,666
<i>We're on our way too.</i>

860
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,957
<i>When you get Park, hand him over,</i>

861
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:11,208
<i>we'll interrogate him.</i>

862
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:19,458
<i>Due to low unemployment rate,
more youths are relying on...</i>

863
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,625
Sis, what's Jin-tae's salary?

864
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:27,332
After taxes, insurance, just over $30,000.

865
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,457
- $30,000?
- Yeah.

866
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:30,582
That's it?

867
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:32,457
What do you mean?

868
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:34,749
We live off that, and
paid for your college.

869
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:38,750
Career men with $100k+
salary are lining up for me,

870
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:43,583
it's a step back to marry
a cop with $30k income.

871
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:46,416
A major downgrade, right?

872
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,625
Did he propose to you?

873
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:50,874
If I want to, of course he will.

874
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:52,375
Sis, I'm Park Min-young.

875
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,541
So what?

876
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,875
You're just a freeloader.

877
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,999
Where did you get that dress from earlier?

878
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,791
I lost count because of you!

879
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:04,457
Focus on getting a job and moving out.

880
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,749
Whatever! Stop!

881
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,583
Not whatever!

882
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,125
So why does he have to be so hot?
I can't decide.

883
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:12,957
Why are you so fixated on looks?

884
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:15,791
And you really weren't. I was so shocked.

885
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:21,124
I was shocked too, almost fatal, right?

886
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:23,707
Totally fatal.

887
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:28,208
<i>...crashed into a truck,
it was a dangerous scene.</i>

888
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:30,166
<i>Their reckless brawl was...</i>

889
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:31,458
It's him!

890
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:33,666
Sis, sis!

891
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:35,250
Isn't that Cheol-ryung?

892
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,207
<i>...even engaging in a fist fight...</i>

893
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,416
Look, look...

894
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:45,332
Jesus Christ! No way!

895
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:46,957
Don't even think about it!

896
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,541
He's so hot!

897
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:53,042
Seriously! Are you nuts?

898
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,124
The magazine won't fit in properly.

899
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:02,791
Please wait here.

900
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:05,583
Park could have another exit route.

901
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,041
No way, how could I trust...

902
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:14,458
Goddammit...

903
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:18,124
Not that I don't trust you,

904
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:21,750
it's better to move as a team.

905
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:28,833
Welcome.

906
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:31,000
Hello there.

907
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,375
Is this it?

908
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,582
What is it?

909
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:54,083
I'm a cop.

910
00:59:55,542 --> 00:59:58,208
So damn smokey...

911
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:00,333
What's this place?

912
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,333
- Let's move.
- Lieutenant.

913
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:26,749
Can't I just live down here for good?

914
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:32,042
I made all preparations,
got the guns and the boat.

915
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,458
I don't need my cut,

916
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:40,292
so please tell the captain for me.

917
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:55,750
Hey!

918
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,041
Who are you?

919
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:00,833
What?

920
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:03,458
Who are you?

921
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,416
Are you the boss here? Who are you?

922
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:09,624
Why are you here?

923
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:13,041
I'm looking for Park Myung-ho.

924
01:01:13,042 --> 01:01:15,333
Out, get out.

925
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,916
Look at these guys...

926
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:24,999
Lim, they're underestimating you.

927
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,541
You should teach...

928
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:28,750
Hey, Cheol-ryung!

929
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:30,708
Cheol-ryung!

930
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:31,875
Cheol-ryung!

931
01:01:31,876 --> 01:01:33,832
Don't come any closer!

932
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,291
You could die...

933
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:37,417
Dammit...

934
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:39,249
Wait, wait!

935
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,374
There's one of me, and 2, 3 of you...

936
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,541
Wait! Stay back!

937
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:52,458
You got a death wish?!

938
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,500
How did he do this?

939
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:03,875
Dammit!

940
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,291
Come here!

941
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:21,542
Come at me!

942
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:28,125
<i>Can't risk a traitor.</i>

943
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,124
Please...

944
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:44,833
I took care of Park.

945
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,166
And Lim?

946
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:52,875
Speak of the devil.

947
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,125
Comrade, answer.

948
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,166
<i>Cheol-ryung?</i>

949
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:06,833
You really found Park.

950
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,375
<i>You shoulda let it go when I spared you.</i>

951
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:17,458
I kept you alive since we go a long way.

952
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:20,957
But you came here to catch me?

953
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:23,124
That's regrettable.

954
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,666
Shut up and wait.

955
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,957
I'll end you with my own hands.

956
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:28,083
<i>What a shame.</i>

957
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,208
You're standing on your grave.

958
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,166
It's not my fault, rest in peace.

959
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:20,000
Cheol-ryung!

960
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:42,916
Who was that bastard?

961
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,208
Secure 1st and 2nd floors!

962
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:53,124
How did he die?

963
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:58,083
Evidence and warrants
are all pointless now.

964
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:01,417
Did you get shot?

965
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:05,417
Like hell I did, I'd be dead.

966
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:10,792
Shit, I got slashed.

967
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:18,833
Out of the way, move please.

968
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,416
What's all this?

969
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:26,666
Where's Kang Jin-tae?

970
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:28,958
Det. Kang!

971
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,125
What is it? What?

972
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,041
- Chief!
- Come here!

973
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,624
Come here, you bastard!

974
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:43,124
This is a covert op.

975
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:46,166
People cannot know about this.
Look at that crowd.

976
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,541
Listen.

977
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:54,666
I'll report this situation
to the Chief myself.

978
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:57,875
That's all you need to know.

979
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,458
This is Park's cell phone.

980
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,374
Extract all his 4-day locations from this.

981
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,749
Then give me a call.

982
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,958
Don't make mistakes like
last time, got it?!

983
01:06:07,292 --> 01:06:08,667
Okay, covert op...

984
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,708
Let's go.

985
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:12,416
Det. Kang!

986
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,291
- Blood!
- It's okay, I'm fine.

987
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:16,250
Shouldn't you go to the ER?

988
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:19,375
It's okay, it's part of being a cop.

989
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,291
How do I tell my wife about this?

990
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:36,917
Are you okay?

991
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:40,583
Of course not, it hurts like a bitch.

992
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:44,124
How could you do that to me?

993
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:48,082
They were coming at me,
and you took off without me.

994
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:49,708
We don't have each other's backs?

995
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:53,083
I'm disappointed, you unloyal bastard.

996
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,374
Anyway, that big guy who killed Park,

997
01:06:58,375 --> 01:06:59,500
that's not Cha, right?

998
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:05,999
Goddammit...

999
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:11,124
If I ask you something, answer me for once!

1000
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,666
I'm risking my life for this detail!

1001
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,166
Forget it! Whatever!

1002
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,707
Screw this joint detail.

1003
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:19,708
He's Cha's man.

1004
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:22,500
You probably knew Cha was a soldier.

1005
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,333
How many men does he have?

1006
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,000
I don't know.

1007
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:30,917
His squad consisted of a dozen or so men,

1008
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:34,833
and if his Mercs got involved...

1009
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:41,416
Lim Cheol-ryung.

1010
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:49,042
What the hell is happening
here in the South?

1011
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:54,375
Why'd a Northern officer
come here with his men?

1012
01:07:56,458 --> 01:08:00,124
I tell you everything, but not you.

1013
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:03,708
It's hard to maintain this
detail if you stay quiet.

1014
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:07,707
Who is Cha and why is he here?

1015
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:12,208
Why are you so desperate
to catch this bastard?!

1016
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:16,166
Some time ago, he killed
a Squad of Censors.

1017
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,083
And?

1018
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:23,583
They were like my family.

1019
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,125
The men in the picture...

1020
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,625
We were supposed to standby,

1021
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,166
but because of me...

1022
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:36,208
Because of you?

1023
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:42,666
As if terrorizing the streets
weren't enough, now murder?

1024
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:45,333
I told you to catch Park, not kill him.

1025
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:48,374
We didn't do it.

1026
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,541
<i>We? Who's we?</i>

1027
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:52,832
You and Lim and you and I?

1028
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,958
Are you guys dating now?

1029
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:58,041
Fine, if not you, then who?

1030
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:00,999
Cha's not alone, he has soldiers.

1031
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
<i>What?</i>

1032
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:04,666
Park's smuggled weapons
must've ended up there.

1033
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:08,082
<i>Then he has at least 10 men with him.</i>

1034
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:09,416
Did you get that from Lim?

1035
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,499
Yeah.

1036
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:13,791
<i>So what's Cha's end goal?</i>

1037
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:15,625
<i>He doesn't know, that's all I got.</i>

1038
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:19,167
<i>How could he not? Leech more intel.</i>

1039
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,832
<i>I'm not a fucking blood-sucker!</i>

1040
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,499
Anyway, recover Park's cell phone...

1041
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,208
What's your area of expertise?

1042
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:46,542
Violent...

1043
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,708
BDSM, I see.

1044
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:52,708
Cosplay for me.

1045
01:09:56,458 --> 01:10:00,958
Wanna know how you could free
yourself from the ankle bracelet?

1046
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:07,582
Help me! Please!

1047
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,374
My arm's gonna break!

1048
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,166
He must be a cop too.

1049
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:22,125
Dammit...

1050
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:25,374
You said you didn't hide anything from me.

1051
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,166
I'm really sorry.

1052
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:29,916
You didn't want to take my cell phone,

1053
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:32,208
I can get worried if I can't find you.

1054
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:36,207
What if you get in trouble
in a foreign land?

1055
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,749
I was just worried.

1056
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:41,666
Listen.

1057
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,583
I can't seem to cut it.

1058
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,041
Okay, I'll try again.

1059
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:50,833
Anything can be cut.

1060
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,791
Here we go! Come on!

1061
01:10:56,292 --> 01:10:57,083
I got it!

1062
01:10:57,292 --> 01:10:59,583
I barely cut that thing off.

1063
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:04,374
I have to return it, idiot!

1064
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:06,666
Holy cow, that was tough.

1065
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,874
Where are you going?!

1066
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:10,749
Come home with me!

1067
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,875
Cheol-ryung! Cheol-ryung!

1068
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,624
Who kicked your butt?

1069
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,666
Go easy, that stings.

1070
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:21,292
Stay put.

1071
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,832
Stop, that's enough. It's just a bruise.

1072
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:26,708
At attention, come back!

1073
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,875
You dumbass!

1074
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:33,082
Seriously...

1075
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:34,999
Don't be a crybaby.

1076
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,292
You pinched too hard.

1077
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:41,583
Give me your face.

1078
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:44,166
Come here!

1079
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,707
It's okay, enough.

1080
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,666
I've told you before.

1081
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:53,958
If you get stabbed again, we are finished.

1082
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:56,833
So I don't go around getting stabbed.

1083
01:11:58,375 --> 01:11:59,416
Hey.

1084
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,457
Why do you get beaten up?

1085
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:04,249
You're not doing God's work.

1086
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,999
Bad guys won't go extinct
because of what you do.

1087
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,291
Are you burning with passion?
Your child is 9 years old!

1088
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:13,000
Okay, that's enough.

1089
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,208
Mister.

1090
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:18,625
You're a cop like dad, right?

1091
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:21,749
You must fight really well.

1092
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:26,458
Do you shoot bad men with guns like him?

1093
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,042
Right.

1094
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,458
Strip.

1095
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:33,708
What?

1096
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:36,791
I mean, roll up your sleeve.

1097
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:38,500
Look at this hand...

1098
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:39,583
No need.

1099
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,583
It looks bad...

1100
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,000
How could you say that with these hands?

1101
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:51,208
Your salary is low but I
hate seeing you get hurt.

1102
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:54,750
If you get married, will
you live in the South?

1103
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:58,042
I'm sure you don't have much,
but I'll overlook that.

1104
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,000
Have a girl.

1105
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:07,375
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

1106
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:08,917
My God...

1107
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:11,167
So embarrassing!

1108
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,625
I'm sorry.

1109
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,499
Do you love her?

1110
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:59,167
Of course, I love her.

1111
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,416
Come on...

1112
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:02,583
Go to bed!

1113
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:20,292
<i>They were like my family.</i>

1114
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:24,458
<i>We were supposed to standby,
but because of me...</i>

1115
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:28,791
He thinks he's so cool...

1116
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,083
<i>PARK MYUNG-HO</i>

1117
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:03,125
Good work.

1118
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:07,292
I'll reward you all for your contribution.

1119
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:12,041
Once we complete this mission,
we will achieve freedom for good.

1120
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:14,917
Fight to your death.

1121
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:17,583
We got something.

1122
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,250
It came from Park's body.

1123
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,667
<i>After the 3-day ministerial talk, the
Northern delegation is returning...</i>

1124
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:30,667
You scared me.

1125
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,125
Did you get any sleep?

1126
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,708
Do you only have 1 suit?

1127
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,625
Come out here!

1128
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,541
Park's phone was recovered,
let's get to it.

1129
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:51,707
Looks good, I loved that jacket.

1130
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:52,624
Have some breakfast.

1131
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:54,458
There's no time, we have to go.

1132
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:55,958
Then throw it out!

1133
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,124
Dammit...

1134
01:15:58,125 --> 01:15:59,957
Okay, let's eat a bit.

1135
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:02,332
- We'll eat fast.
- Did you dress up for him?

1136
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:05,916
- So embarrassing.
- Give it!

1137
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,083
What's with off-season food?

1138
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,208
This doesn't look normal.

1139
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,541
It's North Korean style.

1140
01:16:17,167 --> 01:16:20,166
North Korean? Because of him?

1141
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:22,832
It looked like he had no appetite.

1142
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:23,957
Give it a try.

1143
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:25,999
- Go on.
- It's good.

1144
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:29,249
- Come on, eat.
- I hope you like it.

1145
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:36,708
I looked up the recipe
online and made it myself.

1146
01:16:38,042 --> 01:16:39,333
- Is that true?
- Do you like it?

1147
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:40,917
It's great.

1148
01:16:40,918 --> 01:16:43,332
Is that so? I'm so glad!

1149
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:44,999
- Have plenty.
- You liar.

1150
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,250
Auntie, mom made that.

1151
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,583
Hey!

1152
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:51,458
- My baby!
- Come here, honey.

1153
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:53,832
You want some?

1154
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,999
- Don't sit on him!
- I'll eat later.

1155
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,874
He's uncomfortable, sit on your seat.

1156
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,416
- Daddy?
- Yes, baby?

1157
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:04,208
Where's my iPhone?

1158
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:05,916
- I'll buy it.
- When?

1159
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:08,041
- When? Tomorrow?
- Okay, deal.

1160
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:10,499
- Don't get her hopes up!
- Why not?

1161
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,499
It doesn't cost much, I'll really buy it.

1162
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,583
- No, she doesn't need it.
- Please eat.

1163
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:19,499
<i>Chief Pyo: Your phone's bugged</i>

1164
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:27,999
Is it okay?

1165
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,624
Finish up, I'll get the car started.

1166
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:32,458
Why? Have some more.

1167
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:35,500
You haven't finished.

1168
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:37,583
Finish your meal.

1169
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,707
It's okay, please.

1170
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:41,833
Have some more.

1171
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:53,874
Wait, wait!

1172
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,332
Wait!

1173
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,624
Det. Lim?

1174
01:17:56,792 --> 01:18:00,208
Can I be informal with you?

1175
01:18:00,792 --> 01:18:02,125
You already are.

1176
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:04,792
Is that so?

1177
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:11,583
I don't know what you do
to come back with bruises,

1178
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,458
and I know you won't answer me.

1179
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:20,542
Please look after my husband.

1180
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:23,916
He's stubborn, so my nagging doesn't work.

1181
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:28,541
Take on difficult work in his stead.

1182
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:31,207
You're still single, so
you may not get it...

1183
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,832
Sis, you're too much!

1184
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,291
Your husband is important
but not someone else's?

1185
01:18:35,292 --> 01:18:36,875
Whose?

1186
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,000
There must be someone, I'm sure.

1187
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:44,167
Anyway, take care of him.

1188
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:49,542
He may be an idiot, but he's all we've got.

1189
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:52,875
I understand.

1190
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:07,916
<i>It's called 'supernote', the
plates can print fake cash,</i>

1191
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:11,291
<i>and Cha's negotiating
with the triads over it.</i>

1192
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:13,667
- Meet up location?
- <i>DS Resort.</i>

1193
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:16,333
Did you track Cha's location?

1194
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,916
Not yet.

1195
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:21,791
- Park's phone...
- Tell me, I know you do.

1196
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:24,292
- I don't.
- Tell me at once!

1197
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Gonna hit me?

1198
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,583
- Tell me.
- I don't know!

1199
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:36,541
Even if I did, I wouldn't
tell you, asshole.

1200
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:39,167
You planted a bug on your partner.

1201
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:41,582
No wonder my gramps always said,

1202
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:43,499
all North Koreans are commies.

1203
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:46,416
You people couldn't be
trusted, even back then.

1204
01:19:46,542 --> 01:19:49,708
3rd generation dictatorship
really messed things up.

1205
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,125
They're starving people to death.

1206
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:56,792
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

1207
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,499
Do you know what the South's debt is?

1208
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,207
I dunno, enlighten me.

1209
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:03,332
Even the ability to get loan is a skill.

1210
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:05,874
Better than having so many people starve.

1211
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:08,041
At least we are all poor equally.

1212
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:10,125
What a load of shit.

1213
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:15,125
Is it fair that your leader
burns cash head over fist?

1214
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,291
Don't insult the Republic!

1215
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:20,723
But I did, so what, are you gonna hit me?

1216
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:22,124
Okay, fine.

1217
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:24,833
I'll park here to make it easy for you.

1218
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:33,624
Let's be honest.

1219
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:35,708
You're here for the
supernote plates, right?

1220
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:40,125
But you told me you're here
to avenge your comrades.

1221
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,791
How could you lie through your teeth?

1222
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:49,958
I believed your lies,

1223
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,541
and I almost helped you out, asshole.

1224
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:56,000
I've never lied.

1225
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,583
Forget it.

1226
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,666
- Please help.
- How can I trust you?

1227
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:10,792
If you help me catch Cha,
I'll give the plates.

1228
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:13,458
I promise you.

1229
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:18,958
I know it's a lot,

1230
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,792
please help me.

1231
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:26,250
I'm begging you, comrade.

1232
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:09,928
We should standby, the support will arrive.

1233
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:18,750
What are you looking for?

1234
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:22,457
Us two can't face an entire platoon.

1235
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:23,916
Not us, I'm going alone.

1236
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:25,125
What?

1237
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:27,750
They're ex-special forces
who fought in wars.

1238
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,458
They're not like your spineless units.

1239
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,375
If you want to live, stay back here.

1240
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:41,166
Not quite $100k.

1241
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,291
What is it?

1242
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,500
Buy Yeon-ah an iPhone.

1243
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:48,916
Yankee stuff aren't good for children,

1244
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,749
but at least live with some class.

1245
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,125
What do you mean by that?

1246
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,208
Thanks for everything.

1247
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:15,667
So the plates are verified,
let's get to the deal.

1248
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,458
I've been thinking,

1249
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:22,666
the tech is mine, and so are
printing and distribution.

1250
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:27,250
For that reason, the plates are overpriced.

1251
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:32,583
Let's meet half way, $5 million.

1252
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:47,166
Got any coke? Give me a can.

1253
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,249
The partners cannot be more than 10m apart.

1254
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,250
Rule #3, did you forget?

1255
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:14,499
The joint detail isn't done.

1256
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,416
Down there?

1257
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:24,541
You got a plan?

1258
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:26,042
Place a call, with the video.

1259
01:24:26,417 --> 01:24:29,417
010-2335-6972, that's my number.

1260
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:30,750
What will you do?

1261
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:37,417
Took you long enough.

1262
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:39,916
Answer it.

1263
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,500
That feels good.

1264
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,875
I missed this whenever
I returned home from overseas.

1265
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:07,750
My people must taste
the sweetness of capitalism.

1266
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:15,541
$10 million isn't nearly enough.

1267
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:20,167
Make it $20 million.

1268
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:23,875
What?

1269
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,666
No? Then $30 million.

1270
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:40,333
The clock's ticking as you hesitate.

1271
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,375
$40 million.

1272
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,458
This is a highway robbery!

1273
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:58,708
I told you not to fuck around.

1274
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:10,458
I didn't come here to make a deal.

1275
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:13,374
I'll transfer $10 million
as we originally agreed...

1276
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:14,583
No need.

1277
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:17,333
I'll print my own money.

1278
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,375
Grab the plates.

1279
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:27,249
What will you do? Hey! Hey!

1280
01:26:58,542 --> 01:27:00,208
You really came.

1281
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:04,542
Good to see you alive.

1282
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:10,916
Must we break things whenever we meet?

1283
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:29,750
Time's up, let's go.

1284
01:27:31,792 --> 01:27:32,792
Take cover!

1285
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:46,417
What the hell was that?

1286
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:50,542
You okay?

1287
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:54,250
So that asshole's Cha?

1288
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:56,125
That's right.

1289
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:10,417
See you at the pier.

1290
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:44,249
It missed the heart,

1291
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,958
you'll live with first aid.

1292
01:28:48,542 --> 01:28:49,750
Dong-hoon!

1293
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,333
Det. Kang.

1294
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:54,458
It's okay, you'll live.

1295
01:28:55,542 --> 01:28:57,083
Officer down, Sector C, parking!

1296
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:58,833
Send ambulance!

1297
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:01,958
Part of the being a cop.

1298
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:05,624
I won't die, please go after him.

1299
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:08,458
Go and catch Cha.

1300
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:12,457
Put pressure on it.

1301
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:13,999
Keep an eye on him.

1302
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Yes, sir.

1303
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:17,916
Dong-hoon!

1304
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:19,250
Hurry, hurry!

1305
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:26,707
<i>Route 2330, Songdo-bound,
getaway car found.</i>

1306
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,374
<i>Any nearby units?</i>

1307
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,499
This is D-1, we're on our way, over.

1308
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:35,875
<i>Kang, you bastard!</i>

1309
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,332
Return to the station at once.

1310
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:42,499
<i>I told you Lim can't go there
over and over again!</i>

1311
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:46,458
What exactly is the reason?

1312
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:48,624
Because our joint detail will get exposed?

1313
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:50,791
Or lose the supernote to them?

1314
01:29:50,792 --> 01:29:53,208
It's out of our hands.

1315
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:55,458
The detail is finished!

1316
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:58,332
You said to suck his blood for intel.

1317
01:29:58,333 --> 01:30:01,332
You couldn't stand the
suits running all over us.

1318
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:04,332
Jin-tae, what's with you?

1319
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:07,624
It's dangerous there. The suits are...

1320
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,832
<i>I'm with the agents.</i>

1321
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:11,832
Who gives a shit about them!

1322
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:14,166
Det. Kang, Suit here.

1323
01:30:14,167 --> 01:30:17,333
As of now, we have the jurisdiction.

1324
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:19,375
Stop where you are and turn him around.

1325
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:23,125
Why do I have to?! You saw yourself too!

1326
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:27,750
<i>He shot a cop in broad daylight!</i>

1327
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:30,874
<i>Who cares about South and North?!</i>

1328
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:34,249
Okay, fine.

1329
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:35,875
Listen carefully, Det. Kang.

1330
01:30:36,042 --> 01:30:38,000
We're in a state of emergency.

1331
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:42,750
<i>We have to arrest Cha and
secure the plates at any cost.</i>

1332
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:45,917
<i>You need to prevent Lim from killing him.</i>

1333
01:30:46,417 --> 01:30:49,500
If need be, you can eliminate Lim.

1334
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:54,708
Goddammit!

1335
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:10,667
You promised, the plates are mine.

1336
01:31:11,625 --> 01:31:13,250
I meant, my country's.

1337
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:18,625
Let me do my duty, and
become a respected cop.

1338
01:31:21,417 --> 01:31:22,833
Take them.

1339
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:25,125
One more thing.

1340
01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:29,292
When we get Cha, will you kill him?

1341
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,708
I understand your situation,

1342
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:38,124
but revenge is not in our job description.

1343
01:31:38,917 --> 01:31:40,292
He must be arrested and punished.

1344
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,999
Nothing more, got it?

1345
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,083
I understand.

1346
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:46,041
Don't answer half-heartedly.

1347
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,208
I said I understand.

1348
01:31:51,292 --> 01:31:52,958
That's what being a cop is.

1349
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:03,958
There, that's him!

1350
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:16,750
Slow down.

1351
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,291
Hold the wheel.

1352
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,333
What?

1353
01:32:33,417 --> 01:32:34,417
Get close.

1354
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:20,624
Hey, Cheol-ryung!

1355
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,416
Stop, please.

1356
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:32,333
Why did you do it?

1357
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:36,999
Cheol-ryung.

1358
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:44,333
I didn't want to be a lapdog

1359
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:51,250
to the rotting heads of state
in the name of our people.

1360
01:34:52,833 --> 01:34:55,249
Do not taint the honor of our people.

1361
01:34:57,292 --> 01:35:01,792
You betrayed their trust to
be here for your revenge.

1362
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:07,333
Goddamn shit!

1363
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,500
Go on.

1364
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:19,125
Don't do it!

1365
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:27,958
What are you doing?!

1366
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,666
You can't, you'll die!

1367
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,000
Let go of me!

1368
01:35:36,792 --> 01:35:38,957
You're gonna shoot me?

1369
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:41,624
Answer me, will you?

1370
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,833
You promised, asshole.

1371
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,791
You said you won't kill him!

1372
01:35:48,792 --> 01:35:50,167
Cha Gi-sung!

1373
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,917
Killed my wife.

1374
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,999
This was in her belongings.

1375
01:36:41,583 --> 01:36:43,583
I thought you needed to know.

1376
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,458
Fuck.

1377
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:28,291
Before the cavalry arrives,

1378
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:32,458
take this.

1379
01:37:32,667 --> 01:37:36,708
This fell into the river with Cha.

1380
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:39,582
It's the only way for you to live.

1381
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:41,249
Doesn't matter if I die.

1382
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:42,291
You must.

1383
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:43,917
You have to live strong!

1384
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:52,458
Your wife in heaven will want that too.

1385
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,749
Cha jumped to his death.

1386
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:04,666
Even if he survived it,
I'll arrest him, so go.

1387
01:38:04,667 --> 01:38:05,958
Do you trust me?

1388
01:38:12,292 --> 01:38:13,292
Go on, go!

1389
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,000
Go, right now!

1390
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:54,958
Good work.

1391
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:57,166
You are a pride of the Republic.

1392
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,750
We have not recovered Cha's body.

1393
01:39:01,167 --> 01:39:02,291
If you give me some time...

1394
01:39:02,292 --> 01:39:05,542
The threat against the Republic
has been dealt with, return at once,

1395
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:08,666
that was the Chairman's last order.

1396
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:10,083
Forget Cha.

1397
01:39:10,292 --> 01:39:12,708
This marks the end of the joint detail.

1398
01:39:29,042 --> 01:39:31,000
Lend me your phone.

1399
01:39:42,667 --> 01:39:44,750
<i>Daddy, answer the phone!</i>

1400
01:39:45,083 --> 01:39:46,874
<i>Don't pretend to be busy!</i>

1401
01:39:47,625 --> 01:39:50,625
Daddy's on the way home.

1402
01:39:50,875 --> 01:39:52,749
- Baby, whose daughter?
- <i>Daddy...</i>

1403
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:54,416
<i>Daddy.</i>

1404
01:39:54,417 --> 01:39:57,207
- It's been a...
- <i>Daddy...</i>

1405
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:59,999
Are you crying, baby?

1406
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:03,833
<i>Look here.</i>

1407
01:40:04,542 --> 01:40:06,958
There's something I lost.

1408
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:10,791
I don't have it anymore,
it's already with...

1409
01:40:10,917 --> 01:40:12,917
I don't care if you have it or not.

1410
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:16,499
You got 2 hours.

1411
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:21,249
Bring the plates to Incheon
pier's power plant.

1412
01:40:23,542 --> 01:40:27,333
Then I promise your family will live.

1413
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:33,250
<i>If you get police support,
I will break that promise.</i>

1414
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,500
I'll tear your family to pieces.

1415
01:40:44,417 --> 01:40:47,791
Please just let my child go.

1416
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:51,083
- Yeon-ah!
- Mom!

1417
01:41:02,042 --> 01:41:03,375
<i>Cheol-ryung!</i>

1418
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:06,708
<i>Cha Gi-sung...</i>

1419
01:41:07,708 --> 01:41:09,958
took my wife and Yeon-ah.

1420
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:15,375
<i>He wants the plates by 9 at
Incheon pier's power plant.</i>

1421
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:20,375
Or they'll kill them both.

1422
01:41:22,458 --> 01:41:24,708
<i>Cheol-ryung, please help.</i>

1423
01:41:24,917 --> 01:41:27,417
<i>Please don't let them
kill Yeon-ah, please.</i>

1424
01:41:39,042 --> 01:41:40,042
Leave us.

1425
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:46,792
Comrade.

1426
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:48,625
Cha is still alive.

1427
01:41:50,667 --> 01:41:52,083
Let me take care of it.

1428
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,125
I told you the detail is finished!

1429
01:41:56,292 --> 01:41:58,125
Are you still hell-bent on your revenge?

1430
01:41:58,292 --> 01:42:00,417
Separate your order from personal vendetta!

1431
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:03,124
He took my South Korean partner's family.

1432
01:42:16,042 --> 01:42:17,042
Leave them be.

1433
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:23,083
I don't want to lose anyone else.

1434
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:36,458
I don't want to lose you either.

1435
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:40,166
I'm sorry.

1436
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:43,792
I'll return afterwards.

1437
01:43:02,667 --> 01:43:03,750
Mom...

1438
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:04,874
Yes, baby?

1439
01:43:04,875 --> 01:43:07,500
Are the bad men gone?

1440
01:43:07,958 --> 01:43:09,541
Yes, they're gone.

1441
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:11,666
But keep your eyes closed.

1442
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,416
Let's wait for Daddy a little more.

1443
01:43:15,292 --> 01:43:16,500
Okay.

1444
01:43:25,167 --> 01:43:26,542
The target has arrived.

1445
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:30,499
Yeon-ah?

1446
01:43:31,583 --> 01:43:32,583
Yeon-ah!

1447
01:43:35,208 --> 01:43:36,291
Sweetie!

1448
01:43:36,292 --> 01:43:37,292
Daddy!

1449
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:39,708
Honey, over here!

1450
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:42,249
- Daddy!
- We're here!

1451
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,208
Honey, we're up here!

1452
01:43:43,209 --> 01:43:45,624
- Yeon-ah!
- Over here!

1453
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:47,708
Honey!

1454
01:43:47,958 --> 01:43:51,458
- Honey!
- Daddy!

1455
01:43:54,833 --> 01:43:56,791
- Honey!
- Daddy!

1456
01:43:57,583 --> 01:43:58,833
Honey...

1457
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:07,333
<i>Where are the plates?</i>

1458
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:19,667
Let the girls go first.

1459
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:23,125
Then I'll hand them over.

1460
01:44:25,917 --> 01:44:28,083
<i>Wanna die together?</i>

1461
01:44:28,875 --> 01:44:30,124
<i>Hand them over.</i>

1462
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:31,166
Honey...

1463
01:44:35,208 --> 01:44:36,291
You don't have them.

1464
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:39,041
No, I don't have them, you bastard!

1465
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:41,374
<i>I don't have them!</i>

1466
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:43,707
Stop hiding and come out!

1467
01:44:43,708 --> 01:44:45,457
Come out, you fuck!

1468
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:46,458
Yeon-ah, it's okay.

1469
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:58,250
No, no, I'm sorry. I really am.

1470
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:00,833
I'm sorry, Comrade.

1471
01:45:02,458 --> 01:45:06,124
<i>Cpt. Cha, this is all my fault.</i>

1472
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:09,957
My family doesn't deserve this.

1473
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:13,582
Let them go and just kill me!

1474
01:45:13,583 --> 01:45:17,708
I'm sorry, let them go, kill me instead!

1475
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:21,208
Are you listening?!

1476
01:45:30,958 --> 01:45:35,041
Yeon-ah, daddy's here.

1477
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:38,291
We'll go home soon.

1478
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:43,666
Shoot.

1479
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:51,791
<i>Comrade, you okay?</i>

1480
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:57,750
Cheol-ryung?

1481
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:01,458
Sorry, I'm late.

1482
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:03,374
Thank you.

1483
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:10,083
Move and you're dead.

1484
01:46:11,333 --> 01:46:12,958
Motherfucker...

1485
01:46:13,375 --> 01:46:17,000
Let the Southerners go,
I'll give you the plates.

1486
01:46:18,458 --> 01:46:19,583
Yo, Cheol-ryung.

1487
01:46:20,167 --> 01:46:23,750
<i>Did you betray your country
to save these people?</i>

1488
01:46:24,083 --> 01:46:25,583
<i>But...</i>

1489
01:46:27,458 --> 01:46:29,041
How can I trust you?

1490
01:46:29,917 --> 01:46:31,000
Crane, upper deck.

1491
01:46:47,458 --> 01:46:48,749
Captain.

1492
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:50,791
Front piece are missing.

1493
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:58,333
Cheol-ryung.

1494
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:01,083
<i>We're 2 plates short.</i>

1495
01:47:01,292 --> 01:47:04,625
Like I said, they leave first.

1496
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:09,125
Not bad for a lapdog.

1497
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:12,458
<i>Alright, sure.</i>

1498
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:17,208
Let them go.

1499
01:47:22,333 --> 01:47:24,291
<i>Take your family and get home, Comrade.</i>

1500
01:47:25,792 --> 01:47:27,458
Yes, okay, Cheol-ryung.

1501
01:47:29,167 --> 01:47:31,458
Okay, okay.

1502
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,750
What about...

1503
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:38,207
you?

1504
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:39,624
Don't worry.

1505
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:45,167
Brother.

1506
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,250
I'm sorry.

1507
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:53,208
I got you into this mess.

1508
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:01,916
I need you to move.

1509
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:07,625
Okay, thank you, thank you so much.

1510
01:48:20,208 --> 01:48:21,208
Get going!

1511
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:38,249
<i>Cheol-ryung, there's no need to shed blood.</i>

1512
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,791
If you return to the North,
you'll get a firing squad.

1513
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:45,416
<i>Join us.</i>

1514
01:48:46,042 --> 01:48:48,125
<i>There's a boat standing by.</i>

1515
01:48:51,583 --> 01:48:52,874
Captain!

1516
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,625
Alright, I'm coming.

1517
01:49:29,458 --> 01:49:30,791
Why aren't we moving?

1518
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:32,124
Honey.

1519
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:38,708
You know I love you two
more than anything, right?

1520
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:41,875
But...

1521
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:47,333
I'm a detective, a South Korean cop.

1522
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:49,875
So?

1523
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,916
Cheol-ryung is all alone...

1524
01:49:54,917 --> 01:49:56,833
Don't beat around the bush.

1525
01:49:57,583 --> 01:49:59,333
Go! Get going!

1526
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:01,291
Kill them all and bring Cheol-ryung back.

1527
01:50:02,375 --> 01:50:03,541
You really mean that?

1528
01:50:03,625 --> 01:50:06,708
You won't go alone, right?
You'll contact the chief?

1529
01:50:07,042 --> 01:50:08,582
Yes, of course.

1530
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:12,208
If you get hurt, I'll kill you.

1531
01:51:22,167 --> 01:51:24,292
Look, there.

1532
01:53:11,042 --> 01:53:12,208
Cheol-ryung!

1533
01:53:13,458 --> 01:53:14,458
Take this.

1534
01:53:23,958 --> 01:53:25,291
Are you alright?

1535
01:53:26,083 --> 01:53:27,083
Just dandy.

1536
01:53:27,625 --> 01:53:28,833
Sorry I'm late.

1537
01:53:30,417 --> 01:53:32,333
Why aren't you at home?

1538
01:53:32,792 --> 01:53:35,625
Then why are you here? Same deal.

1539
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:40,000
You wailed and begged for help.

1540
01:53:40,542 --> 01:53:43,083
Yeah, I cried like a bitch, wouldn't you?

1541
01:53:44,042 --> 01:53:47,083
There's no one like me, though.

1542
01:53:48,792 --> 01:53:49,792
Just be thankful.

1543
01:53:52,792 --> 01:53:54,417
Chan's fleeing that way, there!

1544
01:53:56,583 --> 01:53:58,999
I'm actually a marksman.

1545
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:02,124
Where did he go? He's really fast.

1546
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:23,708
I shoulda killed you first!

1547
01:55:27,833 --> 01:55:28,999
Hey, asshole!

1548
01:55:29,625 --> 01:55:33,500
Do you know what these plates are?

1549
01:55:36,208 --> 01:55:40,708
It's revenge against the Republic
for abandoning its people,

1550
01:55:41,208 --> 01:55:43,541
and it's a reward

1551
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:45,749
for my blood and sweat!

1552
01:55:46,083 --> 01:55:50,583
You cannot ruin my noble plan!

1553
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:07,042
Cheol-ryung.

1554
01:56:09,458 --> 01:56:10,791
Let's go...

1555
01:56:14,708 --> 01:56:15,708
Stop!

1556
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:20,041
Cheol-ryung, look at me.

1557
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:22,333
Let me see you.

1558
01:56:22,334 --> 01:56:23,541
Cha...

1559
01:56:23,958 --> 01:56:25,624
Goddammit!

1560
01:57:16,625 --> 01:57:18,625
You sons of bitches.

1561
01:58:26,042 --> 01:58:27,458
Take it with you.

1562
01:58:31,292 --> 01:58:34,958
Are you so desperate to go to prison camp?

1563
01:58:35,792 --> 01:58:38,583
My country should be ashamed by this.

1564
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:44,499
Be a cop respected by your country.

1565
01:58:50,542 --> 01:58:55,041
It's not like we get paid
enough for our services.

1566
01:58:55,042 --> 01:58:58,083
We starve, we get injured, almost die too.

1567
01:59:00,083 --> 01:59:04,416
And it's not like they'll award us.

1568
01:59:05,792 --> 01:59:10,000
Why did you become a cop?

1569
01:59:10,125 --> 01:59:12,000
I didn't know it'd be like this.

1570
01:59:12,583 --> 01:59:16,541
I thought I'd look cool
while shooting guns,

1571
01:59:16,542 --> 01:59:20,166
catching bad guys, reading their rights,

1572
01:59:20,167 --> 01:59:24,292
cuffing them, and cheered on
by a crowd like in the movies.

1573
01:59:26,042 --> 01:59:28,167
What about you?

1574
01:59:28,667 --> 01:59:31,708
Everyone's busy starving,
so no criminals, I bet.

1575
01:59:34,458 --> 01:59:38,833
Wait, it's a heaven, for detectives.

1576
01:59:40,667 --> 01:59:43,792
Take me with you, I want
to defect to the North.

1577
01:59:46,042 --> 01:59:48,125
You better be careful.

1578
01:59:48,583 --> 01:59:50,833
Your mouth will get you arrested.

1579
01:59:54,208 --> 01:59:57,499
Anyway, that was how I began.

1580
01:59:57,750 --> 02:00:01,875
Catch bad guys, save good guys. You?

1581
02:00:04,625 --> 02:00:07,708
Me too, in the beginning.

1582
02:00:09,958 --> 02:00:12,249
Oh man, oh man. I'm in so much pain.

1583
02:00:17,083 --> 02:00:18,499
Took them long enough.

1584
02:00:19,333 --> 02:00:21,416
That bastard of a chief.

1585
02:00:46,917 --> 02:00:48,917
<i>1 YEAR LATER, PYONGYANG</i>

1586
02:01:25,167 --> 02:01:26,167
Pyongyang?

1587
02:01:26,292 --> 02:01:27,707
Yeah.

1588
02:01:27,708 --> 02:01:28,958
On what case?

1589
02:01:29,583 --> 02:01:32,333
Pyongyang's first ever serial killer.

1590
02:01:32,917 --> 02:01:35,542
The suspect is a South Korean,
he defected to the North.

1591
02:01:36,167 --> 02:01:38,750
Anyway, this is a covert op.

1592
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:41,125
Your counterpart has been chosen.

1593
02:01:42,042 --> 02:01:43,541
Oh, yeah?

1594
02:01:43,542 --> 02:01:44,792
Brother.

1595
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:48,916
You're still ugly as ever.

1596
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:53,416
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.

1597
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,000
Rule #1 of our joint detail.

1598
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:03,958
South's weapon is confiscated
until the case wraps.

1599
02:02:04,292 --> 02:02:05,917
Fine, okay.

1600
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:08,458
Let's go this way.

1601
02:02:09,542 --> 02:02:14,042
My sister-in-law went nuts
when I told her I'd be here...
