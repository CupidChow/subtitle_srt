1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,360
(Previously) One day, I'll hold an
exhibition with the pictures you called weird

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,239
and everyone will clap in the gallery.

3
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,440
If you lose, don't you dare
show your faces to us again.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,719
Kong.

5
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,600
"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 2)

6
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Hey, move!

7
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,879
Go, Meuy, go!
Hey!

8
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,799
Meuy, you can't stay here anymore!

9
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,879
Go!

10
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,279
Hey, stop, stop, don't run!

11
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:27,960
Officer, please help my friend!

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Kong!

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,600
Unit 2 to base, come in.

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,919
Got a 241 situation.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,960
Requesting Unit 4 to switch out.

16
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,120
Unit 4, need you on scene ASAP.

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,640
You can't just leave me like this!

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,439
Unit 2 to base, do you copy?

19
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,279
Boss, they took Kawin and Sun...

20
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,399
They're gone.

21
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,640
But the cops are still out front.

22
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,279
Hey, Meuy, calm down.

23
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:01,000
If you go out now,

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,319
they'll round us all up.

25
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,279
So what do we do now, Boss?

26
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's wait for things to cool down a bit.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then we'll find a way to get Sun out.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,719
How long do we have to wait, Boss?

29
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,719
Sun's been arrested.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
Meuy, just think first... what do we do next?

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Right now, we can't do anything.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,839
Boss, I want to find my dad.

33
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,600
Seriously? He'll beat the crap out of you.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,319
What about Kong?

35
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,399
Kong got stabbed, Boss.

36
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,040
I don't even know if he'll survive.

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,000
My dad... he's gotta be able to help.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,239
But first we have to get Sun out of jail.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
Hello? Dad...

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,839
It's Meuy.

41
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,080
Are you still awake?

42
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,359
Sun.

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,799
Hey! How the hell did he get out? Sun!

44
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,040
Sun!

45
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:27,759
You're the first one I'll kill, asshole!

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,680
You're the first one I'll kill, asshole!

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,520
Come at me!

48
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,640
I'll definitely kill you, you piece of shit!

49
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,839
I won't let you get away with this.

50
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,040
You're dead meat.

51
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,080
Sun...

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,919
Meuy?

53
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,160
Why are you crying?

54
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
P'Sun...

55
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,680
What's wrong, Meuy?

56
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,239
Dad...

57
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,520
What happened to Dad?

58
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,560
He was shot.

59
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,560
He's gone...

60
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,080
When?

61
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,359
Last night.

62
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,040
While everything was going down between us.

63
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,319
Who did it?

64
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Meuy, who killed him?

65
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,319
Jack sent me to post your bail.

66
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,560
Meuy...

67
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,319
Let's wait outside.

68
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,719
And what about me?

69
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,719
Shit… I don't even have any money.

70
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,519
Where's Dad?

71
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,760
He's inside.

72
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:00,679
What happened?

73
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,040
Who did this?

74
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,639
I don't know.

75
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,399
And the people who were with him?

76
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,239
Ten was stabbed to death.

77
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,200
As for Ton… we don't know where he is.
He's missing.

78
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,319
That's all you know?

79
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,439
I know as much as you do.

80
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,519
What more do you want me to know?

81
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:22,760
You...

82
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,080
Family of Mr. Songphoom, please come inside.

83
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,279
Yes, sir.

84
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
You want to come with me?

85
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,720
With Jinny.

86
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,679
Since the deceased

87
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,639
did not carry any identification,

88
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,519
we've had to invite family members

89
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,639
to confirm and sign off on the identity.

90
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm going to remove the sheet now.

91
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,720
Please take a close look at the features and marks.

92
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,120
Let us know if it's someone you recognize.

93
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,080
Ready?

94
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:41,359
How did it end up like this...

95
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,599
Dad! Talk to me!

96
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:21,399
Why the hell did you do that?

97
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,000
Why didn't you take care of Dad?

98
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,279
How could you let him get shot like a stray dog?!

99
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,160
You're always the one causing problems!

100
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,279
Maybe start blaming yourself for once.

101
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,439
What the hell do you even do all day?!

102
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,760
Huh?!

103
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:36,840
And now what?

104
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,160
What are you gonna do this time?

105
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,960
You killed someone, you know that?!

106
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,040
I didn't kill anyone! I already told you!!

107
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,080
Huh?

108
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,000
Then go tell the cops that yourself.

109
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,760
And don't forget, I bailed you out
so you could come see Dad's face.

110
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,800
That alone should be good enough, right?!

111
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,000
Huh?!!

112
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,239
Get a grip.

113
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,160
Wake the hell up, Sun.

114
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,720
You bastard!!

115
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,439
Jinny.

116
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,000
Go home!

117
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,080
Jin!!!

118
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,920
I said go home!!

119
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:15,720
Hey, Seongmin.

120
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:19,479
You still don't really know
how our business works in Thailand.

121
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,639
Be careful what you do.

122
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,720
And make sure you learn from me.

123
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,920
Got it?

124
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,200
What's so funny?

125
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,239
My foster dad hates people who aren't punctual.

126
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:38,479
You better focus on driving.

127
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,080
You're starting to act more and more Thai.

128
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,559
Bet you've forgotten Korean by now.

129
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,439
Says you.

130
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:50,559
Living in the UK…

131
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,160
Can you still even speak Korean?

132
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,200
Sungmin, go check Dad's flight.

133
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm thinking of going to Kong's funeral tomorrow.

134
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Do you want to come?

135
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,000
I just feel so sorry for him.

136
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,120
Things that shouldn't have happened… did.

137
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,559
Kong didn't deserve any of this.

138
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,760
It should've happened to me instead, right?

139
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,679
Don't say something so ominous.

140
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,559
Hello, Mr. Jo Junsa.

141
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,120
Welcome to Thailand.

142
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm with the Butler From Airport Premium Service.

143
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:26,760
That you book to the SAWASDEE by AOT application.

144
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,439
I'm here to welcome you. Don't worry about your luggage.

145
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:32,679
I'll take care of it.

146
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,120
The buggy that will take you to the exit

147
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,599
is waiting for you.

148
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,399
Please follow me.

149
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:19,760
Thank you for using our services via SAWASDEE by AOT.

150
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,080
Have a save trip.

151
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Goodbye.

152
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:27,319
You're late.

153
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,399
But I'll let it slide this time.

154
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:35,479
Since Seongmin booked that airport service app for me.

155
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,679
What's the app called again?

156
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,399
It's called “Sawasdee krub, Dad.”

157
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,439
Where's the car?

158
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,319
I'll go get it, sir.

159
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,200
What would you like to eat, godfather?

160
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,800
I'll take you out for something.

161
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm guessing you all skipped breakfast...

162
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,279
The food on the plane must've been terrible, right?

163
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,160
Your Thai's still not very clear.

164
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,120
God... fa... ther... what... would... you... like... to... eat?

165
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,319
I... will... take... you... to... eat.

166
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,519
I'll teach you every day until it's perfect.

167
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,519
Let go!

168
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,359
Huh?

169
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,920
Let go, huh?

170
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,880
P'Sun!

171
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,200
Meuy...

172
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,880
Get on your knees.

173
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,160
That's right. Good job.

174
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,359
Dad!

175
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,800
You wanna keep that bullet for yourself?

176
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,080
Or do you wanna get in on this too?

177
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,639
You, sweetie.

178
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,080
Want a bite of this, huh?

179
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Alright, alright. Enough playing around.

180
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,599
I came here serious today.

181
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,239
I've got a story to tell you all.

182
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,439
Every single one of you.

183
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,279
But if any of you don't pay attention...

184
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,559
I'll blow your guts out.

185
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,519
All of you. Got it?

186
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:30,599
Once upon a time...

187
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,960
There was a godfather.

188
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,519
Respected and feared by everyone in the neighborhood.

189
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,040
He ran a boxing gym.

190
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,559
His gym had tons of champion fighters.

191
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,279
But there's one thing I never got.

192
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,359
This godfather guy...

193
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,040
He was deep in all kinds of shady business.

194
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,559
But for some dumb reason...

195
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,200
He refused to let anyone sell drugs in his turf.

196
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,920
Kept resisting until it got him killed.

197
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,239
You know what happened in the end?

198
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,319
He got taken out.

199
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,399
With an M16 hit order.

200
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,800
Think about it...

201
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,040
Guns, right?

202
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,599
…is one of the hardest things
to get in this shithole country.

203
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,399
And yet, this godfather guy
still got whacked with an M16.

204
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Died right in the middle of an eight-lane road.

205
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,120
The real tragedy?

206
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,359
His wife...

207
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,040
She didn't even dare look at his body.

208
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,479
Don't be confused.

209
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,479
This story ain't about your dad.

210
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:31,359
Or your dad.

211
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,559
Or your dad either.

212
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:34,920
But your dad...

213
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,359
He's the only one

214
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,040
who crawled outta that car alive.

215
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,120
And I wanna know...

216
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:42,519
Your dad…

217
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,239
Which temple did he get his tattoos from?
Huh?

218
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,040
Yo, Songpoom...

219
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,359
Where'd you get tattoos, man?

220
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,479
Your skin's bulletproof or something.

221
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:50,239
Huh?

222
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,559
Then later on...

223
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,000
Your dad ended up taking his boss's place.

224
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:55,880
But...

225
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,319
But you know what?

226
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,200
He never learned a damn thing.

227
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,720
Never figured out why his boss got his ass killed!

228
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,279
All those sacred tattoos, all that bulletproof crap.

229
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,160
Didn't add a single wrinkle to your dad's brain.

230
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,399
That's why you turned out dumb as hell.

231
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,239
Dumb as hell!

232
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,040
In the end, your dad.

233
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,399
Got killed by a damn junkie.

234
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,239
Like a stray dog on the street.

235
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,279
That was satisfying as hell!

236
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,599
He fought so hard to keep drugs outta this area.

237
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,519
Just to get killed by a damn addict.

238
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,439
And that, boys and girls, is the end of my little story.

239
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,040
Did you like it?

240
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Did you like it?!
Huh?

241
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,439
No? You didn't enjoy that?

242
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,439
Well then.

243
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,639
Story time's over.

244
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,840
Today I came here to talk business with you guys.

245
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,559
Since your dad, well…

246
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,840
Where is he?

247
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,880
In there, right?

248
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,080
Hey, Songpoom.
Wake up, man.

249
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:05,359
Nope. He's not waking up. Probably never will.

250
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,760
Which means, this area…

251
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,319
This turf your dad used to run.

252
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,479
Just looking at your faces…

253
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:14,920
None of you got what it takes to handle it.

254
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,720
So from now on.

255
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,800
Everything your old man had!!

256
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,679
It belongs to Madam Yao.

257
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,200
And only her!

258
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,359
You get that?!

259
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,359
The bus depot.

260
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:27,319
Hey! What are you guys whispering about?

261
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,720
Just stay still.
I told you to get down.

262
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,559
The gambling dens.
The bars.

263
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,399
The brothels.

264
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,639
We'll be running all of them now.

265
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,760
This is my turf, you got that?

266
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,160
Crouch.
Sit down!

267
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,200
And all that territory your dad
was so damn protective of

268
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:52,479
I'll be the one collecting protection money from now on.

269
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,359
You understand?

270
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,359
Honestly, you should be thanking me.

271
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,760
'Cause people like you.

272
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,559
You ain't got the brains or the balls to do this job.

273
00:23:58,679 --> 00:23:59,519
So I'll handle it.

274
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm practically running your dad's empire for him.

275
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,559
Don't you think you owe me a thank you?

276
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:03,960
Huh?

277
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,359
Huh? Thank me!

278
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,359
Thank me!

279
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:07,399
You better thank me!

280
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,399
Honestly though.

281
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,800
I'm pretty much done here.

282
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,880
But just so you know,
I'll leave you some space to do your business.

283
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:18,559
If I wanted, I could take your turf.

284
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,599
You'd end up like street dogs or beggars.

285
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,000
I'd feel bad though.

286
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,200
I'm leaving you with the snooker table.

287
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,359
Your old man's beloved snooker table, remember?

288
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,760
Got the license for it already, right?

289
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,720
Go ahead. Do your business. It's all legal.

290
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,239
I'm all for honest work.

291
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:36,760
Follow your father's principles.

292
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,559
Those principles that rotted along with him and you guys.

293
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,080
In there, right?

294
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,920
That's where your principles belong.

295
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,120
Soon enough, you'll be following your old man's path.

296
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:46,000
Right?

297
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
You'll meet me soon.

298
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,439
Oh? You'll meet me soon?

299
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:57,399
Alright!

300
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:58,519
You'll meet me? Huh?

301
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,880
I'll meet you in prison, you bastard.

302
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,359
If you want any food, just let me know, I'll bring it for you.

303
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Which section are you in?

304
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,960
Sure, I'll visit you in prison. I know you
probably don't have any relatives visiting you.

305
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,200
You, asshole.

306
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,840
What do you think?

307
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,519
What do you think?

308
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,399
Well, since I'm already holding it,

309
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,920
punish Junho for his father.

310
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
Because of his lack of discipline…

311
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,239
No sense!!

312
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,880
Living carelessly day by day,

313
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,519
the plan for next month must be moved up to today!

314
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:24,920
Do you know how much that messes up the timing?!

315
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,080
Sorry, Father.

316
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,840
Hit his back!

317
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,239
What... still, how many times?

318
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,080
I've given you an option.

319
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,800
Whip Junho until he almost dies!

320
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,800
Or…

321
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,160
You'll fall in his place.

322
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,840
Do it!

323
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,239
Harder!!!

324
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Harder!!!

325
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
Harder!!!

326
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,960
What did philosophy teach you?!

327
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,519
Dreaming like those people from the 70s?!

328
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,239
Harder!!!

329
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,599
Harder!!!

330
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,960
Raw egg.

331
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,279
Another tip to enhance the flavor of meat.

332
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,080
Not just in Thailand.

333
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,439
I've seen it in Vietnam too.

334
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,760
In Korea, they use it as well...

335
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,960
It's used worldwide.

336
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,960
You guys are like people cracking eggs.

337
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,760
Putting it into legal textbooks.

338
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,840
Spreading money into it.

339
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,920
Making the taste of right and wrong so smooth.

340
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,880
This half-cooked style...

341
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,800
I like it.

342
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,080
But every taste has a price to pay.

343
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:13,399
Exactly...

344
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:15,880
That's why I have to meet you outside
the regular schedule today.

345
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,160
But the way you do things, we don't do it like this.

346
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,920
Money comes first, then the work progresses.

347
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,800
Please understand me.

348
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,720
I might seem like an outsider in your eyes,

349
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,200
but I have my own traditions...

350
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,519
And most importantly...

351
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,880
I've never betrayed my friends.

352
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,599
Would you consider me a friend?

353
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
At least... I have a Thai wife.

354
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,599
Right behind me here.

355
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:50,200
A product of a culture that blends so well.

356
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,200
You're lucky.

357
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,840
That Madame Yeao is vouching for you.

358
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,599
But two million for clearing Junho's case...

359
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,800
I think that's a bit expensive.

360
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,319
But without us…

361
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,800
Without Madame Yeao,

362
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,399
Even if you bring ten million...

363
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,760
Even if you bring ten million...

364
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,359
Well, that's it.

365
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,000
So I think of it as buying friendship.

366
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:37,359
I've moved almost all my business here.

367
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,399
Soon enough,

368
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,319
I'll be relying on you a lot more.

369
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,639
This pork...

370
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,200
It's delicious.

371
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,040
It's all gone, right?

372
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,399
I thought everything was clear and smooth.

373
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,439
What's going on?

374
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,359
You thought... the group we need to eliminate

375
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,599
would just be ordinary thugs?

376
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,160
But it's not.

377
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,479
Our next enemy is the hidden hand.

378
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:49,120
The hidden hand pulling all the strings here.

379
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,800
The court sentenced Mr. Win Krongpak
to 1 year in prison and a fine of 10,000 baht.

380
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,000
The sentence is suspended.

381
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:11,399
The court analyzed the evidence
and ruled that Mr. Akra Leephongpanth

382
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:17,319
is guilty under the Penal Code Sections 372 and 290.

383
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:20,279
The sentence is 7 years in prison and a fine of 10,000 baht.

384
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:25,040
The defendant's confession benefited the trial,
so the sentence was halved.

385
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,359
Under Section 78, the sentence is
reduced to 3 years and 6 months.

386
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:34,720
Ugh.

387
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,599
Don't act tough, huh?

388
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,720
You'll be here for a long time.

389
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,599
Go!

390
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,720
Hurry!

391
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,239
Watch it!

392
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,160
Go!!

393
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,359
Walk!!

394
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,000
Go in.

395
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,279
Give him a mat.

396
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
A blanket.

397
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,120
Go.

398
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,840
Can I suck it?

399
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,319
Shit.

400
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,639
Can you answer me? You blank-faced bastard.

401
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:59,080
Learn to suck it.

402
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,840
I want you to suck it.

403
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
I don't smoke.

404
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,279
I told you, I don't smoke.

405
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,160
Hey, stop.

406
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,319
Go sit down!

407
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,599
It started first.
Go back!

408
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:26,920
It started first.

409
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:30,319
Sit down!

410
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,559
You're looking for trouble on your first day here.

411
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,279
You should be locked in a cell for three nights.

412
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,960
Get him in!

413
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,439
Get up!
Hurry!

414
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:45,559
You guys just sit there.

415
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,160
Walk!

416
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,239
Go!

417
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,800
Damn it, I want him!

418
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm going to get you!

419
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,239
Get in!

420
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,800
Get in!

421
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,920
Let go!

422
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,679
Get in!

423
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,599
If you keep staring at me, you're gonna get it again.

424
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,800
Damn it!

425
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Damn!!!

426
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,080
Give me a tip, please.

427
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:34,040
What should I do to stay young like this forever?

428
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,960
Ah, you're flattering me.

429
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,120
You take good care of yourself too, you know.

430
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,760
I've known you for ten years,
ut you still look the same age.

431
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:48,000
I work with kids, so I guess I look young like them.

432
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:48,880
Hey, Mr. Joe.

433
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:51,000
Come inside with me

434
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,720
it's too sweaty out here, It stinks.

435
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,279
Please come in.

436
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:05,200
When are you gonna get me out of here?

437
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:06,399
Calm down.

438
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,279
I've been waiting for years since you got out.

439
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,559
We want to live comfortably like you too.

440
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Can you tell Jihoon for us?

441
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,040
I feel like I'm putting my neck on the line here.

442
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,559
If we have to work for Jihoon,

443
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,239
Just make sure we get in.

444
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,679
I'll give you everything you want.

445
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,559
Right now, the kids here are all ready to support Jihoon.

446
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,840
My dream is big.

447
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,279
They keep staring. If they want to fight, just let them.

448
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,880
Honestly, we should just stay still,
and they'll end up fighting each other to death.

449
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,080
It's not fun.

450
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,080
I'd rather fight both of them myself.

451
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,960
What do you want to do, Mr. Joe?

452
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,120
Lobbyist.

453
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:21,120
I need to know as much information about them as possible.

454
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:25,399
I'll need your help for this one.

455
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,679
Hey, you guys, get out.

456
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:44,760
Go, go, go.

457
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:47,760
Hey, hey, hey!

458
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,040
Come here.

459
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:50,080
Let me go!
Let me go!!

460
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,840
Let me go!
Hey!

461
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,760
You bastard, let me go!

462
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,439
Hey, hey!

463
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,800
Hey!

464
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,880
Let me go!

465
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,080
Let me go!!

466
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,319
Here's the red thread, it's for you, kid.

467
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,479
Let me go.

468
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,880
Let me go.!

469
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,519
Let me go.

470
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,080
Let me go.!!

471
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,840
Let me go.!

472
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,639
I feel better now...

473
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,960
I'll stomp on him until he dies!!

474
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,479
Let's cut to the chase, Joe.

475
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,880
We've already wasted a lot of time.

476
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:25,920
What you're offering, ten kilos a month,
if you can really do it,

477
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,080
I'm ready to take all of it.

478
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:30,239
Well, Madam,

479
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,679
Normally, I have to sip tea first
before starting business talks.

480
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,239
Please, have a seat.

481
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,760
Looks like Joe has to adjust now.

482
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
The market is blazing hot like fire.

483
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:46,800
If you're slow, you're finished.

484
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,960
I've been waiting for you for three months.

485
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:52,040
I've cleared the path for you.

486
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,720
From transportation to the selling source.

487
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,399
Right now, I only have three kilos left.

488
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,679
Calm down, Madam.

489
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,479
I always have surprises for you.

490
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:08,479
Madam, do you think your cocaine market

491
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:10,000
can last for much longer?

492
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,880
The innovation of happiness,
that is no longer measured by quantity...

493
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,519
Ketamine??

494
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:24,760
Fentanyl...!!!

495
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,599
But honestly, I don't even want to call it that.

496
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It seems too formal and... a bit hard to reach.

497
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:33,479
I want to create a personal brand, something new.

498
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,519
Simple,

499
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,920
catchy,

500
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,319
And easy to approach without feeling awkward.

501
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:40,800
And how will you change the existing market?

502
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:43,000
No need to change the market, Madam.

503
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,800
We just mix it a little bit,

504
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,200
with the existing products you're already selling.

505
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,639
Whether it's cocaine...

506
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,080
meth...

507
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,559
heroin...

508
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,319
Let's not count that, it's out now.

509
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,279
By then, Madam, you'll be selling just three kilos,

510
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:01,279
but the income will be
the same as fifteen kilos... lower costs,

511
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
higher revenue.

512
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I think that should be enough
for your retirement money, Madam.

513
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,599
I've heard that...

514
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,319
It's quite a high.

515
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,239
Hearing about it...

516
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,399
isn't the same as experiencing it, Madam.

517
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,000
And I'd like to call it... Paradise.

518
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,399
And...

519
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:01,840
I want to increase the price by 50% from the original.

520
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,439
That's not the price I've been paying...

521
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:09,080
But this price will make Madam Yeow
the first in the country.

522
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,000
Think about it, Madam.

523
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:13,239
How much the market could grow.

524
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,319
Just think, Madam.

525
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,559
If it expands to Indo-China,

526
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:19,000
across the Pacific...

527
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,880
or even to the American market, it's possible.

528
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,040
It all depends on how far your vision goes.

529
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:29,519
Your Thai is very good, Jo...

530
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,239
I'm lucky to have a Thai wife, Madam.

531
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:37,200
Okay, then, we'll start with three kilos.

532
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,080
Let's ship the goods.

533
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,279
Are you ready for the wealth, Madam?

534
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,679
Thai street food is the best, truly.

535
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:46,040
Dad can walk around here three or four times a day

536
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,720
just to eat at every restaurant, trying every menu.

537
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,639
Two bowls of shark fin soup, please.

538
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:08,439
Your Thai has really improved.

539
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,679
How many languages can you speak now?

540
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,200
Why is Dad planning to settle in Thailand?

541
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:19,160
You don't really know, do you?

542
00:45:19,479 --> 00:45:21,559
How did Junho manage to escape prison?

543
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:26,239
This country excites Dad so much.

544
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,920
But back home... Dad's work is running smoothly.

545
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,319
Do you remember who I used to be?

546
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,599
I do remember.

547
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,080
And do you think Dad would come here for nothing?

548
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,200
Including the Junho matter?

549
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,479
Madam Yeao.

550
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,279
Drug dealing.

551
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:49,920
Or setting up gangs.

552
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:53,000
All of this is just made up.

553
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,359
Dad does it to build influence.

554
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:59,040
To divert attention from the real thing.

555
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,880
If you cut my arm right now,

556
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,479
the blood that comes out would be white...

557
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,479
It's the purity of our nation's blood.

558
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,120
Ah, yes.

559
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,679
What I'm doing is bigger than you think.

560
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:26,120
And one day, you'll understand
why I allowed everyone to hate me, including you.

561
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,519
Yes.

562
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:38,160
Dad... I...

563
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,359
Can I go walk around here for a bit?

564
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,880
Can I go walk around here for a bit?

565
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,720
In the past three months, you've been looking better.

566
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,120
Dad gave you two days off.

567
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,599
Go out and experience life in Bangkok on your own.

568
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:08,720
Eat first.

569
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,399
I miss Mom...

570
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,960
Hey, walk faster!

571
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,880
Hey, let me go!

572
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:42,840
Sit down!

573
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:15,920
If I don't make it out of here, I won't have
the face to go after the person who killed my dad.

574
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,599
Hey!

575
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:56,720
Come at me!

576
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,679
You think you're tough, asshole?

577
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,639
You think you're tough? Prove it, fight me!

578
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,720
Come on!

579
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,960
Hurry up!

580
00:52:15,439 --> 00:52:16,479
Damn, fight me!

581
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:17,840
Stop it.
Let go.
Stop it.

582
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:19,239
Let go!

583
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,800
You think you're tough?

584
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,960
Fight me!

585
00:53:02,439 --> 00:53:03,359
Fight me!

586
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,160
Hey!

587
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,920
Get him.

588
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,399
Stop!

589
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:41,559
I said stop!

590
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,760
You guys again?

591
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,239
What's your deal?

592
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:49,559
You want to pick a fight with me, huh?

593
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:59,880
I'm so tired of you assholes.

594
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,840
Fuck You.

595
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,479
What do you want from me?

596
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:05,639
If I don't die,

597
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,639
You'll never have peace.

598
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,720
You're really stubborn, aren't you?

599
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:12,279
Asshole.

600
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,559
If I don't make it out of here,

601
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:17,040
I'd rather die.

602
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,559
Or do you want to test your luck
against someone like me, ready to die?

603
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:21,920
I'll give it to you, though.

604
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,559
You might want to make peace with me instead.

605
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,160
Make peace, huh?

606
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:30,200
Alright.

607
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:32,960
But I have conditions.

608
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,399
I..

609
00:54:36,279 --> 00:54:38,559
Need to be the one in charge here.

610
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:51,519
(Next Episode)
I'm asking you seriously.

611
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,120
What's your plan?

612
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,760
Find Meuy.

613
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,479
But I'll need your help, bro.

614
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,439
Do you like this picture?
