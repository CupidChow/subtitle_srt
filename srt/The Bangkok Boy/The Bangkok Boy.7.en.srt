(Previously)
Tian, what are you doing here?

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,780
I came to see you, boss!

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,640
No matter what,
my answer will not change.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,700
And I will never allow
drug dealing in my territory.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,060
Looks like this is
really the last time we talk.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,170
Are you threatening me?

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,340
Hey, do you think
the boss talks to dead people?

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,140
Say whatever you want.

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,140
Yes.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,540
Madam, I think...

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,070
Uh, Mr. Joe.

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,780
I've been dying
to work with you, Madam Yao.

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,380
But it's been three months now

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,620
since you asked to clear things up

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,980
even after our talk this morning.

17
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,860
I feel like it's been too long.

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,220
So long that it feels like I'm being fooled.

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,900
Or is there something I should know?

20
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,420
No, no, not at all.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,580
I'm giving you three more days.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,300
If not,

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,500
I might have to start
talking to other dealers.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,970
I really don't want
to see Madam Yao as an enemy.

25
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,820
Three days.

26
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,490
Honestly, Madam,
I can handle this problem.

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,980
How?

28
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,460
Well,

29
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,460
if you want to keep it,

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,420
I've kept that kid Songphoom
in a crate for a while now.

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,020
Right now,

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,460
just one snap

33
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,860
of your finger

34
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,930
and Songphoom will disappear.

35
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,300
Unless

36
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,020
you and...

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,820
Don't try to be too clever.

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,420
Then hurry up and handle it.
Our work can continue.

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,860
There are still three days.

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,420
You should know best, right?

41
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,300
That whether
it's three days or three years,

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,820
the result will be the same.

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,780
People like Songphoom can be broken.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,060
When can we act?

45
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,660
Right after we finish talking.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,220
So, what now, Madam?

47
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,700
Can you handle it?

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,220
Boss, I'm going to buy lunch for Mom.

49
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,500
Go ahead.

50
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,100
"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 7)

51
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,850
Darn!

52
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Why are you telling me to dump Sun?
I don't get it.

53
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,420
Well, he told me to tell you this.

54
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,210
Tim, call him.

55
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,820
Will that be okay?

56
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,180
No answer. If I waited,
this wouldn't have happened.

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,940
- It's because of you.
- Darn, don't blame me, just call him.

58
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,980
I'm calling now.

59
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,210
Call him.

60
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,500
- Darn, are you okay?
- Sun.

61
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,420
- We were really worried.
- Me too.

62
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,300
I'm fine, bro.

63
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,100
So, how is it? Did it go well?

64
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,540
Hey, who is this?
What level am I at now?

65
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,060
Come on.

66
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,780
Open it now.

67
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,290
- Open it.
- Go ahead.

68
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,410
Ahh.

69
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,180
What the heck is this?

70
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,060
Mr. Joe said

71
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,060
the job will only be done

72
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,860
if all the money is
converted to Thai Baht

73
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,940
and paid in cash.

74
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,980
What?

75
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,140
So, how much is it?

76
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,580
Five hundred million won.

77
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,580
Darn, five hundred million won?

78
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,020
Five hundred million?

79
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,700
And after we do that,
we have to finish the job.

80
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,980
Alright.

81
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,740
Can we trust him? He just said that
and left. It's not funny at all.

82
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,620
Leave it with me, bro.

83
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,100
I'll go find him.

84
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,380
Sun.

85
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,380
What now, bro?

86
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,580
You go exchange it, you idiot.

87
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,540
Oh wow, how would I
even know where to exchange it?

88
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,980
You go exchange it.

89
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,020
What?

90
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,060
Peace.

91
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,060
Peace.

92
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,780
Should we change clothes first?

93
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,570
Kong died in my arms.

94
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,900
You remember that, right?

95
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,900
Kong got stabbed.

96
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,780
While the two of us...

97
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,680
were kissing.

98
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,180
Peace.

99
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,580
Peace, please.

100
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,720
Peace.

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm just scared.

102
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,020
I'm scared, Peace.

103
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,020
(Jackson Club)

104
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,940
Mmm.

105
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,840
All our pay is in here.

106
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,660
But the condition is

107
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,420
we have to exchange
all of it to Thai Baht.

108
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,740
And Mr. Joe will
take 30% as expenses.

109
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,300
I think realistically,
we'll get less than 10%.

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,860
This is 500 million won, man.

111
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,180
And we still don't even know
how to exchange it all.

112
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,500
If Mr. Joe finds out we failed the job,
I don't think he'll let us live.

113
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
So...

114
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,860
what if we ask some
of Dad's old crew to help?

115
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,500
Darn, that's a lot of money.

116
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,260
Okay, how about this?

117
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,060
I'll try finding some runners to
exchange the money at money changers.

118
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,420
That should be manageable.

119
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,860
I know some black market dealers,
but we'll have to give them a cut.

120
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,260
20%.

121
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,150
Darn it.

122
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,860
Too much.

123
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,540
20%? Wait, 500 million won.

124
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,020
That's like over 10 million baht.

125
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,650
- Holy crap.
- Boss.

126
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,070
Should we try turning it
into crypto? You interested?

127
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,400
Crypto?

128
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,340
Will it even work
if we convert it to crypto?

129
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,260
If we can exchange it back
to Thai Baht, then it's not hard.

130
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,980
Ah, right. It can be converted back.

131
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,670
Okay then, let's split up
and get to work.

132
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,060
Sun.

133
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,900
Do you guys know

134
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,190
that if this money disappears,
who's gonna be responsible?

135
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,590
I think you should
worry about yourself more.

136
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,000
Then you better get this job done.

137
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,940
Let's end this already.

138
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,580
- You know who's gonna pay for it?
- Hey! Bully, stop it.

139
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,900
I think we've got enough to worry about
just exchanging the money.

140
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,930
Talk.

141
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,100
Songphoom's sons
hacked into the power control system.

142
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,540
They've got some
skilled people, Godfather.

143
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,340
What do you think?

144
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,380
Not bad, skill-wise.

145
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,340
Anything else?

146
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,210
I've sent all the details to your email.

147
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,080
So, it's Sun.

148
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,270
Yeah.
He's the one pulling all the strings.

149
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,390
His whole crew is working for him.

150
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,590
Smart. Brave.

151
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,000
Good subordinates.

152
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,700
Not that impressive, Father.

153
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,620
Not that impressive?

154
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,620
Then you can just make him disappear.

155
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,260
Keep an eye on them.

156
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,820
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,820
What happens
if the bitcoin price drops?

158
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,260
If I get it, I'll use it to
buy dollars on the forex market.

159
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,620
Trade USD pairs,
just to hold the price.

160
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,740
Whether it goes up or down,

161
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,820
we won't lose much.
At most, just the transaction fee.

162
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,180
I don't understand any of this.

163
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,970
Yeah, me neither. So I'll leave this
to you. Just don't let us lose money.

164
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,610
Trust me, bro.

165
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,980
I made you rich even when you were
in jail. You still don't trust me?

166
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,750
Whoa, throwing that in my face now?

167
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,920
No, just letting you know where I stand.

168
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,040
- Are you bluffing?
- We'll see.

169
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,680
We'll see.

170
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,210
- We'll split it up later.
- Yeah.

171
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,680
Hey!

172
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Tian!

173
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,170
Oh, Jinny!

174
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,910
Bro, she was my light in prison.

175
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,060
What a coincidence.
What are you doing around here?

176
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,840
This is my house.

177
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,490
This house?

178
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,890
What a coincidence.

179
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,580
This is my sister.

180
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,100
Jinny, go inside.

181
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,180
Jinny, get inside.

182
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,020
Go.

183
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,060
My sister. And my house too.

184
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,160
You gotta clear this up with me.

185
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,340
Hey! His sister is underage, you know.

186
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,470
This could get you thrown
back in jail. Ever heard of...

187
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,310
Set of five little boys, set of five...
Better five... Yeah.

188
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,540
- Ever heard of it? Fap-fap-fap.
- What's with you? Never heard of it.

189
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,380
Darn hip-hop.

190
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,460
As for Jinny,
I'll hold off on that for now.

191
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,820
It's just a coincidence, man.

192
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,760
Hey, I got a favor to ask.

193
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,300
About yesterday,
I smell something fishy.

194
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,940
- Not your body odor.
- Just kidding.

195
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,780
Ah, those Koreans with
Mr. Joe's adopted son, right?

196
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,780
Yeah.

197
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,060
I want you to dig up more info.

198
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,060
I don't know what they're planning.

199
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,340
- Got it. I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

200
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,460
What, you're not done yet?
You and I still need to talk.

201
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,620
You're so screwed.

202
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,820
Right? Or not?

203
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,270
I think I'll help Tan instead.

204
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,960
- Better come with me.
- Hey!

205
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,940
Hey, bro.

206
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,380
Please take care of this.
Count it first.

207
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,500
Let me count it first, bro.

208
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,980
My stuff is all here.

209
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,860
Do we have to wait
another two months?

210
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,060
Better ask him.

211
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,940
Don't worry about this.
You can exchange it for dong or kip.

212
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,700
Thank you.

213
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Darn, we're still missing a lot.
What should we do?

214
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,900
Let me call Jack first.

215
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,540
Ahh.

216
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,200
Hello, how's it going?

217
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Yeah, yeah, okay, got it.

218
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,620
Jack said there's
still about fifty million won left.

219
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,780
Whoa, that means together we have
around two hundred million, right?

220
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,260
Hey.

221
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,090
- Where the heck is it?
- Don't know.

222
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,460
So what now?
If we count, will the money increase?

223
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,500
We already have a buyer.

224
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,740
- What?
- What?

225
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,490
How much?

226
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,540
150 million, minus
50% off the market price.

227
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,020
Payable in crypto, three types.

228
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,380
Can we trust that?

229
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,740
Honestly, boss, these
dark web guys are all thieves.

230
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,660
But when buying and selling, we have to
plan carefully to get the advantage.

231
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,180
Have you checked their background?

232
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,380
I have, this place
deals with a lot of illegal stuff.

233
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,420
Should be somewhat trustworthy.

234
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Why are you scared?

235
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,740
We've got people.

236
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,180
I've got guns.

237
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,540
I've got feet too, to kick their asses.

238
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,260
- Well done, bro.
- Normal stuff.

239
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,780
Tian, set it up now.

240
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,900
They replied already.

241
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,780
They said if we want to exchange,
meet at the park at seven in the suburban area.

242
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,610
Then we have to plan it well.

243
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,940
Go collect the money.

244
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,700
On my way home.

245
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,520
Are you here yet?

246
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,980
Darn, the meeting is so far
and so early, I'm so sleepy.

247
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,880
I think they don't trust us,
that's why they set the time like this.

248
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,340
So what do you think?
After this job ends,

249
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,620
where will you blow the money?

250
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,730
I think you should calm down, don't rush
to spend it or you'll become a target.

251
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,900
Ahh.

252
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:12,140
Oh Sun, you're overthinking.
I tell you, it's just for fun.

253
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,290
We each have several
hundred thousand, just spend it.

254
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,300
Several hundred thousand.

255
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,880
Haven't you seen?
In the end, I was stuck in jail.

256
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,860
There are tycoons, investors,
even ministers, and recently a lawyer too.

257
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,570
So, what's the name?

258
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,540
Why do you care?
Even if you know, you can't do anything.

259
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Maybe I'll have to
go to jail to contact him.

260
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,340
You'll really go to jail because
you spend too much, darn it.

261
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,810
Oh man, you're too pessimistic.

262
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,740
Hey, guys.

263
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,380
What's up?

264
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,610
Bro, look for two people.
One wears a black shirt and slacks,

265
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,140
the other wears a denim jacket.

266
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,380
Dressed like
they're going to a funeral.

267
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
Black shirt and slacks.

268
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,380
Everyone ready?

269
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,780
Go, you.

270
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,300
Hey, go.

271
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,940
Did you bring the stuff?

272
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,380
Calm down, bro. Let's talk first.

273
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,940
You said you'd come alone,
how come you brought a man with you?

274
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,220
I'm carrying this much money,
how can I come alone?

275
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,460
If you don't trust me,
you can cancel it.

276
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,300
If I didn't trust you,
would I bring this much money?

277
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,620
Here.

278
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,540
Let me count the money first.

279
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,780
Let your friend count
the money here with my friend.

280
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,540
And you go for a walk with me.

281
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,900
No.

282
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,280
What are you scared of?
We came empty-handed with just cash.

283
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,380
But you came with guns.

284
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Exactly, what are you scared of?

285
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,020
Okay.

286
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,300
Let's go for a walk.

287
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,180
And you,

288
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,340
go count the money
over there with me. I'm tired.

289
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,700
Honestly, today I'm not
just here with one man.

290
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,780
What?

291
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,580
Calm down, nothing's wrong,
I'm not going to hurt anyone.

292
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm just checking for assurance.

293
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,380
150 million won is not a small amount.

294
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,100
See those two people
over there? One up there,

295
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,380
and one down here.

296
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,740
If this job succeeds without problems,
those two will disappear immediately.

297
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,700
But if not,

298
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,410
my relatives
will come at you in a pack.

299
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,270
I'm carrying them for assurance only.
Probably won't need to use them.

300
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,260
Let's go.

301
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,860
Sorry bro, but your shirt looks cool.
Where'd you buy it?

302
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,970
Whoa, your gun looks awesome.
Can I try it?

303
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,740
Man, you've got no sense of humor.

304
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,640
Your friend looks nervous.
What's he scared of?

305
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,660
Calm down, man.

306
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
It's nothing.

307
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,040
Once we finish counting the money,
it's all good. We can go home.

308
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,540
All done.

309
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,500
All done?

310
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,260
Is it all there?

311
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,580
Hey bro, you still haven't
answered me. Come on.

312
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,020
What the heck?

313
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,130
Well? What's the answer?

314
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,540
Hang on.

315
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,660
Chill out, man.

316
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,940
Okay, deal's done.

317
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,420
Okay, we're good. Thanks a lot.

318
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,180
Tim keeps nagging all day
like an old man. It's still morning.

319
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,140
I'm going to sleep. I'm tired.
Let's go, go, go.

320
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,020
You're just sitting there eating
comfortably, huh? Everything going smooth?

321
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,700
All smooth, bro.

322
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,290
And the crypto price guarantee
has been taken care of too.

323
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,390
Okay. It's finally done.

324
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,480
Man, I was so nervous.

325
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,480
But you know what?
I really can't stand those two guys.

326
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,290
- We should've just robbed them clean.
- Hey, don't be greedy.

327
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,460
You're so tough, huh?

328
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,180
What are you eating?

329
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,240
Uhhh...

330
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,200
All set.

331
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,500
Today?

332
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,500
Ah okay, sure, sure.

333
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,700
Everyone,

334
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,220
we have to go see Mr. Joe.

335
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,390
Huh?

336
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,270
We just got back and
now we're going again?

337
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,190
Yeah.

338
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,870
We have to go, bro. It's important.

339
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,770
Take my sandwich. Come on.

340
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,170
Eat it on the way.

341
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,690
- I'm about to sleep.
- Let's go. Get up!

342
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,340
Let's move!

343
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,780
You stay here. No need to go.
Just turn the car around and wait.

344
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,060
Also...

345
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,530
Just in case of emergencies.

346
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,980
Take care of this for me.

347
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,410
Hey, what are you standing around for?
Quit posing. Get in the car, you jerk.

348
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,870
Always trying to look cool.

349
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,260
(My faith will never fade)

350
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,700
So, it didn't all go through?

351
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,180
Still have fifty million won left.

352
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,500
That's considered part of
the 150 million in crypto.

353
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,060
Just give me a little more time.

354
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,730
I'll take care of the rest.

355
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,740
How?

356
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,540
The fifty million won

357
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,940
shouldn't take long to handle.

358
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,860
As for the crypto,

359
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,420
I've already hedged it with dollars.

360
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,060
You don't have to worry
about volatility, Mr. Joe.

361
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,810
Songphoom's son is really sharp.
Like father, like son.

362
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,500
You're as skilled as your dad.

363
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,940
Haha.

364
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,750
Jihoon, Jun-ho,
take the money and count it.

365
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,220
Jack, help my son count the money,

366
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,830
so there won't be any issues later.

367
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,560
Yes, sir.

368
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,980
Sun.

369
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,020
Stay and chat with me.

370
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,860
About the remaining crypto,

371
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,740
can you convert it to dollars?

372
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,660
Shouldn't be a problem.

373
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,940
Then take care of it for me.

374
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,100
No need for cash.

375
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,020
Transfer it to my Cayman Islands account.

376
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,500
Cayman Islands?

377
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,660
Got it.

378
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,780
Having such a top-tier
right-hand man really helps.

379
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,380
I'm not that great, really.

380
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,100
I heard about the port
warehouse incident.

381
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,380
You even hacked the area's
power system to break in.

382
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,860
That's no ordinary team you've got.

383
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,900
I'm just lucky to have
some talented friends.

384
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,860
A bird needs feathers,

385
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,860
and a man needs allies

386
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,140
if you want to fly high,

387
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,940
isn't that right, Sun?

388
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,600
- Drink up.
- I'm not much of a drinker.

389
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,180
I thought Mr. Joe wouldn't
be pleased today.

390
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,320
Why wouldn't I be pleased?

391
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,540
If my guys were handling it,

392
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,900
it'd probably take days
to do what you did.

393
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,290
Besides, that day,
you also saved my son's life.

394
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,410
I'm sorry about that, sir.

395
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,110
Things didn't go exactly
as planned that day.

396
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,760
It ended up getting your son hurt.

397
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,060
I heard you came up

398
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,100
with the entire plan on your own?

399
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,180
Not exactly.

400
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,580
I was just lucky that
their security was surprisingly weak.

401
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,860
So weak that it was strange.

402
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,020
Still, skill is skill.

403
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,300
I really want someone

404
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,090
talented like you
to become part of the family.

405
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,300
I don't like the boss-and-underling
kind of relationship.

406
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,140
I treat my people like family.

407
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,260
As for the bonus I promised,

408
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,700
give me a few more days
and I'll sort it out.

409
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,740
Things have been hectic
with a new business lately.

410
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
They're here.

411
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,620
Let's get out of here.

412
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,620
Get in the car.

413
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,180
Sun.

414
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,740
What were you talking about
with Mr. Joe just now?

415
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,020
Hey! Get in the car, stop standing
around trying to look cool.

416
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,660
Get in.

417
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,740
One of them is cunning,

418
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,620
and knows how to use people.

419
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,340
The other one

420
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,770
is skilled both mentally and
physically. A complete package.

421
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,990
We need to nip this in the bud.

422
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,780
You're not thinking of
keeping them around for use later?

423
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,940
We sure could.

424
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,580
But when the time comes,

425
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,050
will you be able to kill the dog
you raised with your own hands?

426
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,860
No matter how well
it guards the house,

427
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,900
it's still just a pet in the end.

428
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,700
Hello, bro.

429
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,290
Yes, thank you.

430
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,980
By the way, I don't know how much
damage your warehouse took.

431
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,670
But my son's safe and sound.

432
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,580
Man, your warehouse security
was really something.

433
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,790
Anyway, let me treat you
to a meal tonight.

434
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,690
Oh, and don't forget to
bring me the damage bill.

435
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,020
I'll settle it for you.

436
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,790
You're welcome, bro. I still need
your help with many things.

437
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,180
See you soon.

438
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,020
What's going on with you?

439
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,900
I wasn't mistaken about what I
just heard you talking about, right?

440
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,450
Oh, so that's what's bothering you?

441
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,820
You think I would

442
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,620
send my only son to die, just like that?

443
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,099
(Police bust major online
gambling ring in Bangkok)

444
00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:37,500
What, officer?
Why did you arrest me?

445
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,300
The site isn't mine, the name isn't mine.
How did you even link it to me?

446
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,860
I want a lawyer.
That's all I'll say, a lawyer.

447
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,940
Any news on the investors?

448
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,020
No, Madam. They've all disappeared.

449
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,220
Darn it. They've shut off
our income source.

450
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,380
So what's your next move, Madam?

451
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,460
A new dealer reached out.
The shipment will come next week.

452
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,000
I'll have to go in person.

453
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,900
I want you to gather everyone
from that day for me.

454
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,900
Understood.

455
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,660
How many people do you need?

456
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,100
Everyone we've got.

457
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,280
I'll take care of it.

458
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,300
If you're gonna stay here,
you need to do boxing training, got it?

459
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,460
So if something happens,
you can defend yourself.

460
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,300
I've got a boss protecting me.
Why should I be scared?

461
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,740
Or do you wanna go back to school?

462
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,420
- There you go again, school.
- Just train.

463
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,730
Come on.

464
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,910
That's it. Hit harder.

465
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,180
Yeah, good. Harder, more.

466
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,020
Yeah, yeah, just like that. Nice!

467
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,980
Ow, that's enough, bro!

468
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,060
You wanna go back to school

469
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,620
or train properly?

470
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,690
Come on. Focus.

471
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,130
Sun, are you tired?
I brought you some water.

472
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,100
(Sun)

473
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,340
Thanks so much.

474
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,770
You got someone like this?

475
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,540
(Tian)

476
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,500
Tian!

477
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
You even got crep, huh?

478
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,080
Let me feed it to you.

479
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,020
Sure thing, Jinny.

480
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,190
Mmm, sweet and delicious.

481
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,850
Shall we do a love shot?

482
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,920
Okay!

483
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,940
Tian's even got crep.

484
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,470
This place is really good.

485
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,180
This file is from my boss.

486
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,420
And this one is the patient list
from the past three months.

487
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,100
These are three new patients
just sent to the center.

488
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,430
And this...

489
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,620
My name is

490
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,220
Kanika Leepongpan.

491
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,120
I'm 20 years old.

492
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,390
My story started

493
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,130
on the day my father died.

494
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,740
Then my brother ended up in prison.

495
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,500
So, Cherry, what happened next?

496
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,780
Um, doctor, I think I forgot
another folder in the room.

497
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,730
Can I bring it to you later?

498
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,020
Sure.

499
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,230
Okay.

500
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,330
My dad had two wives.
My brother, who's in prison, and I

501
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,140
are the children of the second wife.

502
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,500
After that,

503
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,900
I had no one left.

504
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,860
So I decided to run away from home.

505
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,460
My boyfriend and I moved in together.

506
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,580
But I had no idea he and
his father were drug dealers.

507
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,220
Things got worse and they ended up
selling me to online gambling websites.

508
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,480
They made me do live streams.

509
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,410
Mei, how do you feel now?

510
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,520
Are you feeling any better?

511
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,290
I'm better, yes.

512
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,130
Soon, you'll get to start
a new life again.

513
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,210
What's the first thing
you want to do, Mei?

514
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,540
It probably would've been better
if Dad were still here.

515
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,930
Who the heck is that?

516
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,150
Crap.

517
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,010
Is he dead?

518
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,220
(A bonus for Sun from Mr. Joe)

519
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,510
Sun.

520
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,230
Sun.

521
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,140
Jinny.

522
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,900
Lock up the house and
go to bed soon, okay?

523
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,670
We need to go take care
of something quickly.

524
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,180
Let's go, Non.

525
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,630
How many years were you with my dad?

526
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,830
Did he not treat you well?

527
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,600
Huh?

528
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,710
How could you do such
a messed-up thing?

529
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,840
You...

530
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,800
This jerk?

531
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,420
You jerk.

532
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,180
Darn it.

533
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,460
Hey, enough!

534
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,740
Stop, you'll end up killing him.

535
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,220
What did he say?

536
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,660
Tell me.

537
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,610
Who set this up?

538
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,140
You're looking at me?
Huh, you jerk?

539
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,280
Darn it.

540
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,740
Madam Yao was behind the whole thing.

541
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,940
She kidnapped my wife
and kid as hostages.

542
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,650
She forced me to kill.

543
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,530
How can we get to Madam Yao?

544
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,740
I don't know.
I've never seen her in person.

545
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,540
This jerk.
Kill him already! Darn it.

546
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,180
Wait, wait!

547
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,460
That's too far, don't you think?

548
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,230
I did it to protect my family.

549
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,600
You did it for your family

550
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,040
and you killed your own boss?

551
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,420
Please, spare me. I had no choice.

552
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,610
No matter what I chose,
I'd die anyway.

553
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,900
This jerk's heavy as hell.

554
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,900
Hey!

555
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,860
What the heck is this?

556
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,930
Hey!

557
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,180
What the heck are you doing, Non?

558
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,100
You guys can take it, but I can't!

559
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,810
You two go out first.

560
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Go!

561
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,710
Let's help out.

562
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,820
It's just as I suspected.

563
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,100
I thought it was
Madam Yao from the start.

564
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,900
At least now we can focus on her.

565
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,220
Too bad Non killed him already.

566
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,940
But it's fine, I'll keep digging.

567
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,100
And then?

568
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,060
You think you'll be able to kill her?

569
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,580
She shot your dad,
and you still couldn't do it.

570
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,500
I don't know.

571
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,660
Whoever reaches her first...

572
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,180
Swear to me

573
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,220
that you'll kill that woman
and avenge Dad.

574
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,660
Yeah.

575
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,140
Say it.

576
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,980
Yeah, I swear.

577
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,540
Wow.

578
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,460
So pretty.

579
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,540
- Let's play a game.
- Oh, okay.

580
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,260
My turn.

581
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,340
Yeah.

582
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,620
Here.

583
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,820
Skip.

584
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,940
Okay.

585
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,740
Nurse,

586
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,300
how is my sister doing?

587
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,300
Alright.

588
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,700
What's this?

589
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,620
Mmm.

590
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,140
Can this game be played solo?

591
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,940
Did Peace buy that book for you?

592
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,860
Yeah.

593
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,540
You look a lot brighter now, Mei.

594
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:35,190
Next week, you'll be out of here.
Are you happy?

595
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,220
I guess.

596
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,540
Mei.

597
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,500
I found out who hurt Dad.

598
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,340
But now

599
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,740
I don't know what I should do.

600
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,420
Get revenge.

601
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,150
Mei.

602
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Kill them.

603
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,460
Wipe their whole family out.

604
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,890
Then you'll end up
in prison for life, Sun.

605
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,630
Mei, it's not like that.

606
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,260
No, that's exactly how it is.

607
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,400
Isn't that who you are, Sun?

608
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,470
The kind of person
Dad wanted you to be.

609
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,480
The one everyone relies on.

610
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,740
Mei.

611
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,980
You want justice for Dad, right?

612
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,310
How about me?

613
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,870
What do I get out of this?

614
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,100
Today,

615
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,690
I'm going to wipe out
the "Bangkok Boy".

616
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,500
You all know what to do, right?

617
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,950
Yes, sir!

618
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,180
Bring me their blood

619
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,500
so I can wash my feet with it.

620
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,540
Go!

621
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,810
Go!

622
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,300
Let's move!

623
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,300
My men just reported

624
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,560
the Bangkok Boy gang hasn't
made any moves yet.

625
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,810
As long as they don't interfere
with tonight's event, we're good.

626
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,980
I've already given the order.

627
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,080
Kill them all. Leave no one alive.

628
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,060
Well, except for Songphoom's son,
as Madam ordered.

629
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,570
No firearms. You can rest assured.

630
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,670
Hey!

631
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,500
Come on.

632
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,320
Come.

633
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,380
Get in here.

634
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:35,980
(Ride on the Crest of Success)

635
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,380
All set?

636
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:49,860
Good.

637
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,060
Hey!

638
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,400
How did they get in here?

639
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,500
Go!

640
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,780
Madam, hurry.

641
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,780
Oh!

642
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,860
This way.

643
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,100
Sit, sit, sit.

644
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,460
Stay calm. Breathe.

645
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,560
Who are these people?

646
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,020
Black outfits, fully armed.

647
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,140
Only LBE units dress like that.

648
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,700
Impossible. They wouldn't touch me.

649
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,270
I've always paid them.

650
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,230
Maybe someone paid more.

651
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,140
Madam, they're coming.

652
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,180
Trust me. Stay calm.

653
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,660
You run.

654
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,700
I'll handle this.

655
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,060
Trust me, go!

656
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,460
Run! Run!

657
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,660
Hey, you jerk! Come here!

658
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,740
Stop!

659
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,820
Sun, what are you doing here?

660
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,150
Madam Yao.

661
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,930
The one who
ordered my father's murder.

662
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,460
Sun, calm down.

663
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,150
It wasn't me.

664
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,940
(Next Episode)
You must inherit everything from me.

665
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,700
You will never be with that Sun.

666
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,260
If I ever suspect it might happen,

667
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,580
his entire family
and everyone close to him

668
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,100
must die.
