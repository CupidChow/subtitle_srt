00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,000
(Previously)
He and his father ordered the hit on our dad.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,140
I

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,900
am Songphoom's son!

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,500
The son of the man you ordered to kill!

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,900
What the heck are you doing, Sun?
You're making a lot of noise.

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,140
Let's go.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,020
Quick!

9
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,660
I told you, someone like him

10
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,850
wouldn't dare to shoot.

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
Jun-ho.

12
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,180
Stupid but loyal.

13
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,540
Let's go to Songmin's mom's house.

"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 12)

15
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,900
Peace.

16
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,140
Peace.

17
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,660
Peace!

18
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,340
Who the heck are you?

19
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,460
Who the heck are you?

20
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,900
Why did you capture me?

21
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,020
Peace!

22
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,500
Peace!

23
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,260
Nap.

24
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,780
Why did you capture me?

25
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,820
I asked you, why?

26
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,980
Why are you doing this?

27
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,660
Why did you take me?

28
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,860
You betrayed us, didn't you?

29
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,180
Why are you doing this?

30
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,780
Why?

31
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,020
You betrayed us, didn't you, you jerk?

32
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,820
Why the heck would you do this?

33
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,340
Why did you take me?

34
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,660
It's almost over, Mei.

35
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,660
Don't get yourself hurt anymore.

36
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,820
Darn it!

37
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,060
You betrayed us, didn't you?

38
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,540
Why are you doing this?

39
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,340
Why are you doing this, Nap?

40
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,260
Darn you!

41
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,260
What do you want from us?

42
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,500
Why are you doing this? Let me go!

43
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,580
Let go!

44
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,660
Why are you doing this? Let me go!

45
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,780
Let go!

46
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,980
Let me go!

47
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,100
Mei.

48
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,140
Peace.

49
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,860
Jung.

50
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,380
Jung.

51
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,700
Jung! Jung!

52
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,740
Jung!

53
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,820
Jung!

54
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,140
Cherry.

55
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,460
Crap.

56
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,600
My head hurts like hell.

57
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,820
Are you okay?

58
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,820
Darn it.

59
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,620
What the heck just happened?

60
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,020
I don't know.

61
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,380
No.

62
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,020
Hey, are you alright?

63
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,460
Jung, go to the hospital!

64
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,780
Don't you die on me now.

65
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,220
Get up! Get up!

66
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,500
Are you okay?

67
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,580
Jung.

68
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,540
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

69
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,100
Darn it, is anyone following?

70
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,420
Don't think so, bro.

71
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,740
Sun.

72
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,100
Where did you go?

73
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,500
We'll talk later.

74
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,340
What happened to you guys?

75
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,260
How the heck am I
supposed to end this?

76
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
What now?

77
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,220
Well...

78
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,300
Do whatever it takes

79
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,700
to get him to reveal
where he hid the assets

80
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,220
and the important documents
from our foster father.

81
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,140
That's Sun's sister.

82
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
So what?

83
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,300
Hold her hostage.

84
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,780
If her brother goes crazy,

85
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,260
we'll have leverage.

86
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,460
But...

87
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,660
Did you leave any trace behind?

88
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,140
No.

89
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,100
Good.

90
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,260
Nurse! Please help my friend!

91
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,340
Jung, are you okay?

92
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,460
Sit down first.

93
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,420
I'm in pain, darn it.

94
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,660
You, stay here.

95
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,100
Nurse, please take care of my friend.

96
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,020
Wait.

97
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,300
- Miss, what happened to the patient?
- Darn, she just left me here.

98
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,980
- Please help!
- Calm down, put your leg up.

99
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,580
Sun, we're screwed!

100
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,060
What? What happened?

101
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,860
Sun, why was your phone off?

102
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,700
What's going on?

103
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,540
Peace and Mei are missing!

104
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,580
What?

105
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,380
Yeah, Peace and Mei got kidnapped.

106
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,660
How?

107
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,620
We were just sitting at home,
and next thing we knew, we were drugged.

108
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,340
I didn't even know when I passed out.
When I woke up, they were already gone.

109
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,340
Darn it. Who did this?

110
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,740
If it wasn't the lobbyist,
then it must be Joe's men.

111
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,980
What should we do now?

112
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,860
Tian, is my phone working yet?

113
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,540
It's been working for a while now.

114
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,580
And how's the thing
I asked you to handle?

115
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,620
That's been done for ages. I wanted
to show you, but you were never free.

116
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,900
Show me now.

117
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,260
Gather all the data and send it to me.

118
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,620
Got it.

119
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,020
Hey bro, do you know this place?

120
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,620
Why?

121
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,020
I think I know where
Peace and Mei are being held

122
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,620
and who took them.

123
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
Just tell us

124
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,820
so this can end.

125
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,220
You'll be free from this pain.

126
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,020
You're not gonna talk?

127
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,700
What is this?

128
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
What is this?

129
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,860
Huh? What is this?

130
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,900
Let me see.

131
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,180
Who is this?

132
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,060
I asked you, who is this?

133
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,860
Huh?

134
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,820
Who is this woman?

135
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,260
Jun-ho.

136
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,740
Stay here. I'll be back.

137
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Phew, I thought no one
was going to show up.

138
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,100
Take good care of our guest.

139
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,180
About the real estate
you asked me to check,

140
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,860
everything Joe has been
buying up belonged to Madam Yao.

141
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,900
After Madam Yao died,
they were sold dirt cheap.

142
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,180
It's suspicious how Joe knew

143
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,540
where she hid all her assets.

144
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,950
The GPS location where
Peace's signal went dead

145
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,180
is Madam Yao's old
drug manufacturing building.

146
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,660
Joe just bought it.
We know the building,

147
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,260
but we don't know which floor.

148
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,260
There are at least ten floors.

149
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,260
They probably took Peace

150
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,060
to force him to reveal where the hidden assets
and weapons trade documents are.

151
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,340
He must have guarded all over the place.

152
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,740
Too bad I can't hack into
the surveillance from here.

153
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,180
I'll have to tap into the old comm box for that
building, maybe sneak into the security system.

154
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,220
You guys stall for me.

155
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,300
If you find Peace and Mei first,
that's even better.

156
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,220
Traitor.

157
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,540
And is what you did supposed to be loyalty?

158
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,920
If you had acted like a true heir,

159
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,900
Jihoon wouldn't have
been able to do anything.

160
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,380
Our foster father
wouldn't have ended up like this.

161
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,860
Hey.

162
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,300
These shady businesses

163
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,660
are better suited to a scum like you.

164
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,380
No, wait.

165
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,880
Maybe it's just Jihoon alone.

166
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,340
You're just Jihoon's lackey, aren't you?

167
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,300
Or am I wrong?

168
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,560
Can't think for yourself, you idiot.

169
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,620
Darn you, Joe Sungmin.

170
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,460
What's wrong, Joe Jun-ho?

171
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,180
Oh?

172
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,860
What's your real last name anyway?

173
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,300
Sun is coming.

174
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,420
Sun's on his way to rescue you.

175
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,890
Stay here and keep watching.

176
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,660
Sun is coming to save us.

177
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,500
Bro, I'll leave this to you.
I'm going to help Peace and Mei.

178
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,420
Hey!

179
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,860
Kill him.

180
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,820
Tian, the plan's not working anymore.

181
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,460
Where are Peace and Mei?

182
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,020
Can't believe this.

183
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,340
You risked your life to save
the guy who killed your father?

184
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,660
It's because of you and your father
that Peace is in this mess!

185
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,770
So that means I killed
that gay guy because of you?

186
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Where are Peace and Mei?

187
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,340
Sun! I've hacked
into the surveillance system!

188
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,060
Can you help me find them?

189
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,580
There are hundreds of cameras!
Give me a sec!

190
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,260
Sun! I found them!
I found Peace and Mei!

191
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,860
But Mei is being taken out of the room
by someone I don't recognize.

192
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,380
I'll try to find out
which room they're going to.

193
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,440
I'll send everyone
Peace's current location first.

194
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,820
Hello, Mrs. Joe.

195
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,860
Everyone! Cherry is in danger!

196
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Can someone go help her?

197
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,020
Crap, I can't go.

198
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,060
Looks like I'm closest to
Cherry's location. I'll go help her.

199
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,940
Hey! You jerk!

200
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,510
Tian.

201
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,070
Tian!

202
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,040
Cherry.

203
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,750
Tian.

204
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,220
Cherry, take him to the hospital.

205
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,740
I'll help Sun with the rest.

206
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,250
So pathetic, jerk.

207
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,700
Mei.

208
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,940
Tan!

209
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,820
Tan!

210
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,020
Bro!

211
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,220
Mei.

212
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,460
Hey guys, I found Mei.
I'll go help her first.

213
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,700
Hello, Godfather.

214
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,580
You've recovered?

215
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,860
That's just like you.

216
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,940
I'm not even a bit surprised.

217
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:34,260
Like I said, if a cheap trick
like that could kill me,

218
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,420
I'd be dead
a thousand times already.

219
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,780
But thanks anyway.

220
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,220
I was looking for a way to retreat.

221
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
So this was a setup?

222
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,000
Who gave you permission
to see me on your own?

223
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,420
I have an offer for you

224
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,140
that I think you'll
definitely be interested in.

225
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,820
But if you're not willing to listen,

226
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,000
I'll just apologize and walk away.

227
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,660
You've got guts.

228
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,700
Then let me tell you what I want first.

229
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660
Go on.

230
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,460
Since Madam Yao is dead,
you must not kill me.

231
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,200
And what makes you think I would?

232
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,630
Because if I were you,
I definitely would.

233
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,100
What do you have to trade?

234
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,460
You might want to
check your medicine.

235
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,900
The one you're taking every day.
Make sure it's really medicine.

236
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,460
As for who did it,

237
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,940
I'll tell you once I know I'm safe.

238
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,740
Then I'll keep you alive for now.

239
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,700
And anything that belonged to
Madam Yao that you're still hiding,

240
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,500
bring it all to me.

241
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,450
Looks like we really
need to regroup in Korea.

242
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,940
Songmin or Jihoon.

243
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,660
One of those two is betraying me.

244
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,660
What a jerk, Joe.

245
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,050
Goodbye, son.

246
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,530
Shoot him.

247
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,820
Wanna get revenge, Jun-ho?

248
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,060
Drive.

249
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,740
Your lack of discipline

250
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,160
forced us to move our plan up
from next month to today.

251
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,140
I want you to
dismantle this orphanage.

252
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,420
Leave only you and a couple
of strong men to stay in Thailand.

253
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,500
What is Mr. Joe planning?

254
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Lobbyist.

255
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,020
This is a gift for you.
Use it as you see fit.

256
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,380
Get in the car.

257
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,180
What is it?

258
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,060
Were you planning
to confess your love?

259
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,860
I think someday,

260
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,660
one of us will have to kill the other.

261
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,140
That went from love confession
to death threat real fast.

262
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,060
You're very straightforward.

263
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,340
Well, when people
like us are that direct,

264
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,340
what do you think the reason is?

265
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,940
It's probably because

266
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,540
we're confident the other person
won't reject us, right?

267
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,170
Once Yao is dead,
Godfather is going to kill you.

268
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,500
That's not surprising to me.

269
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,080
I mean kill you right away.

270
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,140
That's a bit extreme, isn't it?

271
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,820
Have you figured
a way out for yourself?

272
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,860
What about you?
Got any suggestions for me?

273
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,980
I want you to switch
Mr. Joe's pills with flour pills.

274
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,700
Then stop giving them to him for a while.

275
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,090
You can go run to him
and tell him right after.

276
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,340
Oh, but don't say it's me yet.

277
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,530
Wait until he
guarantees your life first.

278
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,260
Aren't you afraid
I might expose you?

279
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,100
When I do business with someone,

280
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,660
I study them well.

281
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,860
To rise to the top,

282
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,180
we have to knock
those above us down first.

283
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,900
So you need to choose.

284
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,620
Who do you want
your final enemy to be?

285
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,420
Mr. Joe or me?

286
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,020
This is a golden opportunity.

287
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,660
Mr. Joe isn't
that invincible in Thailand.

288
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,620
Why are you

289
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,180
so confident that
everything will go your way?

290
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,140
Because Godfather
is planning to retreat to Korea.

291
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,060
He's probably using
his illness as an excuse to escape.

292
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,060
So, you're planning to shoot
both the husband and the wife?

293
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,660
Wife?

294
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,210
Madam Joe?

295
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,970
I didn't do it.

296
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,680
Her husband did.

297
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,140
Killed her with his own hands.

298
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,040
So, did you get
what you were looking for?

299
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,020
It's done. It's with him.

300
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,530
You were right
from the beginning. It was here.

301
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,320
But it was pointless.

302
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,850
Only he knew all the codes.

303
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,390
That old jerk never trusted anyone.

304
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,400
The lobbyist is here.

305
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,180
Mei's been taken.

306
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,920
It's okay. Tan found Mei.
We'll meet up outside.

307
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,430
Sun, I'm sorry.

308
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,270
Can we not talk about this right now?

309
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,620
Let's go.

310
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,060
Hello.

311
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,380
Aim.

312
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,180
You think you're
the only one with a gun, huh?

313
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,300
You little lobbyist brat.

314
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,140
Don't be confused. No need.

315
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,060
Just remember this.

316
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,370
Today, you

317
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,260
are going to kill Mr. Joe.

318
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,570
You understand me?

319
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,260
So satisfying.

320
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,140
That jerk Joe is dead.

321
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,460
That jerk Yao is dead.

322
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,940
That Songphoom idiot is dead too.

323
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,220
You know who killed them?

324
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,180
Me. It was me.

325
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,380
I killed all of them.

326
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,860
And next will be
you darn lobbyist scum.

327
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,460
I'll take you down one by one.

328
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,300
Just wait, you jerk.

329
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,060
But you can't die just yet.
You still have to do your job for me.

330
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,580
Now it's your turn.

331
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,100
Go pretty up Mr. Joe's corpse first.

332
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,930
Darn it! Out of bullets.

333
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,660
Oh right. You're already dead.

334
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,940
Do you know what's happening
right now? Do you?

335
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,540
This is my era.

336
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,660
Mine. Right now.

337
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,660
Hey, be happy for me! Hey! Hey!

338
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,020
Hey! Darn it, cheer for me!

339
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,740
Yeah, that's more like it.

340
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,940
Very good. Very good.

341
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,470
Take good care of my gun.

342
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,940
Hold it tight.

343
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,790
Yes, teacher.
It's exactly what I suspected.

344
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,140
The lobbyists killed Godfather.

345
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,220
I didn't make it in time to save him.

346
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,420
You okay?

347
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,140
Stop.

348
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,420
Mei.

349
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,460
Who are you? Where's Tan?

350
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,020
The guy who fought me,
was his name Tan?

351
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,900
He's strong.

352
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,860
But not stronger than me.

353
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,140
Don't worry. He's not dead.

354
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,380
Give me Jun-ho
and let's stop fighting.

355
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,260
We'll be seeing
each other again soon.

356
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:05,500
For now, let's get
our people to the hospital.

357
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,700
Yes, teacher.

358
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,060
Oh, right, yes,
Godfather collapsed.

359
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,140
The doctor said it's critical.

360
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,640
You switched Mr. Joe's medicine,
didn't you?

361
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,400
You think I did it?

362
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,620
Before you decide to kill me,

363
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,790
there's something
I want to tell you.

364
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,860
One of the Bangkok Boys is a lobbyist.

365
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,380
Why do you think
Songmin got so close to them?

366
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,310
Whether it's you or Songmin,
someone will pay.

367
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,380
Songmin. That traitor.

368
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,060
Why are you here?

369
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,020
Mr. Joe was killed by the lobbyists.

370
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,220
Jihoon sent me to get you.
We're regrouping in Korea.

371
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,790
Lobbyists.

372
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,100
I'll kill them all.

373
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,380
(Police)

374
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:46,180
Tim, sit down.

375
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,280
Darn, I've never
been to jail like you, jerk.

376
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,700
What the heck?

377
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,700
Sit.

378
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,540
What about Tan and Tian?

379
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,740
What's gonna happen now, Sun?

380
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,620
I've never been to jail before, darn it!

381
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,500
I think you better calm down.

382
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,730
Sun, doesn't this
all feel kinda familiar?

383
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,060
Darn, it's been four years.

384
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,460
And everything still
looks the same, darn it.

385
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,550
Never thought to improve anything?

386
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,410
But I feel like this time,
it's not going to end the same.

387
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,020
Who's Akkira Leepongpan?

388
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:36,720
Stand up.

389
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,620
Alone?

390
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,620
What about me?

391
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,580
Sun.

392
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,660
Sun!

393
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:14,800
Uncle.

394
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,660
Sit down.

395
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:35,980
How are you, Sun?

396
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,100
Uncle, did you find Mei and Peace?

397
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,140
Don't worry.

398
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,740
Mei, Peace, and Cherry
have been confirmed as victims.

399
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,010
By the way, how are you doing?

400
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,490
And what about Jinny?

401
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,020
Jinny is just outside the room.
I didn't let her come in. Don't worry.

402
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,740
Thank you very much, Uncle.

403
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,100
I've caused you trouble again.

404
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,180
What are you going to do next?

405
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,820
I guess I have to
just let it run its course.

406
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,430
But I'm sorry

407
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,880
for dragging my comrades
into trouble again.

408
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,210
What's wrong, Uncle?

409
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:29,260
If you had enough power
to grant your comrades freedom,

410
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,450
what would you be
willing to trade for it?

411
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,510
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

412
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,860
Have you ever seen this tattoo?

413
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,300
Before 1957, back then
government officials were limited,

414
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,780
especially enforcement officers

415
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,580
like the police, district chiefs,
and deputy district chiefs.

416
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,220
That gave rise to a group of people

417
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,260
who were hired by the government
to suppress gangs and brothels

418
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,830
and deal with them
in a specialized way.

419
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:06,180
In Bangkok at that time, they were
called the "Nine-Gangsters".

420
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,660
These people
never really disappeared.

421
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,870
They just hid behind the scenes

422
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,200
and stepped in to handle
certain matters when necessary.

423
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,440
Uncle, you're saying...

424
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,390
There are both good
and bad people in society.

425
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:25,730
Our job is to keep the bad people
bad enough to be controlled.

426
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,080
Lobbyists.

427
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,660
Alright, what information
do you want to give?

428
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,850
My condition is

429
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,380
that everything from today and the past

430
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,920
must be cleared of any wrongdoing
for my comrades.

431
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,790
Want to play some chess?

432
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,060
From what I've assessed, it seems
you don't have any bargaining power now.

433
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,850
But my information will
wipe the board clean for you.

434
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,870
If that information
involves drug trafficking

435
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,840
or the staged death of Yao,

436
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,220
or Mr. Joe ordering your father's murder...

437
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,420
Or the Koreans

438
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:30,140
who came to settle and
do something in Bangkok.

439
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,020
I have all that information.

440
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:35,940
Surveillance footage,

441
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,640
portraits of illegal
Korean immigrants,

442
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,760
all through Joe's network.

443
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:47,540
Useless.

444
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,180
Joe Jun Sa, the former
Korean special agent,

445
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,860
used his connections
and spy network

446
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,210
to turn himself into
a black market trader.

447
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,810
He deals everything,

448
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:04,640
from drugs, weapons, to plutonium.

449
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,580
Eventually, he sent massive funds

450
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,950
to support operations
along his country's borders.

451
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,320
In another light,
he's a secret hero.

452
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,110
And in our country,
it's suitable for it to be his base.

453
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:26,580
But now Joe Jun Sa is dead,
as are Madame Yao and Songphoom.

454
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,320
You and we have all
been dancing on his palm.

455
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,580
The person we
never paid attention to

456
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,040
is Joe Jihoon.

457
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,810
Jihoon,

458
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,900
the quiet, strange one.

459
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,520
Why is that?

460
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,940
He's collaborating with Aim,

461
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,300
using the deaths of those people

462
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,130
to shake our power.

463
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,020
But wait a minute,

464
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,860
Aim is already dead, right?

465
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,550
What the heck is going on?
I'm totally confused.

466
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,970
Looks like I have more
information to trade than you do.

467
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,650
If I'm useless,

468
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,180
you wouldn't have come.

469
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,350
Tell me,

470
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,360
what do you want from me?

471
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,450
You're not that valuable.

472
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,340
I just want to help you.

473
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,420
Your comrades' freedom

474
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,960
in exchange for you
becoming one of our soldiers.

475
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,660
You choose.

476
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,500
Sun,

477
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,780
you're as skilled as your father.

478
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,890
But don't be like your father.

479
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,660
Darn it, Nap! Darn it!

480
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,580
We all know everything now.

481
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,060
That they took your sister hostage.

482
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,380
Why the heck did you do that, huh?

483
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,100
If there's something, just tell us.
Aren't we friends?

484
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,220
This time, I'll forgive you.

485
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,900
But if it happens again,

486
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,740
don't call us friends anymore.

487
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,500
By the way,
is Nap's sister cute?

488
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,800
Darn it, darn it!

489
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:37,940
If you've seen his face already,
then let's just go back.

490
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,590
Let him rest.

491
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,140
Wait until he recovers,
then we'll punch him once each.

492
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,500
- Go, go.
- Go.

493
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,680
Darn it, don't do that again.
Rest well.

494
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:08,760
Don't be confused.

495
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,740
I lied to the bro for you.

496
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,740
Everyone understands.

497
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,340
That's pretty heavy, huh?

498
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,620
(One month later)

499
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,980
Eat this or eat my fist, bro?

500
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,100
Whoa, why are you so spicy today?

501
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,630
- Of course, bro. You want some?
- Hey, calm down.

502
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,820
Don't, don't, chill out, man.
Take it easy.

503
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,700
I'll stab too, come on!

504
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,660
- Getting intense, huh?
- I've got one too, bring it on.

505
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,580
Didn't wait to order, huh?

506
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:06,580
No one's waiting.

507
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,550
Sitting real close, huh?

508
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,460
Hey, how's Jack doing?

509
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,860
He's getting better, bro. A few more days
and he'll be out of the hospital.

510
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,020
We're family, after all.

511
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,600
Just the four of us left.
We've gotta stick together.

512
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,820
Right?

513
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,540
Thanks.

514
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,620
Alright, bring it on.

515
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,780
Stick together, man.
Long live Bangkok boys!

516
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,900
Cringe as hell.

517
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,100
Seriously cringe.

518
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:40,020
- Nah, it's not that bad. Cool name, cheers!
- Cheers, cheers!

519
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,180
Swap it.

520
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,660
Want some of this?

521
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,900
Now that this chaos is over...

522
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,530
Can we really call it over?

523
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,920
I feel empty.

524
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,100
Like I've been chasing
other people's games all along.

525
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,540
Until I got in so deep, I had no choice
but to join the lobbyists.

526
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:19,980
To trade for freedom, for me
and my friends, from all the charges,

527
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,640
and from the blackmail evidence

528
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,900
that both Joe and
the lobbyists set up.

529
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,360
Same goes for Nap.

530
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:33,060
He became a lobbyist to survive
and secretly protect Kawin.

531
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,540
Then he was
tasked to infiltrate Mr. Joe

532
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,070
in collaboration with Jihoon.

533
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,400
Things are bound to get
even more dangerous from here.

534
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,320
Jihoon and Aim
won't let this go easily,

535
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:48,210
neither will the lobbyists.

536
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,420
As for Peace,

537
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,530
he must feel heartbroken
about both his parents.

538
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,970
But at least he seems relieved.

539
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,500
And he decided to go back
and study to follow his dream.

540
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,820
But me?

541
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,830
What should I do next

542
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:45,860
to avoid being a pawn in
someone else's power game again?

543
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,340
Right.

544
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,660
I need to become a player,

545
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,980
so I won't lose
anyone else ever again.

546
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:07,420
(Two months later)

547
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,190
Take care of yourself.

548
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,620
Even if we don't think Jihoon
will chase you all the way there.

549
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,080
Okay.

550
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:19,860
Finish school fast

551
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,900
and come back soon.

552
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,500
I'll be waiting.

553
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,860
Bye.

554
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,620
It's been a while, huh?

555
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:58,220
(Mr. Kongphon Thiwapanya)

556
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,540
I'm sorry

557
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,220
for not going to your funeral.

558
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,900
Since you passed away,

559
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,300
so much has happened.

560
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,340
No.

561
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,500
(Mr. Kongphon Thiwapanya)

562
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,970
If I hadn't pulled that knife that day,

563
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,100
none of this would've happened.

564
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,900
Kong.

565
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,580
You know what?

566
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,780
Every time I feel happy,

567
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,460
I feel even more guilty toward you.

568
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,980
(Mr. Kongphon Thiwapanya)

569
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,260
I don't know

570
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,500
if I even deserve to be happy.

571
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,120
Because when I think of you,

572
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,100
it hurts even more.

573
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,900
(Mr. Kongphon Thiwapanya)

574
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:07,980
Maybe

575
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,220
this sounds selfish,

576
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:19,900
but now, I'm free from that knife.

577
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,060
Now I know

578
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,300
that the more I suffer

579
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,810
and the longer I stay in pain,

580
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,220
it would mean

581
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:42,960
that everything you did

582
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:47,860
would be for nothing, Kong.

Born: Dec 14, 2003 – Died: Oct 12, 2021)

584
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,220
From now on,

585
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,980
I'll live my life to the fullest.

586
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,460
Protect everyone I love

587
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,690
and be as happy as I can

588
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,560
for your sake too.

591
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,800
You'll always be a part of my life.

593
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:50,020
I'll bring Peace to visit you.

594
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,060
You'll definitely love him.
