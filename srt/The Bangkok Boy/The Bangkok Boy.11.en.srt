00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,440
(Previously)
If you lose or refuse to fight,

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,330
your loved one will have to die.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,750
Seriously,

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,330
is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey son,

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,090
you've finished
high school now, right?

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,410
What do you want to study next?

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,750
Have you thought about it yet?

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,750
Well...

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,120
I haven't really
thought about it yet, Dad.

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,660
I'm just thinking

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,040
about training in boxing
for a year or two, Dad.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,840
Really?

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,950
That's true.

16
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,040
I want to train boxing

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,790
with you and Tan at the gym.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,410
Like you always said,

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,200
no matter what happens,

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,750
just brace for it

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,750
and charge through it.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,930
Huh?

23
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,790
Hey bro,

24
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,410
I need to talk to you about something.

25
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,380
What is it?

26
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,370
Dad, I'm heading
to school now. I'm late.

27
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,370
- You're leaving already?
- Yes, Dad.

28
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,260
Hey, Sun.

29
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,200
Be home before 9 PM, okay?

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,500
See you tonight, Dad. I'm off.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,840
Sun.

32
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,790
Yes, Dad? Anything else?

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,370
You know already, right?

34
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,950
That I have to die today.

35
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,540
I know, Dad.

36
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,870
No need to remind me so often.

37
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,690
And you know
what you need to do, right?

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,080
Just leave it to me, Dad.

39
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,620
I'm your son.

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,100
=The Bangkok Boy=

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,580
I'm postponing
my trip out of Thailand.

42
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,410
My father just collapsed.

43
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,260
I'll leave once he gets better.

44
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,540
Okay.

45
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,290
Hey!

46
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,560
Hello, Joe Songmin. We have
no personal grudge against you.

47
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,040
We brought you here
to ask just one question.

48
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Where are the documents for the
black market trade and the bank vault code

49
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,690
in Mr. Joe's Cayman Islands account?

50
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,270
Who are you people?

51
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,800
Did Jihoon send you?

52
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,990
I don't think you're in any position
to ask me questions.

53
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,130
Answer the question.

54
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,140
I don't know.

55
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,100
Make him talk.

56
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,100
What's going on? How did you
end up here? Did Jun-ho catch you?

57
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,260
Hurry.

58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,820
Go!

59
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Hey, stop. He's gotten away.

60
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,010
He escaped.

61
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,020
The worst-case scenario

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,050
is Godfather wakes up from the coma.

63
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,120
But as long as he remains a vegetable,
we can proceed with the plan.

64
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,030
The key issue is...

65
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,630
What?

66
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,360
Over the past three years,
Paradise's sales haven't been small.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,750
After deducting all costs, the net profit
must be at least a hundred million.

68
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,080
And every single cent would be in cash.

69
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,780
The question is, where did
Godfather hide the treasure?

70
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,750
His beloved son is
the one most likely to know.

71
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,560
Not to mention the war-grade weapons
we can't keep using without his input.

72
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,020
If it's like I suspect,
Godfather's broker-style dealings

73
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,050
must have generated a fortune.

74
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,440
Then there's the Cyber Room
he established. Why did he set it up?

75
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,560
I really can't read his mind.

76
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,520
Just squeeze the info out
of Songmin and be done with it.

77
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,100
But we need to make sure Godfather
is really not going to make it.

78
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,230
If we hurt his precious son
and he miraculously wakes up,

79
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,000
we're all going to die terribly.

80
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,180
Don't forget, there are people
more powerful than us watching.

81
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,620
Lobbyists.

82
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,220
Every step we take must be clean.

83
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,210
We want no blood on our hands.

84
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,720
Then we take over Godfather's empire.

85
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,860
Godfather always says he is untouchable.

86
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,180
That was his bargaining power.

87
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,910
And I need to find out what it is.

88
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,380
We're close to the climax now.

89
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,660
Ever since Mr. Joe was hospitalized,
things have been going wrong for you.

90
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
They must've
planned this all in advance.

91
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Could it be that
your adoptive brother is behind it all?

92
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,900
Ever since Madam Yao disappeared,

93
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,680
those two have really gone all in.

94
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,850
Lobbyists.

95
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,030
If there's anyone bold enough
to challenge my father,

96
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,580
it's the lobbyists.

97
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,490
They've been trying to force my father
back to Korea for a long time.

98
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,460
They held back only
because of the money he paid.

99
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,420
So they took advantage of Mr. Joe's coma

100
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,350
and turned their focus
to Mr. Joe's business heir.

101
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,700
That doesn't make any sense at all.

102
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,020
Okay.

103
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,260
It's alright.

104
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,470
Don't overthink it.

105
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,580
Whoever it is,

106
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,220
anyone trying to hurt you

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,070
or kidnap you

108
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,040
is dangerous.

109
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,440
The best thing to do

110
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,020
is to find a safe place and lay low.

111
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,360
Don't worry.

112
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,070
No matter what happens,

113
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,240
I'll protect you.

114
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,900
What's that?

115
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,720
Just being cautious.

116
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,860
In case you get kidnapped,
I'll have a way to track you down.

117
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,620
If they do take you,

118
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,050
I doubt they'll
let you keep your phone.

119
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,660
So hide this in a spot
no one would think to look.

120
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,180
Where?

121
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,340
I can't keep up. I'm so confused.

122
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,100
Where? Hmm...

123
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,060
Pervert.

124
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
Hey now.

125
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,900
It's probably

126
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,050
the hardest place to search, right?

127
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,940
Sorry

128
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,410
for always causing you trouble.

129
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,500
It's fine.

130
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,600
I survived worse in prison.

131
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,270
This is nothing.
Just make sure you keep it safe.

132
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,300
Don't worry.

133
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Peace.

134
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,610
Mei, Cherry.

135
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,700
Sun already told me everything.

136
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,530
We're going to lay low at a friend
of Cherry's house out in the suburbs.

137
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,940
Don't worry, bro.

138
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,320
This friend can be trusted.

139
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,350
We've gotten into
plenty of mischief together.

140
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,300
Uh...

141
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,100
You don't have to...

142
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,020
Enough. Don't say anything.
Learn to accept help from others.

143
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,560
Thank you.

144
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,840
So, what are you going to do next?

145
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,830
I'll try to negotiate
with the lobbyists.

146
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,700
If my dad's still in a coma,

147
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,940
we'll withdraw
from all his businesses.

148
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,220
Is it really that easy?

149
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,370
It's probably the best option.

150
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,780
I'll take him back
to Korea for treatment.

151
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,470
Mei, don't you want
to go to Korea with me?

152
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,500
Can I bring Cherry?

153
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,910
Did you even ask me if I want to go?

154
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,500
That would be nice though.

155
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,310
Alright everyone, let's get going.

156
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,520
Come on.

157
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,160
- Got it?
- Yeah.

158
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,980
Hey, Cherry!

159
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,940
Hey!

160
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,220
How have you been? It's been forever.

161
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,380
Everyone else still sees each other,
but you just vanished.

162
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,540
Well, I've been busy working, okay?

163
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,510
Uh, this is Sun.

164
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,940
And this is Peace and Mei.

165
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,820
Hi.

166
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,580
Take it easy, will you?

167
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,460
What about the car?

168
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,300
Just leave it here. No one will care.

169
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,240
Wait, but...

170
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,780
Come on, this is my house.
Park it right here.

171
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,840
Geez.

172
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,520
I even got a cover for it.
It'll blend in perfectly.

173
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,110
No one will notice.

174
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,300
So where are we sleeping?

175
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,560
At my grandma's house.
No one's staying there now.

176
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,680
That wooden house
down by the riverbank.

177
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,630
Thanks.

178
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,420
First things first,

179
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,940
help me cover the car, everyone.

180
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,570
Let's go, have some fun.

181
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,090
Cover the car, cover the car!

182
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,980
Here we are.

183
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,060
There's only one bed, but I've
prepared three sets of sleeping mats.

184
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,460
Should be okay, right?

185
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,580
Yeah, it's fine. Mei and I
are only staying one night.

186
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,900
What about your coffee shop, Mei?

187
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,540
I already told Uncle
I'm taking two days off.

188
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,550
Jung, thank you so much.

189
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,280
Don't mention it.
Make yourselves at home. Relax.

190
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,780
Like you're staying
at someone else's place?

191
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Girl, don't mess with me.

192
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,100
Cherry, I've got to go prep stuff
to sell at the evening market.

193
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,100
Want me to bring you anything?

194
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,660
Nah, I'm good.

195
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,860
But hey, if you see something that
reminds you of me, bring it back.

196
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,100
Pfft, girl, please. Yeah, yeah, see ya.
Call me if anything comes up.

197
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,440
Yeah, thanks a ton.

198
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,480
Aren't you hungry?

199
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,940
Heh.

200
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,780
Wanna go to the riverfront?

201
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,740
Shall we?

202
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,910
Go ahead, I'll catch up with you.

203
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,300
Okay.

204
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,180
Let's go.

205
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,580
Is something wrong?

206
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,410
Is there any way
I could contact the lobbyists?

207
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,520
Well, your dad.

208
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,140
Dad never told me
how to contact those people.

209
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,910
I think I might know a way.

210
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,480
I just want to put an end to all this.

211
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,460
I've caused enough trouble
for everyone already.

212
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,770
What are you planning to do?

213
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,910
I'll take my dad
back to Korea for treatment.

214
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,860
Might have to hand over
part of the business to them.

215
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,460
Honestly, if you're going to sit down
and negotiate, you'll need a solid plan.

216
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,540
Those guys aren't
exactly trustworthy.

217
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,220
Anyway, for today, let's just clear
our heads, okay? Don't overthink it.

218
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,620
Come on.

219
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,260
Mei, look.

220
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,860
Careful, Cherry. You'll fall.

221
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,740
I won't fall.

222
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,500
- Come over here.
- Nice weather, huh?

223
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,110
Sit here, or you'll fall.

224
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,130
Geez, it's not like we get to
enjoy something like this every day.

225
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,740
Just be careful.

226
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,700
Don't you want to try, Mei?

227
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
No, I'm scared of falling.

228
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,940
You're such a scaredy-cat.

229
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,340
I'm here.
What's there to be scared of?

230
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,540
There are fish too!

231
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,260
Yeah. Want to eat some?

232
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,940
You think you can catch them?

233
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,780
I'm heading out to buy
some stuff. Want anything?

234
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,420
Grab me some snacks.

235
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,380
Okay.

236
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,860
Peace.

237
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
- Sun loves apples.
- Oh yeah?

238
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,340
So he's definitely buying some.

239
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,780
There he is! Let's see what he got.

240
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,540
The day you came from Korea,

241
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,740
what were you doing
in Red Lantern Alley?

242
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,540
You don't have to say anything yet.
Just listen carefully.

243
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,740
I bet you didn't know this.
It was Joe who ordered to kill your dad.

244
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,660
Madame Yao?
She was just a pawn in Joe's game.

245
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,100
He planned for her to kill your dad
in exchange for his new drug business.

246
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,540
And when Joe wanted to get rid of her,

247
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,660
he just set it up so you would do it.

248
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,860
He could've done it himself anytime.

249
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,820
But he wanted to record it
to blackmail you.

250
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,940
And the kicker?

251
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Your beloved Peace,
he knew everything his dad did.

252
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,980
He's known since
the day he landed in Thailand.

253
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,380
Funny, huh?
He never told you a thing.

254
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,050
Don't thank me.
I'm just doing you a favor.

255
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,940
I didn't want you to be a clueless fool
used by that Korean father and son.

256
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,110
Oh, and don't bother calling me back.

257
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,550
If you want the truth,

258
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,250
go ask Peace yourself.

259
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
So it's true.

260
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,900
I told you before,

261
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,620
stay away from my family.

262
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,620
It's your family
that got involved with mine.

263
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,380
Sun, wait.

264
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,460
What's going on?
Can someone explain clearly?

265
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,540
Peace.

266
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
No.

267
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,580
Joe Songmin.

268
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,500
That day at Red Lantern Alley,

269
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,540
he stood there and
watched our dad die.

270
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,860
He and his father

271
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,460
ordered the hit on our dad.

272
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,340
It wasn't Madame Yao.

273
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,020
It wasn't Aim.

274
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,420
It wasn't anyone else.

275
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,420
Why did you do this?

276
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,020
Huh?

277
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,420
Answer me! Why did you do this?

278
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,100
Come here.

279
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,100
Come here!

280
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,380
Why the heck did you do it?

281
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,700
You think you're tough?

282
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,360
Come fight me.

283
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,820
You and your dad are real tough, huh?

284
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,450
- Sun, stop! That's enough!
- I've been such an idiot.

285
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,300
Fight me!

286
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,190
Stop!

287
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,060
Hey!

288
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,180
Enough!

289
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,100
Why do you always resort to violence?

290
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,980
And now look what's happened.

291
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,620
Stop! Enough!

292
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Why are you doing this?

293
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,800
Why would you do something like this?

294
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,380
I'm scared, Peace.

295
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,780
Here.

296
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,900
This is your entry ticket into our gang.

297
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,340
What do I have to do?

298
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,700
I just want to keep
an eye on Songmin.

299
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
Come on.

300
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,620
Anyway,

301
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,940
the lobbyists already want to know

302
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,900
where Mr. Joe is hiding
the list of all his dealers.

303
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,580
Take it.

304
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:51,820
(Auspicious Light)

305
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,500
And if I'm not wrong,

306
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,380
he probably won't kill Songmin.

307
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,630
Songmin will likely
talk his way out of it and survive.

308
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
But Sun's target will change.

309
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,060
To Godfather.

310
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,940
We have to thank Sun for
taking action on our behalf.

311
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,900
Finally, the crucial moment.

312
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,980
Where are you going?

313
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,890
To eat.

314
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,130
I know I'm not as smart as Jihoon,

315
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,100
and not as perfect
in your eyes as Songmin.

316
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,900
But I've always
looked up to you as a role model.

317
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,340
I'm frustrated
with Jihoon's methods.

318
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,910
I hope you don't die
over something so trivial.

319
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,580
If you're truly
the person I look up to,

320
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,110
you must...

321
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,780
You must survive.

322
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,980
When you survive and you
want to kill me, just come and do it.

323
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,540
Because you're the one

324
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,980
who gave me my life.

325
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,940
Sun.

326
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,380
Go check, it's wet.

327
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,500
- What's wrong?
- Oh.

328
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,700
What the heck is wrong with you?

329
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,780
Go on, you go. I'll take care of it.

330
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,740
I'll take care of it for you, bro.

331
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,660
Hey, what the heck is wrong?

332
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,780
I asked what the heck is wrong.

333
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,380
Hey!

334
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,460
What are you doing? What are you
going to do with that gun?

335
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,660
Let me go, bro.

336
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,700
Please.

337
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,620
Tell me what's wrong,
you jerk, I'm your brother!

338
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,500
That jerk Joe is the one
who ordered my father's death!

339
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,260
I'm going to kill him!

340
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,980
Darn it, so what?

341
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,020
What can you do to him?
Do you even know where he is?

342
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,580
Right now, he's barely
hanging on to life in the hospital.

343
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,860
I won't let him die
peacefully in his sleep.

344
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,180
I have to be the one to kill him!

345
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,620
Sun, calm down.
You need to be rational.

346
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,220
Okay.

347
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,980
I'm coming with you.

348
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,740
Because if you go in this state,

349
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,260
you'll have to step over
my dead body first.

350
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,260
If you go alone,

351
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,260
don't call me "bro" anymore.

352
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,780
Hello.

353
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,580
- Hello.
- Actually, I'm bringing

354
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,780
some fruit for Mr. Joe Junsa.

355
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,000
- Please wait a moment.
- Do you know which...

356
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,220
room?

357
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,940
He's on the VIP floor.

358
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,980
Thank you.

359
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,300
Hmm.

360
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,380
Okay.

361
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,260
Sun has arrived at the hospital.

362
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,980
Just as we planned.

363
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,260
So...

364
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,620
But it wouldn't be this difficult

365
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,780
if Godfather
had died from the start.

366
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,660
Proceed according to the plan.

367
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Let's go, you.

368
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,580
Wow.

369
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,960
There are so many, man.

370
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,980
Where are you going?

371
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,260
We're here to visit a patient.

372
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,540
You can't go.

373
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,540
Can't go?

374
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,640
I said you can't go!

375
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
No need, bro.

376
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,780
I'll handle this myself.

377
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,340
Just wait and give me points, bro.

378
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,700
Go on.

379
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,300
That's enough, you jerk!

380
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm deducting
one point for using the gun.

381
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,680
But it's good.

382
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,540
Sun.

383
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,760
From now on,

384
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,450
I respect your decision.

385
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,640
Because no matter what,
I'm on your side.

386
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,320
Here, eat this to
heal your internal bruises.

387
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,180
Go! I'll wait here.

388
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,620
Hard to close.

389
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,980
I'm hungry.

390
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,660
Cherry.

391
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,490
I bought some food for you.

392
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,940
The food's here!

393
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,420
Today I bought curry rice
from that famous shop too.

394
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,100
And I have to tell you, the owner's son
is so handsome. I bought everything!

395
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,660
Everyone,

396
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,850
are you all okay?

397
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,740
Oh, oh, oh.

398
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,590
It's okay, it's okay.

399
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,300
Eat, eat, eat! Sorry for being late.

400
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,460
Come on, come on, come on.

401
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,460
Eat, eat! I'm hungry.

402
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,860
Remember that shop you'd take me to
on your bike when we were kids?

403
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,820
I miss it so much!

404
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,420
Do you remember?

405
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,860
Come on, let's eat, I'm so hungry.
I'm tired from work today.

406
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,180
Get the food out.

407
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,540
Let's sit and eat.

408
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,620
Plate it up.

409
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,580
Come on, hurry, let's eat.
The food looks delicious.

410
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,510
Peace.

411
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,420
Do you smell what I smell? Like...

412
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,000
What's that smell?
Why is it so strong?

413
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,440
That's smoke.

414
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,110
Are we trapped in here?

415
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,650
Oh, who put something to block here?

416
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,540
Someone like you

417
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,820
shouldn't die silently.

418
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,900
You have to wake up,

419
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,380
open your eyes,

420
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,380
and look at me

421
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,820
to see who I am.

422
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,340
I

423
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,900
am Songphoom's son!

424
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,020
The son of the man
you ordered to kill!

425
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,140
Wake up and look at me!

426
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,500
You're so good, aren't you?

427
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,020
Huh?

428
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,460
Wake up!

429
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,020
Look at me!

430
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,220
The son of the man
you ordered to kill!

431
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,300
Sun, you didn't avenge Dad, did you?

432
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,580
I don't want you to be like Dad.

433
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,580
What will you get back
after taking revenge?

434
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,260
You know, right?
That I have to die today.

435
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,940
And you know what to do, right?

436
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,620
Please let me handle it, Dad.
I'm your son.

437
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,620
Darn it, Sun! What the heck
are you doing? It's so loud!

438
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,860
Let's go!

439
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,900
Quick!

440
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,180
Darn it.

441
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,320
Go! You jerk!

442
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,420
Go!

443
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,980
- Go fast, bro!
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

444
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,820
Hey, stop!

445
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,340
Hey, stop!

446
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,710
Not stopping!

447
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,020
Faster, Sun!

448
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,740
Faster, Sun!

449
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,700
Hey, hurry, Sun!

450
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,940
Keys, keys, keys!

451
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,620
Shit, they're here.

452
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,380
They're gone, darn it!

453
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,860
Hey, stop!

454
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,300
(Next Episode)

455
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,380
Who is this?

456
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,900
Did I kill that sissy because of you?
Did you make me do it?
