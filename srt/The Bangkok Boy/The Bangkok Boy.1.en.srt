00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,360

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,720
2539

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,280
Get ready.

4
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,160
Hey!

5
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,000
Let go.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
I said.

7
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,160
Let go!

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,240
Ouch!

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,520
Go!

10
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,800
See you again, Ai-Sun.

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Hey, wait!

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,520
Let him go.

13
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,900
"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 1)

14
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
(3 years ago)

15
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,360
Hey!

16
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,040
Whoa, Dad!

17
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,720
You're not even warming up?

18
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Huh?

19
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,440
In real fights, no one gives you time to warm up, Sun.

20
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,720
If I hurt an old man...

21
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,120
Would I go to jail?

22
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
Such a smart mouth, my son.

23
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
Let's hope your skills match your mouth.

24
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,760
I'm serious.

25
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,400
Bring it on.

26
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,720
Let's go.

27
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,600
Whoa.

28
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
Ouch!

29
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,880
Hey!

30
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,480
What was that, Dad?

31
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,800
Oh?

32
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Everyone's here.

33
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,320
Jack.

34
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,720
Sun.

35
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,920
You alright?

36
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,520
Come at me, both of you.

37
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,240
I have to study for the exam. Can you guys keep it down?

38
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,440
Keep it down, my ass.

39
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,120
You talk too much.

40
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,280
I'll shut you up myself.

41
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,480
Come on then!

42
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,280
Your whole family has a smart mouth.

43
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,560
Come at me together.

44
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,240
Whoever knocks Dad down...

45
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,800
gets a reward.

46
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,400
Can you handle this?

47
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,960
Dad!

48
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Ouch!

49
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,160
Jack!

50
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,320
You idiot!

51
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,560
Dad.

52
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,440
Ouch!

53
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,040
Sun!

54
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,240
You jerk!

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,120
You're the one in the way!

56
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,160
Ouch!

57
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,320
Damn it!

58
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,840
Let go, Dad! Let go!

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,400
Dad! Dad!

60
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,040
Ouch.

61
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,680
Ouch.

62
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,400
Ouch.

63
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,280
Ouch.

64
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,240
P'Muey.

65
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,440
Jinny.

66
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,200
Move!

67
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,320
Bye-bye!

68
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,280
Hey.

69
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,000
I told you already,

70
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Stay focused.

71
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
Wait for the right moment.

72
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,440
Seize the opportunity.

73
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,640
Then finish it.

74
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
Yes, sir!

75
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,120
Sun.

76
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,160
You got hit in the same spot again and again.

77
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
And Jack,

78
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,000
You got hit in the stomach last time, right?

79
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,640
Why didn't you learn?

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,720
Yes, sir.

81
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,760
Don't mock us, Dad.

82
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,360
It's your fault.

83
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,160
Your fault!

84
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,800
Hey, take it easy!

85
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Sun…

86
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,960
That punch just now…

87
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
Consider it my birthday gift for your 18th.

88
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,280
What kind of family

89
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,480
gives birthday wishes like that, Dad?

90
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,280
Huh?

91
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,800
Hey…

92
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,840
That really knocked the wind out of me.

93
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Damn it.

94
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,600
So noisy first thing in the morning.

95
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
I'm gonna go study.

96
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,160
I have an exam tomorrow.

97
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,440
Why is this taking so long?

98
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,120
Ugh!

99
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,320
You go ahead. Dad will catch up.

100
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,120
Alright, go!

101
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,920
Our kid...

102
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,680
has grown up now.

103
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,200
Hey, sweetheart.

104
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,920
The school van's here. I'm leaving now, Dad!

105
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,360
Jinny!

106
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,640
Watch your step!

107
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,320
Oh, Ton.

108
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,480
How's your mom?

109
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,000
She's getting discharged today.

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Hmm.

111
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,320
About 9,000 baht, right?

112
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,440
Is that enough for the meds?

113
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Yes, that's enough.

114
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,080
Thank you so much, bro.

115
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,440
Here.

116
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,960
Alright.

117
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,280
How's Kriang doing?

118
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,800
Haven't seen him doing motorbike runs lately.

119
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
Well, now… his wife and kid,

120
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,160
their whole family...

121
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,640
They're practically scraping the walls for food.

122
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,880
I pity them too, but...

123
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
he brought it on himself.

124
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,680
This guy…

125
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,280
Huh?

126
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,560
Thinks he'll win a world title in his sleep.

127
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,440
I'll take care of it.

128
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,080
Never home on time.

129
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Go check it out.

130
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,280
Hey.

131
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,800
Wait.

132
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,440
Whoa, son!

133
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,720
Why are you in such a rush?

134
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,080
I'm heading to school, Dad.

135
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,600
I'll come with you.

136
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,840
It's alright, Dad.

137
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,720
You can stay here.

138
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,840
It's just the bus stop.

139
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,040
Let's go.

140
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,920
It's okay, Dad.

141
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,000
Hey, you...

142
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,040
Lately...

143
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,760
You're always hanging out with friends. I can barely find you.

144
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,360
Walking and talking together—what's so hard about that?

145
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,240
It's not gonna kill you.

146
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,080
Huh?

147
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,040
Yes, sir.

148
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,800
Wait a sec.

149
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,600
Hey Jack!

150
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,520
Pick Jinny up too, okay?

151
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,240
I'll be home late.

152
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,000
Non,

153
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,000
Take care of the kids for me.

154
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,960
I'll probably be back late.

155
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,440
Sure thing, bro.

156
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,560
Oh, Sun, Sun!

157
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,720
Grab an umbrella too.

158
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,480
Okay!

159
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,680
Looks like it might rain.

160
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,720
Wait outside, okay?

161
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,680
Hey, son.

162
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,720
Hey!

163
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,080
You're hard to catch.

164
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,240
But catching Mei is even harder.

165
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,640
Well,

166
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,840
Mei's a girl, Dad.

167
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,120
She can't live like us guys.

168
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,400
It's just not the same.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,840
Sooner or later,

170
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,520
You'll have to face this with Jinny too.

171
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,520
Yeah...

172
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,640
When I get old...

173
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,200
I'll probably be all alone.

174
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,720
Huh?

175
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,360
You're all growing up.

176
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,080
Please look after your siblings.

177
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,720
Both Mei and Jinny.

178
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
Yes, sir.

179
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,200
You're my youngest...

180
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
So you have to be extra careful.

181
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,840
Sun,

182
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,920
Don't create rifts between siblings.

183
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,240
I love all my children equally.

184
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,240
Even though you and Mei

185
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,720
are children of my second wife...

186
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,760
Has there ever been a time

187
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,880
that I didn't care for you?

188
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,000
No, sir.

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,360
How's business?

190
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,480
Selling well?

191
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,560
How much per sheet?

192
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,120
80 baht each, dear.

193
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,440
Hey! Come on!

194
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,040
Let me pay just the interest for now.

195
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,440
Sales have been really bad.

196
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,560
The interest has compounded so much, there's nothing left.

197
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,760
How much over is the interest now?

198
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,360
Anyway, I'm holding onto your truck for now.

199
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,480
I need the truck to sell my stuff.
If you take it, how am I supposed to work?

200
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,280
Alright, enough.

201
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
You've said this many times.

202
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,200
Pulling the sad face trick again and again.

203
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,280
Hey, you!

204
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
What's going on here?

205
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Hello, boss.

206
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,640
Well, she didn't have the money to pay her debt,

207
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,200
so we were gonna repossess her truck.

208
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Repossess the truck?

209
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,520
If you take it, how will I make a living?

210
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,280
Hey, that's not my problem!

211
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,480
Hey

212
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,720
calm down.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,640
Easy now.

214
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,240
No need to start swearing over something like this.

215
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,840
Hey, boss.

216
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,520
She won't give us the money back.
We're screwed too, you know?

217
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,640
I know you're the local boss around here.

218
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,200
But you gotta understand...

219
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,120
I got an order to follow too.

220
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,880
Unless...

221
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,400
you think you can handle my boss?

222
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,560
Exactly.

223
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,280
How about this...

224
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,880
Hey...

225
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,640
Easy, boss. Take it easy.

226
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,440
Here.

227
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,800
This is my gun.

228
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,640
You guys take it.

229
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,240
But leave the car. I'll take that.

230
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,440
When she pays off the full amount...

231
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,080
bring it back to me.

232
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,120
And do me a favor—
Talk to Madam Yao for me.

233
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,840
We go way back.

234
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,640
Old acquaintances.

235
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,680
Okay?

236
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Just talk to her.

237
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:04,800
Please?

238
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:06,800
Hey!

239
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,840
What the hell! That's his stuff!

240
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,320
I can't take the boss's stuff.

241
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,800
Then help the lady out.

242
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,560
That... I can do.

243
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,840
I'll come collect next week.

244
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,360
And, hey

245
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,400
no interest for three months.

246
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,600
Let her get back on her feet a bit.

247
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,800
Boss.

248
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,560
If we do that...

249
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,240
Madam Yao will definitely come after us.

250
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,320
Then this time, consider it my debt to you.

251
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
You all know that when I owe someone.

252
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,600
I pay them back, every single one.

253
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,560
But...

254
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,040
Yeah.

255
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,600
Better I owe you

256
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,640
than you owe me.

257
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,320
Right?

258
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,520
Show the boss some respect.

259
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
Yes, sir.

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,040
Thank you so much, boss.

261
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
Don't mention it.

262
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,440
No, that's alright.

263
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,480
Please take this. It's a trade, after all.

264
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,240
Please?

265
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,760
If there's anything, let me know.

266
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
The rain's not stopping yet.

267
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,240
Actually, it just stopped, Dad.

268
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,720
Ah... Madam Yao.

269
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,400
That reminds me of a Thai saying my wife often shares.

270
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,400
“Soft wood bends easily...”

271
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,160
“...but old wood is hard to bend.”

272
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,400
Do you know what my hobby is?

273
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,000
I love letting my mind relax…

274
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,720
Planting trees.

275
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,680
Especially bonsais.

276
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
I Nurturing them as they grow...

277
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,320
and shape their branches into beautiful.

278
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,880
Winding curves, just the way I like.

279
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,040
It's totally up to you, Madame,

280
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,080
How you want to handle this.

281
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,960
I don't have any issues on my end.
I'm always ready to work with you.

282
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,680
Mr.Jo.

283
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,640
Your daughter will arrive around 9 PM tonight.

284
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,960
Her flight from England's been slightly delayed.

285
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,880
Oh, you've arrived?

286
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,480
I heard the flight was delayed.

287
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,840
Just a little, Dad. No big deal.

288
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,120
Wow.

289
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,400
You've only been away a few years,

290
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,920
and your accent is so smooth!

291
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,760
Come, come, take a look at this.

292
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,440
I'm trying to solve this game right now.

293
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,360
So, how many more years do you need to study

294
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,680
before you graduate...

295
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,480
and finally come help me out.

296
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,600
I'm not as strong as you, Dad.

297
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm afraid I might not be able to do it.

298
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,160
Not strong?

299
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,680
You've already reached a 7th-degree black belt in Taekwondo!

300
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,320
But our family business...

301
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,120
it's just...

302
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,600
Oh!

303
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,440
I have been switching these two pieces since this evening.

304
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,920
I still feel that it's not right.

305
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,200
Dad..

306
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,160
I...

307
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,040
I didn't choose to study government as you insisted...

308
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,840
But...

309
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,240
I chose to study philosophy.

310
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,280
Um…

311
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
That's good.

312
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,480
It's Western philosophy.

313
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,800
I'll graduate in two years...

314
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,120
My professor offered me a position as his assistant.

315
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,040
I've also received a scholarship for my master's degree.

316
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,360
But..

317
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,360
I need you to sign some documents...

318
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,960
You're just like your mother.

319
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,600
Well then... Jihoon.

320
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,000
You don't need to return to England.

321
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,440
When it comes to studying just pretend it never occurred.

322
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,920
You need to fly to Bangkok right away.

323
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,720
Your foolish brother is causing some issues.

324
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,480
You also have to run some errands for me.

325
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,760
I'll follow you tomorrow.

326
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
Consider it your first task as my successor.

327
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,960
What I need to do.

328
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,440
Nothing just go to watch dogs fight.

329
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,480
Come to think of it.

330
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,600
When I was your age.

331
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
My first sip of beer.

332
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,520
Was about now too.

333
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,200
At my age?

334
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,720
Yup.

335
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,160
When you're was 18.

336
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,400
I don't believe it.

337
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,400
No way, Dad.

338
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,680
Back then, I was a boxer.

339
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,160
Super serious.

340
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,240
Never strayed from the path.

341
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,760
My biggest dream back then...

342
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,680
was the Lumpinee Championship belt.

343
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,440
The championship belt, really?

344
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,920
Whoa, and then...

345
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,400
Why have you never told me why you quit boxing?

346
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,360
Well…

347
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
It was because of that first glass of beer.

348
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,720
It got me into trouble.

349
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Trouble?

350
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,880
Yeah, I got hit—right here.

351
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Right here.

352
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,240
This scar, right?

353
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,800
Yup.

354
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,160
That's scary.

355
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,960
Why didn't you ever tell me?

356
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,480
What kind of dad would tell his kid something like that, huh?

357
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,960
Use it as a bedtime story?

358
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,280
That'd keep you up all night, wouldn't it?

359
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,640
Here you go.

360
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,200
Try it.

361
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,280
Okay.

362
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,120
But the color's really dark.

363
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,360
It's espresso.

364
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Still…

365
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,040
No one knows how life's going to hit you…

366
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,280
Or how hard it'll hit.

367
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,520
But no matter how hard it is, how painful it gets,

368
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,320
you just have to endure it.

369
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,000
Get up.

370
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,840
And keep walking forward.

371
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,640
That's all.

372
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,360
Old people say the weirdest stuff—I don't get it.

373
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,160
Hey, son.

374
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,640
You've finished high school now.

375
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,640
Have you thought about what you want to study?

376
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,920
Well…

377
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,600
Not really.

378
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,840
Just…

379
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,400
Thinking I might focus on boxing for a year or two.

380
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,880
Really?

381
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,240
Yeah.

382
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,480
I want to train with you and big bro at the gym.

383
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,880
Just like you always said…

384
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,360
No matter what happens,
just brace for it

385
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,040
and push through.

386
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,520
I want to be an MMA fighter.

387
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,080
Hey, bro… I need some advice.

388
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,880
Yeah, what's up?

389
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,480
My friend here's into film and stuff.

390
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,280
They're planning to shoot near our neighborhood,
so we wanted to ask your opinion.

391
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
Dad, I'm heading to class now. I'm running late.

392
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,960
Already?

393
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,400
Yeah, Dad.

394
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,040
Hey, Sun don't come home after 9 PM, alright?

395
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,800
Okay.

396
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,160
And drag Mei back home too.

397
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,360
Will do, Dad.

398
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,920
Sun—wait, I've got something for you.

399
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
Whoa.

400
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,760
Move it, young man!

401
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,360
Sit down first.

402
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,840
Your artist dad's not working on his?

403
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,280
Huh?

404
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,960
I already finished mine, see?

405
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,160
You're done?

406
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,600
Let me see.

407
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,360
Can I copy it?

408
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,960
Hey! Hey!

409
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,520
Hey, do you think this photo looks nice?

410
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,200
Look.

411
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Shred.

412
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,720
Did you take this yourself?

413
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,080
I honestly don't get it.

414
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,120
What the fuck, man?!

415
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,840
Give it back.

416
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,720
It's weird your photo's weird.

417
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
Just you wait.

418
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,640
One day, I'm going to hold a photo exhibition
and people will be clapping for me—filling the whole gallery.

419
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,200
I'll be watching.

420
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,480
I'll be watching.

421
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,720
You're so uncreative, man.

422
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,960
Wow, and you're actually smart in school?
And you still want to be an artist?

423
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,240
Huh?

424
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,760
What does that have to do with anything?

425
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,440
Don't you have a dream or something?

426
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,640
Of course I do!

427
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,840
I want to be a boxer.

428
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,840
A boxer?

429
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
Then why are you even in school?

430
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,360
Why not just stay home and train with your dad?

431
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,240
Ah, you son of a bitch!

432
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,640
Wanna fight me instead?

433
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,680
Just go do your job already.

434
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,800
Didn't you tell me you had a thing with him?

435
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
If you're gonna skip class, at least be smart about it.

436
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,680
Yeah, yeah, I'm in class now, see?

437
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,040
Still talking back, huh?

438
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,120
There!

439
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,320
Your dad's here.

440
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
That disrespectful junior...

441
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,160
Doesn't even call me “senior” anymore.

442
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,440
Look at him, look at what he's doing.

443
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,000
Just hurry up and finish.

444
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm sick of seeing his face.

445
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,240
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

446
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,400
I've got it.

447
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,920
I've got an idea.

448
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,760
What idea?

449
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,960
Just watch.

450
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,640
Ow!

451
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,320
My stomach hurts...

452
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,520
It really hurts!

453
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,720
Teacher!

454
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,320
My friend has a stomachache. I'll take him to the nurse's office.

455
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,120
Again?

456
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,240
Do you think I'm your teacher or a fool, huh?

457
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,760
Get back to work!

458
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,800
And you outside go back to your own classroom!

459
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,560
Whoa...

460
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,200
That was tough to get out.

461
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,680
You made me wait until school was nearly over. If I'd known, I wouldn't have tried to skip.

462
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,560
It was hard, man. I tried so many plans.

463
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,920
Your “stomachache plan”? Seriously?

464
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,640
“Ow, teacher! It hurts!”

465
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
Hey, it usually works!

466
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,280
You've used it how many times? No wonder it failed.

467
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,960
Alright, let's just go already.

468
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm thirsty.

469
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Holy shit.

470
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,680
Sun, go! Quick! Sun!

471
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,960
You three! Where are you going? Get back here, now!

472
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Hurry up.

473
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,520
Hurry!

474
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,960
I'm Sun, Grade 11, class 4.

475
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,080
Come on!

476
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,920
Quickly!

477
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,120
Come on.

478
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,400
Throw a kick!

479
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:46,960
1 2!!

480
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,800
1 2!!

481
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,080
Dodge the punch!

482
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,080
Come on, show me some power!

483
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,000
See?

484
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,640
Your legs are weak.

485
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,960
How are you gonna win any fight like that?

486
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,560
Tan!

487
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,240
Hello, sir.

488
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,160
What's up, kid?

489
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,840
Come on down.

490
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,240
What's with you guys?

491
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,800
Ah, students...

492
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,880
What time do you think it is?

493
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Shouldn't you be in class?

494
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,200
We just left a bit early, that's all.

495
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,520
School's almost over anyway.

496
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,440
You guys are gonna get this gym in trouble with the school.

497
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,280
They'll say it's a hangout for delinquents.

498
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,400
Honestly, they wouldn't be wrong—it kind of is.

499
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,760
And that's not all...

500
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,040
Sun punched a teacher too.

501
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,800
What? No way. That was you! I didn't do anything!

502
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,320
Hey, Tan, can I skip practice today?

503
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,040
I'm wiped out.

504
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
My dad beat me up this morning. Still sore.

505
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,800
If you're not training, why are you even here?

506
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,080
To see you, of course.

507
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,440
It's his birthday today. Cut him some slack.

508
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah, it's my birthday today!

509
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,640
Wanna play basketball instead?

510
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,600
Yeah, I was just thinking the same.

511
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,240
Wanna go, huh?

512
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,440
Wait, wait, wait...

513
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,880
You sure you're up for it?

514
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,040
Your legs were shaky earlier.

515
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,560
It's fine, Tan.

516
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,600
After basketball, let's get barbecue!

517
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,560
Tan promised to treat us to Korean BBQ, remember?

518
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,640
Wait, wait, wait!

519
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,520
When did I say that?

520
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,040
You want to hear the voice clip?

521
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,960
We've got it.

522
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,040
Evidence, sir.

523
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,240
Little devils!

524
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,720
Fine, let me shower first.

525
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,960
Quick shower time, let's go!

526
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm still good to go, man. I'm not even tired.

527
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,920
Lright, how about this—you and me, one round, Kawin?

528
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,280
Hell yeah, let's do it.

529
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,600
My body needs some action.

530
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,080
Come on.

531
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,400
Get in the ring, go on!

532
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,880
I'll be the ref.

533
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,600
Hey, actually, you guys should all come at me at once.

534
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,520
Come on then, tough guy.

535
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,400
Come.

536
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,560
Hey.

537
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,960
What is it?

538
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,160
I've got something to tell you guys later.

539
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,920
Then just say it now.

540
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,800
Nah, better save it for when we blow out the cake.

541
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,920
Let's go, let's go!

542
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,360
Whoever beats up the birthday boy gets extra money for BBQ.

543
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,200
You don't have to pick me up today.

544
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,840
I'm going to a party with the guys.

545
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,240
What party?

546
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
It's Sun's birthday party.

547
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,800
When are you going to introduce me to your friends?

548
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,720
Come on now...

549
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,960
Later, okay?

550
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Why? You really wanna get beat up by them that bad?

551
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,880
Watch over her for me, will you?

552
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,560
Lately, Meiy hasn't talked to me at all.

553
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,000
She only talks to you.

554
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,240
My dad's starting to get pissed.

555
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,880
She leaves early in the morning...

556
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,680
And only comes back at night.

557
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
Dad's not okay with it at all.

558
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,600
You told me not to smoke, but you guys sure do it a lot.

559
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Always complaining the moment you show up, huh?

560
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,320
Way too hyped.

561
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,400
Skip it, skip it.

562
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,760
Alright, let's go then!

563
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,920
Whoa, shoot it!

564
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,320
Hey, it's me! Chill, it's me!

565
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,520
Hey, hey!

566
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,080
Can I play too?

567
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,800
Sure, go on, go on.

568
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,160
Daddy.

569
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,960
What?

570
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,360
What?

571
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,520
When are you going to pay me back for the noodles I covered the other day?
I don't have any money left for snacks.

572
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,160
Wow, I paid and now you're collecting?

573
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,360
Well, after the basketball game, I'm taking you out for a meal anyway.

574
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,800
Man, I'm an only child. Why do I have to take care of all of you?

575
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,200
Huh?

576
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
I don't get it.

577
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,160
And what does that have to do with the noodles?

578
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,080
Exactly.

579
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,320
Let's go watch the game.

580
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,880
Hey, who are those Japanese-looking guys?

581
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,000
Never seen them before.

582
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,280
They're not Japanese.

583
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,000
They're Korean.

584
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,240
Yeah, I've seen them a few times already. Ran into them at the gym too.

585
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,560
You guys seriously don't know?

586
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,360
Just past the gym, that's the K-R district.

587
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,320
Really?

588
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,920
Yeah!

589
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,200
K-R district, huh?

590
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,880
Who the hell let them set up a slum here?

591
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,680
Hey!

592
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,320
Hey!

593
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,560
Hey! You little sissy, where you think you're going?
Playing dirty like that, asshole.

594
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,440
What the hell?

595
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,800
Hand him over.

596
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,520
He's with me.

597
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,680
If you've got a problem, take it up with me.

598
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,360
Hey!

599
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,360
You don't understand Thai, huh?

600
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,080
Huh?

601
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,080
This court.

602
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,160
We've been playing here since before you even had passports.

603
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,320
This is my country.

604
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,600
My court.

605
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,160
My rules!!!

606
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,040
If you want to play here.

607
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,000
Beat us first.

608
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,040
If we win, hand over that little sissy.

609
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,720
But if you lose…

610
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,200
Don't ever show your faces here again.

611
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,120
Hey!

612
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,240
Official rules, okay? Keep it fair.

613
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
So no one can say we cheated.

614
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
You in?

615
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,120
Yeah, let's do it.

616
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,280
Are you ready?

617
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
You in?

618
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,600
Bring everyone!

619
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
You in?

620
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,080
Dude! What the hell was that?

621
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,480
Calm down.

622
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah, man, what kind of play was that?

623
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,240
P'Sun, that was awesome!

624
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,440
Bunch of losers.

625
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,080
You jackass.

626
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,560
What?

627
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,520
Still salty? Come find us anytime.

628
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,800
Huh?

629
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,480
What?

630
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,600
Wanna go again?

631
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,720
Hey.

632
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,840
Come at me.

633
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,080
Lame.

634
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,600
Come on, man.

635
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,160
What do you want for dinner?

636
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,440
What?

637
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,720
Oh—oh—ohhh.

638
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,600
So now I don't have to pay for dinner anymore, right?

639
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,520
Nope.

640
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,080
That's from the group fund.

641
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,040
Your treat is your treat, boss.

642
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,480
Boss Songpoom.

643
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,520
About what we discussed earlier...

644
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,440
Have you made a decision?

645
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,640
First, I want to apologize to Madame Yao.

646
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,040
Because…

647
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,160
I'll have to decline.

648
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,720
Why, Boss?

649
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,560
We all know things are going great right now.

650
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,840
Just open your heart. Your side of town is valuable.

651
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,920
The area I take care of it's like family to me.

652
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,280
How long are you going to keep talking in metaphors?

653
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,800
You don't even have to lift a finger.
Just let Yao's people handle it.

654
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,480
All you have to do is sit back and collect your share.

655
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,960
Drugs?

656
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,720
It might be profitable in the short term.

657
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,360
But who's going to guarantee the future?

658
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,320
Lobbyists?

659
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,640
They'll guarantee it?

660
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,320
Name your price.

661
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,280
We're all on the same side here.

662
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,880
Let's eat good together.

663
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,920
Maybe Madame Yao thinks I'm...

664
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,920
An outdated gangster.

665
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,280
I'll accept that.

666
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,520
But if it means putting people in my community at risk...

667
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,680
I won't do it.

668
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,080
Forty percent to open the gate!

669
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,360
Let's just say this'll be the last time I speak with Madame Yao about this.

670
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,520
Because no matter what...

671
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,000
My answer won't change.

672
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,200
And I will never allow drug trafficking in my area...

673
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,360
Absolutely not!

674
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,680
Then I guess this really is our last conversation.

675
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,600
Is that a threat, Madame?

676
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,000
Can you talk sense to a dead man?

677
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,280
Aim!

678
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,240
We're leaving!!

679
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,280
"Don't forget the rules."

680
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,560
No guns allowed in this area.

681
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,840
I won't forget.

682
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,680
Definitely won't.

683
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,400
"But I saw you carrying it."

684
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,560
Well...

685
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,240
If it's not an emergency, I wouldn't even use it.

686
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,960
“We're still able to stand here”

687
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,840
“...without the authorities interfering in our business”

688
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,240
“Because we have rules…”

689
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,160
“Do not break…”

690
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,880
“...the rules.”

691
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,520
“And the money.”

692
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,080
“Do not destroy them.”

693
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,360
Hey, dig in!

694
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,320
Eat as much as you want.

695
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,240
Order anything you want. They'll be the ones paying.

696
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,560
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

697
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,840
Hey, here.

698
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,800
It's still raw, dude.

699
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,760
Oh, really?

700
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,280
Aren't you enjoying this at all?

701
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,400
Come on, come on, come on.

702
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,800
Here, let me feed you.

703
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,720
Tastes good?

704
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,720
So delicious!

705
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,120
Alright, see you later.

706
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,560
You wanna get back at them… Junho?

707
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,520
Hell yeah… Jihoon.

708
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,640
Let's go!

709
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,200
Jihoon.

710
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,320
Hey, Jihoon!

711
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,280
Didn't Mr. Jo say not to cause any trouble right now?

712
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,040
Why'd you rile him up?

713
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,160
Took forever to pull him off the basketball court.

714
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,360
Just trust me.

715
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,000
Don't you wanna see something fun?

716
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,400
If you're in, I'm in.

717
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,040
What's wrong with you two?

718
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,480
You're both Korean why aren't you speaking Korean?

719
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,200
Mr. Jo wants us to blend in here as fast as possible.

720
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,920
You idiot...

721
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,600
Forget it.

722
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,480
Let's go beat them up!!

723
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,040
Eat up.

724
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,720
If you've got something to say, say it now.

725
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,320
I… I wanted to tell you that.

726
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,080
Hey! They're here!

727
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
Stay here.

728
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,240
Don't go.

729
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,440
Bro, take care of Meuy for me.

730
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,800
You guys just won't quit, huh?

731
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,760
What the hell are you acting all tough for?

732
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,160
Wait, Meuy.

733
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,360
You and me three on three, how about it?

734
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,160
Hey!

735
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,720
Sun!!

736
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,280
Boss!

737
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,400
I'm going to grab some food for my mom real quick.

738
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,600
She just got out of the hospital.

739
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,800
She's craving her favorite dishes.

740
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,480
Sure.

741
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,600
Thank you, boss.

742
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,720
Looks like there's trouble, boss.

743
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,560
I'm gonna go check it out.

744
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:10,960
Okay.

745
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,840
Hey!

746
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,040
Sun!

747
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,440
Go!!

748
