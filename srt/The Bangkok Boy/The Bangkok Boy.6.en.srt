00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,060
(Previously)
If you mess them up this time,

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,280
they'll be hurting so bad
and Madam Yao will deal with it herself.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,880
All done, sir.

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,640
- Let's go. Nah, I got it.
- Want me to clean this up for you?

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,520
Sun! Sun! Hello, sir!

7
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,920
I'm one of your guys, Sun!

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,330
You know this kid?

9
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,850
Hey, cut that attitude, man.
One day it's gonna get you hurt.

10
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,530
- You can let him go now.
- Got it.

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,480
Sun, don't you remember me?

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,220
- Who the heck are you?
- We went to the same school!

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,930
I was probably in... Grade 11 back then.

14
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,640
Then how did you end up here?
This ain't no summer camp, kid.

15
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,120
I got arrested
for hacking into some data system.

16
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,330
Darn it. So turns out you weren't
as smart as everyone thought.

17
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,260
Huh?

18
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,920
- How long are you in for?
- Six months.

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,140
And

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,720
I got banned. Can't work in IT for ten years.

21
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,890
Honestly, I'm not scared of stuff like that.
It's just small fries.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,440
But...

23
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,220
But I'm scared that
I won't make it out of here alive.

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,690
Well, good for you, I guess.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,450
To be real, I think

26
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,000
no matter where you are,
life's tough all the same.

27
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,440
I know you've been here a while,
and you're about to be released soon.

28
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,460
Probably a month or two before me?

29
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,780
How the heck do you know that?
You were stalking me?

30
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,350
Sure, it's tough for me in here.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,270
But once you're out there,
things won't be easy for you either.

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,880
What's your name?

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,650
I'm Tian.

34
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,400
Tian, huh?

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,150
You got something to tell me?

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,260
I'm gonna tell you that

37
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,610
if you can help me
survive these prison thugs,

38
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,010
your bank account's gonna be stacked
when you walk out of here.

39
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,980
I got caught hacking into a bank.

40
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,160
Man, I swear,
I wanted to smack my own head.

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,460
I left my IP exposed.
That's how they tracked me.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,720
But before they caught me,

43
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,670
I set everything up on the Cayman Islands.

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,010
So what exactly are you trying to tell me?

45
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,540
Before I got arrested, no bail, by the way,

46
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,460
I spent two years collecting
mule accounts from illegal gambling sites.

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,300
Wrote a randomizing script,

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,170
had it siphon cash from those mules,
bit by bit.

49
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,780
Kept cycling the money around
so no one would notice.

50
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,820
And even if they did notice, so what?
Who's gonna care?

51
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,520
Only a few baht disappeared every day.

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,900
What're they gonna do?
Go cry to their mama?

53
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,140
Mom, someone stole 3 baht from me.

54
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,270
Anyway,

55
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,710
right now, we just need one
last piece-launch code button

56
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,240
and maybe a bar of chocolate.

57
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,300
So...

58
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,600
you're sure no one's gonna
get hurt from this?

59
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,990
Absolutely, bro.

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,270
We'll be making at least 200K baht
a month. Let's split it fifty-fifty.

61
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,420
Just your cut. By the time you're out,

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,780
you'll have about 500K or 600K easily.

63
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,920
So? You're in?

64
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,200
Man, you're in a hurry.
Old folks really are impatient.

65
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
Hey.

66
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,380
Nice, nice.
Told you Chairman Kim can do anything.

67
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,380
Now come on already,

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,460
before someone sees us.

69
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,700
Alright.

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,100
Chairman Kim, launch sequence initiated.

71
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
(How was your day today?
Sending you a heart)

72
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,860
Wait, Chairman Kim
is chatting with girls in prison?

73
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,260
Even he needs a little affection
to get through the day.

74
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,980
A little affection, huh?

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,280
Thanks for the love.

76
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,710
Once I'm out,
I'll return the favor in person.

77
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,200
Hurry.

78
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,250
Alright, Chairman Kim is about
to launch the rocket for real this time.

79
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,500
(You promised, remember?)

80
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,740
I did promise.

81
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,100
Chairman Kim, maybe finish
chatting with your girlfriend first.

82
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,280
Move, I'll do it.
Wasted so much time. This one, right?

83
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,500
"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 6)

84
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,420
Ever since they started
pulling people into the city,

85
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,460
the money drop-off points
have been almost deserted.

86
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,580
Barely five guards left at each one.

87
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,660
Darn, you're aiming big now, huh?

88
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,380
Well, you wanna crush the drug cartel

89
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,020
and also the cash.
It's a win-win, right?

90
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,050
Fair point.

91
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,100
Besides,

92
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,640
if we hit them hard this time,
Madam Yao will step in personally.

93
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,580
At first, I honestly thought
you guys were working with her.

94
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,100
Come on, man.
I was just trying to survive.

95
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,880
Truth is, I hate those jerks
just as much as you do.

96
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,380
And what about Snap?

97
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,060
Snap? He's the one
who told me about all this.

98
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,740
Said he's got inside connections.

99
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,140
Perfect.

100
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,140
Alright, boys.

101
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,380
Let's go.
We've still got a ton of work.

102
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,360
Uncle, I'll pay later, okay?

103
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,210
Sure.

104
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,060
See you later, Uncle.

105
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,930
Yeah.

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,310
See you.

107
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,900
- Sun.
- What?

108
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,350
Do you even realize
what you're getting yourself into?

109
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,530
You're Mr. Songphoom's son.
That makes you like family to me.

110
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,060
Are you sure this path you're choosing
is really good for your life?

111
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,020
But I'm not doing anything wrong.

112
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,100
Don't you ever want a simple,
peaceful life like everyone else?

113
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Maybe it's just

114
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,050
how my life's meant to be, Uncle.

115
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,350
You're just like your dad.

116
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,330
I'll get going now, Uncle.

117
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,140
Whoa.

118
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,220
Check it out.

119
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,020
Crap.

120
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,420
Darn, he's dead!

121
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,750
What the heck happened here?

122
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,200
Tim.

123
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,480
Go check inside.

124
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,740
Me?

125
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Yeah, you. Who else?

126
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,890
Why is it always me?

127
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,270
Just go. I don't think
there's anyone left in there.

128
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,220
What, you scared?
Fine, I'll do it myself.

129
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,060
No need.

130
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,730
I got it.

131
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,420
Kawin! What the heck, man?

132
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,860
How would I know?

133
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,190
Did you drug us or something?

134
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,430
Bro, why would I be here too if I did?

135
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,220
Cause you're shady as hell, that's why!

136
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,660
Yo, what's that supposed to mean?

137
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,670
What? You got a problem?

138
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,510
Hey!

139
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,280
Dude! Help me out here!

140
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,690
They're all dead in there,
except this one guy!

141
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,400
Then just leave him.

142
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,840
Are you nuts? He's still breathing!

143
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,250
Come on.

144
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,060
Then what?

145
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,500
You gonna take him home, give him a bath,
tuck him in and kiss him goodnight?

146
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,930
Darn, man, why you gotta be such a jerk?

147
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,220
So what now, huh?

148
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,980
Wanna go? I'm ready.

149
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,910
Let's do it then!

150
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,820
Seriously? You guys gonna fight all day?

151
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
He started it!

152
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,660
Tim, just help him out.
Put the poor guy out of his misery.

153
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,380
(Hospital)

154
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,580
Hurry up!

155
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,700
You grab the front,
and I'll get the back!

156
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,540
He's heavy as hell!

157
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,780
Handle it from here, bro. I'm out.

158
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:17,020
(Hospital)

159
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,230
Even the safe on this side's been emptied.

160
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,170
Do we know who did it?

161
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,310
Yeah, Madam. We do.

162
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,380
Who?

163
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,260
That punk Sun and his crew.
The son of that jerk Songphoom.

164
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,810
Oh, so you did show up.

165
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,860
If you thought I wasn't coming,

166
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,050
why'd you text me then?

167
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,060
Can we...

168
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,690
Can we separate our problems
from your family's?

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,980
For what we had, it's not gonna work.

170
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,780
I came today just to see
how the guy I saved that night is doing.

171
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,240
How's that guy?

172
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,230
There are four of us siblings.

173
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,810
Mei's my only real sister.

174
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,040
That day Kong died,

175
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,060
a lot of things happened.

176
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,650
Jun-ho, right?

177
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,750
Yeah.

178
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,900
We all got into a fight.

179
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,610
Then it ended up just me
and Jun-ho one on one.

180
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,060
I was weak.

181
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,920
I knew I couldn't take him.

182
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,570
So I pulled out a knife.

183
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,930
But Kong stepped in the way.

184
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,150
Good thing I held back in time.

185
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,770
But Jun-ho pulled his knife too

186
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,970
and stabbed Kong right in front of me.

187
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,670
At that same day,

188
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,000
around the same time, actually,
our dad got shot.

189
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,140
Mei's never stopped blaming me
for leaving her behind.

190
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,210
She's got nothing left.

191
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,380
Dad's dead.

192
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,480
Her brother's in prison.

193
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,580
All because of my dumb temper.

194
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,330
I was...

195
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,540
I don't care about the details.

196
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,160
I think I've finally
understood everything.

197
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,300
Wait, Peace.

198
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,540
Peace.

199
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm a Korean artist.

200
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,500
You caught my eye, so I sketched you.

201
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,560
Your eyes look sad,

202
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,320
but they're still really beautiful.

203
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:39,180
(Your eyes look sad,
but they're still really beautiful.)

204
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,640
Would you mind if we talk for a bit?

205
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,460
I'm Peace.

206
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,550
Now I'm still learning Thai.

207
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,380
You're hitting on me?

208
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,890
No.

209
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,210
You're not my type.

210
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,090
You're just interesting.

211
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,170
You're Korean, right?
Then why's your name is Peace?

212
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,860
My Korean name's Songmin.

213
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,340
Songmin.

214
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,540
Dad said Mom gave me the name Peace.

215
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,740
I've never met her, though.

216
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,040
I heard you like reading.

217
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,420
Not really. When I was a kid,
my dad used to force me to read.

218
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,650
And over time,

219
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,920
I got hooked.
But I haven't read in a long time.

220
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,020
(Lonely, Sad and Depraved)

221
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,700
Tell the wolves

222
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,140
I'm home.

223
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,660
That one's my absolute favorite.

224
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,140
What are you doing?

225
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,370
You look brighter now,
so I tweaked the drawing.

226
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,330
You sure you're not hitting on me?

227
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,940
We're both kind of lost right now.

228
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,690
I'm a mess too, maybe not as bad as you.

229
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,070
But hey, maybe two lost people

230
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,240
can help each other find the way.

231
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,010
You're one of Sun's friends, aren't you?

232
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,670
Not really.

233
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,770
To Koreans,

234
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,420
Sun's basically the enemy.

235
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,240
So do you see me as an enemy too?

236
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,740
When can I come visit you?

237
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,300
Morning and evening rounds are fine.

238
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,520
We have nurses available at all times.

239
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,140
Okay, thank you very much.

240
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,420
Next time, I'll bring you tons of books.

241
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,530
We honestly had no idea

242
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,480
that Mei had gotten tricked into
something awful by a drug gang.

243
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,580
We just thought she left home

244
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,910
because she wanted some freedom.

245
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,150
And you?

246
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,850
Don't you want to live a free life?

247
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,360
Once this is all over,
I'll get back to training for real.

248
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,220
My dream's to be an MMA fighter.

249
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,990
So why not start now?
What are you waiting for?

250
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,680
Are you even sure
that what you're doing is right?

251
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,810
I gotta go. My brother said

252
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,860
your dad's given us a job already.

253
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,370
Sun.

254
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,580
You don't have to do
what my dad tells you.

255
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,160
I'll talk to him for you.

256
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,100
Okay?

257
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,370
Why? You like me or something?

258
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,180
Sun.

259
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,840
Please, just trust me.

260
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,660
You know why

261
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,030
I've been doing all of this.

262
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,270
To get revenge?

263
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,180
What are you gonna gain from that?

264
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,400
Freedom.

265
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,860
You think that's really what
your dad or Mei would've wanted?

266
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,540
Our insider said

267
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,760
Songphoom's son Sun and his gang

268
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,790
all left the warehouse
an hour before the robbery.

269
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,840
- Songphoom's son's crew?
- Yes.

270
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,860
At first, I thought they'd
just mess around in the city.

271
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,990
Didn't think they had the balls
to hit our warehouse.

272
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,350
No way those punks knew
where our place even was.

273
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,430
And they knew we had
barely any men there.

274
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,580
What do you mean by that, Madam?

275
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,120
We've been stabbed
in the back, you idiot!

276
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,760
Our target is the shipment
in Mr. Joe's container.

277
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,470
The one seized three years ago
at the port warehouse.

278
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,850
Mr. Joe wants it back.

279
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,660
There's probably tons of guards.
It won't be easy getting in.

280
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,160
Then we better work hard for it.

281
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,150
That's kinda your specialty, isn't it?

282
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,720
Only this?

283
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,210
We'll need two vans.
One to move Mr. Joe's goods.

284
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,970
Make sure they've got plates.

285
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,480
What about the other one?

286
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,870
The Korean will send another van.

287
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,140
The Korean...

288
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,510
Who?

289
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,670
Mr. Joe's adopted kid.

290
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,490
He's probably coming to keep tabs on us.

291
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,220
Are we gonna need guns?

292
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,220
Can you get them?

293
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,000
I can manage.

294
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,090
Then do it.

295
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,870
This job has to be clean, super clean.

296
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,940
No loose ends, no chaos.

297
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,100
Wrap everything up by this weekend.
Got it?

298
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,360
Alright then.

299
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,370
Where's the deposit?

300
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,680
Hey.

301
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,080
Since when did you start
chasing money like that?

302
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,230
We work, we get paid. Right?

303
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,380
Sun, I'm counting on you.
You're the smartest one in this house.

304
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,070
Tim, I need you to check
out the location tonight.

305
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,060
Kawin, you handle the guns.

306
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,630
As for you, Hia. Come with me.

307
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,580
Hey, Uncle.

308
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,700
How've you been?

309
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,680
What's up, Sun?

310
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,360
I need some help, Uncle.

311
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm looking for two high-powered vans.

312
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
The ones that no one can catch up with.

313
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,060
I can get them. But what
do you need them for, Sun?

314
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,570
- Just family business.
- I'll keep an eye out for it.

315
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,520
Here, take this. We'll be in touch.

316
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,090
Darn it, Nap!

317
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,340
You didn't set us up, did you?

318
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Why would I sell you guys out?

319
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,580
The spot I gave you was solid. You just had
bad timing. Ran into those lobbyist jerks.

320
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,610
And why are you so sure it was them?

321
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,360
Come on, who else has the balls
to pull something that extreme?

322
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,030
What were you just talking about?

323
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,630
Business.

324
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,660
How is this?

325
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,870
Glock.

326
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,320
Glock 43X.

327
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,340
Small, easy to carry, trigger's smooth.

328
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,700
Big seller in the States.
I'm telling you, people love this one.

329
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,330
What about the other one?

330
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:39,410
Taurus G3C, 9 mil.
Super accurate, dead-on.

331
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,500
And this one?

332
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:49,100
Smith & Wesson M&P. Feels solid
in your hand, sleek look. Good price too.

333
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,760
You're on a budget? I'd go with this one.

334
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,730
Nah, feels a little light.
Got anything heavier?

335
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,260
You want something heavy?
It's definitely the large-frame .44 Magnum.

336
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,140
If anyone gets in your face,
just one shot and they're done.

337
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,770
Daaarn.

338
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,830
Alright, I'll take them all.

339
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,910
Hold up. I don't have them right now.

340
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:18,410
Lobbyists've been cracking down lately.
Some psycho's been waving an Uzi around town.

341
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,300
Jesus.

342
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,590
I bet it's those M-gang guys.

343
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,300
In two months, maybe.

344
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,690
We're hitting tomorrow.

345
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,110
- Alright, at least I have these handguns.
- Fine, I'll take them.

346
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:40,780
I'm giving you a good deal, throwing in
ammo too. Try ‘em out, check the quality.

347
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,050
Acting like he's got a whole arsenal.

348
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,090
Right.

349
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,080
All have the same usage.

350
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,920
Handguns.

351
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,430
Could've just picked these up anywhere.
Why'd I even come all the way here?

352
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,610
Dissing me now?

353
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,140
Alright, alright,
I'll throw in two boxes of bullets.

354
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,140
Security's way lighter than they told us.

355
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,470
Dude, we planned like we're hitting a
national bank. Bit much, don't you think?

356
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,480
So, where's the darn container?

357
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,090
Hold on, it's over here.

358
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,850
You can drive in through here,
but gotta use the east gate.

359
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,110
There're two security posts, rotating shifts.

360
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,270
They walk the route clockwise,
every two hours.

361
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,060
So what, I'm going in alone now?

362
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,110
Feels weird, man.
Like they want us to go in.

363
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,170
Think the Koreans are baiting us?

364
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,250
Could be a setup, man.

365
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,020
But screw it, let's just get it done.

366
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,320
If we can avoid a fight, it's even better.

367
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,320
The question is how.

368
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,120
Boss!

369
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,620
Tian? What are you doing here?

370
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,340
I came to see you, boss!

371
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,100
Wait.

372
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,790
Who's this little punk?

373
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,010
Just a junior of mine. You've met before.

374
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,900
Yeah, looks familiar.

375
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,860
You're the one who got busted
for hacking a bank last year, right?

376
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,990
Darn. I thought you were smart.
Turns out you're just dumb too.

377
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,140
Bet you can't do what I did, though.

378
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,770
What did you say, jerk?

379
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,670
Why are you even here? Go back
to your parents, back to school.

380
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,570
Already did. I got kicked out.

381
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:47,080
So you wanna stay with us now?
What, you think this gym's a charity?

382
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,960
Go home.

383
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,040
Don't give me that sad face.

384
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,170
This drama boy.

385
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,140
Tian, you seriously got nowhere else to go?

386
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,500
I do, but I wanna stay with you, boss.

387
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,550
Your kid?

388
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,860
Must be!

389
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,790
But you gotta finish school, alright?

390
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,660
You do know how smart I am, right?

391
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,180
I'd better teach at school.

392
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,180
I'll go back. After this term's over.

393
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,980
For now, let me stick around with you.

394
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,160
With me?

395
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,440
Hey.

396
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,520
You think you can cut the power at the port?

397
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,700
Just the port? Or the whole city?

398
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,860
Cocky little kid.

399
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,960
So can you do it or not?

400
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,220
No problem.

401
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,810
You know exactly what we want, right?

402
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,770
Yes, Godfather.

403
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,370
Jun-ho, don't let your temper
get the best of you.

404
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,410
The mission matters more
than your ego. Got it?

405
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,080
Understood.

406
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,540
Songmin, you're going with them.

407
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,130
Keep an eye on that Thai guy.
Don't let him steal from me again.

408
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:30,930
Okay.

409
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,420
Now go.

410
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,310
You remember what I told you?

411
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,740
About Songmin and that kid, Sun.

412
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,450
Already taken care of.
I gave my men strict orders.

413
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,290
Good. Go.

414
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,800
Boss, that port runs on
a fully automated computer system.

415
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,570
All we need is someone inside
who manages the network.

416
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,270
We'll bait them with a phishing email,
get inside their system.

417
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,800
Drop in some malware
like a sandworm virus.

418
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,280
And boom, system's ours.

419
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,750
We're blowing stuff up?

420
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,630
Wait, did anyone even get what I just said?

421
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,070
What the heck was that?

422
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,140
Can you speak like a normal human?
You sound like an darn alien.

423
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,660
That was human language.
It's called IT. Ever heard of it?

424
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,890
You troublemaker! How did someone as irritating
as you even get released from prison?

425
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,670
So, is it done or what? We're all waiting here.

426
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,660
It's a complex system.
You think it just hacks itself?

427
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,420
It takes time. Go do what you
usually do, boxing, drinking, whatever.

428
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,080
You ever heard of Marvel?

429
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,690
Mavel? Mangwae? Man-whatever?
What the heck are you talking about?

430
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,410
You watch way too many
cartoons, man. You okay?

431
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,570
Eh,

432
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,450
let me do a formal intro.

433
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,220
This is Peace.

434
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,760
Mr. Joe's son.

435
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,890
Dude, no need to make it that dramatic.

436
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,120
I'm not interested
in knowing those guys anyway.

437
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,540
Whatever.

438
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,400
They're the reason Kong died.

439
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,070
Sun ended up in jail
and all our lives went to hell.

440
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,250
Hey, chill out.

441
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,980
We just gotta finish the job
and part ways. That's it.

442
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,530
Boss, once the power goes out
at the port and backup doesn't kick in,

443
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,190
we've got ten minutes max.

444
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,990
Maintenance crews will show up after
about 12 minutes, according to the map.

445
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,540
We're cutting it close.

446
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,680
Can't we get more time? Just in case?

447
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,220
We already built in
two extra minutes, remember?

448
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,160
Two minutes ain't enough, man.

449
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,420
I can hack machines, not people!

450
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,180
What do you wanna do, Sun?

451
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,180
Let's just wait and see.

452
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,080
Drive, now!

453
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,300
Move!

454
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,390
Got it.

455
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,820
Careful.

456
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
What kinda hack job was that?

457
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,020
You think you're on a fashion runway?

458
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,270
See that area? The red containers?

459
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,380
That zone's for seized cargo
waiting for inspection.

460
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,740
It's like 50 meters to haul stuff from there.

461
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,540
Ready, bro.

462
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,570
Okay, let's do it.

463
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,350
- Three, two.
- One.

464
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,380
What the...

465
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,980
Tian, why is the power still on?

466
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,370
Wait, now! Move!

467
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,190
Let's go! Quick!

468
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,980
Sun, I'll wait outside
in case they try anything.

469
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,900
Okay, bro. Watch our backs.

470
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,750
Got it.

471
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,750
Stay safe, all of you.

472
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,840
Be careful, okay?

473
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,460
Let's find something fun to watch.

474
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,380
That little guy's got an attitude.

475
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Hurry up!

476
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,910
Faster, boss!

477
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,540
I'm hurrying! Chill!

478
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,100
Keep searching!

479
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,040
Try knocking or something, dumbhead.

480
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,700
Knocking for what, man?

481
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,930
You never know, man!

482
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,920
You're trying to invite trouble?

483
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,880
Quiet down, will you?
You're gonna get us caught!

484
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,490
Didn't you say it was here?

485
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,610
Relax, we're close!

486
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,470
Then where the heck is it?

487
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,320
Calm down, dude!

488
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,190
Why are you arguing?

489
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,160
We're looking, aren't we?

490
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,380
You two check the other side.
I'll handle this one.

491
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,810
Keep your eyes open.

492
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,200
Still nothing. It's been three minutes.

493
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,060
Where's your friend?

494
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,070
Almost got it. I think we're close.

495
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,120
Faster!

496
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,960
Got it! The third red container
in the last row!

497
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,330
Alright, I'm heading over!

498
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,240
Sorry for the wait. My bad.

499
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,340
I came a little later than expected.

500
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,860
Sun!

501
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,250
Is this the one?

502
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,100
Open it.

503
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,310
Darn, it's heavy.

504
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,860
Search it.

505
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,860
Be quick!

506
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,700
You stay and keep watch.

507
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,920
- Find anything?
- There's nothing here.

508
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,020
Found it!

509
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,730
Jackpot, baby!

510
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,723
Told ya! Found the right
container and the right stuff.

511
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:21,700
Where would y'all be without me?

512
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,650
Oh, look at you. Carry it yourself then!

513
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,040
Yeah, carry it, hotshot.

514
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,380
Now that we found it, move fast.
Time's running out.

515
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,310
Peace!

516
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,940
What the heck?

517
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,490
You two, keep searching. I'll catch up.

518
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,260
Boss, don't go off-scrip!

519
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,970
What's wrong?

520
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,340
Just go, Tim.

521
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,180
Hurry!

522
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,920
Come on, Peace!

523
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,820
Tim! Move!

524
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,640
Give me a hand! Bring it here, quick!

525
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,990
- Where's Sun?
- He told me to go ahead.

526
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,800
Sun, where the heck are you?
We've got the stuff, come out!

527
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,820
You guys go ahead.
Don't worry about me. Just don't get caught.

528
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,960
Sun! Darn it!

529
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,950
He'll be fine. Let's go!

530
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,370
Go, now!

531
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,780
Move!

532
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,860
We should be in the clear.

533
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,200
You're hurt?

534
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,100
Let's go back.

535
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,840
Missed the best part.

536
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,570
They got away.
Should we report to Mr. Joe?

537
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,380
No. Circle back and pick up
Jun-ho and the others.

538
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,640
Okay.

539
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,950
(Next Episode)
I'm gonna wipe out the Bangkok Boy.

540
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,060
You all know what to do, right?

541
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,250
