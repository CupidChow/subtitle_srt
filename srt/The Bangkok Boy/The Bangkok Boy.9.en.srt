I killed the one who ordered my father's death.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You already hugged Mei.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,080
Can't you hug her big brother too?

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,640
Sorry.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,400
Prang.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,040
Prang.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,080
Prang.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,440
Prang!

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,480
You darn Prang!

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,680
No!

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,680
Hey, Prang! Prang!

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,320
Prang, can you hear me? Prang!

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,200
Prang! Prang! Stay with me!

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,160
What the heck...

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,840
Prang, wake up!
Open your eyes and look at me!

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,160
Why did you do something
so reckless, you idiot?

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,920
Prang.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,350
Prang, calm down, okay?

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,160
Prang.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,320
Darn it.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,780
Hey! Hey, please!

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,660
Please help my friend!

24
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,780
Hey!

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,900
Hey!

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,820
Please help her! She's dying!

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,500
Don't die on me, Prang!

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,820
Family members, please wait outside.

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,860
I'm sorry for your loss.
The patient has passed away.

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,100
What?

33
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,500
This can't be true.

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,140
As you can see,

37
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,540
I'm doing everything your boss asked.

38
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,940
Just give me a little
more time to set up the system.

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,100
From what I see,

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,300
this place is right in the city center.

41
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,940
The previous owner
confirmed it himself.

42
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,700
In terms of safety,

43
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,220
the building's complex and sturdy,

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,500
plus the surrounding community
is under our control.

45
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,580
This building

46
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,900
has been used for
several gray operations.

47
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,540
If it's this good,
why would the old owner let it go?

48
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,180
There are two ways to seal a deal.

49
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,420
Money

50
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,260
or blood.

51
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,700
But I usually choose money.

52
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,420
When can I see my goods?

53
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,420
It depends on

54
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,820
whether what I want is ready yet.

55
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,900
I don't want Mei to be alone.

56
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,660
I don't want
my niece to be alone either.

57
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,620
Oh hey,

58
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,180
You know each other?

59
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,180
This is Cherry, my niece.

60
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,620
This is Cherry's room.
See if you're okay staying here.

61
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Wow, it's completely cleared out.

62
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,420
Guess you didn't
expect me to return.

63
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,140
You never come home anyway.

64
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,980
How can anyone live
at a guard post for so long?

65
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,700
Surrounded by smelly guys.

66
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,170
Ah, ah, ah.

67
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
It's for Mei's sake.

68
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,180
It's vacant anyway.

69
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,260
Stay here and work with me.

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,420
I'll teach you how to make coffee.

71
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,060
Who knows, you might actually like it.

72
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,300
Also,

73
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,660
Sun can visit you every day.

74
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,210
Sure.

75
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,100
Wow, so you're
the one teaching coffee?

76
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,620
Are you that free?

77
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,020
I can teach that part, no problem.

78
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,980
Huh?

79
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,820
Seems like everyone
wants you to stay here.

80
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,340
So, what do you say? Will you stay?

81
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,300
Sure, you can stay with me.
I don't stay in my room much anyway.

82
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,300
Wanna go buy your stuff?
Do you have money though?

83
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,300
How much do you need?
Just text me and I'll transfer.

84
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,640
Shall we go?

85
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,170
Okay.

86
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,100
Let's go shopping.

87
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,420
Wait, wait!

88
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,060
Not going to shower or change first?

89
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,700
Nope. We're off now!

90
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,860
Can you see
the civilization of this country?

91
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,860
A land that never sleeps.

92
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,660
So,

93
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,930
shall we discuss
the details now, Mr. Joe?

94
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,700
Easy now.

95
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,060
Drink and enjoy first.

96
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,580
This is my club.

97
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,260
A full-service club in the heart
of the old capital before Bangkok.

98
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
It includes Thai, Chinese,
and Portuguese trade zones.

99
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,700
I even settled an old community here.

100
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,300
I really love
the multicultural vibe here.

101
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,340
And now, all of this area

102
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,060
is in my hands.

103
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,220
Honestly, I thought I'd finally meet
Mr. Sabid's boss in person today

104
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,300
without needing to
go through a middleman.

105
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,620
We might've reached an agreement

106
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,600
by the first glass of whiskey.
Easy and chill.

107
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,300
It's just that my boss
is a very cautious man.

108
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,300
It's pretty soft.
You'll have a good night's sleep.

109
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,500
Ahh.

110
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,630
Yeah, soft enough.

111
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,750
Come up and sleep here with me.

112
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,120
Well? Comfy?

113
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,820
Mm-hmm. It is.

114
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,680
It's kinda strange.

115
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,780
Why?

116
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,620
Just a few hours ago,

117
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,530
we'd just said goodbye.

118
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,300
I thought I'd never see you again.

119
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,660
Back then,

120
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,100
I lived with my mom.

121
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,200
But after my parents divorced,

122
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,650
they each went their separate ways.

123
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,390
One's in England,

124
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,220
the other is in Australia.

125
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,410
As for me?

126
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,860
I just drifted around
without a real home.

127
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

128
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,580
Mm.

129
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,860
That stuff

130
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,300
doesn't really bother me anymore.

131
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,700
You're really strong, you know?

132
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,100
Being able to handle all that.

133
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,700
Yeah.

134
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,740
What are you doing?

135
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,980
A little trick.

136
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,900
When my parents first split up,

137
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,220
I had to sleep alone.

138
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,880
So I did this

139
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,020
to help me fall asleep.

140
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,290
Why

141
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,650
didn't you go live with one of them?

142
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,200
Mm...

143
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,590
I didn't want to.

144
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,170
I hate living abroad.

145
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,830
Thailand's where it's at.

146
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,100
It's the most comfortable place for me.

147
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm really

148
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,580
glad I got to see you again.

149
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,540
So this is a secret too?

150
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,550
Whoa, are you
missing Mei or something?

151
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,060
Why are you staying
so late today, Uncle?

152
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,140
Oh,

153
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,740
I had to finish the store accounts, pack up,
and wash all the glasses and dishes.

154
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,780
By the time
I get home, it's midnight.

155
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,180
Hmm, but

156
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,070
it doesn't look like your shop has
that many customers. Why are you so busy?

157
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,740
Hey, with a mouth like that,

158
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,020
you're just like Songphoom.

159
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,020
Haha, yes.

160
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,220
So...

161
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
- How's it going upstairs?
- Oh,

162
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,780
they brought stuff back
and ran right up.

163
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,500
Then it went completely quiet.

164
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,580
They're probably having fun.
Both of them found new friends.

165
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,660
But why have I never seen
your niece around here before?

166
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,220
She rarely comes to sleep here.

167
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,860
Always hiding out with
that foundation stuff.

168
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,340
Aren't you worried about her?

169
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,460
Of course I am.

170
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,300
How can you not worry
about your own family?

171
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,700
But according to her ID,

172
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,620
she's already 19.

173
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,380
Cherry has the right to live
her life however she wants,

174
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,980
as long as she doesn't
cause trouble for others.

175
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,380
Or if she does

176
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,460
but doesn't tell me about it,
well, then I can't help, can I?

177
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,260
Uncle.

178
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,260
I...

179
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,420
I know what you're about to say.

180
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,620
Listen, Sun.

181
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,500
Don't rush Mei too much, okay?

182
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,580
Your sister just went
through something really tough.

183
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,220
Give her some time to relax and heal.

184
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,060
You know what?
Your sister's really strong

185
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,740
to have made it
through something like that.

186
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,980
Yes.

187
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,980
Time and experience will show us
what we should do next.

188
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,660
Yes, sir.

189
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,860
Looks like it'll rain hard tonight.

190
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,700
Why's that?

191
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,660
Because with your attitude.
"Yes sir", no arguing. That's not like you.

192
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,440
Yes, sir.

193
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,340
Well then!

194
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,020
Uncle.

195
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,660
I think

196
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,060
I want to

197
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,260
reopen the boxing gym.

198
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,020
Great! Go for it.

199
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,620
Just like you said,

200
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,500
time tells us everything.

201
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,940
Songphoom would be proud

202
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,940
knowing his son owns a boxing gym.

203
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,700
Definitely he will.

204
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,020
Awesome.

205
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,420
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

206
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,620
Nope. Just finished.
Perfect timing.

207
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Mr. Joe.

208
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,420
Don't worry about work.
I'll talk to my boss for you.

209
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,460
You don't have to be concerned.

210
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,820
Much better now.

211
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,530
Come, I'll give you a massage.

212
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,660
Are you sober now?

213
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,980
If you're sober, listen carefully.

214
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,020
What the heck is this, Joe?

215
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Next time you want
to negotiate with me,

216
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,460
please do something concrete.

217
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,780
Don't just talk nonsense.

218
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,780
It's disgusting.

219
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,020
Oh,

220
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,180
and tell your boss that, too.

221
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,300
Don't send useless people
to talk business with me.

222
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,220
I want to deal with people
who have decision-making power only.

223
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,460
Do you hear me?

224
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,260
What happened?

225
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,900
I'm teaching the Arabs
how to play Songkran.

226
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,240
I was afraid he wouldn't know
how to play on the real day.

227
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,180
(MMA Gym - Bangkok Boys)

228
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,110
Finally done.

229
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,660
It's finished!

230
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,620
But I think you cheated.

231
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,860
- Yeah.
- True.

232
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,380
- Bro, fix it now.
- No.

233
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,100
He's cheating and complaining
at the same time. How can he not cheat?

234
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,500
Peace.

235
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,820
Don't mind those narrow-minded
people who can't move on.

236
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,500
Hating one person but taking it
out on another, that's nonsense.

237
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,260
So, what did you bring?

238
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,020
A gift for the gym's opening.

239
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,300
And mine?

240
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,060
You have to read
all the books I gave you first.

241
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,100
Thanks.

242
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,420
Let's sit down.

243
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,860
What's wrong?

244
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,940
- Is it pretty?
- Very pretty.

245
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,100
Very pretty, right?

246
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,100
I'll find a good place to keep it.

247
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,060
Sun, what the heck is this picture?

248
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,180
I told you, you wouldn't
understand it anyway, Kawin.

249
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,900
You don't understand art.

250
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,860
Okay, all done.

251
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,740
Let's celebrate, everyone!

252
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,540
- Eat, eat!
- Eat snacks!

253
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,820
Oh, here you go.

254
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,180
Want some?

255
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,440
So, what do you want to eat?

256
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,060
What are you watching?

257
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,980
Is it really what I think?

258
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,180
Hands,

259
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,940
knees,

260
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,820
feet.

261
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,720
Am I overthinking?
Is it too much?

262
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,890
It's just an ordinary art piece.

263
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,340
Nothing special.

264
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,460
Really?

265
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,630
Well, I'm not a kid anymore.

266
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,160
Don't overthink it.

267
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,620
What is this?

268
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,740
It's a celebration, bro.

269
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,660
These kids.

270
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,500
Come on, bro.

271
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,180
How is it, Mei?

272
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,220
How many coffee recipes
have you made now?

273
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,980
Coffee? I never
got to make any, Peace.

274
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,220
Only Uncle's been making coffee, washing
glasses. Must be stingy with teaching.

275
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,140
- Right, Mei?
- Uh-huh.

276
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,420
Why get defensive for no reason?

277
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,420
No, it's the truth, right, Mei?

278
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,740
Right. Isn't that true, uncle?

279
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,460
Uncle never taught me, so I
couldn't make coffee for Peace.

280
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Here, drink.

281
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Okay.

282
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Peace, want some?

283
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,190
Thanks.

284
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,620
This one's delicious.

285
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,980
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,460
Hurry up.

287
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,700
How is it?

288
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,700
Delicious?

289
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,700
Uh-huh.

290
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,220
Do you like it?

291
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,420
Uh-huh.

292
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,940
Want more?

293
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,380
Yeah, I'm thinking of
talking to you seriously now.

294
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,220
Here, I'm free now. Tell me.

295
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,620
I want to tell you

296
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,980
I'm really thankful to you, man.

297
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,340
That's it? I thought it
was something serious.

298
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,420
I want to thank you for
everything that's happened.

299
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,660
For not leaving us behind.
For always being there for us.

300
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,840
And for trusting us and the Bangkok Boys.

301
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,860
Well, I can't abandon my son.

302
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,700
Let him go. He's just going
to cause more trouble again.

303
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Oh, darn it.

304
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,580
What?

305
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,870
A celebration for the new gym, huh?

306
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,300
Why didn't you invite me, Sun?

307
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,420
Well, it's not surprising.

308
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,260
Even my favorite son showed up

309
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,140
and didn't say a word to me.

310
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,300
It's just a small gym, Mr. Joe.

311
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,580
But it's a good step forward.

312
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,970
Before you can count to ten,
a hundred, or a thousand,

313
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,940
you've got to start with one.

314
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,580
Now that you're already here,

315
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,620
would you like something to drink?

316
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,700
No thanks. I'm heading back.

317
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,860
I just stopped by
to say congratulations.

318
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,140
Oh,

319
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,420
and next week,

320
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,700
I'll be hosting a small party
at my clubhouse.

321
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,220
There'll be a street fight
held there too.

322
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,220
Remember what we talked about?

323
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,940
Yes.

324
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
You and Jun-ho
will get to settle things.

325
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,860
Let the past be the past.

326
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,540
Let's clear it like real men.

327
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,500
Alright.

328
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,220
Alright as in...

329
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,980
You agree? You acknowledge?

330
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,820
I agree.

331
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,340
Great.

332
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,180
But if I beat
Mr. Joe's adopted son,

333
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,060
he has to disappear from here.

334
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,740
You're bold!

335
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,940
And if you lose?

336
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,180
What do I get?

337
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,020
A guy like me never loses.

338
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,460
You're so extreme.

339
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,780
Alright, I'll let you know what I want.

340
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,460
That's a nice piece.

341
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,980
Your work, right, Songmin?

342
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,140
When you get time,
draw one for me too.

343
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,340
What's going on, Sun?

344
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,760
Just one more time.

345
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,820
Let me settle things with Kong.

346
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,580
Cher.

347
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,820
Let's go.

348
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,540
Totally killed the mood, darn it.

349
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,040
(Pad Thai Shop)

350
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,940
How much?

351
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,020
30 million.

352
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,540
Don't joke with me.

353
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,100
We're not joking.

354
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,980
Your organization really
works like a machine, huh?

355
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,660
We're not picky.
We just don't want to be poor.

356
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,900
You work just as hard as we do.

357
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,820
Look at my boys.

358
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,060
All at a growing age.

359
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,540
You took Madam Yao out

360
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,500
without consulting us.

361
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,900
That means you broke our iron rule.

362
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,700
A bit out of the loop, aren't you?

363
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,900
I wasn't the one who did it.

364
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,700
You think we're
kids who'll believe that?

365
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,460
Okay.

366
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,100
So now you're
demanding 30 million

367
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,460
as compensation?

368
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,260
30 million is what you have to pay

369
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,940
if you still want to do business here.

370
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,740
And that's not even counting
Madam Yao's life value we assessed.

371
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
And what if I don't pay?

372
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,580
You can pay.

373
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,620
I can tell from
the value of the plutonium.

374
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,160
Oh,

375
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,920
and also the hackers
you secretly brought in.

376
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,440
But don't forget,

377
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,890
you're not the one in control here.

378
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,920
I mean

379
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,260
if I don't pay right away,
I'm just getting back on my feet too.

380
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,600
I know your organization
is very punctual.

381
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,390
But can you give me a week?

382
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,910
Another 30 million
for Madam Yao's life.

383
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,450
Fine.

384
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,380
But that means we'll
drop the issue about her.

385
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,140
That depends on
whether you'll start more trouble.

386
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,780
Next time,

387
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,030
it won't be settled with money.

388
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,680
If you're not satisfied, move out.

389
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,080
There are plenty of other groups
still doing business with us.

390
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,980
In most cases,

391
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,500
people who deal with you
don't end up well.

392
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,900
Yao,

393
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,460
and Songphoom.

394
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,540
Can I go now?

395
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,240
What is this, Godfather?

396
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,360
These darn parasites.

397
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,240
These are what
they call lobbyists, right?

398
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,160
And where are we supposed
to get the money to pay them?

399
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,690
60 million in just one week?
Can we even pull that off in time?

400
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,270
The most frustrating part

401
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,100
is that whatever we do,

402
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,620
they seem to know everything.

403
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,500
Their eyes and ears
are sharper than a pineapple.

404
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,900
Go handle Madam Yao's
medicine situation ASAP.

405
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,260
Even if we clear it all, the value
of the medicine isn't that high.

406
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,050
Just do as I say.

407
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,820
That'll be 160 baht in total.

408
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,660
Can I use the Sawasdee app discount?

409
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
Sure.

410
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,180
Here you go.

411
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,260
Let me snap a picture
of the code real quick.

412
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,900
With the discount, it's now 150 baht.

413
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,020
Scan to pay, please.

414
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,380
Go ahead and scan.

415
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,500
All set.

416
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,640
Thank you very much.

417
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,140
Hey, Uncle.

418
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,620
Watch this.

419
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,940
Uncle, what are you doing?

420
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,300
I'm going to make
something delicious.

421
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,420
What's that machine, Uncle?

422
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,900
Come on now.

423
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,260
I'm so lucky.

424
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Why's that?

425
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,210
I hired one but got two.

426
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,690
You finished your shift at
the foundation and still came to help me.

427
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,200
You're so hardworking.

428
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,220
Oh Uncle, now you're teasing, huh?

429
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,120
I'm waiting for
this coffee to wake me up.

430
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,750
This siphon coffee maker?
I bought it from overseas.

431
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,420
Normally I don't use it

432
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,850
because it's super expensive.

433
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,220
So how's it different
from the others, Uncle?

434
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,500
To me, it's in the details.

435
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,300
Every second the hot water pushes up
and mixes with the coffee grounds,

436
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,410
it makes me really happy.

437
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,900
Ever heard the phrase,
find joy in trying?

438
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,640
Nope, I don't get it, Uncle.

439
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,900
That's the world of old people.

440
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,260
Complicated like this.

441
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,540
Look, look, it's boiling.

442
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,060
If we made it with a mocha pot,
we'd be drinking already.

443
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,940
Learn to appreciate
the finer things, Cherry.

444
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,060
Okay.

445
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,660
Have you tried it?

446
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,100
Doesn't seem that special to me.

447
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,850
Typical crocodile tongue.

448
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,730
Alright, I'm off to run an errand.

449
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,940
Watch the shop, okay?
Keep an eye on it.

450
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,520
Got it.

451
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,360
This is the first time Uncle
let us watch the shop alone.

452
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,400
Alone? Not really.

453
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,060
Your coffee is ready.

454
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,950
An iced Americano.

455
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,900
This isn't what I ordered.

456
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,380
Oh.

457
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,620
I'm so sorry! We'll make
a new one for you right away.

458
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,810
- Really sorry.
- Sorry.

459
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,600
That kicking technique
looks a bit weird.

460
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,960
From what I see in competitions,
kicks like that don't seem dangerous.

461
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,820
Yeah, because
it's for scoring points.

462
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,740
You don't need to hit hard.
Just be quick and precise.

463
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,100
But if it's Korean
military training,

464
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,650
that's a whole different level.

465
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,300
Did you train like that?

466
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,620
Our dad's a soldier.
He definitely passed it on to me.

467
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,700
Then how do we deal with that?

468
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,780
What's this?

469
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:28,930
Me, of course.

470
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,210
What do you mean?

471
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,060
I've got a black belt.

472
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,870
A black belt, huh?

473
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,220
Alright, but can we do it another day?

474
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,510
Today I promised to
take Mei to a birthday party.

475
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,770
Let me take a shower first.

476
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,260
Let's go.

477
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,980
You think you're so tough?
So tough? So tough?

478
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,380
What's this? You're selling
drugs to compete with my gang?

479
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,700
Where'd you get them?

480
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,540
Huh?

481
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,740
Come on, Jack,
I told you everything already.

482
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,260
It was that Korean kid who's selling them.

483
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,180
You know this is my turf, right?
And you still dare?

484
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,280
Sorry, man.

485
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,740
The price was too tempting.
I couldn't resist.

486
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,460
Couldn't resist?
Couldn't resist? Couldn't resist?

487
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,820
Couldn't resist? Couldn't resist?

488
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,980
Hurting my customers like this.

489
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,420
Who's going to dare
buy from me again?

490
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,860
My dad gave me this turf.

491
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,610
Your dad gave it to you,
but that doesn't mean

492
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,780
I gave it to you too.

493
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,150
So what?

494
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,880
You want trouble? I don't mind.

495
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,020
I'd love to rush in
and smash you right now.

496
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,460
But I've got to save my strength
to crush your little brother.

497
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,710
I've been wanting to smash him
for ages. He pisses me off so bad.

498
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,200
The son of the great Mr. Songphoom.

499
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,760
Hey Sun, no later than 11 PM, okay?

500
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,980
Can't it be midnight?

501
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,160
No, no, no. Eleven means eleven.

502
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,340
Okay.

503
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,980
Then let's go.

504
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,820
Let's go.

505
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,860
Yay!

506
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,430
Hello.

507
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,270
Bye.

508
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,120
Bye.

509
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,340
Uncle, are you stressed
about something?

510
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,020
The match is in a day or two.

511
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,940
And you're acting
like nothing's happening.

512
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,660
Well, it's Mei's birthday. I just
wanted to take her out somewhere.

513
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,460
It was hard enough to
get everyone together like this.

514
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,300
Please, Uncle. It's only once a year.

515
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,060
- I'm heading out now.
- Oh!

516
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,100
Sun, let's just go. Old people don't
understand this kind of stuff. Let's go.

517
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,870
- I'm off then.
- Let's all go.

518
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,630
Let's go.

519
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,660
Let's go, Sun.

520
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,700
Ready?

521
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,430
- Ready!
- Where should we go?

522
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,700
- Chinatown.
- Okay.

523
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,660
Chinatown, let's go!

524
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,120
Go, Peace, let's go!

525
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,020
(Long-lasting Bless)

526
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,060
(Scala)

527
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,460
(Bird Nest & Desssert Restaurant)

528
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,660
You just keep complaining.

529
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,220
Why'd you have to park so far?

530
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,460
Didn't hear you
complain when we got here.

531
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,500
Come on.

532
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,540
Can we take a break?

533
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,620
Hello, Jinny?

534
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,980
Calm down, Jinny.

535
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,840
Listen to me carefully.

536
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,350
Stay inside the house
and lock all the doors.

537
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,380
I'll get to you as fast as I can.

538
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,740
What happened, Sun?

539
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,860
Jack's in the ICU right now.

540
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,910
(Next Episode)
If you lose or refuse to fight,

541
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,100
I'll send him
back to study in England

542
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,860
