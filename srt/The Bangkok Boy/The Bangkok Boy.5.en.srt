2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,640
(Previously)
What were your feelings

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,640
when you took that photo?

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,520
Why don't you ask your friend?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,840
That friend of mine passed away.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,120
This place isn't the same anymore.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,240
Where did you take Mei?

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,360
Are you going to speak?

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,200
Aim...

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,080
I know now where he took Mei.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,800
I'm glad you came to visit, Mei.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,080
Why is your face so bruised?

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,400
And why was it so hard
to get in to visit?

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,120
It's been four months, Sun.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,920
I had a bit of trouble

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,400
inside.

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,130
That's why the warden didn't approve.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,920
And how are you, Mei?

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,800
Are you doing okay?

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,720
What kind of "okay"?

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,320
Studying

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,240
and working?

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,440
Working.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,920
Jack won't pay my tuition.

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
He said Dad's business
is completely ruined.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,760
If I want to study,
I have to earn the money myself.

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,920
Calm down, Mei.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,360
I'll be out soon.

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,080
You'll be out soon, Sun?

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,400
You'll be out soon?

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,880
Are you crazy?

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,440
You haven't even reached the first year!

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,840
Those guys killed Kong!

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,760
Why aren't they suffering at all?

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,720
Mei.

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,200
I have no one left, Sun.

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,760
There's no one left for me.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,240
Two minutes left.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,640
The reason I came today

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,120
is because I wanted to tell you

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,520
I'm moving away.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
Mei, don't go live out there.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,080
It's dangerous outside.

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,800
I'll be 18 in a few months.

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm old enough to make
my own decisions, right?

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,760
And I still have Tan.

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't worry about me.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Mei.

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
Wait, Mei.

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
- Mei!
- Time's up.

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,280
- Mei!
- Go!

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,480
Can you wait for me, Mei?

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,280
- Time's up.
- When I get out,

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,080
we can figure things out together.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,240
It doesn't feel
the same anymore, Sun.

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,920
Not since Dad was gone.

57
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,480
- Go!
- Mei!

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,560
Mei! Wait for me, Mei!

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
Mei!

60
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,260
"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 5)

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,960
Sun.

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,480
What's going on?

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,720
Sorry, I've got
something urgent to deal with.

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,960
You go ahead.

65
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
Tim, open it!

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
Be careful, man.

67
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,560
Tim, are you sure Mei is here?

68
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm sure.

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,520
I tracked down Mei's ex.

70
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,680
He sold her to Aim.

71
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,410
Crap!

72
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,120
But I'm not sure

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,880
which part of the building she's in.

74
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,840
Then let's split up to search.

75
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,000
It'll be faster.

76
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,320
And keep quiet.

77
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,440
Bro, I think
we should change the plan.

78
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,680
Who's that?

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
My friend. We'll talk later.

80
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
Mei.

81
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,480
Bro! I'll leave her to you.

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
Go!

83
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,860
Bro!

84
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,690
Hurry!

85
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,400
Mei!

86
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Mei!

87
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Mei!

88
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,720
Bro!

89
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,200
- Mei.
- How is she?

90
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
- Mei!
- Crap, she can't take this anymore.

91
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,960
Mei!

92
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
She's completely out of it, bro.

93
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,360
Hey! Don't come any closer.

94
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Stay back.

95
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,580
(EXIT)

96
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,760
That jerk Aim.

97
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Please take care of Mei.

98
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,120
You jerk, Aim!

99
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,400
What did you do to Mei?

100
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,100
How much detail do you want, Sun?

101
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,680
Mr. Aim, sir.

102
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,620
The lobbyists are targeting you
for gun use. You can't use a gun, sir.

103
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,980
Who told you to speak?

104
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,580
But

105
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,220
come to think of it,

106
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,060
your little sister is

107
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,220
pretty tasty.

108
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,460
You jerk!

109
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,980
That's all you've got, huh?

110
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,460
Don't come any closer, you jerk.

111
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,700
- Come on!
- Bring it on.

112
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,540
Come!

113
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,620
Is that all you've got in a kick?

114
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,140
My neighbor's grandma
kicks harder than you!

115
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,540
The cops are here!

116
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,460
We better bounce.

117
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,220
Go!

118
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,740
Hey!

119
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
You guys, go home!

120
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,260
You!

121
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,900
You're lucky today, jerk.

122
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,100
You want more?

123
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,860
- Darn you!
- Let go of me!

124
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,580
We have to go.

125
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,500
You'll see me again!

126
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,180
Worry about your sister first.

127
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,100
You'll see me again!

128
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,540
Mei.

129
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,180
Mei.

130
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,210
Mei.

131
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,700
Mei, listen to me. Mei.

132
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,930
Mei, get a grip. Mei.

133
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,700
- Mei.
- Don't touch me!

134
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
Mei, just listen to me.

135
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,220
Take her to the hospital quickly.

136
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,940
We'll get back on our own.

137
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,620
Thank you so much.

138
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,540
I'll call you later.

139
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,380
Mei, I'll go get the car.

140
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,380
Let's go, Mei! Hurry!

141
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,780
Calm down.

142
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,620
Mei.

143
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,380
Mei.

144
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Hurry, Tan!

145
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,820
Faster, go!

146
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,700
- Mei.
- Go, go, go!

147
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,100
Help! Help!

148
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,020
Watch her head! Watch her head!

149
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,780
Please help us!

150
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,090
Mei!

151
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,180
Who's the patient's relative?

152
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,110
I am.

153
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,420
What's wrong with the patient?

154
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,100
Uh...

155
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,940
What's wrong with you?

156
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,840
Bro?

157
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,340
What's wrong with the patient?

158
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,060
She overdosed.

159
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Are you sure?

160
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,820
My sister went into shock from drugs.

161
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,900
You! Miss!

162
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,860
Let's get her in the car now.

163
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,540
Take her up for first aid.

164
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,220
Mei.

165
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,300
Hang in there, Mei.

166
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,260
Go! Get in!

167
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,140
Please stay back.

168
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
You're obstructing the staff.

169
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,740
We have a lot of work to do.

170
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,740
Thank you.

171
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,340
Let's go.

172
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,180
(Ambulance)

173
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,020
What kind of hospital is this?

174
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,340
Follow them. Hurry!

175
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Go, go, go!

176
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,420
(Emergency)

177
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,620
Time: 21:00.

178
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,420
The patient was
brought in unconscious.

179
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,700
Relatives suspect

180
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,900
a drug overdose.
She's been given first aid.

181
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,940
But she's not responding well.

182
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,780
Fentanyl again, huh?

183
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,460
Third case this week.

184
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,420
(Emergency - Accident)

185
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,700
- Hey, how is she?
- She's my sister.

186
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,540
Calm down, please.

187
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,620
Please calm down.

188
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,820
The doctor is treating her right now.

189
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
But you

190
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,340
can't make noise in here.

191
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,660
Doctors and nurses
need to concentrate.

192
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,300
Oh, and you'll need to register
your sister's medical records.

193
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,780
Okay.

194
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,900
Also, the police will be coming.

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,860
What?

196
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,820
Why are the police involved?

197
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,900
I have to report this to the police.

198
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,060
Whether right or wrong,

199
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,660
you'll need to speak with them.

200
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,900
People forced to take drugs
have to go to jail too?

201
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,300
Let's hope

202
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,660
that your sister
will only be sent to rehab.

203
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,140
So what exactly happened?

204
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,380
How did your sister
end up overdosed like that?

205
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,220
Anyway, I'll excuse myself now.

206
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,140
Where are you going?

207
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,580
Your sister's
not the only case tonight.

208
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,020
Excuse me.

209
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,060
Thank you.

210
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,560
Mei.

211
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,640
Hey, hey, Sun.

212
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,540
Calm down, man.

213
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,340
Hey.

214
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,860
Register her first.

215
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,620
Let's go.

216
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,540
Chill, man.

217
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,660
Hey.

218
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,700
How's Mei doing?

219
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,740
She's safe now.

220
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,060
She's with the doctors.

221
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,620
That's a relief.

222
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,860
So now,

223
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,820
what do we do next?

224
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,580
The doctor said

225
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,540
Mei has to go to rehab.

226
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,820
Her addiction is quite severe.

227
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,140
Is she still in the ER now?

228
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,940
Yeah.

229
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,300
But they'll probably move her
to another ward soon.

230
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,140
Hey.

231
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,060
I think you should

232
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,060
go home, shower, get dressed,

233
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,220
and take a nap.

234
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,540
You had a rough day yesterday too.

235
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,540
You really stink, you know.

236
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,500
Do I? Really?

237
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,140
But I'm still okay. I can take it.

238
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,260
I can stay here.

239
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,380
Sun.

240
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,740
If you were my little brother,

241
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,900
I'd tell you to just
listen to me and stop being stubborn.

242
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,500
Tim and I will handle things here.

243
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,940
Don't worry.

244
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,460
Come back in the evening if you want.

245
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,300
Go on.

246
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,380
Get some rest.

247
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,300
Thanks a lot, bro.

248
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,420
Don't mention it.

249
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,980
Take care of her, alright?

250
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,700
See you.

251
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,240
Aim!

252
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,530
What the heck are you doing here?

253
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,180
This is a hospital, you know.

254
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,860
Are you so used to using force, huh?

255
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,580
What do you want?

256
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,700
Talking like that
hurts my feelings, you know.

257
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,140
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

258
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,900
During the three years
you were in prison,

259
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,780
I took good care of
your beloved little sister.

260
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,620
I took care of her

261
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,020
every inch and corner.

262
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,780
You jerk.

263
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,300
You heinous villain,
I'm going to kill you!

264
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,860
Alright.

265
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,820
I'm here to warn you.

266
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,140
I'm warning you out of goodwill.

267
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,580
To make you realize something

268
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,540
that the only reason you're still
alive today is because of what?

269
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,980
What the heck are you rambling about?

270
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,020
Wanna continue from
where we left off yesterday?

271
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,980
Huh?

272
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,020
Mr. Sun.

273
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,740
The son of Mr. Songphoom,
the powerful mafia boss.

274
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,980
I always forget this part.

275
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,580
The former mafia boss.

276
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,020
The reason
you're still alive today

277
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,700
isn't because you're strong

278
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,300
or you're some kind of badass.

279
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,020
It's because the scriptwriter
still has a role for you.

280
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,540
And the moment your role ends,

281
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,300
me,

282
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,900
just a slum kid, that's all.

283
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,380
I'm the one who's going to kill you.

284
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,460
Oh!

285
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,180
Want to head back together?

286
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,100
I'll give you a ride.

287
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,460
Darn it!

288
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,660
Darn it!

289
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,380
Why the heck
did you turn off your phone?

290
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,860
Oh, bro.

291
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,060
My phone died. I didn't charge it.

292
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,100
Sorry, bro.

293
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,380
I already took Mei
to the recovery room.

294
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,660
Then

295
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,300
who handled the hospital bill?

296
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,700
Here.

297
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,140
No need to pay it anymore.

298
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,500
What's this?

299
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,460
A bonus.

300
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,300
Bonus? What bonus?

301
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,740
Tim picked it up from that room.

302
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,580
Yeah.

303
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,420
I counted it. Over 90,000 baht.

304
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,500
Over 90,000?

305
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,260
Even after covering Mei's expenses.

306
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,020
It's probably drug money.

307
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,100
So...

308
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,340
what are we doing with that money?

309
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,620
This means we've started
a war with that jerk Aim.

310
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,460
He showed up
at the hospital that day too.

311
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,740
- Huh?
- Huh?

312
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,740
Crap, why the heck was he there?

313
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,180
And why didn't you tell us?

314
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,100
Let's split the money.

315
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,060
I'm not taking any.

316
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,740
Huh?

317
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,300
What about you?

318
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,900
Aren't we splitting it equally?

319
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,100
I already got Mei back.

320
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,620
That's already a huge bonus for me.

321
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,500
Take the money
and split it among yourselves.

322
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,980
Darn, I'm touched.

323
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,140
Respect.

324
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,260
If I'm really
starting a war with Aim's gang,

325
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,220
would you and Tim be in?

326
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,060
If you're going to take that risk,

327
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,460
you better make sure it's worth it.

328
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,900
After what he did to Mei,

329
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,300
I can't live in
the same world as him anymore.

330
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,380
Not to mention all
the junkies they created.

331
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,580
I'll wipe them all out.

332
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,380
We'll rob them until
they're too scared to sell anywhere.

333
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,540
And the money we take

334
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,580
will be our wages. Split it evenly.

335
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,340
You said you
couldn't touch me yet, right?

336
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,820
I'll be watching.

337
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,260
Let's see how long you can hold back.

338
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,460
Hey.

339
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,380
You heard the news about Sun?

340
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,700
Total chaos.

341
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,300
He deserves a round of applause.

342
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,300
What do you think?

343
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,740
Aim's money is gone.

344
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,180
They'll definitely
be hunting Sun down.

345
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,860
But why don't you think

346
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,380
Sun might be hunting them instead?

347
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,260
Nap.

348
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,700
Have you ever thought
about the day we'd all regroup again?

349
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,660
Hey, where are you going?

350
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,340
(Yunnan Restaurant)

351
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,380
What the heck are you wearing?

352
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,420
It's not that weird, is it?

353
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,140
Yeah, whatever.

354
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,660
So how's Mei doing?

355
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,420
She's getting better.

356
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,740
The doctor said she'll probably
be moved to a drug rehab center soon.

357
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,620
That's good.

358
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,300
But it'd be better
if you hadn't abandoned her.

359
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,460
Who are we meeting?

360
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,260
Someone

361
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,620
very well-connected.

362
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,060
And he respected our father a lot.

363
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,580
He wants our family
to rise to greatness again.

364
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,420
You sure you're not being used?

365
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,140
You're always like this.

366
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,500
You're always like this.

367
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,420
Mr. Joe.

368
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,300
Mr. Joe?

369
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,810
You coming?

370
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,660
Let's go.

371
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,740
I called him here myself.

372
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,500
We've got a big job to do.

373
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,620
Let's go.

374
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,140
Thailand is great.

375
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,540
You can find food
from any cuisine here.

376
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:23,700
(Jindu Restaurant)

377
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,340
Oh! Come in.

378
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,380
Welcome, welcome.

379
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,900
Nice to meet the son of
a man who could be called a legend.

380
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,500
What the...

381
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,820
Hey, Sun, what are you doing?

382
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,140
Have you two had problems before?

383
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,620
What's up, Jun-ho?

384
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm going to kill him.

385
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,500
This is Jack.

386
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,360
Sir.

387
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,220
And this is Sun.

388
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,220
Sir.

389
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,740
Sun.

390
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,740
I've seen your skills before.

391
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,620
It's not bad at all.

392
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,260
Now then,

393
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,060
what's your issue with Jun-ho here?

394
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,420
Okay.

395
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,460
Let's just say

396
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,980
kids will be kids.

397
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,900
It's normal to

398
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,140
butt heads sometimes.

399
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,140
Let's consider it
just stretching your muscles.

400
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,980
Now that you've met today,

401
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,940
maybe you'll
work together in the future.

402
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,860
A man with a big heart

403
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,060
won't hold a grudge over
something small. Right, Sun?

404
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,740
Sorry for being late.

405
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,820
Did those two know each other before?

406
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,500
What a small world.

407
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,180
Not exactly, Dad.

408
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,060
Now I don't even know which pair I should
try to smooth things over with first.

409
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,940
Come on.

410
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,300
Let's drink.

411
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,900
I guess I should
introduce my sons to you.

412
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,620
These two are
the sons of Mr. Songphoom.

413
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,700
Mr. Songphoom

414
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,060
used to be a very
influential figure in this area.

415
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,660
But three years ago,
something unexpected happened.

416
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,940
He passed away.

417
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,780
After that, his family
disappeared from the scene.

418
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,980
We got into the business
months after he died.

419
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,460
All we've heard are stories.

420
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,060
But they're stories I truly admire.

421
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,500
Excuse me,
I need to use the restroom.

422
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,820
This kid...

423
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,620
What's up with him?

424
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,140
Come on, let's keep talking.

425
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,580
Where have you been, huh?

426
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,340
You didn't answer my calls.

427
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Didn't reply to my messages either.
Do you know how worried I was?

428
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,540
Things have been
hectic at home lately.

429
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,060
Hectic?

430
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,860
You mean art stuff

431
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,900
or your Korean mafia work?

432
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,140
You'd better
stay out of our business.

433
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,420
Just a warning.

434
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,860
I didn't want to get
involved in the first place.

435
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,420
But your brother

436
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,260
killed Kong.

437
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,380
It's not just my brother who can kill Kong.
My dad can kill you too.

438
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,380
Turn down my father's offer.

439
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,500
Or you'll regret it.

440
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,860
Regret?

441
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,340
You saw what happened to Mei.

442
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,220
One way or another,
we'll be working for your dad.

443
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,740
And one day,

444
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,940
your dad will
help us get revenge on Aim.

445
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,020
And next in line, Jun-ho.

446
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,020
Your brother.

447
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,980
Why make things complicated?

448
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,150
We could just kill each other today.

449
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,260
You will

450
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,420
never understand
the pain we've been through.

451
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,820
Such a shame.

452
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,300
I really thought we'd get along well.

453
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,350
If the chance comes,

454
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,100
shall we arrange
a rematch for this pair, Jack?

455
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,940
My kids

456
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,140
are all from the black belt line.

457
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,220
Mr. Joe is, too.

458
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,140
Actually, my little brother
was just messing around.

459
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,900
His skills aren't that high yet.

460
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,020
But what I saw
the other day in Arcade Alley

461
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,060
wasn't ordinary at all, Sun.

462
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,820
I accept the challenge.

463
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,020
Great.

464
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,060
Then once this job's done,

465
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,620
let's make it happen.

466
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,380
Cheers.

467
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,220
You take the big guy.

468
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,020
I'll handle the two smaller ones.

469
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
You sure about that?

470
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,740
This time,

471
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,060
run!

472
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,340
I'm out.

473
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,100
Hey, Jack!

474
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,180
What the heck is
this supposed to mean?

475
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,380
Weren't these jerks
the ones who got Sun thrown in jail?

476
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,420
Calm down, Tan.

477
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,340
What's done is done.

478
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,460
Right now,
we should focus on the business.

479
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,300
These guys aren't that great.

480
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,060
But that one,
I'll definitely settle it with him.

481
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,020
Anytime, man.

482
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,220
Hey, come on.
We're all on the same side now.

483
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,420
We'll take our leave for now.

484
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,620
Tim, I told you to take the big guy.

485
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,000
(Yunnan Restaurant)
And I'd take the two smaller ones.

486
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,090
Three against two?
Who can handle that?

487
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,060
Run!

488
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,900
So what's the plan then,
about the job?

489
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,040
What do I have to do?

490
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,060
Simple stuff. Nothing complicated.

491
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,740
But you'll need two
or three guys you can trust.

492
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,340
You've got them, right?

493
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,220
Yeah, I guess I do.

494
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,180
I know this job doesn't
really matter that much to you.

495
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,500
But Mr. Joe made a promise

496
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,820
that he'd give us back
Dad's old territory to manage.

497
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,740
But there's something you'll
care about even more than that.

498
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,300
Then just say it.

499
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,140
If we pull this off, Mr. Joe promised to bring
the person who killed our father to us.

500
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,260
Remember Madam Yao?

501
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,260
The one who ruined Dad's funeral?

502
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,460
Mr. Joe wants to play dirty too.

503
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,220
And he's backing us.

504
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,860
I only ask one thing,

505
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,220
don't screw this up.

506
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,580
Screw what up?

507
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,540
That adopted son
of Mr. Joe, obviously.

508
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,020
About that matter,

509
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,380
I'll deal with him for sure.

510
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,220
But not now.

511
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,400
Come on, bro.

512
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,040
Let's head back. See you at the gym.

513
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,060
Alright. Let's go, you little runt.

514
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,980
You owe me spicy skewers.

515
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,820
There's a stall
right up ahead, ten baht.

516
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,860
Wow, you're broke as heck.

517
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,900
Watch your back.

518
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,540
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

519
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,860
Man, the atmosphere
was tense as heck.

520
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,100
And you're the only one cracking jokes.

521
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,340
(Peace, where have you been?
We were worried. We couldn't reach you.)

522
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,860
(Mei's at the rehab center,
in case you want to visit.)

523
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,780
Jihoon.

524
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,780
Given the current situation,

525
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,580
what do you think?

526
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,740
Madam Yao.

527
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,850
Since Songphoom died,

528
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,860
she's been isolating herself.
Almost no one can reach her.

529
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,260
Back then, she and Songphoom
were like armor for each other.

530
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,320
Now, she's only got
Aim as her right-hand man,

531
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,640
always taking the lead for her.

532
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,260
So, what's your plan?

533
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,380
Songphoom's kids will settle
their father's score themselves.

534
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,860
Jihoon,

535
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,620
tell your people to get ready.

536
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,780
And get ready to be rewarded.

537
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,340
What was the name again?

538
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,620
Aim, right?

539
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,140
Yes.

540
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,180
Songmin.

541
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,700
I don't know
when you two got involved.

542
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,940
But I know exactly
what kind of person you are.

543
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,860
Don't you dare disgrace this family.

544
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,700
You will give me a Jo heir.

545
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,060
And if you ever think of
messing this up again,

546
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,500
I'll change the plan

547
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,620
and kill them all right away.

548
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,020
Jihoon.

549
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,660
Keep a close eye on Songmin
and that boy named Sun.

550
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,660
Yes, sir.

551
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,740
Why are you getting up?

552
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,660
You jerks, get lost!

553
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,460
Go!

554
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,900
That's enough, go!

555
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,090
Cops are coming.

556
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,660
Darn it!

557
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
Get up.

558
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,100
Wake up! Hey!

559
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,140
Listen to me.

560
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,420
Tell your boss

561
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,940
that the one who messed you guys up

562
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,500
is named Sun.

563
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,540
And Tim too!

564
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,980
Trying to act cool, huh?

565
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,560
Let's go.

566
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,540
Aim's gonna come after you for sure.

567
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,660
Be ready for it.

568
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,900
That's exactly what I want.

569
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,460
You can't even handle
something this small?

570
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,660
Actually, I could've
handled it just fine.

571
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,660
Just followed your orders.

572
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Who are they?

573
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,660
You really want me to say it?

574
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,860
Say it!

575
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,620
The youngest son of Songphoom

576
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,180
is named Sun.

577
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,820
And why do they dare?

578
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,300
Mr. Joe is probably backing them.

579
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,260
Darn you, Joe.
How far are you trying to push me?

580
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,100
(Calling L)

581
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,780
Once the profit's gone,
they all disappear.

582
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,020
Honestly, I could solve

583
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,220
all of your problems, Madam.

584
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,180
Just say the word.

585
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,580
You're still hesitating.

586
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,060
For now, tell the boys
to just take Sun's beatings.

587
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,660
Hey, go get a cloth.

588
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,700
(Parking Lot)

589
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,690
Let's go.

590
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,000
Am I looking good?

591
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,440
You look great.

592
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,580
Put your cap away too.

593
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,540
Do I have to teach you everything?

594
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,820
(Filling out form for new ID)

595
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,100
Mei.

596
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,460
Tan and Tim came to visit.

597
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,940
Hey, how are you feeling? Any better?

598
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,540
When will I get out?

599
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,380
Uh, well...

600
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,620
If the doctor confirms you're safe,
and there are no complications,

601
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,180
then I'll take you to...

602
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,600
See Moo Deng! Moo Deng!

603
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,760
Moo Deng's like a buffalo now.

604
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,500
I'll take you to

605
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,580
a drug rehabilitation center.

606
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,100
Why worry about me now?

607
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,140
If you're feeling better,

608
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,620
I'll bring you to live with me.

609
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,540
You will get to go back to school
and start a new life.

610
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,980
Isn't that a good thing?

611
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,020
It's already broken.

612
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,980
It can't be fixed anymore.

613
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,980
The only thing to do is throw it away.

614
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,340
You go back.

615
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,460
I want to be alone.

616
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,340
Get some rest.

617
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,740
We're going.

618
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,260
Let her rest.

619
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,980
Hey, what about the hippo?

620
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,140
How'd it turn into a buffalo?

621
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,220
Hey,

622
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,280
I was insulting you, not the hippo.

623
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,490
You've grown into a buffalo
and still don't get it?

624
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,780
Hey, Sun.

625
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,710
About Mei's boyfriend,

626
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,460
I sent him to
the police like you asked.

627
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,380
Thanks, man.
I'll handle the rest myself.

628
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,620
Let go!

629
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,980
Don't! Please!

630
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,870
Help! Somebody help!

631
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,870
Go.

632
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,220
What are you doing?

633
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,900
I need to pee. Going to the bathroom.

634
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,680
Want me to help?

635
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,260
Let me know when you're done.

636
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,980
Hey.

637
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,260
Hey.

638
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,140
That's him.

639
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,260
The guy we saw just now,

640
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,700
his name's Tan.

641
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,500
After Songphoom's son went to jail,

642
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,300
I made sure
he stayed away from this family.

643
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,420
But it seems like
he's not afraid anymore.

644
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,460
You've lost your influence, Aim.

645
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,620
But we can be certain

646
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,460
that the son of Songphoom
who went to jail three years ago

647
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,460
is the leader of this gang.

648
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,180
Do you want me to
take care of it now, Madam?

649
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,340
One, two! One, two!

650
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,260
One hook!

651
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,020
Kick!

652
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,460
Kick!

653
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,860
Bro.

654
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,180
I got it.

655
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,900
Who's that?

656
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,660
Bro.

657
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,220
Tim.

658
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,940
Tim!

659
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,380
Hey, you're not answering me.
Are you mute or something?

660
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,140
Wait here for a bit.

661
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,380
So you've made up your mind, right?

662
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,780
Not exactly.

663
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,480
You're dragging this out too long.

664
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,100
Kawin, you're a schemer.

665
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,500
Whatever it is, let's just
talk it out openly. Be real.

666
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,300
Come on, Tan.

667
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,780
It's top secret, you know?

668
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,060
You really want me to
spill it all right here?

669
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,020
What you guys are doing right now

670
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,180
is just small fry stuff.

671
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:13,810
Shall we go for it?

672
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,760
Hey, calm down.

673
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,360
What exactly do you mean?

674
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,180
Just wait here.

675
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,020
Let's go.

676
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,260
Always putting on a big show, huh?

677
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,660
So?

678
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,940
Well, the small-time
targets you've been hitting,

679
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,900
they showed me something.

680
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,220
What did you see? Just say it.

681
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,540
Ever since you guys started
hitting Madam Yao's crew,

682
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,660
they haven't been able to rest easy.

683
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,260
They've mobilized people
into the city like crazy.

684
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,140
But I've already made my choice.

685
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,540
They're being super cautious now.

686
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,880
There are people at every spot.

687
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,760
And we've only got these men.

688
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:15,900
Coordinates.

689
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,220
Coordinates for what?

690
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,180
The stash point for their drug money.

691
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,040
They're pooling money from all locations

692
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,660
into this one spot.

693
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,260
Some is turned into banknotes,

694
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,260
nicely packed in bags.

695
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,180
Some goes out as bribes,

696
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,940
and another portion is
spread across tourist cities

697
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,140
to be laundered.

698
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,900
So that's how it is.

699
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,100
And ever since they started
mobilizing people into the city,

700
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,260
that stash point

701
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,740
will be guarded by
no more than five people.

702
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,460
You really think big, huh?

703
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,260
Well, you want to
take down the drug gang,

704
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,620
and I want the money.

705
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,180
Win-win, right?

706
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:02,940
Exactly.

707
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,980
And one more thing,

708
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,140
if you strike them this time,

709
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,220
they'll be so shaken that Madam Yao
will have to come out and deal with it herself.

710
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:15,460
At first, I thought you guys
were working with Madam Yao.

711
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,500
Oh please.

712
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,780
I was just trying to survive, man.

713
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,580
Honestly, I hate those jerks
just as much as you do.

714
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,020
Oh yeah.

715
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,260
That darn Nap.

716
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,700
Nap? That jerk?

717
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,980
Yeah, he's the one
who told me about this.

718
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,380
Said he knows someone on the inside.

719
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,620
That's perfect.

720
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,300
Hey! Sun, what should we do?

721
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,900
Should we go in?

722
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,700
Let's go.

723
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,620
Hey.

724
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,380
Let's hit them.

725
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:06,700
Stop right there!

726
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,180
Hey!

727
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,460
Stop.

728
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,500
What the heck is this?

729
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,100
What the heck is this?

730
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,690
How should I know?

731
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,340
Hey!

732
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,340
Hey, what the heck?

733
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,860
Hey.

734
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,260
Hey.

735
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,780
It's all done now, sir.

736
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,860
(Next Episode)
What will you get from entering this competition?

737
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,700
Freedom.

738
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,820
Because this job has
to be done in absolute silence.

739
