(Sponsored by)

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,680
(Previously)
Someone like me will never lose.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,360
You're so extreme.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,920
The son of the great Mr. Songphoom.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,400
Jack is in the ICU now.

6
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,900
This tattoo will show your status
and that you're one of us.

7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,660
You will dedicate the rest
of your life to our cause.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,980
Do you know why I chose
this spot for your tattoo?

9
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,180
Because from now on,
I will never bow my head to anyone.

10
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,980
You and your loved ones
will live comfortably for life

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,140
if we're backing you.

12
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,980
Just do your job well.

13
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,580
=The Bangkok Boy=

14
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,300
Nurse, I'm a relative
of Pharada Leepongpan.

15
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,580
Just a moment, please.

16
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,900
How is Pharada Leepongpan?

17
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,610
Okay.

18
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,620
Please wait,
the doctor is treating him now.

19
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,860
Nurse.

20
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,980
I'm here to place
Mr. Pharada Leepongpan under custody.

21
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,080
Jinny, it's me, Sun.

22
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,020
Jinny.

23
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,900
Can you hear me? It's Sun.

24
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,900
Jinny.

25
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,940
It's okay, I'm here now.

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,620
Don't cry.

27
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,900
While you were home alone,
did anyone come around causing trouble?

28
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,420
Jack

29
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
told me to close the shop early.

30
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,820
He said he had
something to take care of.

31
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,940
So he told me to shower
and go to my room.

32
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,260
Around 10 PM,
the hospital called and said...

33
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,100
Okay.

34
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,420
It's alright.

35
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,820
Now go pack your clothes quickly.

36
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,100
Tonight you're staying with Mei.

37
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,110
I'm worried about Jack.

38
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,660
Don't worry.

39
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,160
Mei is already at the hospital now.

40
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,180
Don't worry, okay?

41
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,260
I want to see Jack.

42
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,380
It's very late, Jin.
You can go tomorrow.

43
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,670
Come on.

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,620
Go pack your things.

45
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,300
Enough for a night or two.

46
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,880
Go.

47
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,460
Trust me. Go now.

48
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,500
Hey!

49
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,420
Why aren't you guys going in?

50
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,780
The place is swarming with cops.
We're afraid it'll get messy if we go in.

51
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,340
Tan is inside checking
with the police station.

52
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,860
Hold on.

53
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,740
Hello?

54
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,260
Hello Tim, someone reported
that Jack is a drug dealer.

55
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,620
Okay, got it.

56
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,060
What the heck now?

57
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,140
Someone reported
Jack for drug dealing.

58
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,020
How could that be?

59
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,700
Hey, I just saw the cops go in.
What's going on?

60
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,060
Someone reported
Jack for drug dealing.

61
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,260
I think we're getting targeted.

62
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,170
Be careful, all of you.
I'll go inside first.

63
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,100
You guys, watch the perimeter.

64
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,740
(Pracha)

65
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,140
Are you sleepy?

66
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,640
Mei's room is upstairs.

67
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,520
If you're tired, go sleep.

68
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,140
Want some ice cream?

69
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,340
Ah.

70
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,630
I'll go get it for you.

71
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,940
Mei and Sun will be back soon.

72
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,140
Relax and enjoy your ice cream.

73
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,660
Thank you.

74
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,100
(Emergency - Accident)

75
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,380
It's serious, Sun.

76
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,300
What is it?

77
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,740
The hospital called the police.

78
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,300
They found lots of drugs on Jack.

79
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,940
How much?

80
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,820
Enough to be considered dealing.

81
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,340
The police said

82
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,740
once Jack recovers,
he'll be transferred

83
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,260
to the prison's hospital.

84
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,780
Crap.

85
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Who did this?

86
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
What now?

87
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,580
Mei and Cherry,
go back with Peace first.

88
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300
I'll handle things here.

89
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,860
Oh, and Jinny is with
Uncle at the café.

90
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,180
Mei, go take care of her.

91
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,300
Go.

92
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,020
Peace.

93
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,300
Take care of them.

94
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,260
Are you sure you're okay?

95
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,820
This won't end easily.

96
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,940
So cunning.

97
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,020
Wait, wait.

98
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,420
Calm down. What's going on?

99
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,140
I know what you did last night.

100
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,140
So?

101
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,100
What are you going to do, rich boy?

102
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,420
That family, they're our people.

103
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,900
Do you understand
what we're saying, Jihoon?

104
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,620
Calm down, Jun-ho.

105
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,300
We're about to do something big.

106
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,540
Don't let something
this small ruin it.

107
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,220
Every time I see his face,
I just can't stand it.

108
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,740
But about what I just saw,

109
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,540
I really freaking loved it.

110
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,780
Love what?
He's trying to pick a fight with us!

111
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,940
He thinks being the adopted son
of the boss lets him act all tough.

112
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,500
Darn it.

113
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,100
But I still like it.

114
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,020
That performance of someone
who doesn't know his own ending.

115
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,700
It's actually fun to watch.

116
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,780
Oh, hey! There you are.

117
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
Yeah, what's up?

118
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,620
Nap just sent word.

119
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,060
About what?

120
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,140
About Jack.

121
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,420
Since we got Mei back,

122
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,340
how

123
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,500
many drug dealers
have we taken down, bro?

124
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,100
A lot, honestly.

125
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,300
All the big ones are gone.

126
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,780
So who's left to keep
the business going?

127
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,740
Who?

128
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,940
Well...

129
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,140
Didn't you say Mr. Joe doesn't
deal with this kind of stuff?

130
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,100
About Jack,

131
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,660
it was Mr. Joe's
adopted son who set him up.

132
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,620
You're saying
there's a rat in our gym?

133
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,940
We're in the spotlight now.

134
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,980
We have to be more careful.

135
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,660
Can't trust anyone.

136
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,620
They're all just waiting to strike.

137
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,900
Also,

138
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,260
I'm the one who killed Madam Yao.

139
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,220
Crap.

140
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,500
Are you serious?

141
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,460
The news said they
found two unidentified bodies,

142
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,380
one male, one female.

143
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,980
But the report disappeared
quickly like nothing happened.

144
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,100
That was Madam Yao and Aim?

145
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,940
Yeah.

146
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
And I got close enough
to kill her because

147
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,980
Mr. Joe made it happen.

148
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,500
So you're telling me,

149
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,140
Mr. Joe was behind everything?

150
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,900
Because I'm not
the one who killed Aim.

151
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,420
Has anyone ever
seen Madam Yao's face?

152
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,900
No one has.

153
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,140
But I'm the one who
got close and took her out.

154
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,020
You think Mr. Joe would
let just anyone stage this?

155
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,620
So what are you going to do now

156
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,940
about Mr. Joe's fight promotions?

157
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,780
I think for now
we just go with the flow.

158
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,910
But Mr. Joe is very dangerous.

159
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,140
He's impossible to predict.

160
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,140
Honestly, I think he's
the scariest person around.

161
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,740
You okay?

162
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,260
Yeah, I'll be fine.

163
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,220
Why are you being so difficult, Jin?

164
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,700
- I just want to see Jack. Why can't I...
- Jin!

165
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,380
Why so many secrets?

166
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,540
Why am I the only one
who doesn't know anything?

167
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,620
I'm not a kid anymore.

168
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,540
I have the right to know
what's going on in my family.

169
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,810
Jin.

170
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,900
Let's wait

171
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,860
until Mei calms down,
then we'll talk.

172
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,720
Okay?

173
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,060
I'm just worried about Jack.

174
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,380
Ah...

175
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,300
Your brother is safe.

176
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,820
You don't need to worry, Jin.

177
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,940
Jin.

178
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,900
You really want to know about Jack?

179
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,020
Huh?

180
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,300
Fine, I'll tell you.

181
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,380
Your brother was dealing drugs.

182
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,900
He got beaten to
a pulp by the other side.

183
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,900
The same drugs that
nearly destroyed me, Jin.

184
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,660
Now they've all
been arrested by the cops.

185
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,860
He's lying in the hospital, hooked to an IV,
handcuffed, barely conscious.

186
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,780
Still want to visit?

187
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,820
Huh?

188
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,140
Do you still want to see him?

189
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,540
Why don't you ever listen?

190
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,540
I'm just worried.

191
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
This is the adult world
you wanted to know about, Jin.

192
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,500
For now, I'm taking you
out of school for a while.

193
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,100
I'll call the school tomorrow.

194
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,540
You're okay, right, Jin?

195
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,380
What Mei said was out of anger.

196
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,100
(MMG Gym - Bangkok Boys)

197
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,340
Whoa, that was pretty good timing.

198
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,820
One more round?

199
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,100
Another round?

200
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,300
Alright then.

201
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,820
Okay, that's enough.

202
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,020
Good.

203
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,620
One.

204
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,620
Two.

205
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,260
Three.

206
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,860
Four.

207
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,740
Five. Come on.

208
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,060
Nice.

209
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,220
All done.

210
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,660
Very good.

211
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,840
Mr. Joe, this is my boss.

212
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,180
Finally, I got to meet you, Mister.

213
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,920
Okay, fine, let's get to the point.

214
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,730
You shouldn't have
treated my team like that.

215
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,140
I just wanted to make sure that
we're talking about is serious.

216
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,340
This is not playing around.

217
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,620
Well,

218
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,940
I'm a real man

219
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,580
and extremely cautious.

220
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,660
I see it.

221
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,020
Five tons of uranium
and thorium each.

222
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,780
I can have them
ready for delivery within 30 days.

223
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,500
As for the star of
the show, plutonium,

224
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,380
I need a little bit more time.

225
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,180
Maybe around two to three months.

226
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,820
I guarantee the chemical quality is high
enough for nuclear fuel production.

227
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,220
You can take a sample
back to your lab for testing.

228
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,300
As for the stock right now,
I can only show you a clip.

229
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,860
So, how many units can you send me
as the first batch?

230
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,340
I can send you 1,000 units right now.

231
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,100
It's already waiting for you
at the Thai border.

232
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,100
You know it's because of the lobbyists,

233
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,540
it's always hard to exchange.

234
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,540
Okay then.

235
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,820
There's something I want from you.
If you agree,

236
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
it will build trust between us.

237
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,940
So what do you want?

238
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,140
I want to ditch the lobbyists.

239
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,500
Stay at the party with me tonight.

240
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,800
I have some special wine for you.

241
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,860
In exchange for the gun, right?

242
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,900
Now it's time for the main event
we've all been waiting for!

243
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,240
A street fight
you won't see anywhere else.

244
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,940
On one side, we've got the rising star,
owner of a Muay Thai gym,

245
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,880
Bangkok Boy!

246
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,140
And on the other side,
a face we all know well,

247
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,020
the troublemaker from K area!

248
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,810
Ready for some serious impact?

249
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,220
How much is the bet on Sun's side now?

250
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,780
It's already hit one million baht!

251
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,780
Nice.

252
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,780
Wanna put some money down sir?

253
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,700
No, I'm not gambling.

254
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,140
Consider it as adding
flavor to the show.

255
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,980
Go.

256
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,820
No.

257
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,380
Six Network? Are you serious?

258
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,900
Huh? Six?

259
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,440
Yeah! Dude, are you sick?
Go home and rest.

260
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,180
Go lie down.
You don't know Six Network?

261
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,900
What the heck?

262
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,340
Six Network is
a blockchain company

263
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,340
based in Thailand and Korea.

264
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,460
How can you not know that?
You're so low-tech.

265
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,900
I'm not a nerd like you.

266
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,580
It's called being smart, bro.

267
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,260
Idiot.

268
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,660
Hey.

269
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,140
Ready?

270
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,260
Ready, bro.

271
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,020
Then go.

272
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,070
Alright, alright, everyone!

273
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,880
Alright!

274
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,060
Let's welcome both fighters to the ring!

275
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,620
Come on.

276
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,450
But before we begin,

277
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,290
Mr. Jo Junsa

278
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,130
has something to say to everyone.

279
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,020
Please give a big hand for Mr. Jo Junsa!

280
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,020
I'd like to say a few words
before the match begins.

281
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Everyone knows how well I've
treated people in this business

282
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,460
throughout all my years here.

283
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,820
And you all probably know I have a son.

284
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,700
But not many of you know that he

285
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,300
is the heir to my entire business.

286
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,700
So I want to take this moment
to introduce my son.

287
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,820
This is Jo Songmin.

288
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,140
My one and only blood heir.

289
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,380
And today,

290
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,900
he'll be fighting in place of Jun-ho.

291
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,020
You went and did it, didn't you?

292
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,540
Since you dared to challenge me,

293
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,260
I'll do exactly what I promised.

294
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,580
Do you remember what I said?

295
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,900
I want to kill him right now.

296
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,100
But I will give you one more chance.

297
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,500
Because you are
my only flesh and blood.

298
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,460
If you lose,

299
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,700
or refuse to keep fighting,

300
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,660
your lover will probably die.

301
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,820
Sun,

302
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,620
if you lose or refuse
to keep fighting,

303
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,180
I will send him
back to study in England

304
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,500
or wherever else.

305
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,980
But one thing's for sure,

306
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,220
you will never see my son again.

307
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,100
(Six Network)

308
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,340
What the heck is this?

309
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,940
What happened?

310
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,580
I don't know.

311
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,310
Are you really going
to keep fighting?

312
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,870
I have no choice.

313
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,430
Ready?

314
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,300
Fight!

315
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,100
Come on, fight back!

316
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,540
If you lose or refuse
to keep fighting,

317
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,420
I will send him back
to study in England

318
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,980
or wherever else.

319
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,100
But one thing's for sure,

320
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,540
you will never see my son again.

321
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,100
If you lose,

322
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,940
or refuse to keep fighting,

323
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,100
your lover will probably die.

324
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,400
Sun from the Bangkok Boy
gang has fallen.

325
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,250
He's lost to our Jo Songmin.

326
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,940
Sun!

327
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,860
- Sun!
- Bro.

328
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,700
Sun!

329
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,220
- Sun!
- Sun!

330
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,820
Sun!

331
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,940
Darn, call the ambulance quickly!

332
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,500
Sun!

333
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,860
Sun, Sun, Sun!

334
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,700
What the heck happened?

335
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,580
- Sun!
- Hurry, take him to the hospital!

336
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,940
Go, carefully lift him!

337
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,580
Help lift him!

338
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,060
What should I do about
Songmin, Father?

339
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,420
Where did Songmin go?

340
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,340
Father, please don't do
anything to Songmin.

341
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,100
You've known for a long time,
why didn't you tell me?

342
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,740
Don't do anything to Songmin.

343
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,900
Did you ever really care
about Songmin?

344
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,340
What do you want?

345
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,860
I'm afraid your condition
will relapse, Father.

346
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,260
And you're telling me this today?

347
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,800
Thanks a lot, Jihoon.

348
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,220
What's wrong with you, Father?

349
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,940
Take him to the hospital!

350
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,780
Yes, sir.

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,540
It's taking so long.

354
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,900
He'll be fine, Mei.

355
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,660
Calm down, guys.

356
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,220
No!

357
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,370
How's Sun?

358
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,420
Still don't know.

359
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,540
It's those jerks again.

360
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,660
I have something to discuss with you.

361
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,460
What happened?

362
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,980
You probably weren't in the club
when it happened, right?

363
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,490
Suddenly, Father collapsed.

364
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,050
His heart condition relapsed again, huh?

365
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,500
Where is he now?

00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,850

So, what were you trying to say?

368
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,780
Let's wait and see
how Father's condition goes.

369
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,900
Where are you going?

370
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,940
I think you're on the wrong floor.

371
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
Sorry, sorry.

372
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,570
Doctor, how is my brother doing?

373
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,380
The patient's condition is stable now.

374
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,690
The doctor is giving him IV fluids.
He should wake up soon.

375
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

376
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,460
Oh, uncle!

377
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,740
How did you get here?

378
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,260
I came to visit Sun.

379
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,460
But judging by his condition,
he should be fine now.

380
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,820
Aren't you going in?

381
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,500
No, I'll let him rest.

382
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,340
Uncle, can I pay you
back for the coffee later?

383
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,100
Same as always.
See you at the coffee shop.

384
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

385
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,180
Let's go.

386
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,780
(Surakan Korea Restaurant)

387
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,100
Eat faster.

388
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,220
There's still a lot to handle.

389
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,140
Just a few things left.

390
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,380
You're always so secretive.

391
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,460
Shall we guess?

392
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,810
What will happen if Father dies?

393
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,880
What will happen next?

394
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,580
How is it?

395
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,900
I want you to swap

396
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,660
Mr. Joe's medicine with starch pills.

397
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,140
Then throw it away
for a while if you want.

398
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,740
After that, you can go
running to tattle on me to Mr. Joe.

399
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,620
Oh,

400
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,860
but don't tell him
it was my doing just yet.

401
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,340
Wait until he
guarantees your safety first.

402
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,220
If we don't do this,

403
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,660
those two, the father and the son,
will always be a thorn in our side.

404
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,060
Traitor.

405
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,580
Traitor, huh?

406
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,020
You were about to kill his son too.

407
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,460
That makes you
a traitor as well, doesn't it?

408
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,250
We've come this far, so what's next?

409
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,420
Wait for Godfather to recover,
and then you run off to report to him.

410
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,300
In the end, I get eliminated, and you go
back to being just another underling.

411
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,220
Or, you could wait to hear
the next phase of the plan.

412
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,660
The opportunity is here, Jun-ho.

413
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,980
I'm sorry

414
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,010
for everything that happened.

415
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,580
How long were you
planning to hide it from me?

416
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,540
That you're related to
the person who killed Kong?

417
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,260
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

418
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,900
I just felt like

419
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,550
I've never really
considered them my family.

420
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,700
I'm just as angry as you are, Mei.

421
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,570
Be honest with me.

422
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,820
Is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

423
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,740
I promise

424
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,660
I'll find a way to
get Sun out of this cycle.

425
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,420
I've heard that promise plenty of times.

426
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,180
Just make it happen for real.

427
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,700
For everyone's sake.

428
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,780
Oh, you're awake?

429
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,260
How are you feeling?

430
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,080
The book Dad gave you.

431
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,800
Try reading it sometime.

432
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,860
Don't waste all your time
on pointless stuff.

433
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,320
What about Peace?

434
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,740
How is Peace doing?

435
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,440
We just spoke earlier.

436
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,820
Don't worry about him,
worry about yourself.

437
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,170
He looks way better than you.

438
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,020
He probably went home already.

439
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,030
I'll take care of
your hospital discharge then.

441
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,100
I'd like to postpone
my departure from Thailand.

442
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,900
My father is sick right now.

443
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,100
I'll leave after he's feeling better.

444
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,180
Okay.

I'll protect you.

then don't call me "bro" anymore.
