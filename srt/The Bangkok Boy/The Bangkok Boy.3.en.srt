1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,840
(Previously)
Dad! Talk to me first.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,320
Let's make peace with me.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,800
But I have a condition.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,760
I have to be the one in charge here.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,160
There's no one here.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,760
What the hell?

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,800
The adults are discussing business.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,160
Wait a moment.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,520
That's it. This gym now belongs to Madam Yao.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,600
Hey, you guys, get the guests seated.

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,440
Hey...

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,200
Hello, Mr. Than.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,880
The Boss of the Bangkok Boys

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,880
Bangkok Boy, what's that?

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,120
The name sounds like...

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,360
a cabaret.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,040
So, you like, take jobs dancing half-naked around Pattaya?

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,320
Wait a sec, I've written a lot about you.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
Oh, found it.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Mr. Than, 28 years old.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Muay Thai trainer at Siam Fighter Gym.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
Been boxing since the age of 14.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,080
Impressive!

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,600
Won any championships yet?

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,480
Do you want to try me?

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
And then you came to excel as a trainer.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Chose this gym.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,160
Because this old bastard...

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,160
was a partner with Songpoom, a man with immense influence.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,360
Past tense, right? Just got...

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,800
Died like a stray dog on the street.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,080
Okay, about the dead guy, forget it.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,120
Including being close with Songpoom's son.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,880
The son from the minor wife, named Sun.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,720
They were close enough to form the Bangkok Boy gang.

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,080
A street youth gang.

37
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,000
He stabbed his own friend until he went to jail, right?

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,960
And he's been in jail ever since.

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,600
I just went to his dad's funeral — right before he went to jail.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,400
He said to ask you to get something back for him.

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,960
Ask him to get it back for me.

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,600
And also ask him if the prison food is good?

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,440
But what I don't understand is...

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,400
How dare you show your face around here? Huh?

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,920
You've seen the state of Songpoom's family, right?

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Stop it.

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,720
That damn gang of yours.

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,920
Hey, old man.

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,320
There's still time to jump back in, man!

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,320
Go, go, go, go!

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,240
Or do you guys want to continue your Muay Thai lesson?

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 3)

53
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,560
Three years in prison.

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,240
Never saw you come to visit.

55
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,400
And what the hell happened to your head?

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,080
Forget it.

57
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,600
Can't we talk nicely?

58
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Aren't we family?

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,760
Have you ever considered me your younger sibling?

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,400
Aren't you Dad's child too?

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
Don't you remember what Dad taught us?

62
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,960
To take care of each other.

63
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Otherwise, the day you caused trouble,

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
why would I have people bail you out?

65
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,360
So what do you think about this?

66
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,080
What are you going to do next after getting out?

67
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,400
I don't know.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,560
If Dad were here, he'd probably want you to continue studying.

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,560
But if you want to study now, you have to find your own funds.

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,680
Right now, all that's left at home is the snooker table
and the liquor bar you know about.

71
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,320
And Mei?

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,080
Haven't seen her in a long time, probably went to work.

73
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
And...

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
How could you let Mei go work outside?

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,840
Why didn't you look after your sister?

76
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,520
Well, I offered her a way, but she didn't take it.

77
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,400
She has to go find her own way, doesn't she?

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,080
But you still have to go home.

79
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,840
Get in the car.

80
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,320
Don't dawdle.

81
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,400
Otherwise, I won't wait.

82
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,680
Is this what you call yourself the eldest brother?

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
What the hell do you know?

84
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,400
About how much we have to struggle to survive.

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
It's alright.

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,480
From now on,

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,360
I'll look after my sister myself.

88
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,480
The building that used to be Dad's warehouse,

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,040
Are you still there? Or have you sold it for a living?

90
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,760
It's closed.

91
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,560
Not doing anything.

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,440
Then I'd like to rent it.

93
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Do you have money?

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
I will soon. Just give me the building keys.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
You guys will have another source of income.

96
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Aren't you interested?

97
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,640
Sun.

98
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,560
And...

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
Who is this young lady?

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding.

101
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,600
Did I scare you?

102
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Scared.

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,040
Is this for me, brother?

104
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,520
Yes.

105
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,120
Wow, it's so yellow!

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,280
Well, yellow means friendship, and white means purity.

107
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,760
So this means Jinny welcomes you,
Brother Sun, with sincere friendship.

108
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,280
Wow, you pay attention to every detail.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,720
It smells good too.

110
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm sorry I didn't go to see you.

111
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,360
It's alright at all.

112
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
Actually, it's good that you didn't go because...

113
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,400
I think that place isn't suitable for...

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,040
my cute little sister, right?

115
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,680
I'll go upstairs first, okay? I have a lot to sort out.

116
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,720
Okay.

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
See you later.

118
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,000
(The number you have dialed is invalid.
Please verify the number and try again.)

119
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,880
Oh.

120
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,440
The car won't start.

121
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,960
Can you fix this model, uncle?

122
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,800
Tsk.

123
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,800
That's too much of an insult.

124
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,400
Well, I saw you looking confused,
so I thought you couldn't fix it.

125
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,920
Because this car, it belongs to Songpoom.

126
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,880
He was the one who told me to buy it for his son.

127
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,440
So he probably bought it for me.

128
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,000
I used to come to this shop often.

129
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,040
But I was a kid back then, you probably don't remember me.

130
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,920
So, you can fix it, right?

131
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,720
Of course, this car has to be this shop only.

132
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,320
Your father knew that well.

133
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,120
Okay, and when will it be finished?

134
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,920
Listen to me, Sun.

135
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,040
Can you come pick it up tomorrow evening?

136
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,160
Because it looks like it's been parked and left for a long time.

137
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,600
Okay.

138
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,680
Then I'll...

139
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
go for a walk around here then.

140
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
Relive some old memories.

141
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,280
Sun...

142
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,080
About what happened, I'm sorry.

143
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,680
Okay.

144
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,520
I'll go now, uncle. See you tomorrow.

145
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,480
Sun.

146
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,960
This place...

147
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,320
it's not the same anymore.

148
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,120
Okay.

149
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,520
Hey... Son.

150
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,080
Tracking you down is already hard,
tracking Mei down is even harder.

151
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,320
Well, Mei is a woman, Dad.

152
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,000
You probably can't make us live our lives like that.

153
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,440
Sun.

154
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,640
Are you trying to divide the siblings?

155
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Dad loves all his children equally.

156
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,960
Here, you guys take this.

157
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,680
As for the car, I'll take responsibility for it.

158
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,400
But when she spends all the money,

159
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,560
bring it back to me.

160
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,200
Thank you so much.

161
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,480
It's alright, it's alright.

162
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
The bag.

163
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
Thank you.

164
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,280
You're welcome.

165
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,640
Thank you so much.

166
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,560
But what can I help you with today?

167
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,360
There is something.

168
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,200
Listen carefully.

169
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,560
Is something wrong?

170
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,720
Sorry.

171
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,440
Nothing.

172
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,960
What would you like to order?

173
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,760
Oh.

174
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,440
I'll have...

175
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,760
an espresso, I think.

176
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,920
Our shop doesn't use a machine.

177
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,760
Espresso would come from a double shot.

178
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,360
Mocha Flood.

179
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,920
Or it could be a single shot.

180
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,560
Manual espresso.

181
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,680
Our café is a slow bar.

182
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,000
If you want one from a machine,
you have to walk two more alleys.

183
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,520
Oh crap.

184
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Uh, I used to come to this shop with my dad, and...

185
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,480
back then, the owner was a woman.

186
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,080
Oh.

187
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,640
My younger sister moved to England.

188
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,720
I've made a lot of changes to the shop since I arrived.

189
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,080
Right.

190
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,040
So, what should I order then?

191
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,040
How about this?

192
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,720
Go sit down comfortably first.

193
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,280
Okay?

194
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,720
Espresso might not be suitable for young people like us.

195
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,880
Given the atmosphere of the shop,
I'll serve you a cold brew instead.

196
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,560
Cold brew?

197
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,080
Yes.

198
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,560
Okay, sure.

199
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Here, have a drink to cool down.

200
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you.

201
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,800
No one knows how life will hit us.

202
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,440
How hard it will hit.

203
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,200
But no matter how strong or how hard it is, we have to endure it.

204
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,080
Get up and keep walking.

205
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,600
That's it.

206
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,560
Hey, aren't you going to drink it?
The ice will melt and it'll lose its flavor.

207
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,400
Oh.

208
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,040
Okay.

209
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,480
It's delicious, isn't it?

210
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,280
I think it's still...

211
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,680
bitter, but it's easier to drink.

212
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,600
Not like the taste I used to have.

213
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,200
Well, the process is different.

214
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,800
Uh.

215
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,840
Who is our father?

216
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,120
If you know my younger sister,

217
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,640
you probably came here a long time ago.

218
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,080
If you came here a long time ago and haven't come back since,

219
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,560
I don't know if you're the person I'm thinking of.

220
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,160
If you know me, know my younger sister,

221
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,000
there aren't many people.

222
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,640
My father's name is Songpoom.

223
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,360
Oh.

224
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,840
I thought you were Chokchai's son.

225
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,920
No, I'm not / Oh, unexpected.

226
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,600
Yeah, Songpoom was a good person.

227
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,600
It's a pity.

228
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,920
He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

229
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,560
How much is the coffee, uncle?

230
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh, no need. Finish it first and then go.

231
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,480
I'm in a hurry. I have somewhere else to go.

232
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,720
What kind of business?

233
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
I'm looking for someone. I haven't seen them in a long time.

234
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,480
You can ask me. I've been around here
for a long time and know a lot of people.

235
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,680
It's okay. How much is the coffee, uncle?

236
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,640
Oh, it's okay.

237
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,360
Songpoom's son came to the shop. How can I charge you?

238
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,160
It's okay.

239
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,760
This... is for the coffee.

240
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,440
Uh...

241
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm looking for someone named Than.

242
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,240
He used to be a Muay Thai instructor at Siam Fighter.

243
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,200
But we haven't seen each other in a long time.
I don't know if you know him, uncle.

244
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,080
Than? He's a regular customer at my shop.

245
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,000
Really?

246
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,400
But he doesn't teach Muay Thai anymore.

247
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh.

248
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,760
And the cold brew you just had,

249
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,000
it's 120 baht per glass.

250
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
Just a moment.

251
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,200
Can I have your number?
If I find Than's address, I'll send you a message.

252
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,840
In the meantime, why don't you go for a walk?

253
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,640
This area has changed a lot now.

254
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,640
I don't understand any of it.

255
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,960
Hey, you bastard!

256
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,080
Get over here!

257
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,160
Hello, please sign your name here first.

258
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,560
Thank you.

259
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,680
Oh don't touch it please.

260
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,960
Oh.

261
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,120
Do you like this picture?

262
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,840
Huh?

263
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
Do you like this picture?

264
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,960
Yes.

265
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,120
Shit, did you take this yourself?

266
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,560
I don't understand any of it.

267
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,920
Hey, you bastard!

268
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,600
Bring that over here!

269
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,280
It's weird, your pictures.

270
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,120
You just watch me.

271
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,240
One day, I'll have a show of these pictures you say are weird.

272
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,000
And people will clap so loudly the gallery will shake.

273
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,520
Ouch!

274
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
Oh, Hia Than!

275
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,800
How did you go from a Muay Thai teacher
to a janitor at the old school?

276
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,600
Huh?

277
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,120
Damn, Sun! How did you get here? Get over here!

278
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,920
Hey, where are you going, Hia?

279
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,360
Hey, where are you going?

280
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,840
What is it?

281
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,200
Get over here!

282
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
What's wrong? Why do you have to be so rough?

283
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,160
When did you get out?

284
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,440
Got out yesterday. Why?

285
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,880
Yeah, so..

286
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,480
Have you heard from Mei?

287
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,120
They said at home she's been gone for a month.

288
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,240
Why didn't you say anything?

289
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,240
Huh?

290
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,680
It's just...

291
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,080
While you were gone, a lot of things happened.

292
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,760
Sun...

293
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm glad you're out of prison.

294
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,600
But can you please not come see me again?

295
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,560
Why?

296
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,240
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

297
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,520
Hey, Hia, why don't you talk to me first?

298
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
I can't even contact Mei.

299
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,240
I went through the trouble of coming to see you.

300
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,040
Aren't you going to say anything?

301
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,560
You never make any sense!

302
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,160
Hey, Hia, talk to me first!
What the hell is wrong with you? Why aren't you talking?

303
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,560
Woah!

304
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,760
Don't you get it?

305
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,880
See? That's what I mean by not making sense!

306
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,520
That's exactly what I mean by not making sense!

307
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,480
Oh.

308
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,680
Heard you were tough in prison?

309
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,640
How much have you improved, huh?

310
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,880
Didn't beat anyone up either.
You're the first one today, Hia.

311
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,360
Wow.

312
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,520
Come on then!

313
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,560
Okay!

314
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,520
You little brat!

315
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
Seriously!

316
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,400
Wanted to kick someone for a long time!

317
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,920
Is that all you've got?

318
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,440
You're still very weak!

319
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,320
Is it?

320
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,080
Woah, you bastard, Sun!

321
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,840
My shirt's all dirty now!

322
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,840
You're just weak, can't help it.

323
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,440
Fine, you want to play, huh?

324
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,920
It's the same as before, huh?

325
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,800
You...

326
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,200
Look! My pants are torn now, Sun.

327
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,560
My shirt's dirty too!

328
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,440
Take me to change clothes!

329
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,240
Go change pants! Change pants!

330
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,520
Yeah, I never thought Hia would get hit that hard.

331
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,440
Yeah, right?

332
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,440
And then he took his family and ran away to the countryside.

333
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,680
As for me?

334
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,360
I have nowhere to go.

335
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,760
So... I have to be humble.

336
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Just do my own little things.

337
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
My father's situation is...

338
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,400
probably serious.

339
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,360
And that...

340
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,920
Gawin and Nap...

341
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,920
They've completely disappeared.
I don't know what happened to them.

342
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,640
The only one left is Tim, but I haven't seen him either.

343
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,760
And...

344
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,680
Have you seen Mei at all, Hia?

345
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,880
The last time...

346
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,440
was when she came to visit you in prison.

347
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,800
They only allowed one person in.

348
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,080
So I didn't go in.

349
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,240
And after that day...

350
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,960
Mei just disappeared.

351
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,920
And then I ran into those damn guys again.

352
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,880
Woah, Than!

353
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,400
You might as well fart if you're going to burp that much.

354
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,960
Come on, sis, you're exaggerating.

355
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,560
We're closing soon. Do you want to order anything else?

356
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,920
Two beers.

357
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,800
Okay, I'll get them for you.

358
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,400
Why are you closing so early?

359
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,600
I can't stand being here much longer.
Those junkies are causing chaos.

360
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,000
Our neighborhood isn't like it used to be.

361
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,800
Hey, Than!

362
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,720
I don't recognize this friend of yours.

363
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh!

364
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,080
He's the son of the snooker table owner from Soi 13.

365
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,200
Don't you remember?

366
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,240
Hia Songpoom's son?

367
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,640
Yeah, that's right.

368
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,120
The one who killed his friend?

369
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,080
Yes, sis.

370
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,960
Okay, then let's hurry up and finish eating
and then go home.

371
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,080
Than.

372
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,640
You know who's in charge around here now.

373
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,680
You're really asking for trouble for me.

374
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,600
Here are your two beers.

375
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,400
Finish up and let's go home quickly.

376
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,040
You...

377
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,000
Don't listen to her too much.

378
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,920
She talks nonsense when she doesn't know anything.

379
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,520
But it's like I really killed Kong.

380
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Hey, Hia.

381
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,960
I want to open a Muay Thai camp.

382
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,720
You, seriously?

383
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,040
Damn it.

384
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,160
I just told you a moment ago

385
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,360
that they don't want me involved in Muay Thai.

386
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,840
Just open it quietly.

387
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,480
You don't have to take in students yet.

388
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,360
So I'll have a place to sleep too.

389
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,760
And I'll go rent my older brother's building.

390
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,000
Sort everything out properly.

391
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Then I can bring Ai Mei to live with me.

392
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,000
I feel sorry that I didn't take care of her.

393
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,480
Then why don't you go back home?

394
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,440
Why do you have to go through
such hardship outside?

395
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,120
The feeling isn't the same anymore.

396
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,040
Ever since Dad's been gone.

397
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,600
Actually, if you had talked to me like this from the beginning,

398
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,880
you would have gotten what you wanted a long time ago.

399
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,640
I was too busy with the missing goods.

400
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,360
My stepfather is very angry.

401
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,640
Everyone is busy with their own things.

402
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,840
But I really respect Mr. Joe.

403
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,600
Because his eyes...

404
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,280
are really sharp.

405
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,240
Everything he touches turns to gold.

406
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,400
Have you been to this area before?

407
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,560
Hmm, why?

408
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,680
It's what your stepfather wants.

409
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,080
The whole area.

410
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Transportation, the port.

411
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,120
And Madam Yao's business network.

412
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,080
It looks like a good hub.

413
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,640
Actually, it's not just a hub.

414
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,240
This whole area...

415
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,920
was intricately designed
since Madam Yao's grandfather's time.

416
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Every house, alley, and lane, every part,

417
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
is all connected.

418
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,480
When you have any problems,

419
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,640
you just go underground,

420
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,400
and pop up at another house, that's it.

421
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,360
And right now,

422
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,720
I'm the one in charge.

423
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,160
I don't think it's possible

424
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,200
that Madam Yao would willingly give up such a good area

425
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,920
to my stepfather.

426
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,080
That's right.

427
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,200
That's what the two of us have to work together to do.

428
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,400
Actually,

429
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,040
you and I,

430
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,920
We are in the same boat now.

431
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,840
When will you take me to meet your father?

432
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,400
I have something to tell you.

433
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,400
My stepfather doesn't talk to people outside the gang.

434
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,320
Especially people like you.

435
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,480
Those who aren't at the boss level.

436
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,400
Boss level?

437
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,720
Oh!

438
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,440
A boss level like Madam Yao, right?

439
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,560
He only talked to your father for a short while.

440
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,120
And your father planned to kill her.

441
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,000
If it's like that,

442
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,040
I don't have to be a boss.

443
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,080
Alright.

444
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,960
I have a very special gift

445
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,840
to give to Mr. Joe.

446
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,040
As a sign of my respect.

447
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,240
Are you ready?

448
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
It should help you solve the problem you're facing right now.

449
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,560
It might help you solve the problems
you are facing right now.

450
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,320
What do you think?

451
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,640
Is this what you call a...

452
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,520
win-win?

453
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,520
It's good.

454
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,640
Actually, these guys,

455
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,160
they're not the ringleaders.

456
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,160
They're just lackeys trying to side with Madam Yao.

457
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,320
Because they're so scared of the lobbyists.

458
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,000
Why is that?

459
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,440
Don't you really know?

460
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,400
Those big shots up there,

461
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,360
they all hate your father.

462
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,680
But I'm not afraid of them.

463
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,960
Oh, almost forgot.

464
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,960
This is a gift for you.

465
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
Use it as you see fit.

466
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,080
Hia!

467
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,000
Hey!

468
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,200
It's pretty spacious, isn't it?

469
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,120
Is it good enough for you?

470
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
But look dirty.

471
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,840
I think it's going to be tiring.

472
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,560
Cleaning it.

473
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,960
There's a lot of stuff. I haven't been here in a long time.

474
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,200
Hey!

475
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,000
You can carry all that yourself.
You don't need my help.

476
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,720
Just help a little. Woah, you complain a lot.

477
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Here, have some water.

478
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,440
Okay.

479
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,360
Hey, Sun.

480
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,920
Let me ask you seriously.

481
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,680
What's your plan?

482
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,960
Well...

483
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,280
Find Mei. But I'll probably need Hia's help.

484
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,400
I can help you find Mei.

485
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,120
No problem.

486
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,680
And then what? And...

487
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,600
What happens when you meet Mei?
What the hell are your goals in life?

488
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,640
Actually, these days,

489
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,080
I'm still not sure who killed my father.

490
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,600
So...

491
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,040
I'll find the person who killed my father.

492
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,920
Let me tell you something.

493
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,000
Before you do any of that,

494
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,760
right now,

495
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,200
what are we going to eat? We don't have a job,
we don't have money.

496
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,920
Huh?

497
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,120
Actually, I have enough money...

498
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,880
to even hire you as my personal trainer.

499
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,120
Woah, bullshit!

500
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,720
Don't mess with me!

501
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,440
Water spray! How was that?

502
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,720
Look.

503
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,120
Damn!

504
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,560
I told you!

505
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,560
Where did you get the money?

506
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,200
I won't tell.

507
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
It's a secret.

508
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,840
But I have it.

509
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,640
Hia Sun!

510
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,600
Call me Hia!

511
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,520
Lend me some money!

512
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,800
Sure thing!

513
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,400
Okay.

514
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,760
You're doing well, huh?

515
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,600
Woah!

516
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,720
This is going to fall apart!

517
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,240
It's still usable.

518
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,440
Hey, woah! This is...

519
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,680
super old!

520
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,040
But cool!

521
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,680
This is pretty heavy too!

522
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,120
Thought it was light.

523
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
So much!

524
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,840
Good job, bro! Keep wiping!

525
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,440
Done!

526
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,760
Over here! I just finished wiping it! Woah!

527
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,800
Why is there so much crap everywhere?

528
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,160
Hia.

529
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,160
Let's get back together again.

530
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,480
You, seriously?

531
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,880
You're going to get me into trouble with those guys again.

532
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,960
Oh well.

533
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,360
My life these days is...

534
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,640
so damn bland.

535
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,760
If...

536
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,640
I added a little MSG, it might taste better.

537
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,400
Dad just...

538
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,240
came to organize things.

539
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,520
Put the pieces of the puzzle together.

540
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,360
And if Sun takes good care of the people around him,

541
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,680
they will repay Sun with loyalty.

542
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,520
Does Sun know the meaning of...

543
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,000
untouchable?

544
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,720
Yes, I do.

545
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,120
Hmm...

546
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,640
That's it.

547
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,160
Okay.

548
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,360
If I were as cool as my dad,

549
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,840
no one could do anything to you.

550
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Do you know,

551
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,480
the word...

552
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,040
untouchable?

553
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,840
You don't study. Where did you learn that word?

554
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,400
Hey, we have to be knowledgeable.

555
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,280
It's not ordinary.

556
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,720
Hey!

557
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,160
I think we should go get something to eat.

558
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,320
I'm starting to get hungry.

559
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,960
We could almost buy out this whole food court.

560
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,160
Let's go, let's go.

561
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm hungry too.

562
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,760
We'll come back and finish cleaning later.

563
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,200
There's lots of food at the entrance of the alley.

564
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,560
Let's go!

565
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,200
I once read that...

566
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,720
water molecules...

567
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,600
change shape according to the emotions they perceive.

568
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,160
What does that mean?

569
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,320
Well...

570
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,440
if we're happy,

571
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,440
the water around us

572
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,960
will change into molecules with beautiful shapes.

573
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,160
But...

574
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,600
if we're sad,

575
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,320
it will be ugly, distorted shapes.

576
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,800
As if to say...

577
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,040
Don't be afraid,

578
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,520
I'm just as sad as you.

579
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,520
Are you the owner of the gallery?

580
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,480
Yes.

581
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,720
It seems like you're not Thai.

582
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,600
I'll be going now.

583
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,040
Wait a moment.

584
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,320
I just wanted to ask about that photograph.

585
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Sorry.

586
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,720
I'm in a hurry. If you have anything,
come find me at the gallery.

587
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,920
Mr. Joe, I was wrong.

588
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,480
Mr. Joe, I was wrong.

589
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,480
Please spare my life, Mr. Joe.

590
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,960
Dad had so much fun today.

591
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,120
Play a game with Dad.

592
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,560
Don't do this to me.

593
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,160
Don't do this to me. I surrender.

594
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,680
I surrender.

595
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,240
Don't do this to me.

596
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,760
I surrender.

597
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,520
Don't do this to me.

598
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,400
Don't do this to me. I beg you.

599
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,080
(Next Episode)
What business do you guys have with us?

600
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,200
I just want to get the gang back together.'

601
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,440
Who are those kids?

602
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,200
I like them.

603
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,400
Good skills.

604
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,560
I'll stand right here.

605
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,880
And you'll see me as the last person.
