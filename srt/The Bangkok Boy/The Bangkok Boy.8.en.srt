(Sponsored by)

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,480
(Previously)
You wanna seek justice for your father, right?

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,080
And what about me?

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,560
What kind of compensation will I get?

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,880
I'm going to wipe out
the "Bangkok Boy".

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,640
Madam's going to run off alone.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,680
I'll handle things here myself.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,040
What's up, Madam Yao?

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,600
Long time no see.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,400
Why are you up so early, big bro?

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,970
I woke up
to train boxing with my kid.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,340
Want something to drink?

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,640
Just give me 30 minutes.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,720
So you can only spare
30 minutes for me, huh?

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,920
What?

16
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,600
Throwing shade this early?

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,120
Or am I wrong?

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,780
Okay.

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,210
Fine, you win.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,340
So, Yao, you came
all the way here to see me.

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,990
Is there something going on?

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,920
If it's about the same topic,

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,600
my answer hasn't changed.

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,160
How dare you go
fight those guys barehanded?

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,240
I was drunk.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,080
Probably the beer was talking.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,200
Was it the beer or was it me?

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,280
To restore the dignity of one woman,

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,220
you were willing to
throw away your boxing career?

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,160
Yao,

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,960
why are you bringing up the past?

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,120
You're not old yet.

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,480
You've got grown kids.
Don't tell me that's not old.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,320
If you hadn't helped me,

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,760
I wouldn't be here today.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,880
I didn't really help you.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,000
I just followed
an order I couldn't refuse.

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,200
That's all.

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,240
And you...

40
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,000
You're not mad at me?

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,040
That I was
involved with your husband?

42
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,160
Marriage is just business.

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,920
So is this conversation
we're having also business?

44
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,280
The business you're in now

45
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,350
has crossed the line, so I can't accept.

46
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,440
Even if you're a woman I once loved.

47
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,480
You're still mad that
I ran off and got married?

48
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,060
It was just once.

49
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,710
One bitter love.

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,090
But it opened my eyes.

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,520
The date is scheduled
to pay the lobbyist.

52
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,290
I ask for an answer
about the merger again.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
I hope to get a new answer
from your own mouth.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,680
Otherwise,

55
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,240
I can't guarantee anything anymore.

56
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you know

57
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,520
how much courage it takes for a woman

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,880
to plead for a man to love her again?

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
It's not easy at all.

60
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,020
"The Bangkok Boy"
(Episode 8)

61
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
Sun, what are you doing here?

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
Madam Yao.

63
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,600
The one who ordered my father's murder.

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,600
Did you like

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,080
the gift I sent?

66
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,560
Yes.

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,320
You've figured out who ordered
Mr. Songphoom's death, haven't you?

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,320
Mr. Joe probably knows best.

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
Do you know how many talented people

70
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,760
are there in this world?

71
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,680
But those talented people

72
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,120
never reach greatness.

73
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,160
Because of their foolish confidence,

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,760
trying to show off how good they are.

75
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,760
To be honest,

76
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,520
I see a younger version of myself in you.

77
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,360
Thank you.

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,520
Our egos aren't that different.

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,760
So, what does Mr. Joe

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,720
want from me today?

81
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,280
You adapt quickly.

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
This is the kind of person I need,

83
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,440
strong-willed,

84
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,240
brave,

85
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,920
diplomatic,

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,960
and knows how to read
timing and opportunity.

87
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,680
Someone who can
do big things that no one else can.

88
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,880
But it's a shame

89
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,520
that you didn't have the guts
to kill the man who shot your father.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,440
Why didn't you kill him?

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
Take revenge for your father.

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,200
Because I don't want to kill someone
like they're just an animal.

93
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
The man who drove my father's car

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,320
wasn't part of this.

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,920
Besides,

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,640
I don't want to spill blood

97
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
unnecessarily.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
And what about

99
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,560
Madam Yao?

100
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,880
The one who ordered
your father's murder.

101
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,360
Is that necessary enough?

102
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,400
Are you ready
to take revenge for your father?

103
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,240
I still don't know
how to get close to Madam Yao.

104
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,440
You and I have the same enemy.

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,320
I opposed Madam Yao's drug trade
just like your father did.

106
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,870
It made my house look dirty.

107
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,740
Here's the deal.

108
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,880
If I can get you close to Madam Yao,

109
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,760
will you chicken out again?

110
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,200
I've never chickened out.

111
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
Your brother isn't
worth associating with.

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,280
But you're completely different.

113
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,920
Tomorrow night,

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,680
I'll deliver Madam Yao
to you on a silver platter.

115
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,200
Oh,

116
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,400
lately, I've seen you
getting pretty close with my son.

117
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
Do what you need to do.

118
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,120
And you'll get everything you want.

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,640
You may go now.

120
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,560
Wait, there must be
some misunderstanding.

121
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,780
I didn't kill your father!

122
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,000
Where did you even hear that?

123
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,340
My dad tried to stop you
from dealing drugs,

124
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,580
so you had him killed.

125
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,460
I've waited a long time for this day.

126
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,740
Sun, listen to me.

127
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,300
I never did it.

128
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,500
I didn't do it.

129
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,580
Sun.

130
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,500
No matter what you've heard,

131
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,940
I wasn't the one who did it.

132
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,860
Someone tried to frame me.

133
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,540
Frame you?

134
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,100
Then who attacked
my father's funeral?

135
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,060
Sun,

136
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,340
please hear me out.

137
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,300
You probably don't know

138
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,780
how close

139
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,580
our families

140
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,490
used to be.

141
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,300
We were very close, Sun.

142
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,980
Sun.

143
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,300
You were like a niece to me.

144
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,510
You don't know

145
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,880
how close I was to your father.

146
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,660
We used to be together.

147
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,810
Why would I kill the man I loved?

148
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,660
Sun.

149
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,260
You've seen
the scar on your father's hand.

150
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,740
Do you know how he got it?

151
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,260
And what does that
have to do with anything?

152
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
I was once almost abducted and

153
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,620
raped by gangsters from another area.

154
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,020
When Songphoom found out about it,

155
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,140
he hunted them down and killed them.

156
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,500
Sun, do you know

157
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,580
that Songphoom

158
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,050
once dreamed of being a boxer?

159
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,220
And the wound on his hand

160
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,060
made it impossible

161
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,620
for him to fight anymore,
so he had to give up boxing completely.

162
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,980
Sun.

163
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,060
You're no different than a son to me.

164
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,260
Everything you've heard

165
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,540
is all nonsense.

166
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,340
Do you know how devastated I was

167
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,300
the day I found out he was killed?

168
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,740
If today's plan gets leaked,

169
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,900
I'll assume it's because
you told them my secret.

170
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,140
Remember this, Songmin.

171
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,580
You will inherit
everything from me.

172
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,620
You will never be with Sun.

173
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,260
And if I ever sense
something like that might happen,

174
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,780
his entire family,

175
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,740
and everyone
associated with him must be destroyed.

176
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,060
But in the end,
you will kill Sun anyway.

177
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,820
Stay home tomorrow night.
Don't go anywhere.

178
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,860
Or I'll kill him tonight.

179
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,860
Sun, how did you get here?

180
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,320
Yes?

181
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,980
(Mr. Jihoon.)

182
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,260
(Sun broke in to see Peace.)

183
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,050
(He already took out two of our men.)

184
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,660
(What should we do?)

185
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,780
Don't tell Mr. Joe yet.

186
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,860
All you have to do is record
a video of them and send it to me.

187
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,180
Oh,

188
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,100
make sure it's a kissing scene,

189
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,140
or something even more than that.

190
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,220
I'll reward you for it.

191
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,740
(Snap)

192
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,700
(Snap)

193
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,700
You okay, man?

194
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,980
Darn, I almost died.

195
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,940
Reminds me of the old days.

196
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,380
It feels like chaos again.

197
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,300
Hey, you're getting old, Tan.

198
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,260
What the heck are you two
chatting about? Go help him!

199
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,580
Hurry!

200
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,980
Go! You get out of here!

201
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,420
God, are you alright, man?

202
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,700
Darn, I don't think he can even move.

203
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,860
How's Tim?

204
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,500
Pretty bad, bro.

205
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,060
Hey guys, come help me
check on him! Hurry!

206
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,300
Hey.

207
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,410
Hurry!

208
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,450
Don't move him.

209
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,180
Call the hospital.

210
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,140
Call an ambulance.

211
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,740
Hurry!

212
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,820
No.

213
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,620
Hello there.

214
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,100
That was exhausting.

215
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,740
But it went according to the plan.

216
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,820
Just as I laid it out.

217
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,220
So what's the next step?

218
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,420
From now on,

219
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,940
everything that once
belonged to Madame Yao

220
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,060
will belong to Mr. Joe.

221
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,020
Everything Mr. Joe ever wanted,

222
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,300
I've laid it all out for you now.

223
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,540
Territories, connections,

224
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
networks,

225
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,100
and all the lackeys.

226
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,500
Including myself.

227
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,700
So please let me serve you.

228
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,220
Boss.

229
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,100
And the video?

230
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,220
These modern cameras are so sharp.

231
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,380
And...

232
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,060
Here it is.

233
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,220
Yeah.

234
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,980
Where did you get this stuff from?

235
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,940
From a drug dealer near the border.

236
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,740
The quality isn't great though.

237
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,140
That's fine.

238
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,700
You can have it.

239
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,060
Consider it a bonus.

240
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:30,980
Thank you, sir.

241
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:31,860
Oh,

242
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,260
and I have a reward for you too.

243
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,940
Tell our men to
strip everything off of him,

244
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,140
especially take his phone.

245
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,540
Then burn his body.

246
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,500
Dump it somewhere
with Madame Yao's body.

247
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,460
Let it become big news.

248
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,060
I want the whole world to
know that their era is over.

249
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,100
We shouldn't be doing this.

250
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,880
Today we killed someone.

251
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,700
I

252
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,920
killed the one who
ordered my father's death.

253
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,100
I never thought

254
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,190
that deciding to kill someone

255
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,280
would be this painful

256
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,020
and torturous.

257
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,950
Since I got out of prison,

258
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,650
I dreamed of taking revenge.

259
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,400
But so many things have happened.

260
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,140
When I raided Madam Yao's warehouse,

261
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,960
I got blackmailed
by the guys in black.

262
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,320
And to this day,
I still don't know

263
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,920
who they are

264
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,770
or what they want.

265
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,610
Aim,

266
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,700
Madam Yao,

267
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,740
Jun-ho,

268
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,910
even your father.

269
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,230
At this point, I don't even know

270
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,120
which way I'm supposed to go.

271
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,860
♪ Please hold me tight ♪

272
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,180
♪ Please don't leave me ♪

273
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:11,180
♪ No matter how you are ♪

274
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,820
♪ To me, you are ♪

275
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,640
♪ My last breath ♪

276
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,980
How are you guys?

277
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,220
You okay?

278
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,420
There he is, the troublemaker.

279
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,740
What the heck, man?

280
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,540
Where the heck have you been?

281
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,310
Your phone was off.

282
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,490
What happened, man?

283
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,500
How should I know?

284
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,160
Out of nowhere, we were ambushed.

285
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,880
Good thing that
Nap showed up in time.

286
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,530
Otherwise we'd all be dead by now.

287
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,070
Kawin's my friend.

288
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,180
I couldn't just leave him.

289
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,820
Hey, what about Tim and Tian?

290
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,100
They're at the hospital.

291
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,690
We'll go see them tomorrow.

292
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,780
(Ramp to lower level)

293
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,380
Don't tell anyone.

294
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,100
Don't tell anyone.

295
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,390
Haven't you been
hurt enough by others?

296
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,820
So why do you keep
hurting yourself again and again?

297
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,660
Hey, Mei.

298
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,380
How do you know my name?

299
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,020
Well, the day you passed out,

300
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,500
your brother brought you to me.

301
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,780
And I brought you here to the hospital.

302
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,700
I must look really pathetic, huh?

303
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,060
The real pathetic ones

304
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,380
are the ones selling drugs.

305
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,060
You're not pathetic.

306
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,740
How are you feeling?

307
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,300
Thanks.

308
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,220
Mei,

309
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,620
hang in there.

310
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,340
Eat a lot too.

311
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,100
Okay?

312
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,940
Alright, I gotta get to work.

313
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,660
Uh...

314
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,900
I brought

315
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,660
you some flowers.

316
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,420
They were left in the meeting room.

317
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,900
I'll put them in a vase for you.

318
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,780
Look.

319
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,020
There's still a lot left.
I'll put the rest in other rooms.

320
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,020
Hope you like them.

321
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,340
I'll go now.

322
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,630
So, how are you feeling?

323
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,460
I'm okay.

324
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,860
Getting better bit by bit.

325
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,260
But I feel lonely.

326
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,300
Yeah? So...

327
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,300
Hey, you sure you're okay?

328
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,900
Mm.

329
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,460
How does it feel being here?

330
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,100
Better than the first day?

331
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,420
A little.

332
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,500
Why?

333
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,420
Uh...

334
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,540
I got more flowers.

335
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,100
More flowers again.

336
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,160
Always bought too many.

337
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,260
Hey.

338
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,500
Do you live near Pak Khlong Talad?

339
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,620
Yeah, nearby.

340
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,340
Hey.

341
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,760
Thanks.

342
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,380
(The bodies were found
at the waste disposal plant.)

343
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,820
(The two were shot
with different types of firearms.)

344
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,580
(Their hands were
glued together with hot glue.)

345
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,920
(Police suspect
more than two perpetrators)

346
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,620
(and they likely wanted
to cover the victims' fingerprints.)

347
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,500
(This brutal act is suspected
to be a silencing tactic)

348
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,580
(by a criminal organization over
conflicts in illegal business operations.)

349
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,200
(We'll keep you updated
on further developments.)

350
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,660
Sun.

351
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,020
How are you doing, man?

352
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,170
All good.

353
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,010
That's good then.

354
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,140
Hey, bro.

355
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,380
Bro, look at this.

356
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,620
What's this?

357
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,700
What do you mean, "what's this"?

358
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,540
I've gotten close to
the target you told me to go after.

359
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,420
I think you should
take a break for now.

360
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,780
Darn, he's really trying to impress you.

361
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,620
Take a rest.

362
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,780
Huh?

363
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,740
Here, I brought this for you.

364
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,980
How are you feeling?

365
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,940
Still hurts.

366
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,100
Thank you.

367
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,700
Tian's going to be fine.

368
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,180
Come on, stay here.

369
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,380
I bought you food. Eat it yourself.

370
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,180
My arm hurts, bro.

371
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,260
Your arm hurts?

372
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,420
Tim, feed him.

373
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,660
I knew it.

374
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,740
He's not trying to impress you.

375
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,220
He's trying to impress your sister.

376
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,940
Jinny, go home.

377
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,830
Just a little longer.

378
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,220
Go home.

379
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,940
Just a bit more, please.

380
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,740
Now.

381
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:24,860
Go.

382
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,660
Non, take Jinny home.

383
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,220
Jail, jail, jail.

384
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,980
She's underage, man.

385
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,100
Easy there.

386
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,300
So you're getting
discharged tomorrow, right?

387
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,940
See you tomorrow then.
I'm heading out.

388
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,140
Alright, bro.

389
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,700
Take care of him.

390
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,300
Later, bro.

391
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,300
Darn, what's up with Nap lately?
Just shows up and leaves randomly.

392
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,740
Comes and goes whenever.

393
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,300
Weird.

394
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,540
He's human, man.

395
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,300
Don't be a smartass.

396
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,060
What?
Wanna go a round?

397
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,940
Whatever, man.
Bring it on.

398
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,940
You two.

399
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,420
So tough in a hospital, huh?

400
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,700
Huh?

401
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,420
You'll both end up in the ER.

402
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,180
A motorbike
can't carry all of Mei's stuff.

403
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,140
That's true.

404
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,340
Let's go.

405
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,340
(Voice Call)

406
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,860
What's up?

407
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,900
You go up first.

408
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,020
Okay.

409
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,980
(Check Service Availability)

410
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,860
(May 2025)

411
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,080
Is that everything?

412
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
Please sign here.
Sure.

413
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,470
All done.

414
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,350
Take care of yourself.

415
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,220
Mei.

416
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,870
- I want to...
- Come on, let's go.

417
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,980
With all these books,

418
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,900
you should just become a librarian.

419
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,200
Not funny.

420
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,220
You ready?

421
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,220
Ready for what?

422
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,140
Ready for a new start?

423
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,100
Tell yourself that.

424
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,580
Thanks.

425
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,060
Can I...

426
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,580
Can I have your IG?

427
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,950
Can't even say that much.

428
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,220
You really won't
ride with me, princess?

429
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,680
Nope. I want to feel
the breeze and enjoy the view.

430
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,000
Never thought
I'd ride on your bike again, Sun.

431
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,940
If Dad hadn't died that day,

432
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,330
I wonder what things
would be like between us now.

433
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,870
I'll wait for you at the gym, then.

434
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,520
Sun.

435
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,500
I saw the news.

436
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,380
What news?

437
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,380
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

438
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,650
Sun.

439
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,280
You didn't get
revenge for Dad, did you?

440
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,060
No.

441
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,680
I don't want you
to turn out like Dad.

442
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,800
Let's go. I'm starving.

443
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,980
My room's this way.

444
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,100
Let me drop this off for you first.

445
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,540
(Jonathan Livingston Seagull)

446
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,190
Why does my family have
to go through something like this?

447
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,260
What's wrong?

448
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,860
The person who
says "nothing's wrong"

449
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:07,980
usually has something going on.

450
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,020
Where did you get that from?

451
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,780
Let's go get something to eat.

452
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,310
I'm hungry.

453
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,190
What are you doing?

454
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:39,980
Well...

455
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,540
You already hugged Mei.

456
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,540
Can't you hug her big brother?

457
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,780
Up to you.

458
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,380
Wait for me.

459
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,550
Sorry.

460
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,720
This should be acceptable.

461
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,630
Everything is in order, Godfather.

462
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,410
About the medicine we got back then,

463
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:42,740
what should we do?

464
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,540
Do you see the villagers around here?

465
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,940
Yes.

466
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,140
Jun-ho.

467
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,410
Go create jobs
and income for the locals.

468
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,820
You mean selling to small dealers?

469
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,160
Sell at a price
lower than the market rate.

470
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,500
We need followers.

471
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,060
Get rid of anyone
who gets in the way.

472
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,340
As for the money,

473
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,940
I'll only take half.

474
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,140
You guys should start
having your own business by now.

475
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,900
Really?

476
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,540
Apologies for Jun-ho's
lack of manners, Godfather.

477
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,930
Hello, Mr. Sabid.

478
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,940
Have you arrived at the airport yet?

479
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:33,980
Yes, sir.

480
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,160
I'll send someone
to meet you at the hotel.

481
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,670
And then we'll meet in the evening.

482
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,460
I would like to show you
my workplace for a bit.

483
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,060
It's more convenient to talk there.

484
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,860
Once we're done,

485
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,930
we'll go out for the night.

486
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:55,180
My pleasure.

487
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,020
See you later.

488
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,300
This evening, you two
go pick up Mr. Sabid at the hotel,

489
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,220
and bring him here.

490
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,300
- Yes, understood.
- Yes, understood.

491
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,260
Also,

492
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,340
what do you think
Godfather is planning?

493
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,660
Don't waste time guessing.

494
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,460
Better use that time to
think about what we'll do next.

495
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,940
So what's your plan?

496
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,830
I'll tell you when it's time.

497
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,820
So, where are the photos?

498
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:55,980
And?

499
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:58,740
Try scrolling through.

500
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,660
Godfather's darling
visits this house a lot.

501
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,060
Almost every week.

502
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,220
And

503
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,930
I suspect that woman is his mother.

504
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,950
Until...

505
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,130
Even though they
publicly said they split long ago.

506
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,810
So what do you think?

507
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,640
Maybe they just rekindled old flames.

508
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,800
Come on, it's just a game.

509
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,290
Let's keep playing.

510
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,270
- Buffalo.
- Buffalo.

511
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,560
Hyena.
Hey!

512
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,440
Giraffe.

513
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,410
Hey, rhino!

514
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,220
Hello, uncle.

515
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,320
We meet again, young Korean man.

516
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:06,940
This is the café owner,

517
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,170
also a friend of our dad.

518
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,950
Hello. You're Sun's sister, right?

519
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:12,800
Yes.

520
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,640
When she was born,

521
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,860
I held her with my own hands.

522
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,540
Uncle, you're really
there for every event.

523
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,540
You're saying I'm nosy, aren't you?
Just admit it.

524
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,740
No, not at all.

525
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,900
How about this, I'll close
the shop and celebrate today.

526
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,500
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

527
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,080
Come on, let's sit.

528
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,750
Oh.

529
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,300
Where's Peace?

530
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,700
He left.

531
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,940
Probably felt awkward.

532
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,050
Please arrange this discreetly for me.

533
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,820
I want to leave Thailand
as soon as possible.

534
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,020
I know

535
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:17,280
that I can't escape my father.

536
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,900
But at least let me leave here for now.

537
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,140
Yes.

538
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,980
(Pracha)

539
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,310
Let me ask you seriously.

540
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,750
I know we seem narrow-minded.

541
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,300
But how do you expect us to feel

542
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,420
about what his family did to you

543
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,540
and to Kong?

544
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,420
What happened to Mei,

545
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,020
darn, it's really too much.

546
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,390
Whatever, forget it. Come on.

547
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,400
Come on.

548
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,460
Eat, eat, eat.

549
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,420
Forget it, forget it, forget it.

550
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:07,520
Here.

551
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,020
I brought a strawberry cake for Mei.

552
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,100
Thanks.

553
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,530
Not for you. It's for her.

554
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,820
Eat a lot, Mei.

555
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,640
It's strawberry, you know.

556
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,940
Okay, where were we?

557
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,540
- No!
- Say the word "rhino".

558
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,680
You fool, I didn't even get to.

559
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,180
Rhino.

560
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,500
Your turn.

561
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,780
Bear.

562
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,790
How is that a bad word?

563
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,740
I meant the animal, you fool.

564
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,740
Meant the animal.

565
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,820
Oh, I thought it was an insult.

566
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

567
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,020
I was dumb.

568
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,470
Is it good?

569
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,380
Oh, I forgot to ask.

570
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,420
Can you stay at the gym?

571
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:55,940
How is it?

572
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,340
Smells like boxing oil.

573
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,340
Oh.

574
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,780
Well, it's a boxing gym.

575
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,740
It's not like it's
gonna smell like lavender.

576
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,140
Then you'll have to go back home.

577
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,140
No.

578
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,940
Then just stay at the gym for now.

579
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,100
I don't want you to go anywhere.

580
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:19,860
I want to work.

581
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:22,700
But I have to go back to school.

582
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,140
You're only good
at bossing others around.

583
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,900
But no one can boss you around, Sun.

584
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,420
You wanna work?
Come work with me, Mei.

585
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,460
Wait, uncle.

586
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,700
Quiet, Sun.

587
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,940
I'm looking for a barista
to help at the shop anyway.

588
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,140
But I want her to go back to school.

589
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,100
And when you got out of jail,

590
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,860
why didn't you go back to school?

591
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,420
Exactly.

592
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,580
That's how Sun is, uncle.

593
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,300
He likes to control others.

594
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,620
But he doesn't do it himself.

595
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,380
He didn't go back to school either.
Hey.

596
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,490
Tan's right.

597
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,020
But I still want
Mei to finish school first.

598
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,740
After graduation,
she can work anyway.

599
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,940
What's the harm

600
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,540
if she really wants to work?

601
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,580
But if she goes to school now,
she won't be happy.

602
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,700
How about this,

603
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,300
let her work with me for now.

604
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,500
For about three to four months.

605
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,540
If she gets bored,
she'll go back on her own.

606
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:35,860
Sound good, Sun?

607
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,820
And for the place to stay,
if she doesn't mind, she can stay here.

608
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,140
There's an empty room upstairs.

609
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:42,970
But,

610
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,420
I don't want her to be alone.

611
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,060
I don't want
my niece to be alone either.

612
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,250
Oh hey, girl.

613
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,360
You two know each other?

614
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,320
This is Cherry, my niece.

615
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,900
(Scheduled to land)

616
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,660
(Mr. Sabid)

617
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,190
Hello, Mr. Sabid.

618
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,420
Welcome to Thailand.

619
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,340
I'm your butler from
the Airport Premium Service

620
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,660
that you booked through
the Sawasdee by AOT application.

621
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,980
I'm here to welcome you.
Don't worry about your luggage.

622
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,220
The buggy to take you
to the exit gate is waiting.

623
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,820
Please follow me.

624
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,660
(Welcome to Thailand, Mr. Sabid. I've arranged
someone to assist you upon your arrival.)

625
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,860
(My son will pick you up at the hotel.
See you soon!)

626
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,260
I'm throwing
a small party at my clubhouse.

627
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,140
(Next Episode)
And I'm organizing a street fight too.

628
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
You and Jun-ho
will finally get your rematch.

629
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,500
Settle things like real men.

631
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:51,900
