Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,050
You know how crisp new bills
tend to stick together.

3
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,470
It should be 590 dollars.

4
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,970
Let me count it again.

5
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,140
Yes. It's 590 dollars.

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,200
Okay. Since you counted it
multiple times,

7
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,550
I won't count it.

8
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,840
I received 590 dollars.

9
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,480
Your payment is done.
Please change before the treatment.

10
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,340
You'll see a gown in the locker
in the dressing room over there.

11
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,050
A gown?

12
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,590
EPISODE 4
Her Double Life

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
You're a lot healthier than I thought.

14
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,550
Yes. I think I am.

15
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,840
Maybe because I eat well.

16
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,840
No, I don't mean that.

17
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,990
Some people are overweight
in an unhealthy way with excess body fat.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,400
Others are overweight in a healthy
way with muscles. You're the latter.

19
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,900
-Is that a good thing?
-Of course.

20
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,740
We use body mass index to compare
the amount of muscles against body fat.

21
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,990
Look here.
Yours is 24, within normal range.

22
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,820
Many people think they're fat
after watching...

23
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,490
...skinny people or female idol groups.

24
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,150
It makes me feel bad
as a doctor in a weight clinic.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,400
I know, right?

26
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,110
I saw an idol group on TV before.

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,030
They only ate half a sweet potato
and a boiled egg for a meal.

28
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,990
Even a bird would eat more than them.

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,360
My friend, Jeong Nan-hee thought...

30
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,360
...she'd lose weight
by only eating sweet potatoes,

31
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,950
and devoured a box of
sweet potatoes per day.

32
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,110
Actually, that kind of extreme diet has
a high possibility of failing.

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,610
As I told you before, it's important...

34
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
...to lose weight slowly
and in a healthy way.

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,030
-Don't obsess about your weight.
-Okay.

36
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,530
I don't want to lose a bunch of
weight overnight either.

37
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,740
Well, I've been...

38
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,820
...living just fine with this body.

39
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,240
I think it's good to lose weight
in a healthy way as you said.

40
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,490
Great. I'll look forward to...

41
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,030
...your healthy weight loss.

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,780
Now that we've set a clear goal,

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,740
shall we move to the bed?

44
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,240
Bed?

45
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,740
For the treatment.
Please lie down on that bed.

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,740
I'll apply some cream.

47
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,110
Excuse me.

48
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,360
Let's begin the treatment.

49
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,610
This will be a little cold.

50
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,280
Please write down everything
you eat including snacks...

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,450
...to helps us provide precise treatment.

52
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,570
These are the instructions for
stretches. Please do them often.

53
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,990
Thank you.

54
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,320
See you later, Ms Bok-ju.

55
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,610
Today is your first day,
so don't change your diet too much.

56
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,990
And it'll probably rain tonight.
Don't forget to take an umbrella.

57
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,110
Right, your umbrella!

58
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,070
I'll make sure to give it back
to you in the next session.

59
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,070
I wasn't asking for my umbrella.
Did it sound that way?

60
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,900
No. It didn't,

61
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,110
but I should give it back to you anyway.

62
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,400
Goodbye, then.

63
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,990
Get home safely.

64
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,650
How do I wear this?

65
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,650
Rather than that...

66
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,860
I think this will look better on you.

67
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,490
It's pretty. Take a look in the mirror.

68
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,110
Doesn't it look bad?

69
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,700
You look much prettier and more feminine.

70
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,650
I'll take this.

71
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,950
I'll wrap it for you.

72
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,400
Do you make those yourself?

73
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,110
I either sell them or give them as gifts.

74
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,490
I don't think it's polite to return
the umbrella by itself.

75
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,740
-Are you dating someone?
-Pardon?

76
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,570
-No.
-Why can't you maintain your weight?

77
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,070
You aren't going out on dates, are you?

78
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,740
I don't know what to do with you.

79
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,740
You won't go to Russia
and you can't keep your weight down.

80
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
How will you join the national team?

81
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,280
You need to have more sense of urgency.

82
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,200
I understand.
I'll take better care of myself.

83
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,450
-Here you go.
-Come on. I want some, too.

84
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,990
It's so sweet.

85
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,950
Let's hide it and eat it again later.

86
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,990
Of course I'll hide it.
We haven't finished it yet.

87
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,900
-Of course.
-We can't waste any.

88
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,530
By the way, what's going on with Si-ho?

89
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,740
She's gotten slow.

90
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,360
Yesterday, she barged into
the boys' dormitory...

91
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,200
and cried in front of her ex-boyfriend.

92
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,400
Really?

93
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,450
Is she in shock after
not making the national team?

94
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,070
-I've never seen Coach scold her.
-Me neither.

95
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,820
Si-ho had always been
our coach's favourite.

96
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,990
I feel bad for Si-ho.

97
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,450
-Why?
-She's not as agile due to her age.

98
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,530
She isn't as good as before.

99
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,070
She doesn't have financial support
from her parents either.

100
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,820
Why not? Isn't her family rich?

101
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,240
So you didn't know?

102
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,200
What do you mean?

103
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,950
You wouldn't even believe
what happened today.

104
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,400
-What?
-What happened?

105
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,400
I went to see our coach earlier today.

106
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,360
Then I saw Si-ho coming towards us
looking upset, so...

107
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,530
It's true that I barged into
the boys' dormitory,

108
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,610
but I didn't cry.

109
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,900
People made it too dramatic.

110
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,530
Soo-bin.

111
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,110
Yes?

112
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,820
Thank you for understanding me.

113
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,490
However,

114
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,950
don't worry about my family business.

115
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,450
It's nothing for you to worry about.

116
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,280
I understand.

117
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,110
-See you.
-See you later.

118
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,320
-Oh my goodness.
-Are you okay?

119
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,610
What's wrong? Are you okay?

120
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,070
Do you have an upset stomach?

121
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,320
Here.

122
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,450
Thank you.

123
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,490
Hey, aren't you Si-ho?

124
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,990
Hello.

125
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,320
I haven't seen you in a while.

126
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,990
When did you get back from Taereung?

127
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,950
It's been a few days.

128
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,400
Would it be rude if I say welcome back?

129
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,280
It's okay. You can go back again.

130
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,990
Many athletes couldn't even
make it to Taereung.

131
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
Right.

132
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,990
Are you feeling okay?
Shall I get you some medicine?

133
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,570
No, I'm okay.

134
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,400
-See you later.
-Stop by the infirmary sometime.

135
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,490
I'll massage your ankles.
I know you had weak ankles.

136
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
I will.

137
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,240
I have to get back to training.

138
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,610
Go ahead.

139
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,650
-Thanks for this.
-Sure.

140
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,700
How did she get an upset stomach?
She doesn't even eat much.

141
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,740
Will it be okay?

142
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,990
I'm sure it'll be fine.
It's not even an expensive gift.

143
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,650
You startled me, you punk.

144
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,610
Most girls shrink back when startled,
but you get ready to punch.

145
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,900
I knew it.

146
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,820
Speaking of which,
do you want my fist in your face?

147
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,700
Come on.
Don't you know how to take a joke?

148
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,740
What's that?

149
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,900
None of your business.

150
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,320
It's your midnight snack, right?

151
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,450
What is it?

152
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,110
-Isn't it food?
-Are you crazy? How dare you?

153
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,610
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

154
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,280
I keep forgetting that you're a woman.

155
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,490
I'm really sorry.

156
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,860
My sincerest apologies.

157
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,990
I'm sorry, Bok-ju.

158
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,110
What?

159
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,490
What is it?

160
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,400
What's wrong with you?
Is this some kind of a horror movie?

161
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,110
It's not about me.

162
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,950
It's about my friend.

163
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,320
Which one between your two friends?

164
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,030
I'm not talking about them.

165
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,700
Anyway,

166
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,240
my friend...

167
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,990
has a crush on someone.

168
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,530
She borrowed something from him
and has to return it.

169
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,320
She wants to give him a gift
to thank him.

170
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,820
-Will it be okay?
-Who doesn't like gifts?

171
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,740
-It's okay, right?
-Yes, as long as she didn't make it.

172
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,240
What's wrong with a handmade gift?

173
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,990
Think about it.

174
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,400
If she made the gift,

175
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,900
it means she thought about him
while she was making it.

176
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,320
He'd feel uncomfortable.

177
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,110
You said they aren't close yet.

178
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,950
Would he feel uncomfortable?

179
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,200
Of course.

180
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,740
If she makes her feelings for him
too obvious,

181
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,200
he'll definitely take a step back.

182
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,280
Send a simple message
to thank him instead...

183
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,950
Hey!

184
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,200
I was so close to making a mistake.

185
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,650
What if I didn't bump into Joon-hyung?

186
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,110
Gosh, that was close.

187
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,860
What should I write?

188
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,450
Make it as simple as possible.

189
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,820
Is this okay?

190
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,200
I don't like the handwriting.

191
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,570
I should have practised my handwriting.

192
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,860
Oh, sorry.

193
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,240
That's a pretty umbrella. Did you buy it?

194
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,990
No, I borrowed it from someone.

195
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,610
Ms Kim Bok-ju, you have
an appointment tomorrow at 2:00.

196
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,990
J Weight Clinic

197
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,610
You seem happy.

198
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,360
No, it's nothing.

199
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,820
You must be dating someone.

200
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,530
-I'm jealous.
-No way.

201
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,030
You're bad at guessing.

202
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,320
How could I ever date someone?

203
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,530
You're very bad at lying.

204
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,570
I'm not lying.

205
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,950
Okay, let's just say you aren't.

206
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,070
I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

207
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,950
What? Really?

208
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,530
-Really, really?
-Yes.

209
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,490
The rumour has spread everywhere.

210
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,280
People call it,
"Si-ho Attacked Boys' Dormitory."

211
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,530
It's one of the top three news in school.

212
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,860
She's much bolder than I thought.
That's awesome.

213
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,900
Gymnasts can be strong-willed.

214
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,400
They even spit out chicken
after tasting it.

215
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,280
I'm not surprised by her attack.

216
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,570
I'm more shocked that
she dated Joon-hyung.

217
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,900
Why would she? She's too good for him.

218
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,820
Joon-hyung is one of
the popular boys in school.

219
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,200
That's true.
You can't disagree with that, Bok-ju.

220
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,650
Joon-hyung is cute.

221
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,320
Good looks aren't the only thing
that matters.

222
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,490
You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

223
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,820
He needs to be mature,

224
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,990
-and he's far from it.
-Hey, you three.

225
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,950
Are you the only ones here?

226
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,030
Did you come here to chitchat?

227
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,990
You've gotten too lax.

228
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,900
Just because you've been here
two years...

229
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,490
doesn't mean your seniors are your equal.

230
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,200
Do you think the gym is your playground?

231
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,450
No, I'm sorry.

232
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,990
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

233
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,030
They've been lax for a while now.

234
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,860
They don't even clean the equipments
after their training.

235
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,200
Look at this chalk powder.

236
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,530
Look how the gym turned into a pigsty!

237
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,110
What's going on?

238
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,530
-What is it?
-They've gotten so lax.

239
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,650
They don't even clean the equipments.

240
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,650
They only chitchat
when they should be training.

241
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,990
Hey, go easy on them.

242
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,990
Strictly speaking, it's our fault
that we didn't manage them well.

243
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,200
What are you girls doing?
Go set everything up for the training.

244
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,400
-Okay.
-Okay.

245
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,530
Hey, Woon-gi.

246
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,820
Why did you let them go like that?
You made us look stupid.

247
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,740
The training will begin shortly.
Scold them later.

248
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,110
Who are you to decide on such matters?

249
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,740
Are you bragging because you're
the team leader? I'm a senior, too.

250
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,900
I get that you won a few medals,
but you can't look down on us...

251
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,450
Sorry, excuse me for a minute.

252
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,450
Gosh, I'm just speechless.

253
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,990
He made you look stupid, Sang-chul.

254
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,200
Appointment at the clinic

255
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,860
Gosh, they're so annoying.

256
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,030
Are we their punching bags?
They always take things out on us.

257
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,820
I think I mopped way too hard.
My hand is shaking.

258
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,070
-Hey, look at this.
-It happens every year.

259
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,740
Even last year, those in their
senior years were always on edge.

260
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,070
Right. They're graduating soon,

261
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,570
and there are only few tournaments left.

262
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,530
They should be getting offers
from semi-professional teams,

263
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,320
but they haven't heard anything.
It must be frustrating.

264
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,950
That'll be our problem, too.

265
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,900
-We'll be in our senior year soon.
-But still,

266
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,070
they shouldn't be
taking it all out on us.

267
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,490
Exactly. Let's not be like them.

268
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,700
We're good at what we do,
so that won't happen. Right?

269
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,280
Girls, I have to get going.
Take my plate back for me, okay?

270
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,820
Hey, where are you going?
Are you going on a delivery?

271
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,860
-Yes. I'll see you girls later.
-Hey.

272
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,570
Geez, everything's either black or grey.

273
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,860
Is my wardrobe customised for funerals?
It's so monotonous.

274
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,490
I guess this is my best option.

275
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,610
You're here.

276
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,650
This was so helpful. Thank you.

277
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,400
Oh, you could've just kept it.

278
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,400
-It's my brother's, but it's okay.
-I can't.

279
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,490
I should give it back to you.

280
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,900
I don't like feeling indebted to anyone.

281
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,070
You can even call me a perfectionist.

282
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,490
That's a cute hairpin.
It looks good on you.

283
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,240
Really?

284
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,400
I just saw it on my floor
and decided to put it on.

285
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
I see.

286
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,110
-Let's check your body mass index.
-Okay.

287
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,740
I can't believe
it didn't even drop by 100g.

288
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,490
-That's so odd.
-You just started the program.

289
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,820
I knew it'd take a while since
you have high muscle mass.

290
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,530
Besides, didn't we make a promise?

291
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,400
-Healthy weight loss.
-Yes, healthy it is.

292
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,990
You're overweight around your middle,
so let's focus on that area.

293
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,110
The program must be accompanied
by exercise to target the area,

294
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,110
but university students probably
don't have time for that these days.

295
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,110
Yes, it's a little difficult.

296
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,700
May I ask you what you're majoring in?

297
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,610
What? My major?

298
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,950
It's...

299
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,110
-Cello.
-Cello?

300
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,900
Cello?

301
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,360
I see. You're a music student.

302
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,530
I should have known.

303
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,740
To be honest, I was a little surprised
when I first saw you.

304
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,400
It's not easy for a woman
to carry something that heavy...

305
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,490
unless she has strong arms.

306
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,240
You could probably do it because
you're used to carrying a cello.

307
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,150
-Aren't I right?
-Well...

308
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,110
Yes. I guess you can say that.

309
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,030
I'd love to hear you
play your cello someday.

310
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,740
As you can probably tell,
I'm an avid fan of classical music.

311
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,570
I go to recitals often, too.

312
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,320
Of course I'm just an amateur
compared to you.

313
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,240
By the way,

314
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,740
do all cellists...

315
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,990
It's okay. You should answer it.

316
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,650
I don't have to.

317
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,030
Hey, Bok-ju. Where are you now?

318
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,450
-Why do you ask?
-What do you think?

319
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,650
I'm going to your school now
and want to bring you some chicken.

320
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,530
-Are you at the dormitory?
-No, I'm not.

321
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,610
Then I'll leave it in your room.
Share it with your friends. Bye.

322
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,280
No, don't!

323
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,240
Hello? Hello?

324
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,650
Sorry, something urgent suddenly
came up. I'll come back tomorrow.

325
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,240
I'll be sure to follow the diet.

326
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,110
Thank you, Doctor.

327
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,400
Oh no. Dad will find out everything
if he meets them.

328
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
-Hey, watch out!
-Hey, stop.

329
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,610
Are you out of your mind?

330
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,530
I'm sorry, but can you get me to
the dormitory? Hurry up.

331
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,200
Woman, this isn't a taxi.

332
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,360
Wait, what's that in your hair?
Is it a dragonfly? What is that?

333
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,240
Hey, I'm in a rush.
Please help me. Please?

334
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,200
Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on!

335
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,990
Gosh, you're such a nuisance.

336
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,610
Hey, I'm in a huge rush.

337
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,950
-Just a second.
-Hurry up.

338
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,200
-Goodness.
-Go, go.

339
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,950
-Hurry up.
-My gosh!

340
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,610
Hurry up already.

341
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,490
-Go faster.
-Where are you hitting me?

342
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,820
Hey, go faster!

343
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,400
-Gosh, you're so heavy!
-Hey!

344
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,990
Go faster, please.

345
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,200
-Hurry up. Go faster.
-You're really heavy.

346
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,610
Chubs, you're making my life
so difficult.

347
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,740
Go faster, seriously!

348
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,490
Oh, my gosh.

349
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Hey, you're not even going to thank me?

350
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,610
Dad!

351
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,570
Does she think I'm her driver?

352
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,950
The seat totally collapsed.

353
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,280
Oh no! Dad! Dad!

354
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,400
-Dad, Dad.
-My goodness.

355
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,110
You didn't have to run. I could've
just left it with someone upstairs.

356
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,200
This is an all-girls dormitory.
No men are allowed here.

357
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,700
Am I considered a man?

358
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,780
I come here so often for deliveries,
even the housemistress knows me.

359
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,030
No one even tries to stop me.

360
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,240
Whatever, just give it to me and go.

361
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,570
Fine, I'm a busy man, too.

362
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,400
-I won't stay even if you ask me to.
-Go. Get going already.

363
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,030
Hey, it seems all your hard training
is paying off.

364
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,950
Your arms have gotten stronger.
You can probably carry me now.

365
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,320
Why are you so chatty today?

366
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,950
-Go and earn your beloved money.
-Money?

367
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,610
Yes, you're right. I should
go earn money. Enjoy the chicken.

368
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,530
The overall test result shows...

369
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,320
that your stress level is quite high.

370
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,740
You're an athlete,

371
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,240
so being in that kind of competitive
environment has to be stressful.

372
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Tell me. Is there any specific symptom
you experience on the day of a match?

373
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,450
My heart beat so fast
as if it's about to burst...

374
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,860
and all sounds around me
gradually became muffled.

375
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,530
Eventually, I couldn't hear anything.
It's as if everything had been muted.

376
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,240
You couldn't hear anything?

377
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,030
Do you experience it only during matches?

378
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,530
Usually. But it's been happening during
a few recent training sessions as well.

379
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,700
I saw an ENT doctor and was told
that my ears are fine.

380
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,240
I'm sure they are. This is
more of a psychological thing.

381
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:24,530
Symptoms like that usually occur after
a big shock or a traumatic experience.

382
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,150
It could be a type of panic disorder
or conversion disorder.

383
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,570
That's what I think.

384
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,860
Then...

385
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,950
try to remember when you
first experienced the symptoms.

386
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,860
Did anything happen around that time
to trigger such symptoms?

387
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,450
I'm not sure.
Nothing specific is coming to my mind.

388
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,110
From what I see,

389
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,610
you're a highly defensive person.

390
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,200
You don't like
to expose your vulnerabilities,

391
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,700
and you suppress everything.

392
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,070
You probably don't want
to see what's inside of you.

393
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,740
No way. I'm really not that complicated.

394
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,200
See? You're in denial.

395
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,450
Oh boy, I'm in trouble.

396
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,860
Patients like you
are the most difficult to treat.

397
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,200
Nevertheless,

398
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,530
you must get it out of yourself.

399
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,900
Only then, I'll be able to help you.

400
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,200
And on that note,

401
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,990
I think we should get to
know each other better.

402
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,450
How about coffee?

403
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,530
Okay.

404
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,280
Try to remember when you
first experienced the symptoms.

405
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,150
Did anything happen around that time
to trigger such symptoms?

406
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,450
I miss you, Joon-hyung.
Merry Christmas! Love, Mum

407
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,110
Jae-yi?

408
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,490
Why are you here?

409
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,240
-Did you come here because of me?
-That's right.

410
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,280
I came to make sure you take
the counselling seriously.

411
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,900
Come on. You're lying.

412
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,860
I had a seminar nearby.
I came to pick you up.

413
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,950
So you did come
to keep an eye on me. Right?

414
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,110
How is the counselling?

415
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,570
Fine. He seems like a good doctor.

416
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,360
-He sees right through me.
-I told you he's a famous doctor.

417
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,740
I know. He's a great doctor.

418
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,900
Don't worry. I won't embarrass you.

419
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,740
Where's your car?

420
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,450
Let's go.

421
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,490
What's that?

422
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,900
It's your umbrella I borrowed before.

423
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,610
What?

424
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,610
Why did you put it in a bag like this?
You didn't have to.

425
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,990
The person I lent it to put it in there.

426
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,400
Who?

427
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,650
Is it a girl?

428
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,320
It is a girl,

429
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,990
but she's just my patient.
She's a cellist.

430
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,400
She goes to a music school?

431
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,950
Of course. Men have...

432
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,200
a fantasy towards girls
who study music, right?

433
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,820
Don't make things up.

434
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,150
I don't fall for a patient.

435
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
So tell me about her.

436
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
Is she pretty?

437
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,990
Geez. Yes, she's quite pretty.

438
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,360
Really?

439
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,990
I should pay a visit, then.

440
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,820
Tell me what time her session is.

441
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,200
You're here.

442
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
-What's that? Is it food?
-No.

443
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,740
Did you get a present?
It must be from a girl.

444
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,320
I lent my umbrella to my brother,
and he gave it back to me.

445
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,280
Are you satisfied?

446
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,650
It has flower patterns.
Your brother has a weird taste.

447
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,110
What's this? You're so busted.

448
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,650
Your brother wouldn't write this.
You liar.

449
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,070
It's not mine.

450
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,950
Thank you, Dr Jeong.

451
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,110
What you gave me isn't an umbrella
but your kind heart.

452
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,650
Goodness.

453
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,530
Jae-yi has seduced
a naive college girl again.

454
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,150
She's one smitten cellist.

455
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,400
A cellist? Who is that?

456
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,990
She's the same person.

457
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,990
Ms Flower Pattern.

458
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,860
How do you know Joon-hyung?

459
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,820
We went to the same elementary school.

460
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,110
But he transferred to another school,
so we didn't graduate together.

461
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,320
Do you know he was my boyfriend?

462
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,990
Yes. My friends told me.

463
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,280
You have an unusual taste in men.

464
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
We must be deeply connected somehow.

465
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,110
It's funny.

466
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,610
J Weight Clinic

467
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,860
Belly fat...

468
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,030
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

469
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,950
Thank you for the meal in advance.

470
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,070
Thank you so much.

471
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,400
Hey, hey. Bok-ju.

472
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,200
Isn't it too early
to be excited like that?

473
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,240
You little brats. Captain.

474
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,990
Isn't Woon-gi here?

475
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,860
He went out after a call last night
and never came back.

476
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,110
Are you saying he stayed out
without telling me?

477
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,700
Yes.

478
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,490
-Sang-chul. Take the lead.
-Yes, Coach.

479
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,820
-Go on now.
-Gather up.

480
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,400
Gather up. Run.

481
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,150
Hurry up and run, you brats.

482
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,990
-Go, weightlifters.
-Let's go.

483
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,530
What's going on with Woon-gi?

484
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,450
-Is there meat?
-It's here.

485
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,360
Give this to me and get yourself another.

486
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,990
I'm too lazy.

487
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,070
Give it back right now.

488
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,610
What's going on? It's a normal amount.

489
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,990
You should stack food up like mountains.

490
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,280
Let this be the Rocky Mountains,
this the Alps and this the Himalayas.

491
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,360
It actually looks like
you've lost some weight.

492
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,740
-Has she lost weight?
-Of course not.

493
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,700
-Maybe she has.
-Hey, that's enough.

494
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,030
-Stop joking and give it back.
-No.

495
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,110
Give it to me.

496
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,740
-Give it back!
-Get yourself another.

497
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,490
-Give it to me!
-No.

498
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,900
Bok-ju, let's go.

499
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,320
-Joon-hyung, I'll get you one.
-It's mine! What's with you?

500
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,360
-"What's with you?"
-Goodness.

501
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,820
-Give it to me!
-Joon-hyung.

502
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,030
Give it back.

503
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,650
-Cut it out.
-Give me that.

504
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,900
-Guys.
-What's the matter with you?

505
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,740
-Get yourself another.
-Stop it already.

506
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,950
-You'll make me spill.
-Give it back.

507
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,030
Let it go.

508
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,740
Bok-ju, what's the matter?

509
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,030
Bok-ju is my roommate.

510
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,400
Didn't you know?

511
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,740
It feels good to eat with many people.

512
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,030
Gymnasts skip meals very often.

513
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,320
I only eat lunch here from time to time.

514
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,820
-Okay.
-I see.

515
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,990
Joon-hyung,

516
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,780
you look a bit thin.

517
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,490
You should eat well.

518
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,900
That's right.

519
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,070
You like acorn jelly, right?

520
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,950
You can have mine.

521
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,990
I try to stick to just vegetables.

522
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,950
Excuse me. I have things to do.

523
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,990
I'll be going, too. Enjoy your lunch.

524
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,820
Did you have to do this?

525
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,110
Can't we even have a meal together?

526
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,780
Sure we can.

527
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,900
But...

528
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,860
I don't want to make
other people uncomfortable.

529
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,240
You've always been so selfish.

530
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,400
Let's get back together.

531
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,570
I want to get back together.

532
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,280
It must be you.

533
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,400
You're seriously...

534
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,450
I know. You must think it's ridiculous.

535
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,240
I broke up with you after all.

536
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,610
But...

537
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,400
...things were so hard back then.

538
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,700
That competition was so important,
but I wasn't getting better.

539
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,360
That's right, Eun-young.

540
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,740
Look at the ball. Good.

541
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,490
Si-ho, balance yourself on one leg.

542
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,900
Raise your leg higher.

543
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,110
Push it back and hold it.

544
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,200
If you keep this up,
you'll never make the national team.

545
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,650
Your balance is all off.

546
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,530
Why are you getting worse every day?

547
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,990
You should be getting better.

548
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,990
If you mess this up, you're done.

549
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,400
You'll have to retire before
making the national team.

550
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,700
Joon-hyung

551
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,700
Let's break up.

552
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,990
What?

553
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,900
Let's break up.

554
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,400
I want to focus on my training.

555
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,030
I know you're upset for
not winning the competition.

556
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,610
But I have my own fish to fry.
I need to focus on myself.

557
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,280
You keep bothering me. It's annoying.

558
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,780
I don't want to be...

559
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,110
your girlfriend anymore.

560
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,820
I'm sure you had your reasons.

561
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,990
But that day...

562
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,740
On that day at least,

563
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,110
I was having a harder time.

564
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,820
I was disqualified
and I wanted to kill myself!

565
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,950
But you...

566
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,240
You didn't even have
the littlest decency.

567
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,450
You're right.

568
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,110
I was too impatient
and couldn't comfort your pain.

569
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,110
I'm sorry.

570
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,700
That was my fault.

571
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,070
I was too selfish.

572
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,030
I'll be good to you from now on.

573
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,320
So please,

574
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,030
let's get back together.

575
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,110
Please?

576
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,740
Do you think I'm that easy?

577
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,740
I'm leaving.

578
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,740
Joon-hyung, I'm sorry.

579
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,450
-Gosh, I have indigestion.
-I couldn't eat properly.

580
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,570
What happened back there?

581
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,530
-Are they back together?
-I don't think so.

582
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,150
Maybe that's what Si-ho wants.

583
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,110
Who knows what's really
happening between them.

584
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,110
They could be arguing out of love.

585
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,150
Ms Kim Bok-ju, you have
an appointment tomorrow at 7:00.

586
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,400
Don't you agree, Bok-ju?

587
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,280
Hey.

588
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,650
-What are you reading?
-It's just a spam.

589
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,320
Let's hurry. We'll be late for training.

590
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,820
That's Woon-gi.

591
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,400
-Goodness.
-I think he just came back.

592
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,860
I don't know what's going on,
but they'll be angry with him again.

593
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,200
Let's just lay low.

594
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,200
Let's go.

595
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,740
I heard that Goyang has
already reached the quota.

596
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,740
-Aren't we hopeless, then?
-What are you talking about?

597
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,900
That isn't the only
semi-professional team around.

598
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,740
Hey, Woon-gi!

599
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,780
-Where have you been?
-I'm sorry.

600
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,570
Let me talk to Head Coach
and Coach first.

601
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
So you're just going to ignore us?

602
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,280
Did you get some good news?

603
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,320
You seem to be in a good mood.

604
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,030
I'm sure you have something to say,

605
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,820
but let's talk later.

606
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Gosh, he's so annoying.

607
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,610
As captain, you broke the rules
to get off campus...

608
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,240
and missed the morning training.

609
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,950
Shouldn't you give us
some kind of explanation at least?

610
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,280
We're your friends.

611
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,650
Sang-chul is right.

612
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,240
Do I have to report
my personal issues to you?

613
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,400
We were never close as friends.

614
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,700
I didn't want to be petty,

615
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,650
but did you get an offer from
a semi-professional team recently?

616
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,990
Have you been visiting one of them?

617
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,610
-What is he talking about?
-What did I expect?

618
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,900
Why would an ace like yourself
care about what we weaklings think?

619
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,110
Fine, just ignore us.

620
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,650
You're such a traitor.

621
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,030
I have no idea what you're talking about.

622
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,650
-Wait, I...
-Hey.

623
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,950
We aren't done talking.
Where do you think you're going?

624
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,360
-I have to answer the phone.
-Move out of the way.

625
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,110
Is it a coach calling?

626
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
-Give it back to me, you punk.
-You want to start this?

627
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,030
-Please don't do it.
-Stop it.

628
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,950
-What's wrong with you?
-Why you...

629
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,610
Have they lost their mind?

630
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,610
-Come on, stop it.
-Hey, what's going on? What is this?

631
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,610
What are you doing?

632
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,990
Hold it correctly. Lower your bottoms.

633
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
It's an additional 10 minutes
each time someone falls.

634
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,570
You've lost your mind.

635
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,320
Do you think I worked hard to train you
so that you can get into fights?

636
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,900
Foolish punks. You need to grow up first.

637
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,610
Hold it!

638
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,950
If you can't even hold it for this long,

639
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,990
you better quit weightlifting.
My goodness.

640
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,950
Coach Choi, they should be
trained much harder...

641
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:04,110
so that they'd be too exhausted
to get into this kind of nonsense.

642
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,860
When I went to Atlanta
to train for the Olympics,

643
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,450
something like this could
never happen. You know why?

644
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,490
We were too exhausted from training
to get into any kind of fight.

645
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,990
They should just be busy with training.
I'm so disappointed.

646
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,740
He's giving me a headache.

647
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,280
Don't you see what's going on?

648
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,990
Head Coach is very upset.

649
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,900
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes, sir!

650
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,990
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

651
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,030
Good job, everyone.

652
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,030
Everyone, get up.

653
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,650
Do some stretching and come outside.

654
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,610
15 minutes before appointment

655
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,030
Why aren't you sitting down?

656
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,110
You need some meat
after wasting your energy.

657
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,570
What are you doing?
The seniors should barbecue the meat.

658
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,780
The rest of you can set the table
and take a seat.

659
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,240
-Yes, Coach.
-Yes, Coach.

660
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,530
Actually,

661
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,990
I have diabetes.

662
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,360
So my doctor told me not to eat meat.

663
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,990
However, I still eat it.

664
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,240
I can be healthier by giving up meat,

665
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,200
but I'd rather eat what I enjoy.

666
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,400
I'd rather live a happier life than
a healthy one. That's my belief.

667
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,820
I hope that...

668
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,990
you'll live that way, too.

669
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,700
Instead of being happy for
making the national team and winning,

670
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,400
I hope that weightlifting
makes you happy.

671
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,530
Some coaches may laugh...

672
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,650
at what I just said.

673
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,740
However,

674
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,990
I don't want you...

675
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,990
to give up weightlifting because
you've damaged your body so much...

676
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,570
just to win a gold medal.

677
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,110
If your only goal is to win a medal,

678
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,280
then you'd be unhappy
when you don't get one.

679
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,900
However, if you simply love...

680
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,110
lifting that cold, heavy metal,

681
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
wouldn't you be happy
by simply lifting weights?

682
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,610
I'm sorry.

683
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,820
I'm sorry.

684
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,860
I know all of you are having...

685
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,610
such a hard time these days,
especially the seniors.

686
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,110
I'm sure you're worried.

687
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,030
However,

688
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,240
you have to wait until the end
of the game for the results.

689
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,070
Just like that,

690
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,990
you have no idea
how your life will turn out.

691
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,110
During the last half of a soccer game,

692
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,990
you may want to turn off the TV
thinking that the team already lost.

693
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,650
But right then, the team makes a goal.

694
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,820
So you must watch it until the end.

695
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,450
That's how you win in life.

696
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,990
Gosh, I can't seem to stop talking today.

697
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,200
Meanwhile, the meat is getting burnt.

698
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,320
That's all I have to say. Let's eat!

699
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,240
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

700
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,780
-Here.
-Thank you.

701
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,610
-Set up the table.
-Here you go.

702
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,740
-Hey.
-I'll do it.

703
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,360
10 minutes before appointment

704
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,200
It reeks of meat.

705
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,490
Order more meat if we run out.
I talked to Mr Jung about it.

706
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,240
-Is it out of your own pocket again?
-Watch it.

707
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,950
I'm sorry for getting out of line.

708
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,240
Head Coach Yoon, Coach Choi.

709
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,740
I'm sorry, but I have to step out
for a while.

710
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,360
I was going to talk to you in private.
What's with you?

711
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,700
-What's going on?
-You can go.

712
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,900
-You'll be back for roll call, right?
-Yes, of course.

713
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,650
-Is everything okay?
-Yes, it's fine.

714
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,950
See you tomorrow.

715
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,740
Okay.

716
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,990
-But...
-Coach Choi.

717
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,650
Trusting them is also
one way of supporting them.

718
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,860
This is Bok-ju,
and I have an appointment at 7 p.m.

719
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,860
I'm sorry, but I'm running a little late.

720
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,740
Yes, of course. I'm on my way.

721
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,400
I'll be right there. See you soon.

722
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,820
Darn, it's raining.

723
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,400
Geez.

724
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,740
Darn it.

725
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,820
I'm sorry to keep you at work.

726
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,570
It's okay.
I'm usually still here at this hour.

727
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,450
Did you get rained on again?

728
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,740
I guess it's obvious. Do I look bad?

729
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,240
That's not what I mean.

730
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,450
You should stay out of the rain.

731
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,320
You'll catch a cold.

732
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,610
You must be in good condition
to take good care of yourself.

733
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,360
I'll do that, Doctor.

734
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:17,700
You did a great job.

735
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,700
You managed to lose 200g of body fat
without any muscle loss.

736
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,530
Did you stick to a good diet?

737
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,070
Really?

738
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,860
I don't think I kept it very strictly.

739
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,320
I'm telling you the truth.
Why won't you believe me?

740
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,530
Take a look.

741
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,650
This is your body mass index graph.

742
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,700
This is your body fat and...

743
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,070
Ms Bok-ju?

744
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,110
Sorry?

745
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,450
Oh, yes. Of course.

746
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:21,240
-What was I saying?
-Pardon?

747
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,320
"Pardon"?

748
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,030
I was going to reward you,
but you blew your chance.

749
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,360
No, I wasn't thinking
about something else.

750
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,900
I was just too immersed in the music.

751
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,860
Oh, right. That...

752
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,900
"J.B. Breval Sonata".

753
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,950
I heard it's like "Czerny New Studies"...

754
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,650
...to cellists.

755
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,280
Of course.

756
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,110
I heard Breval so many times
that I almost know it by heart.

757
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,950
It's such a long etude, though.

758
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,570
How long do you have to practice
in order to master it?

759
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,950
It depends on the person.

760
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,820
I guess...

761
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,990
-...about three...
-Three months?

762
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,780
From three months to
four, five or six years?

763
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,110
When it comes to cello,
the difference can be big.

764
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,200
Yes, you're right.

765
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,490
Ms Bok-ju.

766
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,280
Then...

767
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,200
...shall we start the treatment?

768
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,610
Sure.

769
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:47,030
-This way, please.
-Okay.

770
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,400
I'm hungry.

771
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,990
We could've eaten more
if it didn't start pouring.

772
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,490
I know. Why did it have to
suddenly start raining?

773
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,490
Hey, where is Bok-ju anyway?
She didn't say where she was going.

774
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,200
I guess she's doing deliveries.

775
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,740
That girl is so busy.

776
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,110
Don't you think we should
try to be better friends to her?

777
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,400
We've had so much fried chicken
at her dad's restaurant after all.

778
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,900
I guess you're right.

779
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,240
Shall we go help them serve
their customers?

780
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,110
-Best friends!
-Best friends!

781
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,240
We're seriously so slow today.

782
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,070
By the way,
why are you so quiet these days?

783
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,360
Your boss hasn't called you?

784
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,450
I made a scene asking for money.
Would you call me if you were him?

785
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,950
By the way, why does Bok-ju
never come by these days?

786
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,200
I told her to focus on training.

787
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,860
She has to start preparing for
the upcoming tournament soon.

788
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,950
I actually miss her now that
I haven't seen her for a while.

789
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,240
My troublemaker niece.

790
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,320
Gosh, hold on.
I have to go to the bathroom.

791
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:05,700
How dare that little punk
call his niece a troublemaker!

792
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,990
Hello.

793
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,610
-Hello!
-Oh my!

794
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,320
Look who's here.
I haven't seen you girls in a while.

795
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,610
Where is Bok-ju?

796
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,950
She's not here?

797
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,490
Why would she be here at this hour?
Is she not at school?

798
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,990
-What...
-Wait!

799
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,110
Bok-ju told me that she was
going to a sauna. I totally forgot.

800
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,990
Gosh, I'm so forgetful these days.

801
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,530
-Take care, Mr Kim.
-Sure.

802
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,400
-Take care.
-Bye, girls.

803
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,900
Hey, what was that about?

804
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,280
Where did she go, then?

805
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,860
Who knows?
Gosh, I can't believe that sly fox.

806
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,860
We've been completely fooled.

807
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,360
Kim Bok-ju, I shall teach you a lesson.

808
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,700
Hey, girls. Why are you here?
Are you going somewhere?

809
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,780
No, we've been waiting for you.

810
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,200
You're late. Where have you been?

811
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,110
What do you think?
I was out doing deliveries.

812
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,700
We were so busy.
Orders kept coming in non-stop.

813
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,400
Don't you dare lie to our faces.

814
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:28,400
We were just at Bok Chicken.

815
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,860
There wasn't a single soul there,

816
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,400
and your dad thought you were here.

817
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,450
You better tell us the truth.

818
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,610
What's keeping you so busy these days?

819
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,490
Where on earth were you?

820
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,360
You better tell us.
Don't even think about lying.

821
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,780
Actually, I was...

822
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,820
-Go on.
-What is it?

823
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,610
I was...

824
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,990
I kept it from you because
I was too embarrassed to tell you.

825
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,450
We're best friends.
Why would you feel embarrassed...

826
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,900
Is it that thing again?

827
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,450
So you've been going to a doctor for it?

828
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,110
Is that what's happening?

829
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,990
You should've just told us.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

830
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,200
I know, but...

831
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,990
What did the doctor say? Is it bad?

832
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,110
Do you need surgery?

833
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,490
No, it's not that serious.

834
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,450
Thank goodness.

835
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,740
You should still be careful from now on.

836
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:37,200
-You have to watch what you eat.
-Yes, I should.

837
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,900
I just didn't want to worry my dad.

838
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:44,990
It will probably get better soon.
That's why I didn't tell you.

839
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,990
You should've told us anyway.

840
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,740
We were so worried about you.

841
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,570
Yes. We'll get mad at you
if you keep another secret from us.

842
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,110
Okay, I'm sorry.

843
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,780
-Be careful, okay?
-Did you get medication for it?

844
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,530
I guess lying also requires practice.
The more you lie, the better you get.

845
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,900
"Bach Cello Suite No. 1".

846
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,450
Pre... Pre...

847
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,320
How do I pronounce this word?

848
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,150
It's okay. Don't turn it off.

849
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,200
I guess you like classical music, too.

850
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,240
Yes, sure. A little.

851
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,990
Isn't Joon-hyung...

852
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:43,860
quite charming?

853
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,320
He makes you laugh.

854
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,650
He comes across as aloof,
but he's actually very caring.

855
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,200
I'm not sure.
I haven't noticed that about him.

856
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,240
To be honest, I want to get back
together with him,

857
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,610
but he's not opening up to me.

858
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,110
I broke his heart in the past.

859
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,780
Would you help me
if I ever need your help?

860
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,990
Me?

861
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,450
I'm not sure how I can help you, though.

862
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,280
Why can't you?

863
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,650
You and Joon-hyung seem very close.

864
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,110
Gosh, no way. We're not close at all.

865
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,240
Okay, I'll take your words.

866
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,240
I bluffed in front of our students,

867
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,570
but I'm also very worried these days.

868
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,990
I'm worried they won't get any offers
and become unemployed.

869
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,030
I know. We should already be
receiving some offers by now.

870
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:47,990
I guess it's because our team's
performance wasn't great last year.

871
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,610
We only have the tournament
and a couple of matches left.

872
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,400
They must be even more frustrated.

873
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,740
After all, their lives depend on this.

874
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:00,990
Head Coach, on that note,

875
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,240
I've been thinking about it.

876
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,030
You'll be discharged tomorrow, right?

877
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,990
You can't even go
to a postnatal care centre.

878
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,990
-Doing everything alone will be hard.
-It's okay.

879
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,030
We can't afford things like that.

880
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,650
I can do it alone.
I already bought seaweed, too.

881
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,110
Just a second.

882
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,320
Yes, Head Coach.

883
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,070
My weight class?

884
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,280
Yes.

885
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:45,950
Well, it's Coach Choi's idea.

886
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:51,400
We know that gaining weight and
muscle mass isn't easy.

887
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,950
But if we do it, winning a medal
will become easier for you.

888
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,400
And Jung-woo will be able
to aim for a medal, too.

889
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,860
I'll think about it.

890
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,490
Okay, sure. Give it some thought.

891
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,450
We can talk about it again later.

892
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,740
All right.

893
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,570
One more, Head Coach.

894
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,320
Let's call one more person.

895
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,110
Just a second.

896
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,570
My goodness.

897
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,200
-Bok-ju's weight class?
-Yes.

898
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,990
I've given it a lot of thoughts.

899
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,700
It's possible.

900
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,320
In Women's 63kg, no one can beat Bok-ju.

901
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,990
She will own it.

902
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,950
If Bok-ju raises her weight class,

903
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,450
she'll be more likely to win a medal.

904
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,530
And the girls in 58kg...

905
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,990
will have a better hope
for a medal as well.

906
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,990
It can be a win-win situation.

907
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,240
The remaining competition
is so important...

908
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:34,990
for their career,

909
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,900
especially for the seniors.

910
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,990
In fact, a senior named Woon-gi is
considering a weight increase as well.

911
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,740
I get what you're saying,

912
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:46,650
but...

913
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,950
raising weight is even harder than
lowering it.

914
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,740
November 23rd, 57.12kg
November 24th, 56.80kg

915
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:01,900
You lost 300g again.

916
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,570
I really should give you a prize.

917
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,240
You're doing great.

918
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,950
You don't have to.

919
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,990
What will you give me?

920
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,530
I'm not sure. What would be good?

921
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:15,950
It should be something you want.

922
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,110
Give it some thoughts.
For now, please go and change.

923
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,950
Okay, Doctor.

924
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,950
What are you doing here, Chubs?

925
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,990
What are you wearing?

926
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,820
-Why...
-Joon-hyung.

927
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,030
What brings you here?

928
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,530
Hi, Jae-yi.

929
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,070
What?

930
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,110
-Do you two know each other?
-Yes.

931
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,740
We go to the same...

932
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,400
Weightlifting Fairy

933
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,530
The cellist I told you about is Bok-ju.

934
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,400
You have the arms of an athlete.

935
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:36,400
She likes soccer. Messi, in particular.

936
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,070
Chubs, I want this. Get me water, too.

937
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,450
-What happened with Joon-hyung?
-Let's talk.

938
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,280
I'm sorry for liking your brother.

939
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,030
Do you like my brother that much?

940
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,990
Why? What do you like about him?

941
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,700
-Is Jae-yi seeing someone?
-Today is D-day.

942
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,950
Doctor.

943
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,450
Weightlifting Fairy
