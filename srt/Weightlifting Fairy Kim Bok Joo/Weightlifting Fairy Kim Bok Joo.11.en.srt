1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,060
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,400
I made up some excuse...

3
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,670
...and told them that she got sick
after the competition.

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,470
Yes.

5
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,670
We decided to reschedule the meeting.

6
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,270
Gosh, really?

7
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,370
I'm really sorry
that it's gotten complicated.

8
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,470
It's all right.

9
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,070
I think Bok-ju is deeply upset
about Coach Choi.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,470
Her friends are looking for her.

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,740
I'll call you as soon as we find her.

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,340
Okay, please do.

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,670
I'll keep looking as well. Thank you.

14
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,800
Did they postpone the meeting?

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,920
Where on earth did that little brat go?

16
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,440
Wait until she gets here...

17
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,700
I'll scold...

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,400
Hey, Bok-ju!

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,670
-You punk!
-Where have you been?

20
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,370
We've been looking everywhere for you.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,800
First, call Head Coach Yoon. Now!

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,100
Dad.

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,570
Dad.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,140
I don't like weightlifting.

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,740
I don't want to do it anymore.

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,170
What...

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,470
What did you say?
You don't want to do what?

28
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,170
She doesn't like...

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,200
...weightlifting anymore.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,740
What are you saying all of a sudden?
Explain what you mean.

31
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,770
Dad, you know how it was.

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,340
No matter how much people said...

33
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,270
...that it's strange for a girl
to like weightlifting,

34
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,200
I liked weightlifting.

35
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,370
I liked the metallic smell
of the barbells.

36
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,170
And I liked the smell of
the chalk powder at the gym.

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,840
Weightlifting was fun
and it made me happy.

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,670
But now I don't like it.

39
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,570
I hate weightlifting.

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,270
It doesn't make me happy at all.

41
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,670
I don't want to do weightlifting anymore.

42
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,300
I don't want to do anything.
What should I do now, Dad?

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,500
Poor Bok-ju.

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,840
Hey, Joon-hyung.

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,470
Where have you been?

46
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,870
Why do you have so many secrets lately?

47
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,340
Are you...

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,140
...dating someone?

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,670
Quack, quack.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,300
Quack, quack, quack.

51
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,570
-What's that?
-Here, it's a toad.

52
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,840
Who knows? It may be your lucky charm.

53
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,340
She must be a very special friend.

54
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,170
I mean Bok-ju. Gosh

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,640
Why aren't you saying anything?

56
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,470
Are you really dating someone?

57
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,340
No, right?

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,270
I think I am.

59
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,570
What?

60
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,670
I think I'm in love...

61
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
...with her.

62
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,140
EPISODE 11
It's the End, It's Not the End

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,200
Wow, in my bowl of beef soup,

64
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,200
there are only two pieces of beef.

65
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,400
This is so interesting.

66
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,800
In Bok-ju's bowl...

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
There are two, four, six, eight...

68
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,170
Did you give her beef stew?

69
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,270
My goodness, you're so honest.

70
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,570
You're not ashamed
to discriminate so openly.

71
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,840
I like that.

72
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,500
Where are you going?

73
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,170
Why are you going back in?

74
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Gosh, it's so dreary in this house.

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,700
It's so suffocating.

76
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,870
Haneol Sport University

77
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,070
After she started weightlifting,

78
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,270
she never once said it was hard.

79
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,600
But she cried and said it's difficult.

80
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,300
I think she meant what she said.

81
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,770
I think Bok-ju is in a slump.

82
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,640
As you know, it happens to athletes
at least once.

83
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,400
She must feel dispirited
now that the competition is over.

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,440
And to make matters worse,
Coach Choi is no longer here.

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,740
What do you think we should do?

86
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,170
I was about to go to school.

87
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,540
Pack up your things at the dormitory.

88
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,500
Just bring the things you need.

89
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,270
What do you mean you're taking a break?

90
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,870
It just happened.

91
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,640
Head Coach Yoon also said
it'd be better for me.

92
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,140
Here you go. They're new.

93
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,070
I'll give them to you.

94
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,140
Bok-ju, are you sick?

95
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,140
Tell us. Why are you taking a break?

96
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,800
Yesterday, you made us worry
by simply disappearing.

97
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,870
What's going on with you?

98
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,100
Listen.

99
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,070
I need some time to think.

100
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,840
Think about what?

101
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,370
Why am I doing weightlifting?

102
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,740
What does weightlifting mean in my life?

103
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,470
Am I doing it because I love it?

104
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,700
Why are you asking those questions now?

105
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,370
So if you don't love it,

106
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
will you quit? Is that it?

107
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,740
You're a traitor, Bok-ju.

108
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,570
How can you do this
without ever discussing with us?

109
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,800
We should let her go for now.
She's not leaving us for good.

110
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,300
She's only taking a break.

111
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I still don't want to let her go.

112
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,670
First, Coach Choi left,
and now it's Bok-ju?

113
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,870
Why is everyone leaving?

114
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,070
I'm sorry, Nan-hee.

115
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,470
I'm sorry, Seon-ok.

116
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,400
Are you going somewhere?

117
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,100
Hey, Chubs.

118
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,370
Are you okay?

119
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,340
No, I'm not okay.

120
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,270
Joon-hyung.

121
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,340
I'm packed and leaving the dorm.

122
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,870
What?

123
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,070
I decided to take a break during winter.

124
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,070
I thought I should tell you
before I leave.

125
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,300
Thank you for everything.

126
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,100
Good luck with your training.

127
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,840
Hey, hey, Bok-ju.

128
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,100
The number you have dialled
is not available at this moment.

129
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,170
Yes.

130
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,840
I thought I should tell you.

131
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,470
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,800
I'll explain everything later.

133
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,800
Okay.

134
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,570
See you later.

135
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,200
I heard you won't be training
this winter.

136
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,300
What's going on with you?

137
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,740
Why are you taking a break?

138
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,240
Gosh, I want to take a break, too.

139
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,670
Yes, I caught you again!

140
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,200
I think I was born to hunt you down.

141
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,770
Joon-hyung.

142
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,370
What is this? Fish bread?

143
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,140
Hop on.

144
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,500
You went all the way
to the intersection for this?

145
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,800
Yes. My dad likes their fish bread.

146
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,070
He must be feeling terrible
because of me.

147
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,070
He didn't even eat breakfast.

148
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,570
Do you want one more?
I bought 10 pieces. There's plenty.

149
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm good. You should enjoy
fish bread with someone.

150
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,640
It doesn't taste good when eaten alone.

151
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,470
Do you have to take time off training?

152
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,740
-Is it that hard?
-It's not exactly hard.

153
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,200
I just lost motivation.

154
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,470
I feel listless. I can't do anything.

155
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,170
What are you going to do
during the break?

156
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,300
I don't have anything particular in mind.

157
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,400
I'll just help my dad
at the restaurant or sleep all day.

158
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,670
Maybe I'll go up the mountain
and train my spirit.

159
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,070
You can't go up the mountain.

160
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,570
Try to stay in town.

161
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,870
Don't go out of my sight.

162
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,340
Don't go too far either.

163
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,800
If you get bored, call me.
I'll hang out with you.

164
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,740
Call even if you're not bored.

165
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,140
I'll hang out with you anyway.
I'll be on standby.

166
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,370
Cheer up, seriously.

167
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,570
You're nothing if you're not perky,
and you're not right now.

168
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,540
Okay.

169
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,540
Call me as soon as you wake up.

170
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,270
Call me before you eat
and when you go to the bathroom.

171
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,670
Are you a pervert?
Why would I call you in the bathroom?

172
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,400
Fine. Don't call me in the bathroom.

173
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,300
Call me before and after you eat lunch.

174
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,870
Call me before and after
you eat dinner, too. Okay?

175
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,200
Why should I call you?

176
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,600
It's not bad enough for me to call you
and report everything...

177
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,500
Then call me at 7:00. I like 7:00, okay?

178
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,800
Bok-ju, you're awesome.

179
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,740
Gosh. You never get better.

180
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,640
Bok-ju, you're awesome.

181
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,300
-Awesome.
-Awesome.

182
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,770
Awesome...

183
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,840
Forget it.

184
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,140
-You know I care about you, right?
-I get it. Your arm is heavy.

185
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,740
Cheer up.

186
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,140
All right. Thank you.

187
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,200
Awesome.

188
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,640
Awesome.

189
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,070
Can I ask something about Bok-ju?

190
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,570
Why did she leave the dormitory?

191
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Is she quitting the university?

192
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,270
Why? Is that what you wish for?

193
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,470
No. I don't hate her that much.

194
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,170
She's still my room-mate.

195
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,170
What a nice room-mate you are.

196
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,670
Don't.

197
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,500
I didn't let you have a break
so you can mop the floor.

198
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,300
While you're at it, have a good rest...

199
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,340
or go out and do the things
you always wanted to do.

200
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,540
Give it to me. You should go to
the hospital and get your dialysis.

201
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,140
I'll go with you.

202
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,570
Forget it. You don't need to.

203
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,240
I'll go by myself.
I don't need anyone to come.

204
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,570
The things I want to do.

205
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,400
First,

206
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,170
study in a library.

207
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,070
Second,

208
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,700
learn an instrument.

209
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,500
Piano, maybe.

210
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,340
Third,

211
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,340
go to an amusement park on a weekday
and ride five attractions.

212
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,670
They must include Mad Swing
and Pirate Ship.

213
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,840
Fourth,

214
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,600
get myself a boyfriend.

215
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,500
Share a drink with two straws with him.

216
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,500
Put my hands in my boyfriend's pocket
while walking.

217
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,400
Get 100 roses from him.

218
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,740
So why is Bok-ju taking a break?

219
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
What's the reason?

220
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
I don't know. Woon-gi.

221
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,370
Do you know anything?

222
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,700
I don't.

223
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,770
I spoke with her on the phone,
but she didn't say much.

224
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,870
Maybe they know.

225
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,340
Hey. What's going on with Bok-ju?

226
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,440
I think she just doesn't feel so well.

227
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,700
Don't be ridiculous. We don't take
a break whenever we don't feel good.

228
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,300
I knew it.

229
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,270
You're working hard
even though I didn't ask you to.

230
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,270
I wish all students are like you.
I wouldn't need to do anything.

231
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,100
Min-young, you cut your hair.

232
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,840
My hair has been this short
for three years.

233
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,570
Is that so? It looks shorter today.

234
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,470
Maybe your face grew longer, then.

235
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,570
All right. As you know,
winter training finally begins today.

236
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,270
So don't slack off just because
the tournament is over.

237
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,840
Today's practice gives you
good result tomorrow.

238
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,070
You should work hard. Okay?

239
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,100
Okay. Good.

240
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,770
Continue the warm-up exercises...

241
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,800
and start practising
your snatch afterwards.

242
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,570
Guys, you can do it!

243
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,520
All right.

244
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
You can do it!

245
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,170
Woon-gi, what is it?

246
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,100
I was wondering what will happen
to Coach Choi.

247
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,370
I'm pressuring the dean about it.

248
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,800
She will return soon.

249
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,800
So don't mind it.
Just focus on your training.

250
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,170
That's how you can help Coach Choi.

Weightlifting Team

252
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,140
Coach Choi Seong-eun

253
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,300
Gosh, this cold-hearted girl
doesn't even call me.

254
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,700
Head Coach Yoon

255
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,870
They must have started
the winter training by now.

256
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,740
Seong-eun, get the towels
from the washer.

257
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,740
Okay.

258
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,640
Hello, Choi Seong-eun speaking.

259
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,470
Hi, this is Kim Dae-ho.

260
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,340
Aren't you Bok-ju's uncle?

261
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,140
Are you free tonight?

262
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,240
I want to buy you a drink.

263
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,340
"Easy Basic English"

264
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,700
Personal Pronouns

265
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,570
You've never learned it before?

266
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,600
-No.
-How old are you?

267
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,840
-Ji-yeon, go practise.
-Okay.

268
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,170
You, too.

269
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,170
If you're completely new to this,
you'll need three lessons a week.

270
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,070
It'll be 150 dollars for a month.

271
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,700
Geez, that was expensive.
It's more expensive than I expected.

272
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,500
I need to get a part-time job
to be able to afford it.

273
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,570
Is there any high-paying job
I can pick up?

274
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,440
-Hello.
-Hello, Doctor.

275
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,400
-Gosh, it's okay.
-I'll just take them in.

276
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,540
Thank you.

277
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,240
Dr Jeong is still as kind as ever.

278
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,870
Gosh, enough of this.
I need to find a part-time job.

279
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,670
Part-time job! Where can I work?

280
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,700
I said no.

281
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,800
Sir, please. Sir.

282
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,870
-I can totally do it, Sir.
-Goodness.

283
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,470
Even bulky guys don't last a week here.

284
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,570
A young girl like you can't do this job.

285
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,800
Don't even dream of it.

286
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,500
I sincerely appreciate your concern,

287
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,840
but I'm not just any girl.

288
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,400
I'm a weightlifter.

289
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,340
I can even lift 100kg weights.

290
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,840
-You're a weightlifter?
-Yes.

291
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,240
-Seriously?
-Goodness.

292
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,070
I even won first place
at a recent tournament.

293
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,300
Do you want to see the article?

294
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,670
Forget it. I can't hire you.

295
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,840
That's a sport and this is work.

296
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,470
This is very different
from weightlifting.

297
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,670
Your back needs to be as strong as steel.

298
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,470
-Gosh...
-Sir, these are...

299
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,870
Where should I take these?

300
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,370
Oh my, they're heavy. They're very heavy.

301
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,640
They're light as a feather.

302
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,540
These, too?

303
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,170
My gosh, they're so heavy.
I guess people call this heavy.

304
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,670
They're not heavy at all.

305
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
(Haneol Sport University

306
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,740
Okay.

307
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,500
Hold on.

308
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,740
Where is she?
I told her I'd hang out with her.

309
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,170
Why isn't she picking up?

310
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,240
Is she sleeping?

311
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,440
Bok-ju!

312
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,470
Hey, Jae-yi.

313
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Here.

314
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,070
I ran here so it doesn't get cold.

315
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,570
What's up?

316
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,870
I was on my way to see Ah-young
and thought you'd be at the pool.

317
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,840
Are you having dinner with her?

318
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
We'll see.

319
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,570
You sure know how to win ladies' hearts.

320
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,500
Fine. I know what I've done,
so I can't really deny it.

321
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,070
But I don't think it's a fair judgement.

322
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,070
My life motto is to not be a jerk.

323
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,170
That makes it worse.

324
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,240
I'd be able to curse you
if you were a full-on jerk.

325
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,840
Goodness.

326
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,640
So...

327
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,640
how is Bok-ju?

328
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,300
Is she doing well?

329
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,100
Why do you ask?

330
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,540
I can't even ask you how she's doing?

331
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,070
I'm still worried about her.

332
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,640
Goodness. Just forget it.
You can stop worrying about her.

333
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,870
Don't show interest in her.
You're still dangerous.

334
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,140
I'll take care of her.

335
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,600
Hey, do you...

336
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,270
What?

337
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,670
I think I'm right about this.

338
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,570
She's not just a friend, is she?

339
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,540
You have feelings for her, right?

340
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,470
I don't know.

341
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,740
I must be out of my mind.

342
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,740
I mean, she's really not my type.

343
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,740
There's no such thing in love.

344
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,570
When you fall for someone, that's it.

345
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,470
I knew it.

346
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,570
I noticed your eyes were sparkling
when you were with her.

347
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,300
Good luck. She's cute.

348
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,070
Is that why you rejected her?

349
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
You made her cry. You're so slow-witted.

350
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,670
You should've known when she
asked you, "Do you like Messi?"

351
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,570
I told you. I had no idea
that was what she meant.

352
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,740
So...

353
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,070
when will you confess to her?

354
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,100
I'll have to see.

355
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,200
It's not the right time yet.

356
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,770
-She's in a bit of a slump now.
-Really?

357
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,600
She's taking a break from training, too.

358
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,800
I'll help her get through the phase
and wait for the right time.

359
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,100
Wow, you're...

360
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,140
You're really serious
about her, aren't you?

361
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,270
We definitely share the same blood.

362
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,840
I can see that you really like her.

363
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,670
Yes. Did you think I was making it up?

364
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,740
If you make her cry again,

365
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,200
I'm going to kick your...

366
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,340
Wow, I'm scared.

367
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,270
Are you going to punch me?

368
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,570
Well, I won't punch you.

369
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,570
No, it's nothing to be congratulated on.

370
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,340
I'll have to work hard.

371
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,770
There are so many that need to
be done at the association.

372
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,140
-Hey.
-Yes?

373
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,140
Since Coach Seong is
on the association's board,

374
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
will it be advantageous to us...

375
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,670
especially at tournaments?

376
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,200
Well, it won't be bad for us.

377
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,140
Gosh, is Si-ho dozing off right now?

378
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,440
What's wrong with her? She has
huge under-eye dark circles, too.

379
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,800
-I hope you enjoy it.
-Thank you.

380
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,200
Is gukbap all you want to eat?
I wanted to get you something fancy.

381
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,270
I've been craving
this restaurant's gukbap.

382
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,240
Remember how we used to come here
all the time?

383
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,340
To the point that we got sick of it.

384
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,700
This place hasn't changed at all.

385
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,400
Of course. Only people change.

386
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,140
Oh, right. Sang-gu never showed up.
He said something came up.

387
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,170
I wanted to see if he's doing well.

388
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,370
Really?

389
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,570
By the way,

390
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,740
how are Joon-hyung and Bok-ju?
Has there been any progress?

391
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,100
I'm not sure.

392
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,570
I hope they end up dating each other.

393
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,140
Rather than the foxy type, someone like
Bok-ju is perfect for Joon-hyung.

394
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,070
She has such a cool personality.

395
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,770
Like me.

396
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
So that's what you really wanted to say.

397
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,170
I hope things go well for them, too.

398
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,700
Chang-geol.

399
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,800
We haven't gotten any orders,
so let's just call it a day.

400
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,770
I'm not in the greatest mood as well.
Okay?

401
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,800
That little troublemaker,

402
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Bok-ju got me all down.

403
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,440
Well...

404
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,640
I think we should go play pool.
It'll be perfect to raise our spirits.

405
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,870
Goodness!

406
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,470
Bok Chicken

407
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,240
-Hey, Joon-hyung.
-Hello.

408
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,740
This probably isn't the best time
to visit us.

409
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,200
Is Bok-ju home?
She's not answering her phone.

410
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,800
-She's not here.
-Really?

411
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,800
She picked up a part-time job.
She called and said she'll be late.

412
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,640
Part-time job?

413
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,670
Courier Service

414
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,770
You're so impressive.

415
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,240
Being a weightlifter certainly helps.

416
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,740
I've been lifting heavy weights
since I was very young.

417
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,340
This is light as a feather to me.

418
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,140
You're cut out for this.
You should stay in this job.

419
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,670
The manager has left,
so we should go home, too.

420
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,870
All right.

421
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,870
You must be hungry.

422
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,270
Yes. I digested my dinner
in less than an hour.

423
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,600
Do you want to go for udon with me?

424
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,140
Since today was your first day,
I'll treat you.

425
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,440
Seriously? Can I eat two bowls?

426
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,800
Hey, I'm rich.
I'll buy you dumplings, too.

427
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,570
You're awesome.

428
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,800
Kim Bok-ju!

429
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,540
Joon-hyung, what are you doing here?

430
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,070
What do you think?

431
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,400
I came to see you.

432
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,400
Really? How did you know I'm here?

433
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,400
I went to your place for fried chicken...

434
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,570
and your uncle...

435
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,370
I'm sorry.
Let's go for udon another time.

436
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,070
-My friend is here.
-Oh, your friend can come with us.

437
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,240
I'm allergic to udon noodles.

438
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,340
Get something else. Their stir-fried
cartilage dish is very good.

439
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,070
-The owner is an amazing cook.
-Stir-fried cartilage!

440
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,770
When I eat with people
I'm not comfortable with,

441
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,600
I get panic attacks and become violent.
I'll even curse at times.

442
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,570
Joon-hyung, what's wrong with you?

443
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,070
I'm sorry.

444
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,340
-He's a little sick.
-I see.

445
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,640
I'll get going now. See you tomorrow.

446
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
Let's have udon together next time.

447
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,640
You're still young. Stay strong.

448
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,400
What's going on?
Are you allergic to udon?

449
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,270
Sometimes...

450
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,840
when I'm in a bad condition.

451
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,870
Let's go.

452
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,270
What?

453
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,700
Goodness.

454
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,240
You're too impatient. Here.

455
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,400
By the way, who was that
arrogant-looking guy?

456
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,570
Is he a full-time employee?

457
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,070
That guy?

458
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,370
He's a part-time worker.

459
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,570
He treats me well like I'm his sister.

460
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,240
What?

461
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,370
How long have you known him
to be so close to him?

462
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,240
Don't act friendly with everyone.

463
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,070
Except for your dad and uncle,
you should keep a distance from men.

464
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,670
What about you? Should I avoid you
since you're also a man?

465
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,500
Me?

466
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,200
-Let me be an exception.
-You're ridiculous.

467
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,170
How's your part-time job?

468
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,870
I heard it's a difficult job
even for men.

469
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,570
Of course it's difficult.
It's different from weightlifting,

470
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,240
but it's not so bad.

471
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,670
After I worked for a while,

472
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,700
I started to sweat.

473
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,070
When I drank a cup of instant coffee
during break,

474
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,840
it simply felt amazing.

475
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,670
You sound like you've been doing
physical labour for years.

476
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,870
Let me tell you a secret.

477
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,640
I'm going to learn how to play
the piano with the money I earn.

478
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,700
Piano?

479
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,170
Is it piano this time instead of cello?

480
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,540
I only said cello because
I saw one of his decorations.

481
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,400
I've wanted to play the piano
ever since I was young.

482
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,300
Every girl in my class
could play it except me.

483
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,300
All I did was sports when I was young.

484
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,240
I was thinking of
learning the cello as well,

485
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,800
but it seems too difficult.

486
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,170
Plus, it's more expensive
than piano lessons.

487
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,770
Anyway, I can't wait.

488
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,770
Do, re, mi.

489
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,470
It suits you.

490
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,170
You have the long fingers for it.

491
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,570
I'll play "Wedding March"
at your wedding.

492
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,170
No, thank you.

493
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,070
You'll only ruin my wedding.

494
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
Instead,

495
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,400
why don't you stand beside me?

496
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,500
Why would I stand at your wife's spot?

497
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,800
Fine! Then don't.

498
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,300
Don't stand beside me.

499
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,800
Just eat.

500
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,700
Don't talk to that arrogant guy.

501
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,800
It makes me feel upset.

502
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,270
Don't you think he's good-looking?

503
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,240
Here. I'd like to hear about you.

504
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,800
What are you up to these days?

505
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,570
I'm helping out my sister.

506
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,100
She runs a hair salon
in front of the university.

507
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,340
Hair salon?

508
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,570
Do you even like it?

509
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,370
Who cares about that?

510
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,670
I just help out with the chores.

511
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,370
Come on.

512
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,370
Let's drink together.

513
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,500
Thank you.

514
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,640
Here, cheers.

515
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,570
Are you okay? Can you walk?

516
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,070
Can you?

517
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
-Excuse me...
-Hey.

518
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,400
What do you want?

519
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,670
Here.

520
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,170
Get on my back.

521
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,200
-Why are you being good to me?
-I'm not being good to you.

522
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,270
Offering my back isn't
such a big deal. Get on.

523
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,370
Mister, do you like me?

524
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,470
What's wrong with this woman?

525
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,070
Listen.

526
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,170
Why would I like an old woman...

527
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,370
Yes, I like you.

528
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,070
I like you, so what?

529
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,800
Am I not allowed to like you?

530
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,070
It's okay.

531
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,400
There's nothing wrong with
one liking another.

532
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,700
What is it?

533
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:27,240
There's one thing that
I just can't understand at all.

534
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,400
And that's love.

535
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,440
All right.

536
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,340
Why don't we date each other?

537
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Pardon?

538
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,840
Let's date each other.

539
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,240
Before I become a decrepit old granny,

540
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,100
let's just date each other
like it's not a big deal.

541
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,070
Do you mean it?

542
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,400
You're not saying it
because you're drunk, right?

543
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,870
Do you really mean it?

544
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,700
Are you serious?

545
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,300
Don't you believe me?

546
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,500
Shall I prove it to you?

547
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,740
You don't have to walk me home.

548
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,170
I can defend myself
if someone attacks me.

549
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,340
No way. Even if you're strong,
you can't defeat a man.

550
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,300
-Ouch!
-What about now?

551
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,840
Okay, I was wrong!

552
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,570
You better watch what you say.

553
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
The winter wind smells amazing.
It's so refreshing.

554
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,870
It's cold. I want it to be spring soon.

555
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,340
Joon-hyung.

556
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,570
-I saw Dr Jeong on the street today.
-Really?

557
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,640
You and Jae-yi sure
bump into each other often.

558
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,170
He didn't see me, though.

559
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,170
How did you feel seeing him again?

560
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,070
Did seeing him again tear you apart?

561
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,870
It wasn't like that.

562
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,770
It just felt strange.

563
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,470
The days I went to the clinic because
I was crazy about him seem long ago.

564
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,740
You know how sometimes
when you catch a cold,

565
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,470
you can't get rid of it
no matter what you try?

566
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,200
I feel like I'm at the tail end
of the cold now.

567
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,340
Doesn't that mean you're okay now?

568
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,300
I'm glad to hear that.

569
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,700
I think so.

570
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,570
Like you said before,
time takes care of everything.

571
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,170
Oh, we're here. You should go home now.

572
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
Can you walk me to campus?

573
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,740
I'll walk you home again after that.

574
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,540
Just go alone. I need to rest
for extra work tomorrow.

575
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,640
What? You have extra work?

576
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,140
Yes, they told me to work extra tomorrow.

577
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,640
What kind of part-time job is that?

578
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,670
Won't you finish late at night, then?

579
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,340
It's okay. If I work with that guy,
we'll finish early.

580
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,140
-That guy?
-See you.

581
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,400
Why do you keep mentioning him?

582
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,700
See you later.

583
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,200
Why does she talk about him
as if they're long-time close friends?

584
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,440
She's friends with anyone
who buys her food.

585
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Gosh, what do I do?

586
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,070
Should I go there again tomorrow?

587
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,570
Darn it!

588
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,170
That guy...

589
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,400
My gosh!

590
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,270
A ghost?

591
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,370
Yes.

592
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,300
Last night, a fencer was so shocked
after seeing the bare feet of a ghost.

593
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,570
Maybe she was dreaming.
Not every bare feet is a ghost.

594
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,200
The thing is, those pale bare feet...

595
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,200
were floating above the floor.

596
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,570
It's called the barefoot ghost.

597
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,340
According to the rumour,

598
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,840
she was a runner who lost her medal
about 15 years ago for taking drugs.

599
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,500
She committed suicide
by jumping off a building.

600
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,200
They think the ghost is her.

601
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,770
-Oh, my gosh.
-Is the ghost pretty?

602
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,670
Sorry. Continue.

603
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,570
She actually took diet pills
that her friend gave her,

604
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,700
-causing her to fail the drug test.
-Goodness.

605
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,300
She turned into a ghost and
looked for her friend every night.

606
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,840
-My goodness.
-That's so scary.

607
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,270
Gosh, it's so scary.

608
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,170
-Bok-ju, come and eat.
-Okay.

609
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,800
Why is it sticking to my clothes?

610
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,570
Gosh.

611
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,370
-What are you doing?
-I'm coming.

612
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,370
I'll come out after I get dressed.

613
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,170
Hurry up. The stew will get cold.

614
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,300
It must be soybean paste stew.
It smells fantastic.

615
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,640
Do you need a bowl?

616
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,840
I'll get it.

617
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,570
Give it to me. I'll mix it for you.

618
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,170
Dad.

619
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,570
Aren't you going to ask me
what kind of part-time job I got?

620
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,470
I don't need to ask...

621
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,800
as long as it's not something bad.

622
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,070
I won't meddle in everything anymore.

623
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,670
You can go back to university
if you ever feel up to it.

624
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,840
Do what you want to do.

625
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,740
It's your life, not mine.

626
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,570
Here. Try it. I mixed it well.

627
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,800
-It's so salty, Dad.
-Really? I'm sorry.

628
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,870
I wonder where Dae-ho went
so early this morning.

629
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,370
I haven't seen him all day.

630
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,740
I must've been crazy!

631
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,570
I won't drink alcohol anymore.

632
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,070
Gosh. Alcohol always gives me trouble.

633
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,440
-What do I do now?
-What is it?

634
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,440
Did you drink alcohol and do something?

635
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,770
Whatever. This is all your fault.

636
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,670
It's because you borrowed money from me.

637
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,370
Forget it.
I shouldn't have said anything.

638
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,070
What should I do?

639
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,240
Right, I was drunk.
Let's just pretend it never happened.

640
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,870
Maybe he was drunk
and doesn't remember it.

641
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Welcome. Please have a seat here.

642
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,270
-What can I do for you?
-Hello, I'm...

643
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,300
What are you doing down there?

644
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,370
Hi.

645
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,600
I brought food for hangover.

646
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,340
Gosh, Bok-ju.

647
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,500
You're doing great. I like you very much.

648
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,440
Right? My dad runs a chicken restaurant,

649
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,200
and he said I'm a natural worker.

650
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,500
Do you have a boyfriend?

651
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,500
If you don't, I'll introduce you
to my nephew.

652
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,640
Really?

653
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,500
Shall I meet him?

654
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,800
Hey, you do have a boyfriend.

655
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,370
That guy with glaring eyes yesterday.

656
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,270
He looks a bit like me.

657
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,840
Gosh. He's not my boyfriend.

658
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,600
Come on. I could tell you were
more than just friends.

659
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,170
He even glared at me.

660
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,740
He's just a friend who is a guy.

661
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,770
He's just a guy. A human.

662
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,540
Aren't I better than him?

663
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,500
You're a lot better.

664
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,240
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

665
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,340
Sir, when are you going
to introduce me to your nephew?

666
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,400
Hey. Let's go out.

667
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,300
Let's go to a cyber café and play games.

668
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,740
No. I don't feel like it.

669
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,470
Okay. If you're determined to mope alone,

670
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,070
I'll just go alone, then.

671
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,200
-Get a good rest by yourself.
-Hey!

672
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,340
You punk!

673
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,170
Bok-ju, so you're working
overtime today as well.

674
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,800
Oh, that guy?

675
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,540
He's a part-time worker.
He treats me well like I'm his sister.

676
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,070
That sly punk definitely
gave her a dirty look.

677
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,470
-I'll get it from the warehouse.
-I'll go with you. It's heavy.

678
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,140
Keep moving them.

679
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,700
Okay. I'll see you later.

680
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,840
My gosh.

681
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,740
Darn my shoelace. Gosh.

682
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,270
Goodness.

683
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,870
I can't see.

684
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,470
How did you get in here?

685
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,640
How else? I just walked in.

686
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,800
Do you still have much to do?

687
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,140
Yes.

688
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,570
Why are you here again?

689
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,540
Nothing.

690
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,170
I went to a club,
but the girls weren't pretty.

691
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,140
Don't go to clubs so often.
You'll hurt your bones.

692
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,870
I'm fine. I have thick bones.

693
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,800
If you have much to do, I can help you.

694
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,400
It's fine. Just go before people see you.

695
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,700
Geez, I said it's fine. Hurry up and go.

696
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,870
I'll help you out since I'm here.

697
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,640
You should finish quickly and go home.

698
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,070
It's not that.

699
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,070
I just don't want people
to misunderstand.

700
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,700
Misunderstand how?

701
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,670
They think you're my boyfriend.

702
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,800
They won't believe you're just a friend.

703
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,500
If they see us, they'll definitely
misunderstand. So just go.

704
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,340
They didn't misunderstand.

705
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,340
What was that?

706
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,870
You're not just a friend.

707
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,240
You're a special friend to me.

708
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,240
Can't you see what I'm trying to say?

709
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,340
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

710
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,370
Yes. I'm crazy.

711
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,840
If I wasn't, I wouldn't do this.

712
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,670
What?

713
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,070
You fool.

714
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,500
I like you.

715
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,540
Not as a friend, but as a girl.

716
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,400
I'm curious if I don't see you,
I'm upset if you're depressed,

717
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,570
I'm happy if you smile
and I worry if you're sick.

718
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,670
It's driving me crazy.

719
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,070
This means...

720
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,500
I like you, doesn't it?

721
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,370
Gosh, is he asleep already?

722
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,170
Joon-hyung!

723
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,500
Joon-hyung!

724
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,270
Who locked this door?

725
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,840
Gosh, I'm freezing.

726
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,870
I can't go home right now, Mum.
The winter training has started.

727
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,570
I get a sleepover next week.
I'll go home then.

728
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,670
Why don't you just hire someone
instead of asking me?

729
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,200
I can't keep...

730
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,500
Mum? Mum...

731
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,340
Who's there?

732
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,070
It's me, Tae-kwon.

733
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,170
-What were you doing there?
-I'm sorry.

734
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,070
I went out to play some games,
but someone locked the window.

735
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,800
The window here was open,
and your voice sounded familiar.

736
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,500
Did you hear everything?

737
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,800
No, I didn't hear what you said.
I just heard your voice.

738
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,440
Fine. Just go.

739
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,270
You're going to get me into trouble.

740
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,370
-I planned to go anyway.
-Where on earth is Seon-ok?

741
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,270
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

742
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,200
Maybe the chicken feet were too spicy.

743
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,670
Why am I the only one
with the stomachache?

744
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,470
Where did Seon-ok go
in the middle of the night anyway?

745
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,240
Go! Go away! Leave me alone!

746
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,140
-Go away! Go!
-What's wrong?

747
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,240
-There's a ghost.
-A ghost?

748
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,140
-What's wrong?
-Seon-ok, there was a ghost there.

749
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,300
What? Where? There's nothing.

750
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,070
-It was there. Where did it go?
-Gosh, calm down.

751
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,740
It's gone now.

752
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,100
-It was definitely there.
-Calm down.

753
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
-It was scary.
-Oh, dear.

754
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,200
Stop crying.

755
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,470
Bok-ju, stop the silent treatment
and talk already.

756
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,200
Bok-ju.

757
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:41,500
Why?

758
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,770
I mean, why me?

759
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,070
What?

760
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,440
It just doesn't make sense.

761
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:52,140
It wasn't long ago when I was crying
and getting upset over your brother.

762
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
How could you...

763
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,840
Is it because you pity me?

764
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,470
Because I have unrequited love
and never had a boyfriend,

765
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,700
so you feel bad for me?

766
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,070
I don't do charity.

767
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,600
-Then why?
-I can't explain why.

768
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,270
There is no reason for liking someone.

769
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,770
I like you because I just do.

770
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,300
Besides, I realised that...

771
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,740
I've liked you since a long time ago.

772
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,800
You're my first love.

773
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,400
What is that supposed to mean?
Do you hate me?

774
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,670
No... Well, I don't hate you.

775
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:43,340
Gosh, how should I say this?
All right. I like you, too.

776
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,570
These days, I lean on you more than
I do with Seon-ok and Nan-hee.

777
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,840
You make me feel safe.

778
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,470
And...

779
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,470
you're, honestly speaking,
a little handsome.

780
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,700
I didn't realise it at first,
but I've come to admit it.

781
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,270
But...

782
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,770
But?

783
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,740
I like you as a friend.

784
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,540
I've never felt romantic feelings
towards you.

785
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,570
Then you can start now.

786
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,540
Go out with me...

787
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,070
for just one month.

788
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,500
See if you can be attracted to me...

789
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,140
and find out how I can be as a boyfriend.

790
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,070
Get a full experience and decide
whether or not you want to do it.

791
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,670
Is this a home shopping channel?
That sounds ridiculous.

792
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,300
Then are you just going to reject me?

793
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,170
We've been through many things together.

794
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,400
You should at least give me a chance.

795
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,070
I'll take that as a yes.

796
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,770
Let's go. It's cold.

797
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,470
Gosh, this lunatic seriously...

798
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,200
Not coming?

799
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,800
What should I do? Goodness.

800
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,670
Gosh, seriously. My goodness.

801
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,670
Keep walking. Why are you staring at me?

802
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:03,840
Go! What do you want?

803
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,700
Why do you keep looking at me? Just go.

804
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,400
Gosh. Kim Bok-ju, you're too much.

805
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:26,500
What?

806
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,370
Do you know how uncool you are right now?

807
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,570
Why are you being all awkward with me?

808
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,070
What are you talking about?
I'm not being awkward at all.

809
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,300
What did I expect? You've probably
never had a guy confess to you.

810
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,400
Try to stop being so awkward. Be natural.

811
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,270
I am being natural.
Blame your unnatural thoughts.

812
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,400
-Hey, Nan-hee.
-Bok-ju.

813
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,500
I almost died
from a heart attack earlier.

814
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,800
My heart is still pumping so fast.
I'm so scared.

815
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,170
I just saw a ghost.

816
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,070
I can't explain this over the phone.

817
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,740
I'd be less scared if you were here.

818
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,500
-Come back soon. I'm terrified.
-Hey.

819
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,170
All right. I'll go home first
and head over there. Okay.

820
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,640
-Do your friends need you?
-Yes.

821
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,770
Nan-hee said she saw a ghost or
something. I'm not sure.

822
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,500
I should hurry, though. See you.

823
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,570
Hey, I'll walk you home.

824
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,870
It's fine. It's right there.
Just get going.

825
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:35,700
She sure loves her friends.
She's so loyal to her friends.

826
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,100
She rejected me just as I expected.

827
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,500
It's all that weasel's fault.

828
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,470
What's this?

829
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,070
Is this Bok-ju's?

830
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,840
ID card, Kim Bok-ju

831
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,470
It is her wallet.

832
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:10,100
Gosh, why does she carry so much cash?

833
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,240
Right, it's probably her pay from today.

834
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:19,570
How can she be so clumsy
about her hard-earned money?

835
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,170
Let's see.

836
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,100
What else is in Bok-ju's wallet?

837
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,740
Gosh, look at that face.
Is she on the most-wanted list?

838
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,540
Everything is mediocre
from her eyes and nose...

839
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,170
down to her lips.

840
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,670
But together, they look harmonious
and cute.

841
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,200
What is this? What on earth is this?
What is this?

842
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,400
Jeong Jae-yi!

843
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,700
Jeong Jae-yi, you...

844
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,070
What's this now?

845
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,800
"The things I want to do".

846
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,570
This must be her bucket list.

847
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,540
"First, study in a library."

848
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:20,640
You wish.

849
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,070
I bet 100 dollars
you'll fall asleep in 5 minutes.

850
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,770
"Second, learn an instrument.
Piano, maybe."

851
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,270
Piano? I've heard that.

852
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,240
"Third, go to an amusement park on
a weekday and ride five attractions."

853
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,670
Right.

854
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,570
You waste so much time queuing
if you go on weekends.

855
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,070
"Fourth".

856
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,240
This is the most important one.

857
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,770
This is it. This is key.

858
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,200
Her wishes are so humble even
when it comes down to her boyfriend.

859
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,670
Gosh, be quiet.

860
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,440
Okay. I obtained key information
at a very important moment.

861
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,640
The universe is helping me.

862
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,800
So as I got out of the bathroom,

863
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:16,300
I saw something
black and white passing by.

864
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,270
I took a look at it again,
and saw loose and unkempt hair.

865
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,440
You know those white nightdresses, right?

866
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,140
Then she went back into the wash room.

867
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,570
I was seriously so scared.

868
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,570
I would've wet my pants if I hadn't
relieved myself already.

869
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:41,700
Yes. And you'd be known as the girl
who wet her pants over a ghost.

870
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,840
You fool. I like you.

871
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Isn't it so scary?
Doesn't it give you goose bumps?

872
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,070
I can't believe it no matter
how many times I hear the story.

873
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,770
I don't believe in ghosts.

874
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,500
But I'm glad that the incident
helped us get together like this.

875
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:00,300
When will you return to training, Bok-ju?

876
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,070
What?

877
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:04,200
Oh, yes.

878
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,600
Come back soon, Bok-ju.

879
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:08,670
I need you to knock out that ghost.

880
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,740
Right. Only Bok-ju is strong and
fearless enough to catch that ghost.

881
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,270
Why is your face so red, by the way?

882
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,070
-Do you have a fever?
-What?

883
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,470
No. Why? I don't have a fever.

884
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,640
You're right. Her face is beet red.

885
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,670
It's probably because
I was out in the cold. I feel fine.

886
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:41,400
No! Keep Nan-hee safe.

887
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,570
Darn it.

888
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:43,370
Who are you?

889
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,140
We thank Ji-soo
for his guest appearance.

890
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,300
Weightlifting Fairy

891
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,300
Hey, why did you insist on meeting here?

892
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,370
I'm here to pick up my girlfriend
of course.

893
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,400
Is someone else coming?

894
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,470
Joon-hyung!

895
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,470
You're really something.

896
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,300
It's cold. Use what you can.

897
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:20,800
What is it? Is your heart fluttering?

898
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,070
I have to go to the hospital now.
My dad was getting dialysis and...

899
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,500
How have you been, Jae-yi?
You haven't changed at all.

900
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,170
Do you still have feelings for Hwan-hee?

901
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,440
Where are you now?
Can we meet up for a few minutes?

902
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,870
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

903
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,370
Joon-hyung.

904
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,400
