1
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,410
-Good.
-All right.

2
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,940
People ask me...

3
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,130
...why I became a weightlifter.

4
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,060
My dad took me to a weightlifting
stadium when I was 10 years old,

5
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,580
and I found myself strangely liking
the metallic smell of the barbell.

6
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,660
That's when I decided...

7
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,020
...to become a weightlifter.

8
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,190
Kim Bok-ju from Haneol Sport University...

9
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,110
will now make her third attempt
at lifting 115kg in the clean-and-jerk.

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,190
Kim Bok-ju

11
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,520
Haneol Sport University

12
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,610
As a young player who made history,

13
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,570
I grew up with weightlifting.

14
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,150
I lifted and threw the barbell
thousands of times,

15
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,440
and I get calluses on my hands
hundreds of times.

16
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,670
I shed thousands of litres of sweat...

17
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,650
...and tears.

18
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,820
And...

19
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,150
...I'm about to go on stage.

20
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,520
The third attempt by Kim Bok-ju
of Haneol Sport University.

21
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,770
-Tell us about it.
-I told you already.

22
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,520
-What is it?
-Come on.

23
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,610
Here is your chicken.

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,610
Why can't you tell us?

25
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,770
Can we switch the channel?

26
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,690
Please don't mind me and enjoy the food.

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,860
-Don't mind him.
-Gosh.

28
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,070
My goodness!

29
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,770
She won a gold medal!

30
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,730
Dae-ho! She won a gold medal!

31
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,860
Yes!

32
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,230
She's my daughter.

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,360
-She's my niece.
-She's my daughter.

34
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,820
Thank you.

35
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,070
Great work. I'll see you at
Taereung National Training Centre.

36
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,650
You're my role model. I'll work harder.

37
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,020
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

38
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,570
I'm Kim Bok-ju,
a beautiful 21-year-old...

39
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,360
...and the history of weightlifting.

40
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,860
We're in the Olympia Swimming Stadium,

41
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,150
where the 35th Presidential Cup
National Swimming Competition...

42
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,860
...is taking place.

43
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,860
Group D is having the preliminary round
of Men's 200m right now.

44
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,520
Take your mark.

45
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,150
In the fifth lane,

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,320
we have Jeong Joon-hyung from
Haneol Sport University.

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,770
He's going at an amazing speed.

48
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,360
Could you tell us more about him?

49
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,770
He has great records in practice games.

50
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,270
He's a rising star.

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,730
Unfortunately, he was disqualified
in the previous competition...

52
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,650
-...for a false start.
-As we speak,

53
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,520
Jeong Joon-hyung came in first
in the preliminary round of Group D.

54
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,690
Let's look at his record.

55
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,270
He's 0.15 second faster than
Choi Tae-hoon of Group A,

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,650
who holds the fastest record in Korea.

57
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,070
EPISODE 1
What Do We Do About the People We Hate?

58
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,020
-Let's go, weightlifters.
-Let's go, weightlifters.

59
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,690
-Let's go.
-Let's go, weightlifters.

60
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,980
-Go, weightlifters.
-Let's go!

61
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,570
Come on. Weightlifters,

62
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,070
-let's go!
-Let's go!

63
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,860
-Go, weightlifters.
-Let's go!

64
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,730
-Go, weightlifters.
-Let's go!

65
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,940
Go, go!

66
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,650
Watch your knees. Good.

67
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,980
Take a look at Bok-ju.

68
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,070
Bok-ju. That's right. Okay.

69
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,610
Keep it up. Look up.

70
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,940
That's right.

71
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,020
You should endure it.

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,940
Your leg at the back was shaking.

73
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,440
Maybe you don't have enough muscles.

74
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,270
You should do some extra workout.

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,020
Don't slack off and work out more.

76
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,860
That's it for the morning training.

77
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,070
-Gather up.
-Gather up.

78
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,020
Yes. Good work.

79
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,940
As your head coach,
there's something I want to ask of you.

80
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,230
You see,

81
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,940
how you finish is as important
as how you start.

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,270
When I was a player like you,

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,320
I always turned on and off
the lights at the gym.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,730
Why? Was I a bad player?

85
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,110
Of course not.

86
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,770
Personality is as important as
the talent and...

87
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,150
In short, don't forget to turn off
the lights, understand?

88
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,100
-Yes, Ma'am!
-Attention, bow.

89
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,940
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

90
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,320
Dismissed!

91
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
-Shall we?
-I'll see you later.

92
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Okay.

93
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,980
Seon-ok, what's today's lunch?

94
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,860
Stir-fried meat, bean sprout soup,
beans, anchovies and yogurt.

95
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
Wow, stir-fried meat?

96
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,480
-Awesome.
-Awesome. Let's have three plates.

97
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,020
-Awesome.
-Awesome.

98
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,940
Let's eat three plates each.

99
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,730
Everyone, halt. Stop.

100
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,520
There's an event at
the assembly hall today.

101
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,650
-Again?
-Again?

102
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,860
-Again?
-Again?

103
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,610
Why do we have to do this every time
there's an event? We're not slaves.

104
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,100
We're not the only strong ones.

105
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,650
Girls who play judo, shot put,
and rowing have huge thighs.

106
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,320
They all won so many gold medals
in the previous national games.

107
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,440
-Let's work harder.
-Okay.

108
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,190
Men's 200m Freestyle

109
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,690
-The final games are starting.
-Darn it.

110
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,820
I can't wait to see the match
between him and Choi Tae-hoon.

111
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,070
-Let's go!
-You can do it!

112
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,840
The players are coming in right now.

113
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,520
Based on the preliminary round,
Jeong Joon-hyung is in the fourth lane.

114
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,690
In the fifth lane to his left,
we have Choi Tae-hoon.

115
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,980
That's right. It's only
the preliminary records, but...

116
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,480
it'd still get on Tae-hoon's nerves.
The final game is bound...

117
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,980
-...to be very interesting.
-Yes.

118
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,610
Now all players are getting ready.

119
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,900
Men's 200m.

120
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,940
Take your mark.

121
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,150
Jeong Joon-hyung in the fourth lane
made a false start.

122
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,440
Does this mean he is disqualified again?

123
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,480
That's right. He'll be disqualified.

124
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,770
False start came back to haunt him again.

125
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,860
It's a shame.

126
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,400
Gosh.

127
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,400
Mr Jeong.

128
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,230
You know me, right? I'm Choi Tae-hoon.

129
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,690
I'm his coach. Can we talk?

130
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,820
You're already talking.

131
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,730
We have a favour to ask.

132
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,940
Would you be Tae-hoon's
private training partner?

133
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,940
A private training partner?

134
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,360
Tae-hoon doesn't like training
in Taereung.

135
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,860
He's better suited doing
private training.

136
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,820
It's more fun to train
with someone with similar records.

137
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,270
We'll be able to motivate each other.

138
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,230
It's a win-win situation.

139
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,190
It's my honour.

140
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,230
A nobody like me rarely gets to
train with a world star like you.

141
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,270
But...

142
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,400
...I have difficulty waking up early.
We can't train in the morning.

143
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,100
I have to take all weekends off...

144
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,150
and I'm sensitive to change,
so I'd like us to train at my school.

145
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,320
Can you meet my requests?

146
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,650
You can't, right?

147
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,110
I knew you couldn't.

148
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,690
It's so heavy.

149
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,070
-Gosh, I hate these chairs.
-This is annoying.

150
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,100
-This is crazy.
-It's so heavy.

151
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,610
-It's too much.
-Why do we have to do this?

152
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,690
Gosh.

153
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,690
Move.

154
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,150
-My hands hurt.
-We have to arrange them now.

155
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,190
Move.

156
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,150
Hey, gymnasts. Please get out of our way.

157
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,360
Are you deaf?

158
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,980
We have to arrange the chairs.
Get out of our way.

159
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,320
-Guys.
-Hey.

160
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,980
Weightlifters.

161
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,610
Don't distract them from their training.

162
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,440
Start over there.

163
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,360
-All right.
-You look tired.

164
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,730
I wonder if it's fun.

165
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,520
I feel so sorry for them.

166
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,150
-How dare they bother us?
-I know. Keep moving chairs.

167
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,980
They're laughing at us.

168
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,060
Darn those sly gymnasts.

169
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,570
They're so tiny.
They're not worth our energy.

170
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,860
-I knew it. Serves you right.
-You deserved that.

171
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,480
How dare you bother us?

172
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,320
-I know.
-We're gymnasts.

173
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,730
I'm sorry. Can you pass me the ball?

174
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,820
That was so funny.

175
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,860
Gosh.

176
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,820
Oh, I'm sorry.
I failed to control my movement.

177
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,270
This is the last one.

178
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm so tired.

179
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,690
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

180
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,270
Can you get up?

181
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,770
Look at that.

182
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,650
Darned witches.

183
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,020
Look at her.

184
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,730
-That was hilarious.
-I thought it was a tsunami.

185
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,190
-Get up.
-Get up.

186
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,400
Haneol Sport University

187
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,150
We just ate, but I'm hungry again.

188
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,440
-It's time for some sausages.
-Why do you have so many?

189
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,610
Give me one.

190
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,520
Cheer up, Bok-ju.

191
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,190
-It's just like stepping on poop.
-That'd be much better.

192
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,230
That was so embarrassing.

193
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,070
Should I drop out? Should I kill myself?

194
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,480
-Geez.
-It's okay.

195
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,570
Just wait a couple of days
and they'll forget about it.

196
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,020
I don't do this often.

197
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,400
Have a sausage...

198
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,190
...and cheer up.

199
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,730
Cheer up. She's trying so hard.

200
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,770
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-ju
You're so pretty, Bok-ju

201
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,150
Stop it.

202
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,440
Do you want some sausages?

203
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,020
If you insist, should I try some?

204
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,360
-Of course.
-Yes!

205
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,440
You're obsessed with sausages,
you have so many.

206
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,150
I love them.

207
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,690
How many do you have?

208
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,940
-Goodness.
-Bok-ju!

209
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,770
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

210
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,940
Are you okay?

211
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,860
I thought her finger got cut off.

212
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,230
Are you okay?

213
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm okay,

214
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,230
but my sausage died.

215
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,190
You should have slowed down
and kept your eyes forward.

216
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Do you want me to express
my condolences or something?

217
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,860
What did you just say?

218
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,860
By the way,

219
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,190
have we met before? You look familiar.

220
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,020
Sorry?

221
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,610
I'm sure we've met before.

222
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,360
She's been in newspaper many times.

223
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
It's on the school bulletin boards, too.

224
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,440
Anyway, I'm sorry for your loss.

225
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,270
Please excuse me now.

226
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,980
Wait.

227
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,020
This may sound random,

228
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,480
but do you like Messi by any chance?

229
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,520
Sorry?

230
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,360
It's nothing. I guess it was too random.

231
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,610
Well, then.

232
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,860
Goodbye.

233
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,570
Go on.

234
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,980
Go ahead.

235
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,980
Be careful. Go.

236
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,770
He sounded so rude.

237
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,570
I should've made him pay for my sausage.

238
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,020
I think he's hot.

239
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,520
Don't you recognise him?
He's famous as a handsome swimmer.

240
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,440
No way. He looks completely ordinary.

241
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,230
He doesn't look special at all.

242
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,940
By the way, Nan-hee,
what were you saying about Messi?

243
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,770
Do you like Messi by any chance?

244
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,480
It's a good tip.

245
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,320
Guys are attracted to girls who
share the same interests as them.

246
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,190
What do guys love? They love sports,

247
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,150
especially soccer.

248
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,690
If a girl likes Messi,

249
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,150
guys want to have a drink with her.

250
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,230
That makes sense. Isn't that convincing?

251
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,190
You say nonsense so seriously.

252
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,150
Don't mind her. That's all nonsense.

253
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,150
Hey, what are you saying?

254
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,400
Do you like Messi?

255
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,190
What a terrible day!

256
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,190
Wait.

257
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,610
Did he drop it?

258
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,110
He has such a weird taste.

259
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,110
Is he a pervert?

260
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,400
Were you nervous about the competition?

261
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,980
Your thighs are so stiff.

262
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,360
That's not it.

263
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,820
I was startled by a sausage.

264
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,070
A sausage?

265
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,520
It's nothing.

266
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,270
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

267
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,650
Hey.

268
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,730
I'm sorry,

269
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,610
but I don't feel anything.

270
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,900
That can't be true.

271
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,400
Don't thighs like this
make your heart flutter?

272
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,610
I wish someone could
make my heart flutter.

273
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,860
It's done.

274
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,860
Be careful today.
Massage them before you go to bed.

275
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,980
Okay.

276
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,270
Thank you.

277
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,110
Wait.

278
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,440
Are you looking for something?

279
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,650
It's nothing.

280
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,360
Who else would know?

281
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,190
We gave you back all the laundry.

282
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,610
I ordered them from Canada.

283
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,940
Could it be...

284
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,650
...those lumps?

285
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,570
-What do you mean?
-Those weightlifters.

286
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,770
Theirs break easily,
so they often use ours.

287
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,440
Our laundry once ended up in theirs.

288
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,360
-It might be...
-Hey, weightlifters.

289
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,980
Yes?

290
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,610
Come here.

291
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,980
You're freshmen, right?

292
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,650
-Yes.
-Yes.

293
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,400
Have you seen my tights?

294
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,230
Did it get mixed into your laundry?

295
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,520
I don't think so.

296
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,730
How can I trust you?

297
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,150
Hey, what are you doing to them?

298
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,940
-Bok-ju!
-Bok-ju!

299
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,570
-What's going on?
-Her tights went missing,

300
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,440
and she's saying we took it.

301
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,980
We stopped using their washing machine
after they lashed out at us about it.

302
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,770
You're actually accusing them?

303
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,100
-Yes, I am.
-Do you have proof?

304
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,440
It's not like I made it up.

305
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,570
Do you have evidence
that these girls took it?

306
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,440
I don't have evidence,
but they have history.

307
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,150
How many times did you girls sneak
in and use our washing machine?

308
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,150
That's not enough to put anyone
behind bars. You need evidence.

309
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,690
This is precisely why
our society never improves.

310
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,770
Everything prevents ex-convicts from
starting afresh with confidence.

311
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,860
Don't you dare bother my girls.

312
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,320
Got it?

313
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,270
Let's go, girls.

314
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,610
-Bok-ju, you're the best!
-Bok-ju, I admire you.

315
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,690
You didn't even sync.

316
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,730
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

317
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,100
The fried chicken's here.

318
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,190
-Sweet.
-I'm so excited.

319
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,320
-Hey.
-Yes?

320
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,570
How can they accuse our girls
of stealing their laundry?

321
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,150
They were glaring at us like this.

322
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,570
What's with those skinny girls?
They give us so much trouble.

323
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,360
You know how our bad times with them
go way back.

324
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,520
You girls did an amazing work.

325
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,440
Keep up the great work.

326
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,610
-Okay!
-Okay!

327
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,650
Good job.

328
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,440
The space the gymnastics department
is using as their practice room...

329
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,570
used to be a weightlifting room.

330
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,610
Was it during the Asian Games?

331
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,230
They got a gold medal and took over
our space. Our seniors were so mad.

332
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,570
-We love you!
-Thank you.

333
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,020
Is that a dog or a bear on your uniform?

334
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,980
It looks like it was drawn.

335
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,230
It didn't stop there.

336
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
At every track meet, guys compare us
to them and humiliate us.

337
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,940
Do you girls remember last year?

338
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,610
That's nothing compared
to the Day of Goo Seul.

339
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,610
Right, Day of Goo Seul!

340
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,730
My goodness, Joo-sang.
Joo-sang, can you hear me?

341
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,400
I'll quit weightlifting
and say goodbye to resin if you want.

342
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,270
I can wear makeup, too.

343
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,860
What is the problem, Joo-sang?

344
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,360
Is this that you don't like?
Or is this the problem?

345
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,320
-Goo Seul, stop it.
-Why are you like this?

346
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Why are you...

347
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,400
It's you, right? This is the girl.

348
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,940
-Goo Seul, please!
-You witch.

349
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,110
You wagged your tail and seduced him!

350
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,980
Lifting you up and slamming you down
is a piece of cake.

351
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,520
-You witch!
-That's enough.

352
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,070
Goo Seul spent an entire year...

353
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,190
coaxing that guy from track
and field to go out with her,

354
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,650
and that girl in gymnastics
just snatched him from her.

355
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,110
Goo Seul ended up getting kicked out
of the residence after that.

356
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,650
Her performance has been bad
ever since, too.

357
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,190
I know. Everyone had high hopes
for her before that incident.

358
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,150
Anyhow, those girls irk me so much.

359
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,730
-Bok-ju, we ate all the chicken.
-What? Oh, okay.

360
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,860
-Gosh, you're the best!
-Nice!

361
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,360
-Ouch, it's hot.
-This is the fourth chicken.

362
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,150
-It's the third one!
-It's the third one!

363
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,190
I'm sorry. I sincerely apologise.

364
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,770
Go ahead and stuff
your faces with it, you fools.

365
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,440
-Why'd you hit our head?
-That was mean!

366
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,690
-Then pay for it at least!
-You'll kill our brain cells!

367
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,110
Are you collecting chicken bones?

368
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,190
Hey, we only have
10 minutes left. Eat quickly!

369
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,320
-Hurry up.
-Oh, my goodness.

370
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,070
-Hey, why are you girls here?
-Hello.

371
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,230
-Good night.
-You, too.

372
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,230
Make him do the deliveries, Dad.
I'll go to the hospital...

373
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,520
What is that? You found it
on the street, didn't you?

374
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,440
Someone threw out
this rice cooker. It's clean inside.

375
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,820
It probably doesn't work.
What are you going to use it for?

376
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,520
Of course I can use this.

377
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,730
I can keep chicken warm in here
when I do deliveries.

378
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,320
Also... What's that thing called?

379
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,230
You know you're not making
much sense now, right?

380
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,570
Shut it. Just go back
to your residence already.

381
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,360
Stop eating so much chicken.
I don't want to talk to you. Just go.

382
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,520
And don't come back tomorrow.

383
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,190
What are you talking about? I'll see
you at the hospital tomorrow. Bye!

384
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,860
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

385
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,400
Hey, be careful! You'll trip!

386
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,440
Goodness! My cute daughter.

387
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,980
-Don't run. Just go like this.
-Just hurry up, would you?

388
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
-Oh, boy.
-Let's do our laundry.

389
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,070
It's time to do our laundry.
Gosh, it reeks of sweat.

390
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,860
-What's the matter?
-What?

391
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
I think I just saw something.

392
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,650
What are you talking about?
I don't see anything.

393
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,110
Was I mistaken?

394
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,770
Let's go.

395
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,650
We'll start the evening roll call.

396
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,020
-All student leaders to the office.
-Have you seen my handkerchief?

397
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,610
What are you talking about?
Just organise your stuff.

398
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,150
Tidy up, please.
Ki-seok will be here soon.

399
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,400
Gosh, where did it go?
Did I leave it at home?

400
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,860
Hey, hurry up.
He's in the room right next to ours.

401
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,440
You're in charge of the stairs, right?

402
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,360
Did you mop the stairs?

403
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,440
Of course we did.

404
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,570
You left in the middle of the match.

405
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,570
I wasn't feeling well.

406
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,610
Disqualification
is nothing to be proud of.

407
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,070
-I informed our coach before.
-Right.

408
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,820
You don't care about things
like comradeship and teamwork.

409
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,730
You only care about yourself.

410
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,980
I guess I'm at fault.

411
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,980
You guess?

412
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,610
This brat seriously...

413
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,690
Ki-seok, what are you doing?
Will you keep us up all night?

414
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,860
I'm coming!

415
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,570
Good night.

416
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,650
Can't he close the door?

417
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,520
Is he a sociopath or what?

418
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,690
Why is he always out to get you?

419
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,360
People either like me or hate me.

420
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,150
Would you like a junior as cheeky as me
if you were my senior?

421
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,770
You even understand your anti-fan.
You're really something.

422
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,440
Aren't I flawless?
Even my personality is perfect, right?

423
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,650
Gosh, you're so perfect.
Is that why you got disqualified again?

424
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,900
You're worse than me
who came in fifth place.

425
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,440
Just give up already.

426
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,070
Hearing you swear at me
is actually making me feel better.

427
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,150
-You jerk. I'll teach you a lesson.
-Ouch, stop it.

428
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,400
Hey, get up. Let's go out.

429
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,650
We need to lift up our spirits.

430
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,320
The roll call is done.
We can't go out now, you fool.

431
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,150
Hurry up. Wow, look at this!

432
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,110
Min-young, it's been a long time.

433
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,440
Hey, you look gorgeous today.

434
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,020
Girls, I'm here!

435
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,190
Hey, let's drink. Cheers!

436
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,270
You're a professional swimmer, right?

437
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,980
You have such broad shoulders.

438
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,440
I saw your photo
on Hye-jin's social media page.

439
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,650
Well, can I have your number?

440
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,940
My mum took my phone.

441
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,690
My performance hasn't been good lately.

442
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,860
She thinks it's all because of girls.

443
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,820
Have a good time.

444
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,190
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

445
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,360
Joon-hyung, you can eat breakfast, right?

446
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,230
-I'm fixing you breakfast.
-Not too much food, Mum.

447
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,980
Where did it go?

448
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,270
-Good morning.
-You're up early.

449
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,230
-Get in. I'll give you a ride.
-It's okay.

450
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,520
I'll run and get some exercise.

451
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,150
Just get in.

452
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,230
You must be exhausted
from yesterday's match.

453
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,940
You're just bringing it up now?

454
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,230
Mum and Dad probably wanted to talk
about it but they didn't say a word.

455
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,150
Everyone in our family loves to act cool.

456
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,110
We all know how upset you must be.
Bringing it up is pointless.

457
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,360
Sure. I was so upset that
I went out and partied all night.

458
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,150
I'll get going since I'm so uncool.

459
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,440
Let's see if your clunker
can be as fast as me.

460
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,770
What are you doing?
Follow me with your car.

461
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,860
Gosh, it looks like we've been
too lax with you guys. Seon-ok.

462
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,400
What are you thinking? You've put on 2kg.

463
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,360
I had fried chicken last night.

464
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,190
Gosh, seriously.

465
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,190
-Don't laugh.
-If you guys pig out like this,

466
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,150
you'll regret it so much later.
I told you.

467
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,690
For the Atlanta Olympics,

468
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,360
I had to lose 3kg as my weight class
was unexpectedly changed.

469
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,650
I starved myself and got rid of
every drop of water in my body...

470
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,860
in order to shed the 3kg.

471
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,270
Even someone as disciplined as me
had to...

472
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,570
-Listen!
-My goodness.

473
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,570
Try to manage your weight on
daily basis and eat less meat, please.

474
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,860
-Okay!
-Okay!

475
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,610
Head Coach Yoon!

476
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,320
-Hello.
-Hello.

477
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,020
-Hello, Sir.
-Hello, everyone.

478
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,270
Hello.

479
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,360
What brings you here?

480
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,360
Someone ordered chicken
and suddenly cancelled the order.

481
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,070
I thought the kids can use a snack.

482
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,110
Gosh, you didn't have to do this.
I'd feel bad.

483
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,860
What are you talking about?
You're making me feel bad.

484
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,440
You made my Bok-ju who she is today.

485
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,520
She was thinking about quitting...

486
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,070
because she's tall
and has long arms and legs.

487
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,770
You encouraged her...

488
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,070
and told her all she needs
is affection towards weightlifting.

489
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,320
-I'm so grateful to you that...
-Everyone, applaud!

490
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,230
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

491
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,190
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the food.

492
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

493
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,320
-Thank you.
-Go on and eat.

494
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,320
Why'd you come?
I was going to the hospital later.

495
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,360
We have to do this
once in a while, you brat.

496
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,770
They always make things
comfortable for you.

497
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,480
Head Coach Yoon, go on and eat.

498
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,020
I used very young chickens.

499
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,480
-They were not even fully grown.
-Thank you.

500
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,150
Bok-ju.

501
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,110
Since your dad is here, why don't
you go to the hospital with him?

502
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,980
The evening training is
individual training anyway.

503
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,190
Go on.

504
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,440
Thank you, Sir.

505
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:20,860
Nephrology Department

506
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,230
Chang-geol.

507
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,400
I'm sorry, but I have to go out.

508
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,730
Jong-ki's father died. You know
my army friend, Jong-ki, right?

509
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
-Of course I do.
-Okay.

510
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,520
By the way,

511
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,770
his father would be thrilled...

512
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,230
to see you in this glitter jacket.

513
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,940
Are you playing
a nightclub singer this time?

514
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,860
I'll go change.

515
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,150
My gosh, how silly.

516
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,940
If he wants to be an actor,
he should play better roles.

517
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,400
He's always an extra
who doesn't even have a line.

518
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,400
Okay. That was great.

519
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,860
Good cycles, Joon-hyung.

520
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,360
Well done.

521
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,820
Ki-seok, you should work harder.

522
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,360
Geez, I got a callus again.

523
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,650
Look at this. It's a wound of glory.

524
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,520
My goodness.

525
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,650
-You're back.
-Hey.

526
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,940
Do you have to do that in my room?

527
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,400
Gosh, it stinks.

528
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,020
Even if you colour your nails,
it will come off soon.

529
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,860
I don't know why you even bother.

530
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,070
It's not colouring. It's called nail art.

531
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,690
Don't be ridiculous.

532
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,770
Remove the calluses
on your hands instead.

533
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,770
They'll come off when you lift the
barbell and your hands will bleed.

534
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,980
Let her be.

535
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,400
She's just trying to impress
the guy she likes.

536
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,400
Hey, don't try to impress him with those.

537
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,520
Work on your inner beauty instead.
That'd be much faster.

538
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,150
We're a lot more charming than
the girls in the gymnastics team.

539
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,770
We're nicer and more self-sufficient.

540
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,980
Not to mention...

541
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,520
our glamorous figure.

542
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,150
That's right. We have a glamorous figure.

543
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,730
-Awesome.
-Awesome.

544
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,610
You're such an optimistic girl, Bok-ju.

545
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,860
-You have high self-esteem.
-I don't know if it's self-esteem...

546
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,190
or plain vanity.

547
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,270
Nan-hee.

548
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,690
You're out. Get out.

549
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,980
Go to your room.

550
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,730
Where did it go?

551
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
-What?
-What?

552
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,690
The T-shirt I wore at
the national games. It's not here.

553
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,730
-It should be there. Look harder.
-Where did it go?

554
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Are you sure?
You don't know where my T-shirt is?

555
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,520
No. I think I saw it when
I was doing laundry.

556
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,190
Oh, no.

557
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,820
I won the gold medal in that.
I need to wear it for the next game.

558
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,070
This is bad.

559
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,400
I can't find it.

560
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,270
It's not in my room,
and no one else has seen it.

561
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,770
What will you do now?

562
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,570
You always wear it for the games.

563
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,110
Gosh, I'm doomed.

564
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,070
I can't win a medal without it.

565
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,230
Listen. Maybe...

566
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,690
This is just an assumption.

567
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,860
Maybe the girls in gymnastics
did it to get back at you.

568
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,320
They always blame us when
their clothes go missing.

569
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,980
Maybe they did it to...

570
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,900
Bok-ju, it was just an assumption.

571
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,400
Don't you know she acts first
when she's angry?

572
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,150
-Bok-ju.
-Can't I even make an assumption?

573
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,320
So you're saying...

574
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,650
we did something to your T-shirt?

575
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,110
You think we took it?

576
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,070
-Didn't you?
-Are you crazy?

577
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,400
Why would we? It's too big for us anyway.

578
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,690
You think we took your clothes.

579
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,400
You couldn't find any proof,

580
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,770
-so you probably...
-We did it to get back at you?

581
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,690
She's driving me crazy.

582
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,610
-She thinks we're that childish.
-I know.

583
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,730
Do you have proof?
You told us proof matters.

584
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,570
Yes. I'm here to find proof.

585
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,860
Let me search your room.

586
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,230
No.

587
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,190
Why should I let you do that? Why?

588
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,270
I must find that T-shirt. Move.

589
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,150
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

590
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,190
It's my lucky charm. I have to find it.

591
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,980
-Gosh.
-I said no.

592
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,610
Move or you'll get hurt.

593
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,730
-Move.
-What's the matter with you?

594
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,900
-Get off of me.
-Don't push them, guys.

595
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,360
Hey, no pushing.

596
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
-Goodness.
-Are you okay?

597
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,770
What should we do?

598
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,070
My wrist.

599
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,650
Infirmary

600
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,860
Goodness.

601
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,440
Who said you can rest?
Straighten your arms!

602
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,900
Get up, Bok-ju.

603
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,770
What were you doing? Are you a thug?

604
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,320
Are you really a human bulldozer
like the others are saying?

605
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,070
Why did you use your strength
on a person?

606
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,520
No, Sir. I'm sorry.

607
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,270
Is that why you work out so hard?
To beat up a person?

608
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,690
-But today...
-Don't make excuses.

609
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,230
You did something terrible
and your excuse won't work.

610
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,770
Watch your behaviour.
We're strength athletes.

611
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,150
If you do something wrong, you'll put
us all in trouble. Understand?

612
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,650
Coach.

613
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,270
She hurt her muscle.

614
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,980
She'll have to rest
for two to three weeks.

615
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,150
It's not like you to do something so...

616
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,230
I didn't do it on purpose.

617
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,860
She stopped me from going into
her room, so I pushed her a little.

618
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,980
It's true. I didn't even use
much strength.

619
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,190
I know.

620
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,230
But apologise to her still.

621
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,320
Try not to get involved with
those gymnasts.

622
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,190
Darn it.

623
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,440
He had to apologise to their coach
so many times.

624
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,360
He doesn't want to make any trouble,
so do as he says.

625
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,400
I'm sorry.

626
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,820
What did you say? I can't hear you.

627
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,650
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. Happy now?

628
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,980
I don't know.

629
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,820
I'll see how you behave...

630
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,440
and decide whether to forgive you or not.

631
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,650
Let's go.

632
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,440
Gosh, I hate them.

633
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,440
This is too upsetting.

634
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,520
Hurry.

635
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,860
Our bunk bed is still here.

636
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,020
Today's been such a long day.

637
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,070
All because of a stupid washing machine.

638
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,110
What will you do about your T-shirt?
It's your lucky charm.

639
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,650
Darn those witches in gymnastics.

640
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,150
My dad was right.

641
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,650
We can't do anything about
the people we hate.

642
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,320
Hey, gymnast witches!

643
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,320
Sure you're pretty and popular,
but that's not everything.

644
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,440
You should be a decent human being first.

645
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,570
That's right!

646
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,570
We know you have bad morning breath
just like us, too.

647
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,360
Don't be so cheeky.

648
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,190
We have bigger chest than you!

649
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,020
You've got nothing.

650
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,150
They've got nothing at all.

651
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,360
How noisy. You're weightlifters, right?

652
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,980
No.

653
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,980
We're judo players.

654
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

655
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,770
Bok-ju,

656
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,320
if both Song Joong-ki
and Kim Soo-hyun ask you out,

657
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,610
who would you choose?

658
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,110
Can't I date both?

659
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,440
Shame on you.

660
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,650
You can't have everything.

661
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,270
Can't I?

662
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,570
I'm always giving up to others.

663
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,980
It's nothing to fight over.
Just admire the stars.

664
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,520
The weather is so nice.

665
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,440
-Nan-hee.
-Yes.

666
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,230
-Where's our fish jerky?
-We ate it all last time.

667
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,070
-We didn't.
-We need something to eat.

668
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,150
I didn't eat it. Stop suspecting me.

669
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,690
-I'm so hungry.
-Nan-hee, you sound so guilty.

670
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,270
-Fine, I ate it.
-I knew it.

671
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,770
Joon-hyung, let's go out.

672
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,400
Let's go out.

673
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,230
The headmaster is in his room...

674
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,020
and Ki-seok is already sleeping.

675
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,270
I don't want to. I'm tired.

676
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,020
Just an hour. Let's play some games
for just an hour.

677
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,730
-Please.
-Gosh.

678
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,770
My goodness.
It's not even two or three hours.

679
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,070
It's just an hour.
Is it such a big favour to ask?

680
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,820
I'm so sad.

681
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,190
Geez, you're so annoying.

682
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,770
I'll ask them to change my roommate.

683
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,940
-You're going out, right?
-Fine, whatever.

684
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,820
I love you, Joon-hyung.

685
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,270
Stop it.

686
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,650
Stop it already. How gross.

687
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,860
Wait. Who are you?

688
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,730
Who are you? Stop there.

689
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Hurry, hide.

690
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,520
Where did they go?

691
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,940
-Has she left?
-Yes, she's gone.

692
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,520
-Who's that?
-It's a pervert!

693
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,150
It's a pervert! Catch him!

694
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,320
It's a pervert! Hurry up!

695
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,440
Where are you going?

696
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,730
Stop there!

697
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,940
Hey, come down.

698
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,190
I'm coming down.

699
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,440
What's happening? Hey, hurry up.

700
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,860
You pervert!

701
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,360
He's here! I caught the pervert!

702
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,440
-You pervert!
-Hey!

703
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,730
-Come here, you pervert.
-Let go!

704
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,400
-Let go! Hey!
-Where are you going?

705
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,690
Hey!

706
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,770
-Don't go, you pervert!
-Come down!

707
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,570
It wasn't me.

708
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,650
It was him. I saw it clearly.

709
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,730
What are you talking about?

710
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,650
We were going out to play some games.
She just popped out.

711
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,520
I could just ask a girl out.
Why would I steal girls' clothes?

712
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:40,770
That's why you're a pervert.
I saw it all. I have perfect eyesight.

713
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,230
This is crazy.

714
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,320
There's no evidence it was him...

715
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,150
and I can guarantee
he wouldn't do such a thing.

716
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,320
Why don't we go back to our rooms
for now?

717
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,440
All right.

718
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,690
Hey, you'll get penalty points.

719
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,360
Why doesn't our security system work?

720
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,150
We should change it soon.

721
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,860
You can't just let him go like this.
He is a pervert.

722
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,820
He carries a girly
lace handkerchief with him.

723
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:24,980
Give my handkerchief back.

724
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,940
Give me my T-shirt back first.

725
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,440
Why do you think I have it?

726
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,110
I can't give you your handkerchief, then.

727
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,440
Fine. Bring it on.

728
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,820
I warned you.

729
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,690
I was waiting for you to get caught.

730
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,070
Do you know why I hate you so much?

731
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,860
It's because you overestimate yourself.

732
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,150
And it shows on your face.

733
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,860
Wake up.

734
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,900
You might get good records
during practice,

735
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,900
but you break down in real competitions.

736
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,980
You are...

737
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,480
neither excellent nor terrible, which
makes you the most problematic guy.

738
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,520
Know your place.

739
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,860
Do 100 sets if you have a conscience.

740
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,860
Gosh, this is so exhausting.

741
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:27,940
Joon-hyung!

742
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,610
Joon-hyung.

743
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:35,610
Joon-hyung, I'm sorry.
It's my fault, Joon-hyung.

744
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,940
Hey.

745
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,770
Are you okay?

746
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,020
-Hey.
-Yes.

747
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,860
-Water.
-Water?

748
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,770
Okay. I'll get you
the highest-quality water.

749
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,020
Wait. Do I have any change?

750
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,650
I'll get some change from my room.

751
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,520
Gosh, I can't believe you.

752
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,400
Joon-hyung.

753
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,980
I'm so sorry.

754
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,940
-I didn't mean to.
-Forget it.

755
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,070
Joon-hyung, I'm sorry.

756
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,820
Why are you doing this to me?

757
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,770
I'm so sorry.

758
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,440
Forget it. I'll get water myself.

759
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,020
Let's see.

760
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,770
Thank you.
I'll use it for a good purpose.

761
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,110
I see you're a habitual thief.

762
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,190
All the students throw coins here.
I always wondered where they end up.

763
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,520
Don't get me wrong.
I just want to make use of them.

764
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,940
Do you know how many coins
go to waste every year?

765
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,690
I'm just concerned about our environment.

766
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,230
I see.

767
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,610
You're so thoughtful.

768
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,730
By the way, give back my handkerchief.

769
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,270
You're asking me?

770
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,400
Why would I, Mr Pervert?

771
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,360
Hey.

772
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,150
Give it back to me while I'm being nice.

773
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,400
Hey, Sausage!

774
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,520
-Go, weightlifters!
-Go, weightlifters!

775
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,610
-Go!
-Go!

776
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,440
-Go, weightlifters!
-Go, weightlifters!

777
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,980
-Go, weightlifters!
-Go, weightlifters!

778
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,650
Give back my handkerchief.

779
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,690
Give back my T-shirt first.

780
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,730
Joon-hyung, get into formation!

781
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:06,270
Sports Coaching Seminar

782
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,400
Women's Dormitory

783
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,230
Gosh, I hate him.

784
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,110
It's not just an ordinary handkerchief.
Give it back.

785
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,900
My T-shirt is special, too.

786
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,900
Hey, you're going to regret this later.

787
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,230
Just give it to me now
so you won't feel too sorry.

788
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,320
I hope I'll feel sorry someday.

789
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:43,020
National Gymnastics Team
Selection Contest 2017

790
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,190
Next up is number five,
Song Si-ho in Ribbon.

791
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:19,110
The preliminary round for the 2017
National Team Selection Tournament.

792
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,020
Song Si-ho,
a junior at Haneol Sport University,

793
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,020
will give a ribbon performance.

794
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,730
She chose "Libertango"
for this performance.

795
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,390
2017 National Team Selection Tournament

796
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,690
-My goodness.
-I'm so sick of this.

797
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,940
-This is ridiculous.
-We always do all the work.

798
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,070
Why does our school host so many events?

799
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,730
I have to find my lucky charm soon.

800
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,110
Hey,

801
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,190
are you sure that swimmer's a pervert?

802
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,650
How can a guy who looks like him
be a pervert?

803
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,320
Gosh, you're at it again.

804
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,480
You care too much about looks,
you shallow girl.

805
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,940
Don't let his face fool you.

806
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,520
I also don't think he's a pervert.

807
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,820
Why would I falsely accuse him?

808
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,440
-The bicycle.
-The sausage.

809
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,860
Gosh, what kind of person
do you think I am?

810
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,400
We know you so well.

811
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,070
You're tactless and reckless.

812
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,400
You girls know nothing about me.
Hurry up already.

813
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,820
Oh, boy.

814
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,860
Gosh, be careful.

815
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:33,520
Just what are we doing here?

816
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,150
-Put them down there.
-Move. Hurry up.

817
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,900
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

818
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,860
-Move quickly.
-Hurry up.

819
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,230
-Hey, move it.
-Hurry up.

820
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,020
Get back here, girls.

821
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,320
You can't just throw
the chairs like this.

822
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,270
You have to pile them up
nicely at the corner.

823
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,730
You are all so thoughtless.

824
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,320
Go bring the boys, too.

825
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,570
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

826
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,070
What is it?

827
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,980
You saw?

828
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,190
Let go. Let go!

829
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,400
-Don't touch us!
-You pervert!

830
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,940
Let go, you pervert!

831
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,190
Go away!

832
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,520
-What's going on?
-Stop there.

833
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:40,650
-The underwear...
-Get him!

834
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,650
-I saw it.
-You're dead!

835
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,940
-Get him!
-You pervert!

836
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,980
Your leg must touch your ear.

837
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,270
Good. Hold it and drop your hand.

838
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,230
Stay balanced. Great.

839
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,820
Good job.

840
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,270
Go lower.

841
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,770
Hey. You got it, too, right?

842
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,150
I was so shocked to know that he did it.

843
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:07,730
Me, too. I feel bad for
blaming it on the weightlifter girls.

844
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,190
They falsely accused us, too.
Just act like we don't know about it.

845
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,150
Don't show them that you feel apologetic.

846
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,270
Hush. Who's chatting right now?

847
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,570
Focus on warming up.

848
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,190
No, you have to go lower.

849
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,110
Hey, pay attention to your feet.

850
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,860
Keep going.

851
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,360
Coach Seong, Si-ho is here.

852
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,860
-Unbelievable.
-How can he steal underwear?

853
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,770
-What are you looking at?
-What?

854
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,230
-Did you see that?
-That piece of...

855
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,770
-Thank you.
-He's crazy.

856
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:42,070
Darned pervert.

857
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,610
-We have to go.
-That jerk needs to be punished.

858
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,110
Hey, let's go.

859
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,690
From now on, make sure you tell us first.

860
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,730
I can't believe it.

861
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,940
It's easy to miss what's in front of you.

862
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,730
You can never judge a book
by its cover. Let's go.

863
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:57,820
Bok-ju, come on.

864
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,400
Winner of the Third Junior High...

865
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,320
Hey, what shall we eat?

866
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,190
Are you hungry already?

867
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,360
Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

868
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,150
Why did that jerk have to show up
right at this moment?

869
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,860
Should I transfer to a different school?

870
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,650
What should I do?

871
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,230
Excuse me. Can you get the door for me?

872
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,150
Thanks.

873
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,440
Room 302, Kim Bok-ju

874
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,440
Could it be you in Room 302?

875
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,270
Why do you ask?

876
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,940
Nice to meet you.

877
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,730
I'm Song Si-ho,
a junior in Rhythmic Gymnastics.

878
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,360
I'll be your roommate.

879
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,480
This was the only room available.

880
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,110
I just got here from Taereung.
I didn't get into the national team.

881
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,610
Let's have fun together.

882
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,150
Hey. Isn't she Song Si-ho,
one of the national team hopefuls?

883
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,980
She said she's my roommate.

884
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,360
Get ready for a tough time.

885
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,190
It's not like I have a choice.

886
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,940
Hi, your name's Bok-ju, right?

887
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,150
Do you mind keeping the window closed?

888
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:56,570
I can't catch a cold as my bronchial
tubes get inflamed easily. Sorry.

889
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,020
I keep the window open
because I get hot easily.

890
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,320
Hey, can you make some room
in the closet?

891
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,980
It's a bit too packed.

892
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:15,440
Sure. Sorry, I've been using
the entire closet by myself.

893
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,150
Here.

894
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,770
Haneol Sport University

895
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,320
Joon-hyung, Joon-hyung. Did you hear?

896
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,440
The pervert in the dormitory
has been caught.

897
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,480
It was the sly-looking man
in the administrative office.

898
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,360
Your innocence has been proven.

899
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,770
Why did he do that?

900
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,520
How would I know? By the way,

901
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,360
there's a more shocking news.

902
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,110
Si-ho is back from Taereung.

903
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:08,230
Your ex-girlfriend is back.
She didn't pass the preliminaries.

904
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,690
Why did she do that?

905
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,980
Excuse me.

906
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,230
Excuse me.

907
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,360
I'm looking for a tall guy.

908
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,980
He has a pointy chin...

909
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,520
and he rides his bicycle every day.

910
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,520
Do you know who it is?

911
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:51,860
I have no idea.

912
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:55,770
Girls always talk about how
attractive he is. You must know him.

913
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:59,570
-You know that guy...
-Looking for me?

914
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,520
A tall guy with a pointy chin...

915
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,570
who always rides his bicycle.

916
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,610
That's me, right?

917
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,520
Well...

918
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,570
Here.

919
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,230
I'm sorry that I jumped to conclusion.

920
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,730
I felt bad, so I washed it for you.

921
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,650
Why did you wash this?

922
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,070
Who says you can wash it?

923
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,020
Hey.

924
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,440
Is washing it
such a horrible thing to do?

925
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,230
I felt bad...

926
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,070
that I came to give it to you
even though I'm late for my training.

927
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,070
Gosh, why are you trying
to pick a fight with me?

928
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,980
I'm speechless.

929
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,230
Give it back. I'll soil it again for you.

930
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,770
-Give it to me.
-Let it go.

931
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,360
-Come on. I'll make it dirty again.
-I said let it go!

932
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,520
Help!

933
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,650
No!

934
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,400
Help me!

935
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:24,650
Thanks to Yoon Jin-hee, Jota,
and Lee Su-ji.

Weightlifting Fairy

937
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,400
-Why are you being so mean?
-It's so fun.

938
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,320
-Hey. Give me a high-five.
-You punk.

939
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,360
-I guess we have a special bond.
-Doctor.

940
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,980
-I came here because I missed you.
-It's been a long time.

941
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:47,360
Wait. Have we met before?

942
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,070
Good luck with the training.

943
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,360
You deny it,
but you like him a bit, right?

944
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,650
It was good to see you.
I'll see you around.

945
