1
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,740
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,900
If you go this way, you'll see the pool.

3
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,420
Thank you.

4
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,980
Joon-hyung.

5
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,860
Bok-ju.

6
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,900
Joon-hyung.

7
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,900
Do you recognise me?

8
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,090
It's me. Your mum.

9
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,780
Are you really my Joon-hyung?

10
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,860
My goodness.

11
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,540
I always wanted to know...

12
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,860
...how you'd turn out after growing up.

13
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,060
You grew up to be
much better than I thought.

14
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,340
I wonder if...

15
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,660
...Joon-hyung met his mum by now.

16
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,380
I'm sure she has. She went to
his university today after all.

17
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,500
I hope she doesn't mention the postcards.

18
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,900
I begged her not to.

19
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,540
Joon-hyung's mum isn't stupid.

20
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,300
Why would she mention that?
It'd only hurt Joon-hyung.

21
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,940
I wonder if she'll recognise him.

22
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,820
I didn't know the area and got lost,

23
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,460
so I asked someone for help.

24
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,740
What amazing coincidence that
she turned out to be your friend.

25
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,540
Are you very close to her?

26
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,860
Yes.

27
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,540
Have you eaten?

28
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,380
-If you're hungry, let's get...
-No.

29
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,140
I'm not hungry.

30
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,980
Okay.

31
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,940
How's swimming?

32
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,540
Is it difficult?

33
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,100
Is it okay?

34
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,540
Yes, I guess.

35
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,540
By the way,

36
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,620
I have this.

37
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,460
I got this for you.

38
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,900
I wasn't sure what you'd need.

39
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,140
It's a pair of sneakers.
I thought you could use a pair.

40
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,740
I guessed your size. I hope they fit.

41
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,820
Thank you.

42
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,100
I'll make good use of them.

43
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,860
While buying the present,

44
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,580
I thought about you very much.

45
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
I wondered how much taller you got.

46
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,380
I wondered how your face changed.

47
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,660
I'm sorry, Joon-hyung.

48
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,100
I should have come earlier to see you.

49
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,060
I had been very busy.

50
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Okay.

51
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,900
Hello, Mum.

52
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,300
EPISODE 15,
That's How You Become an Adult

53
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,260
I didn't have much time to prepare.
I hope you like the food.

54
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,140
It's very delicious.

55
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,420
Your cooking is amazing as always.

56
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,340
It's not so true these days.

57
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,660
Her food is getting saltier
as she gets older.

58
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,860
Dad, you might regret saying that later.

59
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,460
The fish is very plump.

60
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,860
-You made a great choice.
-Whatever.

61
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,340
-Goodness.
-Here you go.

62
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,780
Thank you.

63
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,060
Mum. Water, please.

64
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,460
-Okay.
-Okay.

65
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,660
Pardon me.

66
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,020
Here, give it to him.

67
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,660
Okay.

68
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,380
Here, Joon-hyung.

69
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,140
Are you okay?

70
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,140
Yes, thank you.

71
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,060
I can catch the taxi by myself.

72
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,220
-Please get in. It's cold.
-Okay.

73
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,060
Joon-hyung.

74
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,340
Do you want to come see me tomorrow?

75
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,500
Before I leave,

76
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,540
I want to make you a meal.

77
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,180
-If you aren't free...
-I'll come.

78
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,940
After the training.

79
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,380
-Could you give me your number?
-Okay.

80
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,060
See you tomorrow, my son.

81
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,020
-Get home safely.
-Bye.

82
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,140
Hello.

83
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,620
You look happy. How was it with your mum?

84
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,860
There's not much to say.

85
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,700
Yes, there is.
You look much happier than before.

86
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,700
Is it obvious?

87
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,540
Yes, it's very obvious.

88
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,380
What did you do with your mum?

89
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,540
We went home and had dinner.

90
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,500
Then I walked her to get a taxi home.

91
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,060
That's it?

92
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,500
I'll go see her again tomorrow.

93
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,820
What else?

94
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,140
I held my mum's hand.

95
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,860
It was very warm.

96
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm getting jealous,
but I'll let it go this time...

97
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,900
since she's your mum.

98
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,620
Your mum must have
missed you very much...

99
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,140
that she came all the way here
from Canada.

100
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,140
Of course.

101
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,380
Why wouldn't she want to see
a handsome son like me?

102
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,780
You seem very confident
after seeing your mum.

103
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,980
I shouldn't be jealous.

104
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,180
I'd love to have a mum who
came to visit me in college, too.

105
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,940
You have a dad who supports you
wholeheartedly.

106
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,420
You also have a great uncle,
and more importantly,

107
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,020
you have the great me.

108
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,620
That's right.

109
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,260
I forgot about that.

110
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Is it Spring Residence room number 1803?

111
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,300
I'm leaving now.
It'll take about 30 minutes.

112
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,540
Okay, see you soon.

113
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,300
By the way,

114
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,900
can you bring a photo album
if you have one?

115
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,500
I want to see your photos
of when you were young.

116
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,340
I'll bring some from home.

117
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,940
Okay. I'll see you later.

118
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,140
Gosh, it's too small.

119
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,260
I'll just have to squeeze
my feet into them.

120
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,740
I sent 10,000 dollars
to Mum's bank account.

121
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,540
All right.

122
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,460
If I put that together
with the money I have,

123
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,460
that will be 20,000 dollars.

124
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,780
Thank you. I'm sure you need
money for other things, too.

125
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,060
It's fine. It's not like I need
the money right now.

126
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,740
By the way,
is her child's condition serious?

127
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,860
Can she get her child a surgery
if she goes back with the money?

128
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,460
I'm not sure.

129
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,660
She has to get enough money
for the surgery first.

130
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,620
I feel bad that...

131
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,300
...her young child got a rare disease.

132
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,380
I guess she thought her brother
could give her the money,

133
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,420
but selling land takes time.

134
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,380
She wouldn't have asked us for money
if she had a choice.

135
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,340
What money?

136
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,780
Joon-hyung.

137
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,540
When did you get here?
We didn't hear you come in.

138
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,540
What money?

139
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,780
What are you talking about?

140
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,780
Joon-hyung, let's sit down and...

141
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,500
Is my mum here for money?

142
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,340
Did she need money?

143
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,420
Is that why she suddenly...

144
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,820
But why is she...

145
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,940
asking you for the money?

146
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,780
She should be grateful that
you've fed me and raised me so far.

147
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,300
How...

148
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,140
How could she ask you two
for such a favour?

149
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,660
Joon-hyung, it's not like that.
She had a reason for it.

150
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,700
Even if she did, this is not right.

151
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,300
It's so brazen of her.

152
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,740
She never contacted us
in the last 10 years.

153
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
How...

154
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,900
How could she do this?

155
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,140
I knew it all along.

156
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,940
The postcards and presents
I got every year.

157
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,500
I know it was you who sent them.

158
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,540
You should've been honest with me.

159
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,620
I was miserable thinking
how long I should keep pretending,

160
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,020
and when I could end this show.

161
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,340
I felt so bad because
you were trying so hard.

162
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,900
Why would you give her that money?
Do you feel sorry for me?

163
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,460
Or...

164
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,700
did you think you'd do
just one more charity work...

165
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,860
since you've been merciful all along?

166
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,140
Did you want to look like a good person?

167
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,780
Is that it?

168
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,340
You're right.

169
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,020
I did it because
I wanted to go to heaven.

170
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,780
That's why I raised you.
Are you happy now?

171
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,260
You ungrateful brat.

172
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,540
How could you say such harsh things?

173
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,540
I can't... I can't believe you.

174
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Joon-hyung!

175
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,260
Bok-ju, you're slacking off.

176
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,500
How long are you going to sit there
and wrap the bandage?

177
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,980
Are you a mummy?

178
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,180
-No, Sir. I will start right away.
-You brat.

179
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,460
You got all lazy after
winning a tournament.

180
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,700
If you're going to keep doing this,
just quit and go to Taereung!

181
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
Pardon?

182
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,540
They want you in
Taereung National Training Centre.

183
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,620
Go to Taereung, you brat.

184
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,900
The association made a decision today.

185
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,140
You should join them within this weekend.

186
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,820
What?

187
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,300
-Hey!
-Congratulations!

188
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,300
The Daily Sports will come
to interview you tomorrow.

189
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,460
They want to hear about how
our team came to the front...

190
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,700
in the last tournament.

191
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,660
Thank you so much. Thank you, Bok-ju.

192
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,820
You did it, you brat.

193
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
-What's happening?
-Congratulations.

194
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,980
-Congratulations.
-Way to go, Bok-ju.

195
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,220
-You did it.
-Well done.

196
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,740
-Go, Bok-ju!
-Let's go!

197
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,900
You have delivery.

198
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,900
You can put it over there.

199
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,020
Three radishes, three spring onions
and one scallion, correct?

200
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,740
I thought Mr Kim usually delivers them.

201
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,220
Oh, he went to have a vasectomy.
He doesn't want to have a fourth kid.

202
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,380
But he loves his wife so much.

203
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,940
By the way, I'm thirsty.
Can I have a bottle of soda?

204
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,460
Sure.

205
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,500
Here.

206
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,020
That felt good.

207
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,620
Thank you.

208
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,260
Wake up. I still haven't
come to my senses.

209
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,460
Women are wicked.

210
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,500
Isn't it amazing that
you're going to Taereung, Bok-ju?

211
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,460
-Your dream is finally coming true.
-What did your dad say?

212
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,260
-He must be so happy.
-He is.

213
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,380
Dad's dream was to be a national athlete.

214
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,460
He must think his hard work at the
restaurant is finally paying off.

215
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,540
You're doing a great thing for your dad.

216
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
This would be the greatest news
to your dad.

217
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,660
I'm not sure. I can't really feel it yet.

218
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,300
Am I really a national athlete now?
Am I really going to Taereung?

219
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,260
It doesn't feel real that
you're going to be apart from us.

220
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,420
As sad as we are,
how would Joon-hyung feel?

221
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,900
You two just started dating.

222
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,780
-And now you already have to be apart.
-Exactly.

223
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,620
It's certainly a good thing,
but Joon-hyung might feel bad.

224
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,900
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached at the moment.

225
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,420
You'll be directed to voice mail.
Please leave a message...

226
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,660
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached at the moment.

227
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,140
You'll be directed to voice mail.
Please leave a message after the beep.

228
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,100
What is it?
Joon-hyung's not answering his phone?

229
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,260
It's not that.

230
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,660
Actually, yes.
He doesn't normally turn off his phone.

231
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,100
That's the mire of dating.

232
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,340
You get worried if he doesn't call you...

233
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,900
and you think he's changed if he sounds
just a little different on the phone.

234
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,540
Gosh, dating is too hard for me.

235
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,220
Enjoy it while we're still young.

236
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,140
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached at the moment.

237
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,820
He's not answering. His phone is off.

238
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,180
It's our fault.

239
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,460
We should've been honest with Joon-hyung.

240
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,660
That poor little thing.

241
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,060
He was pretending not to know
about the show we were putting on.

242
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,140
It must have broken his heart.

243
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,300
We all meant well.
Don't blame yourself, Honey.

244
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,140
Joon-hyung is going to be okay, right?

245
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,260
Of course he is. He's not a little child.

246
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,380
-Hello?
-It's me.

247
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,660
Yes. Hi.

248
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,260
I was wondering if something
happened to Joon-hyung.

249
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,780
He said he was coming, but he never came.

250
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,860
His phone is also turned off.

251
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,740
(Girls' Dormitory

252
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,980
My face is swollen, right?
I will look ugly in the picture.

253
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,260
Hey, why are you making a fuss?
They're interviewing Bok-ju.

254
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
They'll take a picture
of all of us together.

255
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,700
I'm doing this to revive weightlifting.

256
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,060
Listen. Kim Yu-Na of figure skating
and Son Yeon-jae of gymnastics.

257
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,300
There should be a star weightlifter,
who will make weightlifting popular.

258
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,300
Besides, you're one to talk.

259
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,580
-What are you wearing?
-Bok-ju.

260
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,420
-Hello.
-Hey, Tae-kwon.

261
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
I was thinking of calling you anyway.

262
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,740
-Were you with Joon-hyung last night?
-What?

263
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,460
What are you...

264
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,940
Didn't Joon-hyung come back
to the dormitory last night?

265
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,460
His phone was turned off,
so I assumed he'd be with you.

266
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,860
Where did he go? I'm getting worried.

267
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,780
When did you last talk to him?

268
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,380
Yesterday afternoon.

269
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,100
Does this mean Joon-hyung
went missing yesterday?

270
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,060
Gosh, what's going on?

271
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,380
So after he left home like that...

272
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,140
I still can't reach him.

273
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,940
I thought he would've
gone back to campus.

274
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,220
He must've been shocked.

275
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,060
His mother came back after 10 years...

276
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,100
because of money rather than for him.

277
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,540
Even so, it's immature of him
to just disappear like this.

278
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,340
He's a soft-hearted guy.

279
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,740
He matured too early and has gotten
used to putting up a tough front.

280
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,540
I know.

281
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,460
My mum couldn't sleep at all last night.

282
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
She's never hit Joon-hyung
before until then.

283
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,820
I'll keep trying to track him down, too.

284
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,780
If you hear from him,
let me know immediately.

285
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,740
Please.

286
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,700
Leader of Athletic Education,
Haneol Sport University

287
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,620
-It must be them.
-It must be them.

288
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,740
Goodness, stop putting on a show.

289
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,220
Why are you guys overreacting?

290
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,060
Didn't you hear
what Head Coach Yoon said?

291
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,940
The interview is nothing special.

292
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,820
-Just be natural. Do what you...
-They're here.

293
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,540
My sweatsuit isn't dry yet.

294
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,540
What?

295
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,700
Let's go inside.

296
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,140
-Okay.
-Look at what he's wearing.

297
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,020
-What's up with him?
-Why is he wearing a suit?

298
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,020
-Head Coach.
-Let's practise.

299
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,020
Really? Let's do something else.

300
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,020
Hey, can't you just tell us
what's going on?

301
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,660
Could it be that
Joon-hyung's family went bankrupt?

302
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,620
Hey, his family owns a pharmacy.
How could a pharmacy go bankrupt?

303
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,420
I don't know what's going on, but
don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing.

304
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,260
That's right. He's probably
just drinking somewhere.

305
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,740
What if he's dangling off a bridge...

306
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,660
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached at the moment.

307
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,900
Please leave a message after the beep.

308
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,340
Joon-hyung, I heard about what happened.

309
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,580
I'm sure you must be very upset
right now.

310
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,940
But I'm worried about you.
Please call me back.

311
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,260
No, you don't have to call me.
Just text me.

312
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,660
Okay?

313
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,300
All right, Joon-hyung?

314
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,420
Darn it!

315
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,300
Woon-gi, straighten your back.
More! That's good.

316
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,980
Hey, your legs!

317
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,060
They're shaking. Watch me! Like this.

318
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,140
Like this! Is that all you can do?

319
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,060
Hey, Ye-bin.

320
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,140
Be careful. You might dislocate
your shoulders that way.

321
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,980
Watch your shoulders.

322
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Good.

323
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,620
Hey, focus on your lower body!

324
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,380
-Ye-bin.
-Mum, I'm on television.

325
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,460
Ms Kim Bok-ju, congratulations on being
selected for the national team.

326
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,540
I actually heard you went through
a slump after winning the match.

327
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,980
May I ask you how you managed
to overcome it?

328
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,660
I took some time off from training
and did a lot of thinking.

329
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
I also got help
from the people around me.

330
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,460
Who are some of the people
who'd helped you?

331
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,020
My family members, of course.

332
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,820
My professor, my coach,

333
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,420
my best friends,
Lee Seon-ok and Jeong Nan-hee,

334
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,900
and...

335
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,220
Bok-ju.

336
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,620
The ace of HSU's weightlifting team.

337
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,660
You won't make any mistakes.

338
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,620
You've been training so hard,
and you're such a strong person.

339
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
And...

340
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,940
I'm really sorry, but I think
we should end the interview here.

341
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,300
Something very urgent has come up for me.

342
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,140
I'm sorry. I sincerely apologise.

343
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,540
-Bok-ju.
-What's going on?

344
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,300
-Bok-ju.
-Bok-ju.

345
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,220
Bok-ju.

346
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,620
Please leave a message after the beep.

347
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,380
Jeong Joon-hyung,
where on earth are you right now?

348
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,820
Your brother and everyone else
are so worried about you.

349
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,460
I'm really worried, too.

350
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,340
Call me as soon as you get this message.

351
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,380
I'm starting to get really mad at you.

352
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,700
Call me back, okay?

353
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,100
Where did this guy go?

354
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,260
Jeong Joon-hyung, you fool.

355
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,620
Where are you?

356
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,980
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached at the moment.

357
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,260
Gosh...

358
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,020
Hey, where are you?
Why aren't you picking up?

359
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,940
I had no idea
that you were this self-centred.

360
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,220
Let's just break up if this is how
you're going to be. You're a jerk.

361
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,060
What if he got
into an accident or something?

362
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,780
Where are you?

363
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,500
Well...

364
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,340
Ma'am.

365
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,180
How much will my total be if I
take out these two? I forgot my wallet.

366
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,460
I'll pay the rest. Just add this in.

367
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,780
You work at Bok Chicken, right?

368
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,340
We're even now.

369
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,860
I see you can drink quite a bit.

370
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,180
You must like soju.

371
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,140
Yes. Beer tastes like nothing to me.

372
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,220
You must love chips.

373
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,380
You're like a kid, so cute.

374
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,100
I think I'm a little too old
to be called cute.

375
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,660
But you are cute.

376
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,140
You have a cute face.

377
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,460
You're my type.

378
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,820
By the way, is Bok Chicken yours?

379
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,180
Are you the owner?

380
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,540
No, my brother owns it.

381
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,940
I'm actually an actor, though
I've only played minor roles.

382
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,140
Seriously?
Which films or dramas were you in?

383
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,380
Oh, you know.
I played one of the crewmen...

384
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,780
in the film that came out recently,
"Train to Bucheon".

385
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,940
I also played Sawing Man No. 3
in "Inside Men".

386
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,540
Right, that sawing scene.

387
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,460
Yes, you do look familiar.

388
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,020
You were that man with the saw.
That scene was so scary.

389
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,980
That wasn't even
one of my best performances.

390
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,380
Thanks for remembering it.

391
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,620
If you don't mind,
can you reenact the scene for me?

392
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,980
I was so impressed by it.

393
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,660
How can I reenact the scene here...

394
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
I'll cut here and here.

395
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,900
My gosh! You're awesome.
You look just like him!

396
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,820
Of course I look like him.
I played that role after all.

397
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,340
All right, bottoms up.

398
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,420
Gosh, you're a celebrity.

399
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,900
Let's have just one more drink
at my place.

400
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,740
-Okay?
-Look, I can't. We shouldn't.

401
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,460
We're going way too fast.

402
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,900
I won't lay a finger on you.
We're just going to drink, okay?

403
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,540
-Wait, my ear.
-What?

404
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,460
-Gosh, hold on. My ear is...
-What's wrong?

405
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,540
-Let's go! Here we go!
-You're so manly.

406
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,580
No, Dr Jeong. Not yet.

407
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,620
I searched all the places he might
go to, but I couldn't find him.

408
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,660
Okay. I'll call you if I find him.

409
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Bye.

410
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,380
Indoor Swimming Pool

411
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,460
Hey, Joon-hyung!

412
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,540
What are you doing there? Come out now.

413
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,300
Are you dead, you jerk?

414
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,340
Tell me if you're dead, you punk!

415
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,620
Come out now.

416
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,940
I'm going to get you.

417
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,100
Do you know how worried I was?

418
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,340
I went to Han River in case
you jumped off the bridge.

419
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,620
Why did you turn off your phone?

420
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,140
You need a good beating
to come back to your senses.

421
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,220
What are you doing, Joon-hyung?

422
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,020
Joon-hyung.

423
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
Gosh.

424
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Are you okay?

425
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,900
Bok-ju.

426
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
My mother didn't come to see me.

427
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,460
She came here for money.

428
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,700
To borrow money.

429
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,740
My assumption was completely wrong.

430
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,700
Even though I missed Mother to death,

431
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,900
I persevered through it.

432
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,300
I thought it was the same for her.

433
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,500
Only I was happy to see her.

434
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,100
It's so embarrassing.

435
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,020
I'm embarrassed...

436
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,220
for myself.

437
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,700
I feel embarrassed
in front of Uncle and Aunt.

438
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,540
Compared to when Mother abandoned me,

439
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,940
I'm much sadder now.

440
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,500
Voice messages

441
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,740
This is your voice message box.

442
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,820
Hey, where are you?
Why aren't you picking up?

443
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,660
I had no idea
that you were this self-centred.

444
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,900
Let's just break up if this is how
you're going to be. You're a jerk.

445
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,020
It's baggy and smells like old rags.
Don't you have a smaller one?

446
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,500
It's the smallest one I have.

447
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,940
Just think of it
as a hip-hop style outfit.

448
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,820
Your hair is still wet.

449
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,700
There you go.

450
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,780
-You're so cute, my baby.
-Hey.

451
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,220
I'm not your baby.
Did you give birth to me?

452
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,940
Yes, I'm your real mother,
you immature boy.

453
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,860
Do you know how worried I was?

454
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,620
What you did was terrible.

455
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,900
I know.

456
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,940
I heard your voice messages.

457
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,540
Will you break up with me?

458
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,740
-Are you breaking up with me?
-It's a warning.

459
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,820
If you cut off contact one more time,

460
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,700
I won't forgive you then.

461
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,180
You like me very much, don't you?

462
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,220
How can you say that
in a moment like this?

463
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,220
-That hurts.
-You need more beating.

464
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
This is on behalf of your aunt and uncle.

465
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,700
These are from your mum and Dr Jeong,
and these are from me.

466
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,020
You have really strong hands.
It really hurts.

467
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,420
Let's get out.
I'm worried the security will find us.

468
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,420
No.

469
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,540
I can't go.

470
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,540
Why not?

471
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,220
-I don't have any shoes.
-What?

472
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,460
I threw them away.

473
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,140
My goodness.

474
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,620
Why would you throw away your shoes?

475
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,020
You're walking barefoot in
the middle of winter. You're so dumb.

476
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,420
It was because I was so mad.

477
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,140
It's impossible to carry you
to the dormitory.

478
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,300
It's okay, I'll walk back.
I walked here barefoot, too.

479
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,020
No, you might get a frostbite
in this weather.

480
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,060
Wait for me on that bench.

481
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,340
Where are you going?

482
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,860
Here you go.

483
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,700
I took them from the senior lockers
in the weightlifting room.

484
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,140
Give them back tomorrow.

485
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Thank you.

486
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,860
Gosh, I even steal shoes for you.

487
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,340
Are you cold?

488
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,260
You're being so considerate.

489
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,100
At least you have a mum to blame.

490
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,420
I don't even have a mum.

491
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,380
The privileged always complain more.

492
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,300
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

493
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,660
You shouldn't apologise to me.

494
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,140
You might feel hurt by this,

495
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,220
but I can understand your mum a little.

496
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,700
Every child is dear to their parents.

497
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,100
You're dear to her,

498
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,140
but her other child is sick.

499
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,140
She must help her sick child first.

500
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,980
It doesn't mean that
she doesn't love you.

501
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,740
And as difficult it is for your mum,

502
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,540
can you imagine how much more
difficult it is for your aunt?

503
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,500
Go and comfort her now.
She couldn't sleep a wink last night.

504
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,620
How did you know that?

505
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,140
-Did you meet Jae-yi?
-What else could I do?

506
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,660
You didn't pick up my calls at all.

507
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,820
My only contact was Dr Jeong.

508
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,220
You're making me angry again.

509
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,060
Go home and make your aunt feel better.

510
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,980
Okay.

511
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,220
-I'll go back tomorrow.
-No way. Go home right now.

512
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,020
Are you feeling embarrassed
after what you've done?

513
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,140
It gets worse tomorrow. Go home now.

514
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,820
We'll just stay one more minute.

515
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,660
Couple Pharmacy

516
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,740
Enough already. You didn't have to
walk me all the way here.

517
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,100
It's because I'm worried that
you'd go somewhere else.

518
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,580
Your walking me home
doesn't make me look good.

519
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,260
Gosh, what's the big deal?

520
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,220
Women can walk men home, too.

521
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,500
-Okay, Ma'am.
-Go in. It's cold.

522
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,340
Ask for their forgiveness
and tell them you won't do it again.

523
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,460
Give these to make them feel better.

524
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,420
I'm afraid. They might be
very disappointed in me now.

525
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,860
Mums don't get disappointed
in their sons.

526
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,140
Just give her a tight hug. Go in now.

527
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,900
Thank you.

528
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,860
Gosh, it's so cold.

529
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,540
Shouldn't you install a heater
at the pharmacy?

530
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,540
Where's Dad?

531
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,020
He went home first.

532
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,900
What's that?

533
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,020
This? Roasted chestnuts.

534
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,420
There was a vendor selling them
on my way here. You like chestnuts.

535
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,620
Gosh, you didn't have to.
It's too late to eat anything.

536
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,660
You probably just don't want
soot on your hands.

537
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,860
My goodness, this mother of mine
can be so fussy at times.

538
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,900
There's no other choice.

539
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,540
Your son shall peel them for you, then.

540
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,420
What now?

541
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,060
Eat them before they get cold
or they won't taste as good.

542
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,820
Your hands are cold.

543
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,980
I'll make you a cup of citron tea.

544
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,260
I'm sorry, Mum.

545
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,540
Please forgive me.

546
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,140
I'll never do that again.

547
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,740
You should've been strict with me.

548
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,340
You spoiled me
by coddling me all the time.

549
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,660
What was that? You brat.

550
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,060
-I'm speechless by your impertinence.
-Mum.

551
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,820
I'm really sorry.

552
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,660
You don't know...

553
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,460
how grateful I am to have you, Dad
and Jae-yi in my life,

554
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,460
and how much...

555
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,980
I love you guys.

556
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,460
I love you so much more...

557
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,260
than you think...

558
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,780
because my family...

559
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,460
means so much to me.

560
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,340
Your smell.

561
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,940
I was too upset to even wash my hair.

562
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,380
I knew it!

563
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,300
Does it smell bad?

564
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,820
-Yes, it stinks.
-Don't tease me, silly boy.

565
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,300
-Come here.
-Why?

566
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,500
My gosh, you're so sweet.

567
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,620
Couple Pharmacy

568
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,940
Mother.

569
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,940
Joon-hyung.

570
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,700
The traffic was worse than I expected.

571
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,420
I didn't think I'd be
able to see you before I go.

572
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,860
Thank you so much for coming.

573
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,580
-Listen, Joon-hyung.
-Thank you for giving birth to me.

574
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,500
I came to tell you that.

575
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,540
And...

576
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,340
Take this.

577
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,100
It's yours, so I'll give it back to you.

578
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,660
I don't think I'll need it anymore.

579
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,660
By the way, do you happen
to have a photo of my sister?

580
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,220
I want to see how she looks.

581
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,380
Yes, sure. Wait.

582
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,540
Her name is Emily.

583
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,780
She's pretty. She takes after you.

584
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,100
She'll recover soon. You should
bring her next time you visit.

585
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,380
All right.

586
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,260
She'll be so happy
to meet her handsome brother.

587
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,860
Remember you met her on campus?

588
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,460
She's my girlfriend.

589
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,460
Oh, this girl.

590
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,540
I see.

591
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,020
She's very pretty.

592
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,820
Did you say goodbye to your mum?

593
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,380
Yes.

594
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,380
Good.

595
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,460
I'm happy you listened to me.

596
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,460
I'm yours, so I have to listen to you.

597
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,500
Dr Go Joo-hwan's Clinic

598
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,420
Doctor Go Ah-young

599
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,220
You're still very clumsy.

600
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,380
I don't think that's enough
to smash this desk, though.

601
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,940
What brings you here?
When did you get here?

602
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,020
I was in the area,

603
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,140
so I thought I should just stop by.

604
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,220
Is it too lame excuse?

605
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,540
I'm here to see you.

606
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,020
I closed my clinic early today.

607
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,780
What's with you?
You've never done this before.

608
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,460
The nurse said you only work
in the morning on Saturdays.

609
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,660
I must be your last patient.

610
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,260
Let's go grab some food.

611
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,620
I'm hungry.

612
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,780
You came all the way here for food?

613
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,140
Well...

614
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,540
Except for you,
I don't even have friends to eat with.

615
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,340
Let's go eat something.

616
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,980
-Gosh, he's so handsome.
-He really is.

617
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,740
-My goodness.
-He's so good-looking.

618
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,620
-He's so handsome.
-That must be his girlfriend.

619
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,500
-Whatever. He's seriously so cute.
-I'm really jealous.

620
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,060
He's the most handsome guy
I've ever seen.

621
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,740
-Look at him.
-He's so cute.

622
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,940
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

623
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,980
You have to cover your face as much
as possible from now on, okay?

624
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,220
Nothing can really mask my good looks.

625
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,020
Why do you have to be this handsome?

626
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,780
How about you shave your head?

627
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,540
I'll do it if you want me to.

628
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:25,060
I'm too nervous to go away in case
some other girls snatch you.

629
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,420
Joon-hyung,

630
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,780
I haven't told you
because I didn't want to upset you.

631
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,900
I got selected for the national team.
I have to move to Taereung next week.

632
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,420
Whatever. Don't lie.

633
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,740
The world championships will
take place in China in February.

634
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,260
What's this?

635
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,980
Are you serious?

636
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,420
Seriously?

637
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,660
Really? My gosh...

638
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,460
Hey, congratulations. How did you
manage to lift those heavy weights?

639
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,900
I'm more amazed
that you can float in water.

640
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,700
You're not sad about it?

641
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,300
We just started going out, and now
we have to be a long-distance couple.

642
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,620
I won't be able to visit you often.

643
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,340
It's okay. I'll follow you there soon.

644
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
What?

645
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,140
I have a match next week.

646
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,740
They'll pick members
for the national team, too.

647
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,460
If I win first place,
I'll go straight to Taereung.

648
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,620
We also have a world championship
tournament coming up.

649
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,660
Seriously? Can you really join
the national team if you win it?

650
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,700
Yes.

651
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,780
If I get second place,
they'll look at my previous scores.

652
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,620
But if I win the first place, I can
join the national team immediately.

653
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,460
I was going to take it easy this time,

654
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,220
but I feel my competitive juices
starting to flow all of a sudden.

655
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,340
Are you confident that you can win?

656
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,540
Of course.

657
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,260
I could beat anyone in the world
if my trauma didn't get in the way.

658
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,660
Joon-hyung, I really want
to go to Taereung with you.

659
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,540
-Let's go together.
-Don't you worry.

660
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,780
I'm going to beat everyone at the match.

661
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,540
I'll follow you there shortly, okay?

662
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,020
I really want us to go
to Taereung together. Please.

663
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,580
Go!

664
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,780
Hey, I don't need
extra training right away.

665
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,940
You missed two full days of training.

666
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,740
You have to win the first place, okay?

667
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,580
Come on. Start with running. Hurry up.

668
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,740
Let's eat something first.

669
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,100
You wish. Just run first.

670
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,900
I'll run if you give me a kiss.

671
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,340
Don't let me catch you!

672
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,420
Hey!

673
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,940
That's it. Keep going.

674
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,060
Hey, Joon-hyung. Watch your head!

675
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,140
One, two. The pace is great!

676
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,900
Keep going, guys.

677
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,100
One, two. Great.

678
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,340
Joon-hyung, you seem to be
in a great shape. Good job.

679
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,380
Hey, did you really make this?

680
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,180
It's so good.

681
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,660
I'm happy to see you enjoying it.

682
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,460
Hey, go run now if you're done. Hurry up.

683
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,020
I just ate. Running immediately
after eating causes stomach pain.

684
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,580
-I can't. I can't run now.
-Come on!

685
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,340
Whatever. I won't run.

686
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,020
Hurry and run now. You're totally fine.

687
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,540
Let's go. Come on.
Start running, will you?

688
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,060
I'll run if you kiss me.

689
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,460
Gosh, you think it's fun, don't you?
I'll kiss you if you finish running.

690
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,940
Go and run first.

691
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,660
Hurry up and run.

692
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,740
I love you, too.

693
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,020
Stop looking back.

694
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,900
-In one, two, three.
-In one, two, three.

695
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,060
I wish my dear Joon-hyung will...

696
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,860
overcome his false start trauma,
win the tournament...

697
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,860
and go to Taereung National
Training Centre with me.

698
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,540
Me, too. I wish for the same thing.

699
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,860
You have to make it come true.

700
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,940
Joon-hyung's match, Go to Taereung

701
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,820
Selection Match for
the National Swimming Team

702
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,820
It's now the Men's 200m final.

703
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,460
The contestants are entering the pool.

704
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:16,540
Choi Tae-hoon in fifth lane did
his individual training in Australia...

705
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,500
and came back to Korea for this contest.

706
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,820
I wonder if his training
will bear a great result.

707
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,900
I see the guy who made a false start
at the last Presidential Cup.

708
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,620
-You mean Jeong Joon-hyung.
-Yes.

709
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,780
If he can do a good start,

710
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,700
-he will achieve a good result.
-He's always sadly defeated...

711
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,380
because of the start.

712
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,700
Will he be able to overcome his trauma
in this final game?

713
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,500
This will be very interesting.

714
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,460
All right. Choi Tae-hoon was
the quickest to start the race.

715
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,260
Jeong Joon-hyung made a good start, too.

716
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,940
Joon-hyung is picking up speed.

717
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,620
-He's catching up.
-That's right.

718
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,140
Joon-hyung is going at a great speed.

719
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,740
He's only a span away from Tae-hoon.

720
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,420
-He almost caught up to him.
-He's coming up fast.

721
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,060
Now...

722
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,780
It looks like they finished
at almost the same time.

723
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,660
That's right.
They finished at the same time.

724
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,300
All right. That means...

725
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,140
Choi Tae-hoon wins the first place...

726
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,820
and Jeong Joon-hyung won
second place by a nose.

727
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,220
Yes. Joon-hyung was amazing.

728
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,500
Hello, Kim Chang-geol speaking.

729
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,460
Pardon? A donor?

730
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,500
I see. I can't go in today,

731
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,300
but I can go to the hospital tomorrow.

732
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,820
All right. Okay. I'll go to
the hospital tomorrow afternoon.

733
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,020
Okay. Thank you.

734
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,500
What is it? Do they want
you to have the surgery?

735
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,020
Did they find a donor?

736
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,860
Yes. I'm second one on the list,
but they said...

737
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,460
there's still a chance.

738
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,220
They set up additional tests for me
and asked me to come in today.

739
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,700
Why did you say you'll go tomorrow?

740
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,620
You should go when they ask you to.

741
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,140
You brat. I should go after
Bok-ju goes to Taereung.

742
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,380
If I say I have to go to the hospital,
she'll be worried.

743
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,540
You can't hide this from her.

744
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,460
Even if I get the surgery, I won't
tell her until they set the date.

745
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,660
Maybe I'll tell her after
setting the date.

746
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,060
I still think you should tell her.

747
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,140
What if she gets mad at me later
because of this?

748
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,500
You did great.
You were the best, Joon-hyung.

749
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,620
I could have won
if my arms were a little bit longer.

750
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,420
I wanted to win and
go to Taereung with you.

751
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,540
Don't say that.
You couldn't have done it better.

752
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,420
You've completely overcome your trauma,
so you'll win first place next time.

753
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,340
You're only going to get better now.

754
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,020
You'll be leaving...

755
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,540
in 13 hours 26 minutes...

756
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,420
and 15 seconds. 14 seconds.

757
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,780
Bok-ju, I'm not sure I'll be okay
when you're not around.

758
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,860
I'm the one who's more worried.

759
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,380
You made me addicted to you
without my realising it.

760
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,460
But of course.
I have deadly charms after all.

761
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,140
You shouldn't run away
from there because you miss me,

762
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,140
so I will follow you in there soon.

763
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,740
If you break up with me and start
seeing someone else, I'll kill you.

764
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,140
That's what I want to say.

765
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,060
I already asked Seon-ok
and Nan-hee to keep an eye on you.

766
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,540
Those girls.

767
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,540
They ruined everything.

768
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,940
What time are you leaving tomorrow?
Let me see you off.

769
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,460
No. I'll go by myself.

770
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,660
You said you'll join me soon.

771
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,340
You don't have time to see me off.
You should train hard.

772
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,140
Gosh, you already sound so proud
of becoming a national athlete.

773
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,660
Now I have to go to Taereung.

774
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,980
Please do. No one is stopping you.

775
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,620
When you're free,
please visit my dad's restaurant.

776
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,900
I know Uncle will take care of him,
but I'm still worried.

777
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,140
Okay. You can trust me.

778
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,220
We only have 13 hours 22 minutes...

779
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,820
-and 12 seconds. 11 seconds...
-Hello, Nan-hee?

780
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,060
Your uniform?
Why do you want me to bring it?

781
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,140
Well, yes, I am outside. Fine.

782
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,340
I'll drop by the gym.
I'll see you later. Okay.

783
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,540
-Do your friends need something?
-Yes.

784
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,740
-I need to drop by the gym.
-Okay. Let's go.

785
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,900
What? Why is it so dark?
Why are all the lights turned off?

786
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,940
Hey. This is a chance.

787
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,300
For what?

788
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,780
Hey, don't. What if someone walks in?

789
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,500
No one would walk in.
There's nobody here.

790
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,820
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

791
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,100
-Here, Bok-ju. Let me pour you one.
-Yes, Head Coach.

792
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,740
I told the coach at Taereung...

793
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,140
to take good care of my special pupil.

794
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,540
You should take care
not to hurt your back.

795
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,220
-You have to take care of yourself.
-Yes, Coach. Head Coach.

796
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,380
Thank you.

797
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,540
I couldn't have done it
without your help.

798
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,580
Gosh, what's wrong? It's not like
we'll never see her again.

799
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,980
It's true that we won't be
seeing her for a while.

800
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,540
She won't be here for the jog, lunch,

801
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,460
and training for snatch
and clean and jerk.

802
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,540
Who's going to be my partner now, Bok-ju?

803
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,060
You have Seon-ok. You're just
trying to stop me from leaving.

804
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,740
By the way, you've been standing still
over there for a while now.

805
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:32,860
What's your name?

806
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,380
I'm Jeong Joon-hyung,
a sophomore in the swimming team.

807
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,540
Even his voice sounds amazing.

808
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,220
You're so handsome.

809
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,860
Good for you, Bok-ju.

810
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,860
Bok-ju is lucky to have
a boyfriend like that.

811
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:47,100
He reminds me of myself
when I was 20 years old.

812
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,540
-What?
-I used to look like that.

813
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,300
I doubt that, Head Coach.

814
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,020
-You're a big liar.
-It's not a lie.

815
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,140
Even my nickname was...

816
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:58,700
All right. Bok-ju, I hope your
training goes well at Taereung,

817
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,700
and you will raise the prestige
of Korean weightlifting in China.

818
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,540
All right, guys. Cheers!

819
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,820
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

820
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,380
-Thank you. I'll work hard.
-Congratulations.

821
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,100
-Cheers, Bok-ju.
-It's delicious.

822
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,420
-Can we eat now?
-Go ahead.

823
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,620
Here. It's bellflower roots.

824
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,060
It boosts your immune system.
Eat it when you have a cold.

825
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,540
This is ginseng extract.

826
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,660
Don't forget to drink
one pack every day. Okay?

827
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,260
Take care of yourself.

828
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,660
Dad.

829
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,340
Bok-ju, shall I drive you there
on my scooter?

830
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,060
No, I'll just take the bus by myself.

831
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,020
All right, then.

832
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,740
Uncle, please take good care of Dad.

833
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,020
I'll count on you.

834
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,980
I'll look after him.
Don't worry about it...

835
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,260
and just take care of yourself.

836
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,260
Eat well and train hard.

837
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:18,740
Kim Bok-ju of Haneol Sport University
reporting for departure to Taereung.

838
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,060
-Salute!
-Salute!

839
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,980
-Take care.
-Okay.

840
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,860
Don't come out, Dad. Bye.

841
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,660
Chang-geol.

842
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,980
Bok-ju's gone now.
Let's go to the hospital.

843
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,660
Joon-hyung, I'm going now.

844
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,860
I didn't show it to you,

845
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,260
but I'm so scared and nervous right now.

846
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,660
Will I be able to do a good job?

847
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,260
If I open the strange door
and walk through it,

848
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,740
what kind of world
will be waiting for me?

849
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,380
Don't worry, Bok-ju.

850
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,220
You'll be great.

851
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,420
You're much stronger and prettier
than you think you are.

852
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,660
Wherever you go, you'll shine brightly.

853
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,780
Bok-ju, you're awesome.

854
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,620
Taereung National Training Centre

855
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,900
I'll be waiting for you, Joon-hyung.

856
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,100
Don't take too long, though.

857
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,860
I'm a short-tempered girl.

858
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,740
Wait for me. I will be there soon.

859
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,940
You know I never turn back, right?

860
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,660
I miss you,

861
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,900
Joon-hyung.

862
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,540
I miss you,

863
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,300
Bok-ju.

864
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,960
We thank Kim Seul-gi and Jota
for their guest appearance.

Weightlifting Fairy

866
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,020
Bok-ju, can you see that
I'm totally in love with you?

867
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,740
I'd never fool around with anyone else.

868
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,340
Joon-hyung just came back.
He stinks of a girl's perfume.

869
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,220
I moved here to avoid you.
I wanted to be away from you.

870
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,460
So don't come here again.

871
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,740
I hate Seoul without you in it.
It's too lonely.

872
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,460
I guess men are all the same.
Joon-hyung has changed, too.

873
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,340
What's wrong? You two were
madly in love. Did you guys fight?

874
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,540
What's the matter?
It's not something to get mad about.

875
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,820
I never thought you'd
do this to me, Joon-hyung.
