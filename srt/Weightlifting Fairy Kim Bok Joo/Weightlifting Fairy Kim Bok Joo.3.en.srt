1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,670
-Your next patient is here.
-Okay.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,310
Ms Kim Bok-ju...

3
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,050
Aren't you...

4
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,620
-Yes. I met you a few days ago.
-Right?

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,880
Are you here for a consultation?

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,000
Please sit down.

7
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,370
I guess we have a special bond.

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,750
Doctor.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,830
Do you like Messi?

10
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,510
Excuse me?

11
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,460
It's a good tip.

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,330
Guys are attracted to girls
who share the same interests as them.

13
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,210
Guys love sports,

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,010
especially soccer.

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,540
If a girl likes Messi,

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,150
guys want to have a drink with her.

17
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,710
Do you...

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,330
...like Messi?

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,670
By Messi, do you mean...

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,120
...the soccer player?

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,540
Yes.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,120
That's right.

24
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,540
I love soccer players.
And I'm a big fan of Messi of them all.

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
Sure. I like Messi.

26
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,250
He's an amazing soccer player.

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,330
He's small, but he's very persistent.

28
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,580
Right? He's very persistent.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,750
That's what I love about him.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,540
-Oh, I see.
-He's also very handsome...

31
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,360
...in a manly way.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,880
Right.

33
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,880
Right.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,080
Let's talk about soccer later.

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,670
Shall we start the check up now?

36
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,890
Ms Kim Bok-ju.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,080
You don't need special treatments.

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,960
I recommend dietary
and behaviour therapy.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,830
Don't seek immediate weight loss.

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,960
It's more important
to lose weight healthily.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,420
Give it enough thoughts.
If you really want this,

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,960
come and sign up for a session.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,850
Why is the success rate of losing weight
only 17 percent?

44
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,860
Basic fee of 590 dollars

45
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,330
590...

46
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,050
Basic fee of 590 dollars

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,790
Come and sign up.

48
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,790
Come and sign up.

49
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,420
EPISODE 3
Let It Go

50
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,170
Please choose a transaction.

51
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,170
When you enter the pass code...

52
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,430
Remaining balance of 390 dollars

53
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,330
What?

54
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,790
Why do I have this little?

55
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,170
Right, I bought Uncle
a birthday gift last month.

56
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,580
Why did I buy him a jacket
instead of a pair of socks?

57
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,790
The transaction is in progress.

58
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,170
What should I do?

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,750
I need 200 dollars more to sign up.

60
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,670
Should I ask Dad to pay me in advance
for working part-time?

61
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,370
Should I lie and tell him
I need new weightlifting shoes?

62
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,040
Okay, that's a great idea.
Weightlifting shoes!

63
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,670
Okay, weightlifting shoes.

64
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,500
Don't forget to take
all of your belongings with you.

65
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,250
Daehan Bank

66
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,670
Hey, Chubs.

67
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,670
Hey!

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,210
Why is she in such a hurry?

69
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,750
Goodness, my goodness.

70
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,620
Look at her run.

71
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,210
That's definitely Bok-ju.

72
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,170
She hasn't changed at all.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,790
Gosh, look at that.

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,670
It's taped everywhere.

75
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,960
The scooter will become green soon.

76
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,540
Let's just get a new one.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,460
We've used it for 18 years.
That's enough.

78
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,370
Why buy a new one when this still works?

79
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,580
It's good enough to use
for the next 10 years.

80
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,000
I haven't mentioned it before,

81
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,790
but it's so embarrassing to make
deliveries with this piece of junk.

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,080
It's the same as riding an old mule.

83
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,080
Hey, Bok-ju.

84
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,000
What brings you here at this hour?

85
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,580
It's nothing. Is the scooter broken?

86
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,500
No, it fell over and a piece broke off.

87
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,790
Bok-ju, tell your dad
to get a new scooter.

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,040
Look at this piece of junk.

89
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,000
Deliveries are important
for a chicken restaurant.

90
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,420
Shut it, would you?

91
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,790
If you have any conscience, you can
say that again after earning more.

92
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,810
You worked as an extra...

93
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,350
but didn't even get paid.
Don't tell me what to do!

94
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,780
The boss was mean, so I couldn't help it.

95
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,900
It's not like I have power
to make any complaints.

96
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,280
That's why you should just focus
on running this business.

97
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,820
Take your mark.

98
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,490
Okay.

99
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,780
Joon-hyung, there's no pressure.
You did a good job.

100
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
Keep up the good work.

101
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,280
Good job.

102
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,440
That's it. You're doing great.

103
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,320
Okay.

104
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,570
That's right.

105
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,570
Point your toes more.

106
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,690
Haneol Sport University

107
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,070
Point your toes more when you jump.

108
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,610
Soo-bin, you're flexible enough,

109
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,530
so all you need now
is more accuracy, okay?

110
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,490
Keep your leg firm when you kick.

111
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,490
Keep up the good work. You're doing well.

112
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,440
Wrap it up. That's all for today.

113
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,030
Who was it that weighed
over the standard?

114
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,070
Do some jump ropes.

115
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,440
You can't go home
if you don't lose weight by today.

116
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,990
Attention.

117
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,990
-One, two, three. Thank you.
-Thank you.

118
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,150
Si-ho.

119
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,940
You aren't getting better
than I thought you would.

120
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,860
What's the problem?

121
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,020
I lose balance during penche turns,
but if I work on my leg muscles...

122
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,200
The problem isn't that simple.

123
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,650
Have you seen...

124
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,570
...how Soo-bin is improving?

125
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,860
She improved a lot.

126
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,990
Speaking of which,

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,940
why don't you get some training
in Russia during the vacation?

128
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,570
-In Russia?
-Yes.

129
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,240
It'll cost you some money,

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,650
but how you spend your winter season...

131
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,900
is very important.

132
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,650
Discuss it with your mum.

133
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,110
Okay?

134
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,940
Geez, where's Bok-ju?
I can't get a hold of her.

135
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,490
Maybe she's making deliveries.

136
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,860
Bok Chicken is making her work
so hard these days.

137
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,820
-I hope no one's in the lounge.
-Let's check.

138
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,990
Geez.

139
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Nice.

140
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,650
Darn it.

141
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,900
I got here first.

142
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,860
So what?

143
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,440
It belongs to the person
who grabs it first.

144
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,440
Are you going to watch food shows again?

145
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,740
What's the point of watching them?
You have to watch your weight anyway.

146
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,650
Then why do you read fashion magazines?

147
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,280
You can't wear those clothes anyway.

148
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
That's right.

149
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,280
We don't read fashion magazines.

150
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
-Bok-ju.
-Where were you? I've been calling.

151
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,740
Shall we go to a sauna?

152
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,860
-Okay.
-Let's go.

153
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,570
Gosh.

154
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,320
Do you...

155
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,280
-have any money?
-Money?

156
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,820
I have about 20 dollars. Why?

157
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,530
I have exactly 11 dollars.

158
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,570
Do you want to order a pizza?

159
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,570
Forget it.

160
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,150
I want to get some rest.

161
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,860
Where are you going?

162
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,030
With coupons, we should have enough
for a pizza.

163
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,650
I told you she should've
quit gymnastics a long time ago.

164
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,690
We even sold our house for her.

165
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,070
If we invest anymore money in her,

166
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,690
we'll have to move to a slum.
Do you understand?

167
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,860
What can we do now?

168
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,280
We sold our house to come this far.
We can't give up now.

169
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,860
She's so close to being the top.

170
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,070
Who wants her to be the top?

171
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,320
It's you. It isn't what Si-ho wants.

172
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,040
All of this is for her.

173
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,650
She's underweight, undernourished
and have irregular menses.

174
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,320
I don't want to push
my daughter this hard either.

175
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,070
What's wrong with you?

176
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,400
Did you see a ghost or something?
You seem so out of it.

177
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,900
It's nothing.

178
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,570
I just remembered a question
someone asked me yesterday.

179
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,860
What's the question?

180
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,360
One of my patients asked me...

181
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,690
if I like Messi.

182
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,320
Isn't that a soccer player
from Argentina?

183
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,690
Come to think of it,

184
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,650
I always ask questions to my patients.

185
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,900
It's been a while
since I was asked a question.

186
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,860
Especially about what I like.

187
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,280
You must've been quite surprised.

188
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,820
You don't usually
talk about your patients.

189
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,570
Is she pretty?

190
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,150
I'm not sure.

191
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,360
I think she is.

192
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,690
Gosh, this is crazy.

193
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,280
What am I thinking?

194
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,110
There's no cure for lovesickness.

195
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,280
-Come back to your senses.
-Bok-ju.

196
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,690
No! My gosh!

197
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,440
-You might break her spine. Stop it.
-Gosh, are you okay?

198
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,690
Don't worry. I like being bent in half.

199
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,400
You've been strange since yesterday.
Is something bothering you?

200
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,780
No, I'm just not feeling too well.

201
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,610
Are you putting on a show so that
you can skip mountain climbing?

202
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,860
Something is fishy.

203
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,490
Right, the mountain-climbing race
is tomorrow.

204
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,940
I'd be flying around right now
if I didn't have to worry about it.

205
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,240
Why does our school always
schedule these things on Saturdays?

206
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm going to go wash my face.

207
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,280
Okay.

208
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Oh, Bok-ju. Hello.

209
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,780
Weightlifting Department

210
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,360
My gosh.

211
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,320
I must've really lost my mind.

212
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,280
Why haven't you signed up?

213
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,780
Gosh, he even talks now.

214
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,530
I'm broke and I have training to go to.
Please don't do this to me.

215
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,150
Why aren't you coming by to sign up?

216
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,820
Why are you doing this to me?
Please stop.

217
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,570
I must be going insane.

218
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,360
Stop. Don't smile. My goodness.

219
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,900
Stop hesitating.

220
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,150
-Just trust me and take my advice.
-I'm going crazy.

221
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,860
Also, UV rays can be
very harmful for women.

222
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,860
-You need to protect yourself.
-This is how people become insane.

223
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,570
-Carry a parasol or an umbrella...
-I'm losing it.

224
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,070
Okay?

225
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,820
Go away. Don't come near me.

226
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,690
I'm literally going crazy.

227
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,380
Stop drinking. It looks like you
already drank an entire pack.

228
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,570
You're the best.

229
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,030
You actually came all the way here
for your obnoxious ex-girlfriend.

230
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,940
You threatened me and said
you'd wait here for me all night.

231
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,690
Did something happen?

232
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,110
Joon-hyung.

233
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,610
Were you born with
a golden spoon in your mouth?

234
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,780
Or... maybe a silver spoon?

235
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,940
Gosh, I'm neither.

236
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,440
I think I'm more of
the bronze spoon kind of guy.

237
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,740
If I can be born again,

238
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,570
I want to be born into a rich family.

239
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,570
I want parents who can fully support me
and not having to worry about anything.

240
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,440
Even if I don't work hard
and slack off all the time,

241
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,570
my parents will marry me off
to a good family.

242
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,780
You know Pyeongchang-dong, right?
I'd love to live there.

243
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,780
In a fancy mansion
with a beautiful garden.

244
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,030
Don't say stuff like that to others.
It makes you sound shallow.

245
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,740
Do you think I'm pathetic?

246
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,570
I'm desperate.

247
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,860
Do you know why you're unhappy?

248
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,990
It's because of the gap...

249
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,780
between what you want and your reality.

250
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,280
Try to be a little less greedy.

251
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,940
Let's go.

252
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,150
We can't be late for the roll call.

253
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,900
Your hand still feels warm.

254
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,690
We have a busy schedule ahead.
We should get some sleep. Let's go.

255
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,360
Just thinking about mountain climbing
is making me so upset.

256
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,360
We can't even sleep in on a Saturday.

257
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,070
I'd rather do more training.

258
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,490
-Those gymnasts are even exempted.
-Are you serious?

259
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,940
Geez. Had I known that,
I would've gotten into gymnastics.

260
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,440
That's not even funny.

261
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,940
Have some conscience, will you?

262
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,400
How about I lie and say
that I have pain in my hamstring?

263
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,490
That won't work. Hyung-chul tried
the tactic. It didn't work.

264
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,940
-He said he has haemorrhoid.
-Goodness.

265
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,820
Haemorrhoid is nothing.

266
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,440
So many people in our department have it.

267
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,150
Even Bok-ju went to the hospital
last year for it.

268
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,280
Hey, why are you suddenly
talking about me?

269
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,650
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

270
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,900
It's like a medal to those of us
who are in strenuous sports.

271
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,940
Anyhow, we can't skip it
unless we have serious injuries...

272
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,780
since so many people
tried to get out of it.

273
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,820
That's why the dean
offered prize money to the winner.

274
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,150
Prize money?

275
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,740
How much is it?

276
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,150
Was it 300 dollars? I heard
it's from the dean's own pockets.

277
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,690
It'll be like a little event.

278
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,280
300 dollars is more than enough
to sign up for the program.

279
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,240
This is my chance.

280
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,150
It's a golden opportunity.

281
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,360
Now then,

282
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,030
shall I climb that darn mountain
as fast as I can?

283
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,010
All right.

284
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,210
I'm glad that all of you are
fully recovered from food poisoning.

285
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,670
Today's such a gorgeous day.

286
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,960
I know that you guys aren't fans
of mountain climbing,

287
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,860
but this race is an important event.

288
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,530
-You know, right?
-The peak is 338.2m high.

289
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,010
Yes. I'll win it...

290
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,800
and make that 300 dollars mine. Then...

291
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Then come to me, Bok-ju.

292
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,410
Then I...

293
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,210
Stay strong, Bok-ju.
You can do it. You got this!

294
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,800
Then I will...

295
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,170
So what, then?
You have to do your best, okay?

296
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,040
Listen. No matter how high
the mountain is,

297
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,960
it won't be as grand as your dreams.

298
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,170
This is nothing hard
compared to your dreams.

299
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,330
What's our biggest strength?

300
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,490
It's being trampled upon...

301
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,660
-Wait, what...
-Ability to overcome obstacles.

302
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,090
Yes, overcoming obstacles.

303
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,120
We get back up no matter
how harshly we're trampled upon.

304
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,420
Guys, I don't even expect
any of you to win today.

305
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,210
I just want all of you
to finish the race without giving up.

306
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,970
That's my goal as well as
the challenge we must conquer today.

307
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,670
Got it?
I hate it when people call us fat...

308
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,840
...and assume we'd be terrible at
mountain climbing because of that.

309
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,800
As you guys know,
that's total nonsense.

310
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,180
Do not make me hear things
like that ever again, okay?

311
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,990
-Yes!
-Are you ready?

312
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,220
-Yes!
-Good.

313
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,210
-Are you guys feeling passionate?
-All right! Go!

314
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,580
-Yes, go.
-Hurry up, guys.

315
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,420
-Move, guys. Move.
-Hey, Bok-ju!

316
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,670
Hurry up.

317
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,460
Let's go faster.

318
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,870
Hey, watch out.

319
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,370
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

320
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,070
-He's coming.
-Ouch!

321
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,250
Joon-hyung, are you all right?

322
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,910
Hey, Ki-seok. Ki-seok.

323
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,330
Joon-hyung sprained his ankle
while getting off the bus earlier.

324
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,370
I don't think he can climb anymore.

325
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,870
-Really? Is it painful?
-Yes.

326
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,160
-Let me see.
-It's this side.

327
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,500
Hey, Ki-seok!
Are you all right? Ki-seok!

328
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,790
Are you okay?
Hey, it was your left ankle.

329
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,210
Stop putting on a show.

330
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,280
Jeong Joon-hyung.

331
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,950
You better not get behind me
and climb all the way to the peak.

332
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,130
The second you see
the back of my head,

333
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,000
you and all of your peers
will be punished. Understand?

334
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,340
-Yes.
-Go.

335
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,590
-Keep climbing.
-Okay.

336
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,750
That way.

337
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,960
-Hey, was I too obvious?
-Yes, you were.

338
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,540
-Bok-ju, wait up!
-I can't climb anymore.

339
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,960
What's wrong with her today?
Did she eat something weird?

340
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't know.
I can't do this anymore.

341
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,040
My gosh.

342
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,130
Hold on.

343
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,170
Hey. Hey, Tae-kwon.

344
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,290
The crazy guy is coming.

345
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,710
Tae-kwon, I'm going first.
Good luck.

346
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,500
Hey. Wait.

347
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,090
I'm scared, too.

348
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,210
Frankly, I'm scared, too.

349
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,750
Hey! Wait for me.

350
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,290
Hey, Chubs!

351
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,920
This is surprising.

352
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,960
Given your size,
I thought you'd already given up.

353
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,210
I wonder if you have strong will
or you're just physically strong.

354
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
Hey.

355
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,470
Am I a ghost?

356
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,770
Talk to me.

357
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,210
I have no energy to talk.

358
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,960
Go away.

359
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,290
Wow, you're so determined.

360
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,920
Are you going to win the first place?

361
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,130
Way to go, Bok-ju!

362
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,670
I'll give you energy!

363
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,670
Get up there, Bok-ju!

364
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,070
Wait for me, though.

365
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,540
One.

366
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,840
Two.

367
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,090
-Good.
-Three.

368
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,170
Flip and kick.

369
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,880
Chubs.

370
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,880
Are you okay?

371
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,090
I don't want to carry you
in case you collapse.

372
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,000
It's not like you'll take care of me
if I hurt my back.

373
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,750
Want me to call for a stretcher?

374
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,040
Go.

375
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,790
Just go.

376
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,090
Okay, let's go!

377
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,920
What are you doing? Keep going.

378
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,710
-Move it.
-My goodness.

379
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,920
Stop it!

380
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
-Let's go, Bok-ju!
-Stop!

381
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,960
Bok-ju!

382
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,670
Hey. Oh no. Oh my gosh.

383
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,590
What should I do?

384
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,130
-I'm so sorry. It wasn't intentional.
-Stop!

385
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,420
You seemed tired,
so I just wanted to help you.

386
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,090
I really just wanted to help.

387
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,460
I think someone will be here soon.

388
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,420
We're offering a prize,
so I'm sure they're trying hard.

389
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,960
Shall we get ready, then?

390
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,090
Go away.

391
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,500
Hey, I'm sorry.

392
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,630
You seemed so tired,
so I was trying to help you.

393
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,840
What? Are you going
to head-butt me again?

394
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,750
-Hold on to me. It'd be easier.
-Oh, geez.

395
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,420
Hold on to me.

396
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
Come on.

397
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,630
Seriously!

398
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,540
Hey. Get on my back, then.

399
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,840
I made you fall, so I'll carry you.

400
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,260
I'll just hurt my back at worst.

401
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,470
Get on.

402
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,090
Bok-ju!

403
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,540
I'm hurt.

404
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,750
My knee hurts.

405
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,500
She won't look back at all.

406
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
So many have already arrived.

407
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,500
But then, they're athletes.
Of course they'd be competitive.

408
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,630
They offered a prize after all.

409
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,920
That's gone now.

410
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,170
Bok-ju.

411
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,290
Let's get your ankle treated.

412
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,170
-You should put ice on the...
-Get lost.

413
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,000
-What?
-I said get lost!

414
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,920
We're not friends.
We just went to the same school.

415
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,630
Why are you being such a busybody?

416
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,630
Mind your own business, would you?

417
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,420
You ruined everything.

418
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,710
Did she have to be mean like that?

419
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,710
Hey, what do you want to eat?

420
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,670
Jokbal? Bossam?

421
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,920
Or should we have some beer with
chicken, sausages and French fries?

422
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,090
The last one sounds good.

423
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,460
-Let's eat until we burst.
-Sounds good.

424
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,420
Bok-ju, what's your choice?

425
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,090
What? I don't have an appetite.

426
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,170
-What?
-Seon-ok, did I hear her right?

427
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,040
Did she say
she doesn't have an appetite?

428
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,040
What's wrong with you?
You said your ankle is fine.

429
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,840
-You made it to the top. It's good.
-She's right.

430
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,340
Hey.

431
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,960
It's our night out in a long time.
Don't be like this.

432
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,340
Come on now.

433
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,380
Let's go, Bok-ju.

434
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,290
I'm hungry.

435
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,710
I'm so hungry that
my stomach is flat.

436
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,540
Come on, Bok-ju.
She won't stop otherwise.

437
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Hurry.

438
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,090
Fine, let's eat the things
you just said, so be quiet.

439
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,210
How long do we have
to put up with this?

440
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,960
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

441
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,920
Drink up! I don't need anything else.
I have you guys.

442
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,630
That's right.
Now you sound like yourself.

443
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,710
Bok-ju is swilling her beer.
Awesome.

444
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,960
Bok-ju.

445
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,380
Here's to your healthy weight loss.

446
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,090
Cheers.

447
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,920
-Hey, slow down. You'll get drunk.
-Gosh.

448
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,590
This is already your third glass.
Bok-ju, she's drinking too fast.

449
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,290
What are you doing? Slow down.

450
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,420
It's fine. It's our night out
in such a long time.

451
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,090
We won't get to drink out again
for a while after today.

452
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,790
-Right?
-Ouch, that hurts.

453
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,750
I'm sorry. Hey, move forward a bit.

454
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,170
Fine. All right.

455
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,630
Okay.

456
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,130
My gosh, seriously.

457
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,000
What should we do?
She's doing it again.

458
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,540
Let's just eat quickly.

459
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,210
I'm going to take a selfie.

460
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,040
Have you talked to Joon-hyung?

461
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,930
Is he okay about being disqualified?

462
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,880
He'll have a counselling with
my friend.

463
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,460
Really? Gosh, that's a relief.

464
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,880
That's good. We were worried,

465
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,460
but we tried not to show.

466
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,130
Mental training is important
to athletes.

467
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,460
-It will help him.
-Oh, my.

468
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,750
Speak of the devil.

469
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,920
Hello, Joon-hyung.

470
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,000
Have you eaten?

471
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,340
We're having octopus...
No, I meant pancakes.

472
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,540
I just ate dinner with Tae-kwon.

473
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm not going to be late.

474
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,630
I know you miss me.
Just wait a little longer.

475
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,960
I love you, Mum.

476
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,500
Is she your mum or your girlfriend?

477
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,250
You're quite a mama's boy.

478
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,710
I can't say I'm not.
I love my mum so much.

479
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,960
My goodness.

480
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,200
-My gosh.
-Oh no. Oh no.

481
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,290
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't touch me!

482
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,390
I'm sorry. My friend is drunk.

483
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,770
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

484
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,000
Do something about
your drinking problem.

485
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,840
Let them be. It'll ruin the mood.

486
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,980
-Sit down.
-Brats should just stay home.

487
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,440
Why are they drinking outside?

488
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,610
Hey. Don't bother others
when you're drinking.

489
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,560
I can see what will become of you.

490
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,150
We'll be weightlifters.

491
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,210
Gosh. If you were my sister,

492
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,560
I'd shave your head and lock you up.

493
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,150
-What did you say to my friend?
-What?

494
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,400
I said what I wanted to say.
Do you have a problem?

495
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,730
How dare you.

496
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,110
What was that?

497
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,230
You're athletes.

498
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,440
No wonder.

499
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,810
That's enough.

500
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,770
What do those losers know anyway?

501
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,440
What did you say?

502
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,020
-Losers?
-Losers?

503
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,550
Let's see who the real losers are.

504
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Bok-ju.

505
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,150
-Darn it.
-Calm down. Calm down.

506
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,980
Hey, the girls here
don't look very nice.

507
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,730
I'm tired. Let's just have
a quick drink.

508
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,520
Come on.

509
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,270
Don't be upset.

510
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,150
Look here.

511
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,770
You're cowards who
talk behind our back.

512
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,770
Isn't she the weightlifter
you went to school with?

513
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,060
-Stop it, let's go.
-I can't believe this.

514
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,310
I don't want to fight with you.
Just apologise and leave.

515
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,940
I already apologised. You get lost.

516
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,650
What did you say?
How dare you talk rudely to me?

517
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,860
-Get lost.
-I'm not getting lost.

518
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,610
-Stop it.
-You are the worst.

519
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,560
-You're worse.
-Stop it.

520
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,650
Gosh, what should I do?

521
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,020
-Stop it.
-Get out of here.

522
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,860
-Gosh, he's so rude to women.
-What?

523
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,560
You don't even look like a woman.

524
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,100
-Then am I a man?
-You're uglier than a man.

525
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,940
-Your face is worse.
-Oh, my gosh.

526
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,730
-Don't look down on women.
-Stop it.

527
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,070
Let me go.

528
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,110
-What woman would be so aggressive?
-Hey, let's go.

529
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,770
Do you think I'll go easy on you
because you're a woman?

530
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,400
Hey.

531
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,730
-Who cares if you're an athlete?
-What does that have to do with this?

532
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,730
-You swore at us first.
-Stop it.

533
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,860
My goodness.

534
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,400
She might even punch me.

535
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,520
Punch me. Come on, punch me.

536
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,770
-Punch me.
-How dare you?

537
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,150
You have a flat chest anyway.

538
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,690
You don't even look like a woman.

539
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,230
What? You punk!

540
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,520
-You punk, what did you say?
-Let me go.

541
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,520
-Goodness.
-Let me go.

542
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,810
I'm a woman, too, you punks!

543
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,730
-I'm still a woman even if I'm fat.
-Let it go.

544
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,270
-How dare you hit me?
-Goodness.

545
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,020
Let me go.

546
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,310
-Come here, you punk.
-Goodness.

547
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,230
-Hey, stop it. My goodness.
-Just leave.

548
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,400
-Come on, stop it.
-I'm sorry.

549
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,940
You'd better watch it.

550
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,860
-Don't stop me.
-Come on, let's go.

551
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,560
They deserve to be punched.

552
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,230
Stand up straight.
You need to sober up.

553
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,360
Have a seat over there.

554
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,560
Okay, I'm sober now.

555
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,070
I'm completely sober. See?

556
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,440
Put this on. It's cold.

557
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,520
What a mess.

558
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,840
I wanted us to have a good time
away from school.

559
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,980
Darn those punks!

560
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,730
I'm sorry. I lost my temper again.

561
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,360
You should be careful.
What if you got hit?

562
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,730
We may be weightlifters,
but they were still men.

563
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,360
They looked like thugs.

564
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,360
They were so rude toward us.

565
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,150
You guys are a mess.

566
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,520
One likes to fight
while the other is a bad drunk.

567
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,310
I'm never letting her drink
ever again.

568
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,310
Gosh.

569
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,690
I'm cold.

570
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,650
I'm so cold.

571
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,980
Here you go.

572
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,310
Drink this and let it go.

573
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,310
Gosh, it sucks.
I was so close to punching a girl.

574
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,020
Be careful with your words.

575
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,150
They were gangsters, not girls.

576
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,440
I hate aggressive women like them.

577
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,230
I'd reject them even if they're easy.

578
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,860
-Are you serious?
-Well, one of them was okay.

579
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,110
That's right.

580
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,770
Women like them can be
attractive in a different way.

581
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,270
They may be tough at first,

582
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,480
but they can be quite submissive.

583
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,360
You know what I mean.

584
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,770
You know Kyung-shik, right?

585
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,020
His girlfriend is manly
and has a big build.

586
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,730
Kyung-shik says that she's amazing.

587
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,940
-Come on, be more specific.
-You know. Compared to skinny girls...

588
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,980
-Excuse me.
-What?

589
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,860
Nan-hee, are you okay?

590
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,310
-Have you sobered up?
-Yes.

591
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,770
I feel much better now.

592
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,520
She's sober if she can talk.
She looks better, too.

593
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,610
-Let's go.
-Let's. I'm so tired today.

594
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,520
-Hey!
-Gosh, I'm tired.

595
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,360
-Run. Let's go!
-What?

596
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,520
-Run, run!
-What's going on?

597
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,020
-Goodness.
-What's going on?

598
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,310
Come on, hurry up.

599
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,440
-Run faster.
-Stop right there.

600
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,730
Just wait until I catch you!

601
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,610
Come on, hurry!

602
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,070
How much more do we have to run?

603
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,860
You go that way.

604
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,560
-This way, this way!
-Come on, hurry up.

605
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,190
My goodness.

606
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,150
Where did those punks go?

607
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,020
Where on earth did they go?

608
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,560
Gosh.

609
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,610
What are you doing?

610
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,900
You guys go that way.
Let's go this way.

611
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,100
-Why don't we go this way?
-That's what I said.

612
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,730
-Keep up with me.
-Gosh.

613
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,310
Again?

614
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,310
-They're leaving.
-Let's go.

615
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,690
That must hurt.

616
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,150
Let's go.

617
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,440
Okay, let's go.

618
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,860
Hey, they're here!

619
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,610
Stop it.

620
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,230
All that running made me nauseous.

621
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,190
Is your ankle okay?

622
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,980
I feel a little pain, but it's okay.

623
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,230
Why did we run away?

624
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,150
Right. I wonder
why I ran away with you.

625
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,190
I must have lost my mind.

626
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,520
When did you get there?

627
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,440
Did you see what happened?

628
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,770
See what?

629
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,730
Did you...

630
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,020
get into a fight because of me?

631
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,150
Why would I get into a fight
because of you?

632
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,150
You may not know this,

633
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,650
but I'm not that loyal. I don't
meddle in other people's business.

634
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,770
"Stay out of other people's business
while others stay out of mine."

635
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,860
That's my motto in life.

636
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,070
Then why did you run away?

637
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,440
Wasn't it because
you got into a fight?

638
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,230
No.

639
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,150
I must have been too handsome.
They kept giving me looks.

640
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,610
I understand that those losers were
out to have some good time,

641
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,360
but all the women were looking at me,
so...

642
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,230
What?

643
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,650
I can't have a serious conversation
with you.

644
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,730
Anyway, now that I ran for a long time,
I have less on my mind.

645
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,610
Thanks, friend.

646
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,360
You're welcome.

647
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,110
By the way, what was on your mind?

648
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,770
-Is it something complicated?
-What if it is?

649
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,360
Am I to tell you about it?

650
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,690
I don't think we're close enough
to have a deep conversation.

651
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,860
I have to agree with that.

652
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,560
Let me ask you one question.

653
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:56,150
Has your personality changed
or did I remember you wrongly?

654
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,400
Of course I have changed.

655
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,650
I can't survive in this world
if I'm still that shy little boy.

656
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,980
Be honest.

657
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,560
Aren't I more attractive
than before?

658
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,270
Right?

659
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,190
Stop it, get that face away from me.

660
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,270
Your chin is too pointy.

661
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,940
Speaking of what's on your mind,

662
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,860
don't force yourself to
come to a conclusion.

663
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,900
Based on my experience,

664
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,150
time solves everything.

665
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,230
Whatever.

666
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,860
Chang-geol!

667
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,610
Bok-ju!

668
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,230
Come out now.

669
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,360
Why is he so loud?

670
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,190
Why are you yelling loudly
so early in the morning?

671
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,190
What's that?

672
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,650
Uncle, what's that? My gosh.

673
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,730
Can't you see what it is?

674
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,650
It's a scooter.

675
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,100
It's used, but it doesn't have
much mileage. It's as good as new.

676
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,360
By the way,
I disposed our old scooter.

677
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,650
No one was willing to take that junk,
I barely sold it for 100 dollars.

678
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,440
Where did you get the money
to buy this?

679
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,020
I complained to my boss.

680
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,730
I told him to pay me
for all the works I've done...

681
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,310
or I'd complain
to the broadcasting station.

682
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,310
If you get on his bad side,
he might not give you more work.

683
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,860
I don't even have the talent
for acting. I can just quit.

684
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,810
Whatever.
I don't want to talk about it.

685
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,440
So? What do you think?

686
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,520
If you get on this scooter...

687
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,940
and ride it like this,
you'll look so cool.

688
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,610
Uncle! You look so cool today.
You're super charismatic.

689
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,110
So?

690
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,560
I do like it.

691
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,900
Isn't it so shiny?

692
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,520
-Gosh.
-Come on.

693
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,400
Let's just take a look.
It'll be quick.

694
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,520
-Let's go inside.
-We're running late. Let's just go.

695
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,150
-Hello!
-Hello.

696
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,230
Let's just browse.
We won't buy anything.

697
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,980
This must be a new model.

698
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,400
-Let's get matching shoes.
-No, let's go.

699
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,940
-Why not?
-Why should we get the same shoes?

700
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,310
I hate it.

701
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,310
Let's go. Come on.

702
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,360
Gosh, seriously.

703
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Okay, all right. Let go of me, then.

704
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,940
-You won't get them, right?
-No.

705
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,520
-Promise?
-Yes.

706
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,020
Goodness, hey.

707
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,230
-Let's go.
-Gosh, all right.

708
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,360
Come on.

709
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,980
-Let's go now.
-Let's get matching shoes!

710
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,730
-Thank you.
-I'll be back soon!

711
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,190
What are you talking about?

712
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,980
That one would also look good...

713
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,860
on Joon-hyung.

714
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,560
It's certainly faster.
It took at least five minutes less.

715
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,860
I know, right?

716
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,110
This new scooter sure is great.

717
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,360
Don't drive too fast, though.

718
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,070
And be careful
when you make a turn, okay?

719
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,860
Yes, Ma'am. Sure thing.

720
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,110
Thanks for giving me a ride, Dad.
See you later.

721
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,560
Here, take this.

722
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,480
What is this?

723
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,020
You seemed so down
the last time I saw you.

724
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,690
Don't spend all your time training.
Make sure to de-stress, too.

725
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,770
Go out with your friends for
delicious food and shopping.

726
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,190
You should also go clubbing
like other girls.

727
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,690
It's okay. I don't need this.

728
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,440
Just take it, you silly girl.

729
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,810
I was thinking
of getting a new scooter,

730
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,190
but your uncle already got this for me.

731
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,360
Stress is bad for athletes.

732
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,110
Go out and de-stress. You have to.

733
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,520
One more thing. Your uncle will visit
the hospital from now on,

734
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,560
so don't worry
and just focus on your training.

735
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,810
We don't get many customers
during the day,

736
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,270
so let's just do that. Okay?
I'll get going now.

737
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,520
Dad.

738
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,440
Bok-ju, all the best!

739
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,310
Bye!

740
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,440
Watch my parkour!

741
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,860
You're such a kid.

742
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,400
Gosh, here we go again.
My shoulders are hurting so much.

743
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,860
Build more muscles unless you want
it to be dislocated all the time.

744
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,860
I know that, too.
I'm just lazy.

745
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,440
My darling, you're the only one
who's worried about me.

746
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,770
Get off of me, you idiot.

747
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,650
What's your problem?
Get more of this!

748
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,440
You're so dead when I catch you!

749
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,520
Come here. Come with me.

750
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:51,360
-You're so dead.
-Wait! I have to pick up my package.

751
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,650
-Don't lie to my face.
-I'm serious.

752
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,400
-Ouch! Let go of me!
-Gosh, I'm not lying.

753
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,110
I'm expecting
the swim trunk I bought.

754
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,150
Hey, you did more shopping?

755
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,650
-What?
-Aren't you worried about your dad?

756
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,940
-Can you keep on splurging like this?
-Don't worry, my friend.

757
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,310
The rich never goes
completely flat broke.

758
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,150
What's there to life anyway?

759
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,730
You should live today
as if there's no tomorrow.

760
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,610
There's something for you.

761
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,560
Look, "For Jeong Joon-hyung".

762
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,980
I'm not expecting anything.

763
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,650
It's actually a little odd.

764
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,190
There's no address written.
There's only your name.

765
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,020
Korea Gymnastics Association

766
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,070
Hi, Joon-hyung.

767
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,690
I guess you were practising.

768
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,110
Here.

769
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,230
You figured it out.

770
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,730
You're the only person
who'd send me things like this.

771
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,650
Since I'm the only person,
can't you just keep and wear them?

772
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,150
You do have a point.

773
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,070
I thought about keeping them
for a very brief moment,

774
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,770
but I don't think I can accept it,
knowing it's from you.

775
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,150
Okay.

776
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,810
I didn't know it'd make you
so uncomfortable.

777
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,190
Point taken.

778
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,150
Goodbye.

779
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,610
No, you crazy wench.

780
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,440
You're really crazy
if you sign up with this money.

781
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,690
All Dad does is worry about you.

782
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,520
He had to drive that old scooter
so many times to earn this money.

783
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,440
Bok-ju, don't do anything
you'll regret.

784
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,020
Gosh, this is so boring.

785
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,150
We can't even have beer.

786
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,560
Have some conscience, will you?

787
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,150
Don't you dare talk about alcohol
for some time.

788
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,980
-Girls.
-Yes, Bok-ju. What is it?

789
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,150
From now on,

790
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,020
I'm going to train real hard.

791
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,940
You already practice hard enough.

792
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,610
-You practice the hardest among us.
-That's right.

793
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,980
No.

794
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,230
I've been so lax lately.

795
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,860
I'm going to focus now...

796
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,940
and train a hundred times harder.

797
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,150
What, a hundred times harder?

798
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,860
Bok-ju might go to Taereung
this year, don't you think?

799
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,190
Yes. Taereung
will be a piece of cake.

800
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,070
-She'll win a gold medal.
-Exactly.

801
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,610
I'm Kim Bok-ju!

802
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,520
I'm the rising star of weightlifting,
Kim Bok-ju!

803
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,150
From now on,
I'm going to focus on training!

804
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,520
Yes, I got this. I can do this!

805
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,650
Hey, we heard everything,
Kim Bok-ju!

806
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,440
I'm the rising star of weightlifting,
Kim Bok-ju. Got it?

807
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:52,940
-I can do this!
-Keep it down!

808
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,440
That's right. It's not like
I ever had a guy in my life.

809
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,190
I'm Kim Bok-ju! I'm Kim Bok-ju.

810
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,230
I'm sure this is
just something fleeting.

811
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,690
Time will take care of everything.

812
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:07,230
I hope time flies by. I really do.

813
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,560
I'm Kim Bok-ju!

814
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,860
Fly, time. Fly.

815
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:26,650
Good, Bok-ju.
That's it. Focus on breathing.

816
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,650
Lift! And breathe.

817
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,150
-You got this!
-You're doing great, Bok-ju.

818
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,440
-Hold it.
-Go, Bok-ju!

819
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:38,270
Gosh, that was awesome.

820
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,560
Bok-ju, you seem so determined.

821
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,690
Our team hasn't won
a gold medal for a long time.

822
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,020
Let's root for her to win one!

823
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,520
-Go for it, Bok-ju!
-You can do this!

824
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,770
Let's go!

825
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,770
-Gosh, I'm hungry.
-I know you're taller than us,

826
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,020
-but don't do this.
-What? I can't hear you.

827
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,440
-My gosh.
-Hey, what do you girls think...

828
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,110
about me getting
a double lid surgery?

829
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,150
-What do you think?
-You'll look like a celebrity.

830
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,360
Like Park Myung-soo!

831
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,310
Hey.

832
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,360
-How can you say that?
-Aren't we going to eat?

833
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,770
-Yes, I'm hungry.
-I'm starving.

834
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:07,980
Today's menu is omelette rice.

835
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,360
-Omelette rice again?
-Why again?

836
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,480
-I don't want it.
-We had it last week.

837
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,150
-Hey.
-Gosh, please!

838
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,560
Omelette rice is delicious.

839
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,940
Ms Celebrity, take us out for barbecue.

840
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,190
-Yes, you should.
-Thanks in advance.

841
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,440
-Hey!
-Let's go.

842
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,860
-Let's go eat!
-Let's go!

843
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,150
It looks like Chubs
is in a good mood.

844
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,690
You have to join the national team
when you're back from Russia.

845
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,150
Yes, of course.

846
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,310
Hey, Si-ho.

847
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,770
I'll come back in a bit.

848
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,070
Just talk to me now.

849
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,440
Okay.

850
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,690
Did you speak to your mum about it?

851
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,230
Yes. I don't think I'll be able
to do it this time.

852
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,520
Why not?
You can't afford it?

853
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,110
Did she say it's too expensive?

854
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,310
All right, then.
It can't be helped.

855
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,070
I hoped you could come with us.

856
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,310
It's disappointing.

857
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,610
I know. It's disappointing.

858
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,770
-Hi, Mum.
-Did you tell the coach...

859
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,150
you won't go to Russia?

860
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,520
Why did you decide it without
discussing with me first?

861
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:21,860
If I had,

862
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,650
would I be able to go?

863
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,770
-What?
-We have to pay for the lessons.

864
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,270
How will you afford the airfare,
living expenses and lesson fees?

865
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,860
Please, Mum.

866
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,610
Stop bluffing
when you can't even afford it.

867
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,020
It makes me forget about
how poor we are.

868
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,310
-It's Song Si-ho.
-Isn't she Song Si-ho?

869
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,440
Why is she in the men's dormitory?

870
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,360
Where is she going?

871
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,730
Gosh, she startled me.

872
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,230
I get what you said
and I know what I did was wrong.

873
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,230
But don't do this to me.

874
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,520
It's not so hard to accept this.

875
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,940
You can wear them
or throw them away.

876
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,310
I already gave them to you.

877
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:09,070
Do you like Messi?

878
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:17,890
-I'm done. I can't do this anymore.
-All right.

879
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,190
It can't get cleaner than this.

880
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,460
Let's go and eat the ribs.

881
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,640
Fine. Go on before the ribs run out.

882
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,730
-I'll get there first.
-Wait for me.

883
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,680
I like Ronaldo better than Messi.

884
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,980
Have a good day.

885
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,600
I like Ronaldo better than Messi.
Have a good day.

886
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,560
Sometimes, there are
passionate feelings that...

887
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,660
time and reason can't help.

888
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,340
Hurry up, Bok-ju.

889
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,100
-Hey, we're here.
-Bok-ju!

890
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,560
-Bok-ju!
-Hey!

891
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,990
One day, a mayfly said this
to a moth that's drawn to a flame.

892
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,450
"You know that flame is
a trap set by humans."

893
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,510
"It's not like you only have
a day to live as I do."

894
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:16,290
"Why would you want to throw yourself
at the flame, knowing that you'll die?"

895
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,460
The moth said,

896
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,820
"The flame is too beautiful
not to throw myself at."

897
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:26,040
"There is no beauty without pain."

898
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,970
Would this road lead me
to a fire pit?

899
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,860
I'm a little scared,

900
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,720
but I'll go down this road.

901
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,440
I'll run to him.

902
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,380
Are you okay?

903
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,050
We're stuck.

904
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,220
Be careful.

905
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:58,130
Wow, you even talk now.

906
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,970
I must be out of my mind.

907
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,120
We thank Ahn Il-kwon and
Noh Woo-jin for their appearance.

908
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,040
Weightlifting Fairy

909
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,470
Your hairpin is pretty.
It looks good on you.

910
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,310
-Shall we move to the bed?
-Bed?

911
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:47,310
Jae-yi, you seduced
a naive college girl again.

912
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,720
-Where have you been?
-What are you up to these days?

913
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,850
If I asked, would you help me?

914
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,970
-Bok-ju is my roommate.
-You think I'm a fool.

915
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,930
She's one of my patients.
She is a cellist.

916
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,430
-Is she pretty?
-She's quite pretty.

917
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,720
What are you doing here, Chubs?

918
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,880
-He's my brother.
-Brother?

919
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,310
