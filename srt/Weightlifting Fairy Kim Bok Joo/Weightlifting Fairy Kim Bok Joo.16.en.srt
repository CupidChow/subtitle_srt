1
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,660
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,600
Taereung National Training Centre

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,280
Yes. We turned the lights off already.

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,280
I just came out to a quiet place.

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,240
My roommate,

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,040
who plays for Yeonnam City Hall,
is a light sleeper.

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,160
How was your training today?

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,760
Good. I shortened my record
again by 0.2 second.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
I might not only join you there, but
also become a star player like Phelps.

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,240
I like him.

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,280
What about you? How is your back?

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,880
Well...

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,560
It won't heal any time soon.
It's a chronic illness.

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,880
You lost weight again, didn't you?

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,920
I saw your picture, and your face
has gotten even smaller.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,040
No. I'm just lovesick.
It's because I miss you.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,640
Gosh. Why aren't I losing weight, then?

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,160
I miss you, too.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,840
I miss you, Seon-ok and Nan-hee.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,920
I also miss the fried chicken
my dad and uncle make.

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,280
You call your dad often, right?

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,280
Yes. I called him earlier.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,960
I don't know if it's because
I'm not there, but he sounded weak.

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,000
All right.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,280
I'll come by his restaurant tomorrow
and check on him.

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,680
Okay. Thank you.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,240
Joon-hyung.

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,240
Now that I'm here in Taereung,

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,200
things that happened back in school
seem like a dream.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,160
I realise how happy I was...

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,360
and how blessed I was to have
such good people around me.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,360
Joon-hyung.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,360
Joon-hyung?

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,080
Are you asleep? Are you?

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
You're asleep.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,160
I fought off the urge to sleep
and waited to call you,

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,680
but you fell asleep.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,480
It seems like I like you
more than you like me now.

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,840
This hurts my pride.

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,760
Hey. Who's there?

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,760
I must follow the rules.

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,400
I must follow the rules.
I must follow the rules.

43
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
I must follow the rules.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,240
I must follow the rules.
I must follow the rules.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,120
Joon-hyung. Joon-hyung!

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,240
You said you'd go to the cyber café
with me. I even massaged my hands.

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
I have a place to go. I'll see you later.

48
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,640
Where are you going?

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Hey, Joon-hyung. Hey!

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,720
Geez, just where is he rushing to?
Did something good happen?

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,040
-Hi, Tae-kwon.
-Hello.

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,360
We're going to the cafeteria. Join us.

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,240
-All right.
-Let's go.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,960
-Awesome.
-I love the cafeteria.

55
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,900
Bok Chicken

56
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Closed due to personal reasons

57
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,160
"Closed due to personal reasons"

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
"If it's urgent..."

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
Did something happen?

60
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
I should ask.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,520
Hello, Kim Dae-ho speaking.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,400
Hello, Mr Kim. This is Bok-ju's friend,
Jeong Joon-hyung.

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,120
Oh, you're Bok-ju's future husband.

64
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes. That's right.

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,160
So, is everything okay?

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,480
I see your restaurant is closed.

67
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,960
What brings you here?

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
I heard you were in the hospital,
and I thought I should come.

69
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,640
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes. He's fine.

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,080
He's staying here because they
need to treat his stomach ulcer...

71
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,480
and optimise his condition
before the surgery.

72
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,280
I thought you and Bok-ju
were just friends.

73
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,880
Why do you care so much
that your friend's dad is sick?

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
You should be thankful that he cares.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,040
-You have such a nasty temper.
-What nasty temper?

76
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
How dare you
talk to your older brother like that?

77
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,920
It's been too long since I gave you
a good beating, right?

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,160
-You punk.
-You didn't have to get him anything.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,280
All right. Here you go.

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,920
When are you going to have the surgery?

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
They gave us a date,

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,280
but it's the same day as
Bok-ju's tournament.

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,320
We've been worried that
Bok-ju might find out.

84
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,920
Listen. I say this out of concern.

85
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,920
Don't you tell Bok-ju about this.
Do you hear me?

86
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,640
She'll have a match soon.
If she finds out,

87
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,280
she won't focus on her training.

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,160
She worked so hard
to make the national team.

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,840
Okay. I promise you
I will keep that in mind.

90
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes, Bok...

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm training right now.
I'll call you back when I'm done. Okay.

92
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,760
What's going on?
He fell asleep last night and now this?

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,040
I wanted to hear his voice.

94
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,880
What is it?
Didn't your boyfriend pick up?

95
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,480
He did, but he said
he will call me back later.

96
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,920
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Show us his picture.

97
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,440
Let's see what he looks like.

98
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,040
Here.

99
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,400
Hey, are you really saying
he's your boyfriend?

100
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,040
Don't lie to us. You got these
pictures off the Internet, right?

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,120
No. He's in my university's
swimming team.

102
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,240
Hey, did you save a kingdom
in your past life?

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,120
He's so handsome. She hit the jackpot.

104
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,800
But she can't even get
her handsome boyfriend on the phone.

105
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,480
That's not a good sign.

106
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,800
I think you two are
going to break up soon.

107
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,360
-What?
-90 percent of the athletes...

108
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,760
who have a boy or girl friend
go through a breakup after coming here.

109
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,160
And there are stages to it.

110
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,080
At first, it gets harder
to get him on the phone.

111
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,880
He either ignores your call
or says he'll call back later. Then,

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,680
he will sound aloof
and his answers will be very short.

113
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,600
And finally, he will drop the bomb.

114
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,040
"I'm sorry. I think we should break up."

115
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,040
"I'm seeing someone else."

116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,360
No way. He's just
training right now, so...

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
-Gosh, I'm sorry.
-Hey.

118
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,520
Who trains during lunchtime?
We went to a sports university, too.

119
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
With your boyfriend's looks,

120
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,040
I'll give it a month tops.

121
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,720
Girls would never leave him alone.
Am I right?

122
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,520
Seon-ok, Tae-kwon.

123
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,720
-The hot dogs are here.
-What took you so long?

124
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,560
I brought hot dogs. There's no ketchup.

125
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,640
-Why? You have no tact at all.
-They didn't have it.

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,760
The food tastes so much better
now that you're filling in for Bok-ju.

127
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,480
Tae-kwon, I'll have you as
our new member, okay?

128
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,800
Sure. I'll be honoured. Count me in.

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay. We're now the new trio.

130
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
-It's our former member.
-It's Bok-ju.

131
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
Hey, Bok-ju. It's been so long
since you called me.

132
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,080
I almost forget how your voice sounded.

133
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
That's why I'm calling you now.

134
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,760
How are you, Nan-hee? Where's Seon-ok?

135
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,440
She's next to me. We're eating snacks.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,640
Have you eaten?

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Have you talked to your boyfriend?

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,880
No, I haven't. He's in training.

139
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,320
What? Joon-hyung is in training?

140
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,600
What happened?

141
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,640
Where did Joon-hyung go
after lying to Bok-ju?

142
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,320
I have no idea.
He said he had to go somewhere.

143
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,520
What is Joon-hyung up to these days?

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,400
Do you also suspect that
he's with another woman?

145
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,080
I don't want to suspect him,
but that's the feeling I get.

146
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,880
What else could it be other than women?

147
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,040
Listen, Joon-hyung tends to have
many women around him,

148
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,360
but he's not the type to betray.

149
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,000
How would you know that?

150
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,480
As a man, I can't guarantee it.

151
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,680
Forget it.

152
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,360
We need evidence to either catch him
or straighten out any misunderstanding.

153
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,320
Tae-kwon, we need your cooperation.

154
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,160
Hey.

155
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,440
My future nephew-in-law.

156
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm not sure if I can ask this,

157
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,640
but can you come for two hours tomorrow?

158
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,000
My girlfriend is very upset right now.

159
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,280
Okay, I will.

160
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,960
I'll come after my training, Uncle.

161
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,400
Could you let me go?

162
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,800
-Hello, Honey?
-Aren't you coming?

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
-Where are you, you jerk?
-Why are you cursing at me?

164
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,920
Though you're most beautiful
when you curse.

165
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,400
-You're so cool.
-Keep up with the compliments.

166
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,640
Why aren't you answering me?

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Who are you with? Which girl?

168
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,160
Aren't you going to answer me?

169
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,880
The number you have dialled...

170
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,760
She's not picking up.

171
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,760
Is she in training?

172
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,120
Why did she call me at that moment?

173
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,520
I want to hear your voice, Bok-ju.

174
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
Joon-hyung.

175
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,520
Look who's here. Hi, Si-ho.

176
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,960
-Have you been well?
-I've been better.

177
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,040
Geez. Where are you going?

178
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm heading to the dorm. You?

179
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,400
I'm heading there, too.
Let's go together.

180
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,520
-Go ahead first.
-Let's go together.

181
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,200
-No, you go first.
-Stop playing. Let's go.

182
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,440
Okay, let's go.

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,280
How's the therapy session?

184
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,040
-Isn't the doctor great?
-Yes, he is.

185
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm feeling much better
ever since I started therapy.

186
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm studying these days.

187
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,960
I'm being interviewed for
assistant coach positions.

188
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,680
You're working hard.

189
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
You look much better, too.

190
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,600
Really?

191
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,960
By the way,
are you in touch with Bok-ju often?

192
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,880
Isn't it difficult
now that she's in Taereung?

193
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,880
I'm starting to resent the national team.

194
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,760
Haneol Sport University

195
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,880
What?

196
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,760
Darn. See you there.

197
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,480
Nan-hee, we've got one.

198
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,200
Joon-hyung is out again.

199
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,680
-We have to go now.
-Okay, Joon-hyung is dead meat.

200
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Let's go.

201
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
He's walking so fast. He must be excited.

202
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,560
I hope he's not seeing another woman.
If so, I'll grab him by the collar.

203
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,520
It must be another woman.

204
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,320
I'm sure of it.

205
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,160
I thought he'd be
more faithful than that.

206
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,520
-I'm nothing without my fidelity.
-Be quiet.

207
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,280
We must catch him in the act,
so be as discreet as possible.

208
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,160
Over there.

209
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,400
Let's go.

210
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,280
Isn't he just visiting a patient?

211
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,840
Perhaps.

212
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,480
Is the woman hospitalised?

213
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,520
Or could it be...

214
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,440
a nurse?

215
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,320
We can't just barge into someone's room
in the hospital.

216
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,680
We must catch him in the act of cheating.

217
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,800
Kim Chang-geol? The name sounds familiar.

218
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,520
Do you know Kim Chang-geol?

219
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,760
Kim Chang-geol?

220
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,440
Oh, it's the same name as
Bok-ju's father.

221
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,480
Right, her father's name is...

222
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,360
No, that can't be.

223
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,800
What? What is it?
What are you two thinking?

224
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,280
-Gosh, these are delicious.
-Aren't they?

225
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,760
Nan-hee, Seon-ok.

226
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,840
How did you know I was here?

227
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,880
-Mr Kim.
-Mr Kim.

228
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,760
-Mr Kim?
-Hey.

229
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,200
I can't believe you guys
the more I think about it.

230
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,680
-Especially you, Tae-kwon.
-Yes?

231
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,600
Are you my friend or theirs?

232
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,400
How could you suspect me and spy on me?

233
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,840
-I didn't have a choice.
-He didn't do anything wrong.

234
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,240
It's us who overreacted.

235
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,840
Bok-ju was sad that
she couldn't get a hold of you,

236
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,640
so I lost my temper.

237
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,760
I'm sorry for being thoughtless.
It's because we're her friends.

238
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm sorry, too, for overreacting.

239
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,240
I understand. Just make sure
you keep it a secret from Bok-ju.

240
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm not sure if I'm doing
the right thing,

241
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,480
but this is what her father wants.

242
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,120
We should respect his wish.

243
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,240
-Okay, I got it.
-Don't worry. We won't tell.

244
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,000
I won't see Bok-ju anyway.

245
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,480
Our friendship is over after this year.

246
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,200
I love you, Joon-hyung.

247
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Finally. Why is it so difficult
to get a hold of you?

248
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,240
I'm sorry. We kept missing each other.

249
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
-Where are you?
-I'm at the gym.

250
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,400
Are you in the dormitory?

251
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,760
Are you training a lot these days?

252
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,760
You seem busier than me
even though I'm in Taereung.

253
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
I'm busy with training.

254
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,600
Lately, I've been busy with many things.

255
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,480
Things like what?

256
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
What?

257
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,880
I'm just saying.

258
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,720
What could I be busy with?

259
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,880
You're so wishy-washy.

260
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,360
Is it because you don't like me anymore?

261
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,120
Bok-ju, come here for a minute.

262
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Okay, someone is calling me.
I'll call you later.

263
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,560
Bok-ju.

264
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,960
Chubs

265
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,240
We only talked for a minute.

266
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,240
I miss you more after hearing your voice.

267
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,560
I miss you, Bok-ju.

268
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,760
I miss you like crazy, Bok-ju.

269
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,840
Let's focus.

270
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,960
The competition is coming up.
Let's focus.

271
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,960
What's wrong, Bok-ju? Is your back okay?

272
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,040
I think I hurt my back.

273
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,720
Your back keeps getting in the way.
Your competition is coming up soon.

274
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,400
Let me see it.

275
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,480
-Does this hurt?
-It's okay, I can endure the pain.

276
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,280
No, it's not good.

277
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,760
You can't continue like this.

278
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,280
It's better that you get treated first.

279
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,880
There's a place called
Dr Park's Hospital.

280
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,960
They specialise in injuries for
athletes, so go there for treatment.

281
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,560
Get some rest at home,
and come back tomorrow.

282
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,240
I give you my permission.

283
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,960
-Are you serious, Coach?
-Yes.

284
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,960
You need to get in better shape.
You can't compete with a bad back.

285
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,880
Thank you, I'll go get treated.

286
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,560
It must go straight up.

287
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,120
There it is.

288
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,560
It was a success.

289
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,400
Oh, Tae-kwon?

290
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,360
What's up, Tae-kwon?

291
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,160
-What are you doing?
-I'm watching competition videos.

292
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,720
What is it?

293
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,080
I'm not working today.

294
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,800
Do you want to see a movie with me?

295
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,680
A movie sounds good. Just a moment.

296
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,880
-I'll ask Nan-hee when she's back...
-Wait, don't ask her.

297
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's go without her.

298
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,360
I want to go with you.

299
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,200
Are you surprised
that I asked you out for a movie?

300
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,080
No.

301
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,080
I think I'm more surprised that
you're talking to me casually now.

302
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,440
Then shall I go back to talking politely?

303
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,360
You don't need to do that.

304
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
I'm sure I'll get used to it soon.

305
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,840
-Hey, guys!
-Gosh.

306
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,040
Where were you, Nan-hee? My gosh.

307
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,360
-Hi, Nan-hee.
-Hi.

308
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,760
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

309
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,480
This doctor is really good.
The tension is gone.

310
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,120
Nice. I'm free from the pain now.

311
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,200
Would Joon-hyung be done now?

312
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,680
I should go home first.

313
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,480
Then, I should call Dad.

314
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,520
Hey, Bok-ju.

315
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,160
Hi, Uncle. Where's Dad?

316
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,960
Well, he's in the bathroom.

317
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,160
I think he has diarrhoea or something.

318
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,880
Really? What did he eat?

319
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,880
Uncle, I got a day off
to get treatment for my lower back.

320
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
If I take a taxi,
I can be home in 20 minutes.

321
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
What did you just say?
You're coming home now?

322
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,400
Okay. All right, Bok-ju.
I left something on the stove.

323
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Yes, okay. I have to go. Bye.

324
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,120
What do we do? She's on her way home now.

325
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,000
-What if she sees the sign?
-We have no choice.

326
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,960
-We should go home now.
-You'll hurt yourself.

327
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
We're already doomed.

328
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,960
She'll be there in 20 minutes.
It'll take at least an hour for us.

329
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,280
What should we do, then?
If she finds out,

330
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,080
she'll cry her eyes out and go crazy.

331
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Hold on. Let's calm down
and try to collect our thoughts.

332
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,720
We have to stop her
from going home, right?

333
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,400
-What about her friends?
-Right, her friends.

334
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,360
-Shall I ask them to snatch her?
-Yes, call them now.

335
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
-You should use your phone.
-Oh, right. My phone is here.

336
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,360
The seizure procedure has begun. I was...

337
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
a prosecutor in the Special Crimes Unit.

338
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,200
The unit is still filled
with my junior colleagues.

339
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,480
Please trust me...

340
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,000
and sign this power of attorney.

341
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,280
I promise...

342
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,400
you'll get your money back.

343
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,080
It's so funny.

344
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,960
That's way too light.

345
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Hi, Uncle.

346
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
I'm at the gym. What's up?

347
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Sorry?

348
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,720
Bok-ju is what?

349
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,960
My home sweet home, Bok Chicken!

350
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,440
Kim Bok-ju is back. I'm home.

351
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,480
Bok-ju! Bok-ju, Bok-ju!

352
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Joon-hyung!

353
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,840
-How did you know that I'm here?
-What?

354
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,080
I didn't know. I was coming here
to eat fried chicken when I saw you.

355
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,760
This must be what people call telepathy.

356
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
We must really be meant to be.

357
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,320
It is pretty cool. Let's go in together.

358
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Hey! Bok-ju.

359
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,600
-I missed you so much.
-What's the matter with you?

360
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,480
Hey, did you do something wrong?
Is that why you're acting like this?

361
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,680
What are you talking about?
I just missed you so much.

362
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,360
Hey, let's go. We should go
eat something delicious.

363
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,440
How about we go for barbecue?

364
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,960
Okay. Let me say a quick hi
to my dad before we go.

365
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,360
Hey! You can do that later.

366
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,440
I'm starving right now.
Let's go eat meat. It's on me.

367
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,640
Turn around!

368
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Go.

369
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,120
Hurry up now.

370
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,440
I'm not sure why I have to eat
fried chicken here,

371
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,120
but I guess knowing my enemy
isn't a bad thing. Let's eat.

372
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes, exactly. Eat up.

373
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
It looks like you've lost
a bit of weight.

374
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,320
-I've gained weight.
-I haven't seen you in so long.

375
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,080
How have you been, Chubs?

376
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,680
You're asking that just now?

377
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,720
-I've been great. Are we good now?
-Do you have to talk like that?

378
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,040
You haven't seen your darling here
in such a long time.

379
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,320
My darling? Whatever.

380
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,480
Hey, be honest with me.

381
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,960
What are you up to these days?

382
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,040
Have you been partying and
hanging out with girls like crazy?

383
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Do you think I'm crazy?
I know you'll kill me if I do that.

384
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,400
-So you didn't do that?
-Of course not.

385
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,360
I have to go to the bathroom.

386
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,160
Hello, Uncle. Go ahead.

387
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,160
How did it go with Bok-ju?

388
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,680
I'm making sure
she can't go anywhere. Don't worry.

389
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,000
My gosh. Thanks so much, Joon-hyung.

390
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,960
I think we'll be home
in about 20 minutes.

391
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,520
Stall her for another 30 minutes, okay?

392
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,120
Okay, I will. Please don't worry.
I'll do my best to keep Bok-ju here.

393
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,960
Please be careful.

394
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay, I should go now. All right.

395
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,360
Weren't you going to the bathroom?
Why are you taking a call here?

396
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,960
I was feeling a little claustrophobic,

397
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,840
so I wanted to get some fresh air.

398
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,640
-Who called you?
-What? It's someone you don't know.

399
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,760
Hey, let's go eat.
The chicken will get cold.

400
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,120
Come on. Let's go.

401
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,560
Goodness.

402
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,280
Who was it? Why can't you tell me?

403
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,760
It's not that I can't tell you.
It's just someone you don't know.

404
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,000
So who is it? I'm sure
that person has a name. Tell me.

405
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,720
You don't know him.

406
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,800
His name is Seung-jin.
He's my friend from high school.

407
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,560
Friend? Do you usually talk
that politely to your friends?

408
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,440
You must have huge respect for him.

409
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,040
Hey, when did I talk like that?

410
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,120
You misheard me.

411
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,560
We haven't seen each other forever.
Why are you trying to pick a fight?

412
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,480
It wasn't a friend, right?
It must be a girl.

413
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,280
What are you talking about?
Why are you so suspicious of me?

414
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,520
It's because you're acting suspiciously!

415
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,560
Give me your phone. Show me his name.

416
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
What are you doing now?

417
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,560
Goodness gracious.
How dare you glare at me.

418
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,600
You're only increasing my suspicion.
Give it to me.

419
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,040
-Stop it.
-You said you did nothing wrong.

420
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,280
Show me his name. Give it to me.

421
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,520
What is wrong with you?
Don't you trust me?

422
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,440
Okay. I was out of line.

423
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,200
I've been on edge because
of my training. Let's not fight.

424
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,160
Yes. Why are you suspicious of me?

425
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,360
I have never even looked at other girls.

426
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,600
Trust me.

427
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,400
Hey. Hey! Give it back.

428
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,000
-Who is this person?
-Hey, give it back to me now.

429
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,880
Hey, stop.

430
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,760
Give it back!

431
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,760
Give it back.

432
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,960
I know that we're dating, but we
must respect each other's privacy.

433
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,640
Going through your boyfriend's phone...

434
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,160
is such a mannerless thing to do.

435
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,800
Privacy? Mannerless?

436
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,000
Wow! You're so intelligent.

437
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,200
I don't know what privacy or manner is,
so I'll just leave you alone.

438
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,400
Have fun with your new girlfriend. Bye!

439
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,120
Hey, wait. Hey!

440
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,800
Bok-ju.

441
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,960
Oh, I have to pay.

442
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,720
Hey, Bok-ju. Wait up!

443
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,280
What is the matter with you?
It's nothing to get angry about.

444
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,960
Right. I'm getting worked up
over nothing, aren't I?

445
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,240
I'm overreacting and have trust issues.
Let's say it's all my fault!

446
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
Hey, why are you talking like that?

447
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,960
We haven't seen each other forever.
Let's make up.

448
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,640
Exactly. I didn't want
to be like this, too,

449
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,200
but I can't stop feeling angry.

450
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,760
My lower back is killing me, but
I was still so excited...

451
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,800
to see you and Dad like an idiot!

452
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,440
I really didn't think
you'd do this to me.

453
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,440
Hey, Kim Bok-ju.

454
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,640
Gosh, I can't even tell her the truth.

455
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Has it been 30 minutes? Goodness.

456
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,880
He doesn't love me as much anymore.
What a jerk.

457
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,600
He used to be so sweet to me.
We weren't even apart for that long.

458
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,960
Fine. The world is wide
and there are many pretty girls.

459
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,000
What a jerk.

460
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,600
Bok Chicken

461
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,920
Dad! Uncle!

462
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,800
-What are you doing, Uncle?
-What?

463
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,640
Hey, Bok-ju. You're here.

464
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,880
Is your back okay now?
Did you get it treated?

465
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,480
I feel much better after going to
the hospital the coach recommended.

466
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,000
Why are you wearing a mask?
Did you catch a cold?

467
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,680
I might give it to the customers.
It's just a prevention.

468
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,120
Be careful, Dad. They say
the flu this winter is really bad.

469
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Why are you sweating so much, Uncle?
Did you go somewhere?

470
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,480
I think I've become poor in health.
I sweat so much these days.

471
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,600
I guess my andropause started early.

472
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,840
You should get married soon.

473
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,480
Uncle.

474
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,600
-What are you doing?
-It's a prevention.

475
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,480
Why are you cleaning
the fire extinguisher?

476
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,200
To prevent fire.

477
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,000
-Bok-ju!
-Bok-ju!

478
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,880
What are you doing here, guys?
How did you know I was here?

479
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,320
-What's going on?
-We just came to eat chicken...

480
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,120
when we heard your voice.

481
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,640
We just have telepathic
connections, don't we?

482
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,560
-We're awesome.
-Awesome.

483
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
All right.

484
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,680
Why does everyone keep talking
about telepathy?

485
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,960
Bok-ju, I missed you.

486
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,200
-Did you?
-Welcome back.

487
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,880
You eat chicken without me now.

488
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,240
Dr Go. He's late today.

489
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,760
Maybe he's busy.

490
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,480
I'm not waiting for him.

491
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,280
I didn't say you were.

492
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,360
Should we go home first?

493
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,880
Of course.
I'm going to go home soon, too.

494
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,320
-I just want to see some documents.
-Okay.

495
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
Ah-young!

496
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,720
A seminar suddenly came up.

498
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,800
I came as soon as it ended,

499
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,480
but I'm a little late.

500
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,960
I drove really fast
so I wouldn't keep you waiting.

501
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,880
I wasn't waiting for you.

502
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
-I just had many patients today.
-Is that so?

503
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
I guess I was happy over nothing.

504
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Have you had dinner?

505
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,640
Of course. I ate with the nurses.
What time do you think it is now?

506
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
You're still going to eat with me, right?

507
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,040
I rushed all the way here.

508
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,960
All right.

509
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,920
You did come all the way here. I can't
tell you to go back without eating.

510
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,080
Let's go, then.

511
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,680
Here. Eat up.

512
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,160
They make delicious food here.

513
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,560
I couldn't finish my dinner
because I got a patient.

514
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,680
I'm sure.

515
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,720
Eat up. I didn't say anything.

516
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,880
By the way, I think we've been
to almost every restaurant here.

517
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
Well...

518
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,680
I guess you're right.

519
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,440
I wanted to buy you
something more delicious,

520
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,320
but I don't know this neighbourhood well.

521
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,400
So I searched the Internet
for good restaurants around here.

522
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,760
There is...

523
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,760
a very famous place that
makes squid bulgogi.

524
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,240
There's also a popular samgyetang
restaurant in the suburb.

525
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,680
The drumsticks look good.

526
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,080
We can go for rice with wraps, too.
You like that, right?

527
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,560
Gosh. Look at these pictures.

528
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,800
Look. What do you think?

529
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,360
What do you say we eat it next time?

530
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,480
I should go.

531
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,080
I have some more work to do.
Enjoy your dinner. Bye.

532
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Ah-young.

533
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,040
Ah-young. Hang on.

534
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,960
Here you go.

535
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,320
-Please keep the change. Ah-young!
-Thank you.

536
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,640
Ah-young, what's wrong?

537
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,160
Did I make a mistake again?

538
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,160
Yes. You did.

539
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,920
I moved here to avoid you.
I wanted to be away from you.

540
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
But these days,

541
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,400
I find myself waiting for you
every evening.

542
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,200
I feel like I'm developing
a crush on you all over again.

543
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,000
It scares me and I hate it.

544
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,640
So don't come out here again.

545
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,160
I won't eat with you anymore.

546
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,480
A Seoul without you...

547
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,280
is too lonely. I hate it.

548
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,720
So, don't tell me not to come.

549
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,840
What did you...

550
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,560
mean by the things you just said?

551
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,040
Do you...

552
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
like Messi?

553
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,960
That's a lousy way of
proposing to someone.

554
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
I know.

555
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,680
No, not that.

556
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,880
My goodness. Here.

557
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,080
-Get it yourself. You're so lazy.
-Just eat this.

558
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,200
-I can't reach it.
-Gosh.

559
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,120
Who is it? Why aren't you answering?

560
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,440
Who is it? Isn't that Joon-hyung?

561
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,280
-Why aren't you answering?
-I don't care. I hate him.

562
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,760
What's wrong? You two were madly in love.

563
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,360
-Are you fed up with him already?
-Whatever.

564
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,200
I guess all men are the same.

565
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,960
The moment you loosen their leash,
they start getting ideas.

566
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,960
Bok Chicken

567
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Gosh. She must be really mad at me.

568
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,480
We don't have much time to be together.
Please pick up already, Bok-ju.

569
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,720
The person you're trying to reach
is not available.

570
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,240
Bok Chicken

571
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,000
What are you doing here?

572
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,920
Hello, Sir.

573
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,320
Why were you waiting outside in the cold?

574
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,360
If she didn't pick up,

575
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,160
you should've just gone home.

576
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,080
Thank you for the drink.

577
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,040
Are you feeling okay?

578
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,000
Of course. It's not like I'm dying.

579
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,200
Why is Bok-ju mad at you?
What did you do?

580
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,800
I didn't do anything. She just
misunderstood about something.

581
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,200
-It's nothing big.
-Is that right?

582
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,960
Anyway, thank you for helping me today.

583
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,720
-Did you say you are a swimmer?
-Yes.

584
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
How good are you?

585
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,400
I won second place
in the last national qualifier.

586
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,600
You should've won the first place.

587
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,440
-Do you have both of your parents?
-Yes.

588
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,000
They run a pharmacy together.

589
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,720
They're actually my aunt and uncle.

590
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,480
My dad died when I was little
and my mum remarried,

591
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,960
so I grew up in my uncle's house.

592
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,600
But I've been well-loved by them.
I never felt like anything was missing.

593
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,280
I've never heard someone say
he's been well-loved himself.

594
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,480
By the way, why do you like Bok-ju?

595
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,320
She just...

596
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,360
...feels warm.

597
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,560
She's warm with her friends,

598
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,680
when she is with you and her uncle,

599
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,880
and also when she lifts weights.

600
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Somehow, ever since she was little,
Bok-ju just makes your heart warm.

601
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,480
I guess.

602
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,400
She takes after me
in that she's very friendly.

603
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,920
That's right. Bok-ju is just like you.

604
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,720
Don't laugh, you brat.

605
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,480
I know you're lying.

606
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,800
You're quite cheeky, you rascal.

607
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,280
Goodness.

608
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,800
Bok-ju, hurry up and go.

609
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,640
-You're on the national team now.
-I'm going.

610
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,120
Just go already. I hope the rest
of your training goes well.

611
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,520
Watch your back as well.

612
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,520
I hope you'll get over your cold soon.

613
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,640
Uncle, work harder
and let him rest, okay?

614
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,280
I know. Don't worry and just go.
A national athlete shouldn't be late.

615
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,480
Fine, I'm going.
Why are you so eager to send me away?

616
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,160
I'll call you. I love you. I love you.

617
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,880
Okay. I'll see you later.

618
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,400
-We should hurry.
-Okay.

619
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,360
Closed due to personal reasons

620
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,280
I always forget to bring
my extra battery.

621
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,160
What? Why is it closed?

622
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,600
Where did they disappear to so quickly?

623
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,360
Bok-ju, long time no see.

624
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,680
-Hello.
-Hello.

625
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,680
I heard you went to Taereung.
Are you visiting home?

626
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,160
By the way,
when is your father's surgery?

627
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
Pardon? His surgery?

628
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,920
My gosh, it's Bok-ju again.

629
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,000
Why does she keep calling me?

630
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,600
My Bok-ju, did you get back safely?

631
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,280
Where are you right now?

632
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Where else? The restaurant, of course.

633
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,680
Now that you've left again,
it feels so empty here.

634
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,080
Really? You're really at the restaurant?

635
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,160
Yes, I am.

636
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,880
Is this the restaurant?

637
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,280
Yes, this is the restaurant.

638
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,560
Your voice sounds so clear.

639
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,240
I swear. I was going to tell you...

640
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,040
right after your competition. Honest.

641
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,840
I told him not to tell you...

642
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,800
...in case you can't focus.

643
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,600
It's your
first international competition.

644
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,480
If you ruin it because of me,

645
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,720
I'd regret it all my life.

646
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,080
Don't be angry, Bok-ju.

647
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,440
I'm not angry.

648
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,400
When I heard your weak voice...

649
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,840
and saw you wearing a mask,
I should have noticed it.

650
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
No matter how much I try to hide it,

651
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,360
you'd know if I'm sick or in a bad mood.

652
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,360
I'm nowhere near that.

653
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,600
That's because I'm your parent.

654
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Dad.

655
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,640
I'll do well.

656
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,360
I'll win the gold medal
and put it around your neck,

657
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,600
so stay strong and
get through the surgery, okay?

658
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,880
I believe in you, Dad.

659
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,560
Yes, believe in me.

660
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,080
Just believe me.

661
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,600
If you win the gold medal,

662
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,080
you should treat Joon-hyung to a meal.

663
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,120
He helped take care of your dad,
and even stalled you yesterday.

664
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,880
He's done a lot.

665
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,240
Indoor Swimming Pool

666
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,520
Bok-ju, what are you doing here?
Didn't you go back?

667
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,440
I'm very thoughtless.

668
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,080
I'm self-centred
and not understanding at all.

669
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,280
I don't deserve you as my boyfriend.

670
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,160
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

671
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,000
I think so.

672
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,800
I believed what my senior athletes
said without proof...

673
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,080
when you have done so much for my dad.

674
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,280
Please hit me. I deserve it.

675
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,160
Stop it. It will hurt.

676
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,280
I tried to keep it a secret,
but you found out.

677
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,240
I'm really sorry.

678
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,080
I'm worried because you're too handsome.

679
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,400
On top of that, you're tall...

680
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,320
and have a great personality
that any woman would fall for.

681
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,080
-What else?
-Your hands are warm,

682
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,320
and you're good at swimming and kissing.

683
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,120
-What else?
-There's nothing more.

684
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,080
How did you find out? Are things
okay between you and your dad?

685
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,000
Let's go before it gets late.
I'll take you to Taereung.

686
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,800
We're already here.

687
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,680
-I thought Taereung was farther.
-I know.

688
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,920
It seemed far when I travelled alone.

689
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,520
Bok-ju, look at me.

690
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,480
Look me in the eyes.

691
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,840
Can you see that I'm completely into you?

692
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,080
I don't know about a million years
from now, but I won't cheat on you now.

693
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,920
Don't worry and
focus on your training, okay?

694
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,400
Don't worry about your dad's surgery.

695
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,040
I'll stay with him and
do my best to take care of him...

696
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,000
...as if I were you.

697
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,800
Do you trust me?

698
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,280
Yes, I do.

699
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,800
Okay, go in.

700
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,800
Concentrate only on your training
and nothing else, okay?

701
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,400
You better win the gold medal.
Otherwise...

702
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,240
-Otherwise?
-I'll hug you.

703
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,840
Don't feel pressured.
There will always be another chance.

704
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,800
Okay, you should leave first.

705
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,600
No, you go in first.

706
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,640
-Come on, you leave first.
-No, you go in first.

707
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Go.

708
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,480
Go on.

709
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,800
What are you doing? Go.

710
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,880
See you.

711
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,040
Go on.

712
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,640
See you.

713
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,280
See you.

714
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,280
Breathe, and get ready.

715
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,880
That was good this time.

716
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Pay attention to your legs.

717
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,360
That's right. Hold it. Good job.

718
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,960
Bok-ju.

719
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,600
Sausages at the convenience store
remind me of you.

720
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,840
I broke my unofficial records today.
I'll catch up to you soon.

721
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,600
Work hard today.
You don't have to respond.

722
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,600
How to make salt compress for back pain.

723
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,800
Wrap roasted salt in a towel.

724
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
Apply on affected areas
for 30 minutes twice a day.

725
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,920
It's more effective than heat pads.

726
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,960
Bok-ju, your dad is in good condition.

727
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,280
He'll get the surgery as scheduled.

728
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,200
There's only one day left to D-Day.
I'll make a wish on your behalf.

729
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,440
The World Weightlifting Championship

730
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,880
-If you're ready, let's go.
-Okay.

731
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,880
Bok-ju, you can do this.

732
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,680
You're not alone right now.

733
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,280
There are many people who love you
and cheer for you.

734
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,480
Don't be nervous.

735
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,800
Keep up what you've been doing.

736
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,840
No matter what anyone says,
you'll be a world champion.

737
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,960
Kim Bok-ju.

738
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,360
You can do it. It'll come true.
Let's do it.

739
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,320
Operation Centre

740
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,200
Operation Room

741
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,000
The surgery went well.

742
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,880
His vital signs are normal.

743
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,120
We'll transfer him to the recovery
room and keep an eye on him.

744
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,320
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

745
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,960
Thank you, Doctor.

746
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,360
When does the championship start?

747
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,040
It's starting soon.

748
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,480
Clean and Jerk.

749
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,920
There's Bok-ju.

750
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,800
-Bok-ju, you can do it.
-Let's go, Bok-ju.

751
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,200
Republic of Korea.

752
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,440
Kim Bok-ju.

753
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,560
Third attempt.

754
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,920
Please.

755
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,720
She did it.

756
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,560
That means she won, right?

757
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,920
Yes, she'll get the gold medal.

758
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,840
Good job, Bok-ju.

759
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,880
Thank you.

760
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,480
Gold medal.

761
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,200
Great job!

762
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,600
Gold Medal Winner of 2017
World Weightlifting Championships

763
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,320
Weightlifting Fairy, Kim Bok-ju

764
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Gold Medal Winner of 2017
World Weightlifting Championships

765
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,440
Gosh, I'm so proud of you.

766
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,480
Thanks.

767
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,200
Thank you so much.

768
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,220
Korea

769
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,080
My shoulder is killing me.
I'm sick of getting treatment for it.

770
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,920
No pain, no gain. It's just part of
your journey towards the gold medal.

771
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,800
Goodness. Talk like a know-it-all
after you get out of being a reserve.

772
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,640
Isn't your graduation ceremony today?
Don't you have to get going?

773
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,880
-What time is it?
-Gosh, I forgot!

774
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,720
Bok-ju will get mad at me again.

775
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,400
Ki-seok, I have to go.

776
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,080
-Let's catch up later.
-Go on.

777
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,960
-Watch out for the cars!
-Okay!

778
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,600
Haneol Sport University
Graduation Ceremony

779
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,440
Thank you to the alumni for coming
and attending the graduation ceremony.

780
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,120
And graduates,

781
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,800
your lives begin now, okay?

782
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,520
Dew drops can form an ocean
when they come together, don't they?

783
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,320
So in other words...

784
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,400
-What's the saying?
-"Trees can form a mountain."

785
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,280
Oh, that's right. Give me a high-five.

786
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,760
Gosh, they have matching rings!

787
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,400
-Oh, my!
-Goodness!

788
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,200
-My gosh.
-That's so sweet.

789
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,480
-I'm jealous.
-You two look lovely together.

790
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,680
Thanks, guys.

791
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,760
Anyway,

792
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,440
one of you...

793
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,000
got into the national team.

794
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,800
Some of you joined
semi-professional teams.

795
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,200
Yes.

796
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,680
Some of you are embarking
on completely new paths.

797
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,400
Anyhow,

798
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,200
let's not forget about...

799
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,800
our times together.

800
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,080
Call me whenever you're stressed out.

801
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,200
Coach Choi and I...

802
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,600
will always be here for you.

803
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,120
-Thank you, Head Coach.
-Thank you, Head Coach.

804
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,040
Congratulations on your graduation.

805
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,600
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

806
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,200
Weightlifter Yoon Jin-hee

807
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,240
Bok-ju.

808
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,800
Hey, Ye-bin.

809
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,480
Thanks for putting up with us
all these years.

810
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,440
Just thanking us isn't enough.

811
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,880
Don't think we'll go easy on you.

812
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,760
You must do what you have
to do before you leave.

813
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,760
All right. Time for
the highlight of the graduation day!

814
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,880
The weightlifting team's fashion show
begins now!

815
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,760
-Go, Nan-hee!
-Nice!

816
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,280
Bravo!

817
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,600
Please give it up for our
weightlifting fairy, Kim Bok-ju!

818
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,840
Go, Bok-ju.

819
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,520
-You're so awesome!
-Kim Bok-ju!

820
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,480
-Bok-ju!
-Hey, go stand in front of it.

821
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,120
Hey, why are you...

822
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,920
Gosh, you guys can't take anything pink.

823
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,560
-Snatch it.
-I got it!

824
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,080
Let go!

825
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,080
Her shoes. Grab her shoes.

826
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,640
-No!
-We got it!

827
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,840
No. Who took my socks?

828
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,800
-Hey, grab her!
-Come here!

829
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,680
Hey, get her.

830
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,880
-Snatch it.
-Gosh!

831
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,440
I got her shoe!

832
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,280
-Hey!
-Get back here!

833
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,120
Danger! Keep Out

834
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,960
-Guys!
-Joon-hyung.

835
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,880
-Joon-hyung.
-Joon-hyung, come on.

836
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,960
Guys, take his clothes off.

837
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,360
-Take it.
-I thought you guys were going out.

838
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,960
-Lift him.
-Wait! I'll give you guys money.

839
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,120
The graduation ceremony
will begin shortly.

840
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,600
Let's get this over with, okay?

841
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,880
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

842
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,160
Salute!

843
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,080
Sergeant Cho Tae-kwon is here
to attend the graduation ceremony!

844
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,800
-Just in time.
-Help me, Tae-kwon!

845
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,280
You wish. Let's do this, guys!

846
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,520
No, no. Guys, please.

847
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,320
No. No! Gosh!

848
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,600
-In one, two, three.
-In one, two, three.

849
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,200
Bok-ju!

850
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,680
Oh, hello!

851
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,960
-Hello.
-Hi.

852
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,880
This is Bok-ju's dad,
and this is her uncle.

853
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

854
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,720
These are Joon-hyung's parents.

855
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,280
This is his brother,
and she's his fiancée.

856
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,280
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm Kim Chang-geol.

857
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,160
Thank you for those vitamins
you sent me. They're great.

858
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,800
It's nothing compared to all
the fried chicken you've sent us.

859
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,600
They're so delicious.

860
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,680
You're a master of fried chicken.

861
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,360
To be honest, I deep-fry
70 percent of our fried chicken.

862
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,240
Please visit our restaurant.
I'll close it for the day...

863
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,120
and make as much
fried chicken as you want.

864
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,440
Then we'll give you
red ginseng drink in return.

865
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,160
Please visit our pharmacy.

866
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,160
It looks as if you two
are getting engaged.

867
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,640
Congratulations.

868
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,200
You got me a gift, right?

869
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,640
Congratulations, Bok-ju.

870
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,800
Congratulations on
setting your wedding date.

871
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,200
-Congratulations, Dr Go.
-Thanks.

872
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,920
You'll need to help me out
when we become sisters-in-law.

873
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,480
You know how clumsy I am, right?

874
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,080
Gosh, stop it.

875
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,400
Here, Bok-ju.

876
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,880
-Thank you.
-Joon-hyung, here.

877
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,240
Dad, smell these flowers.

878
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,280
-Bok-ju.
-Bok-ju, let's take photos.

879
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,600
Hello, everyone.

880
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,040
I, Sergeant Cho Tae-kwon,
will be your photographer today.

881
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,160
Hello, hello.

882
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,880
Shall we start with Joon-hyung's family?

883
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,080
All right. Please stand right there.
I'll take a few photos.

884
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,080
In one, two, three.

885
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,160
I guess I won't be able
to come here after today.

886
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,480
I can probably buy 100 chickens
with all the change I threw here.

887
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,560
Thanks to it,
you achieved all of your dreams.

888
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,400
You joined the national team
and even got a boyfriend.

889
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,360
A handsome boyfriend.

890
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,480
What are you saying?

891
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,280
You don't think I'm handsome?

892
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,880
Fine. I'll give it to you as
your graduation gift. You're handsome.

893
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,360
So many things happened on this campus
in the last four years.

894
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,880
I trained hard...

895
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,280
and ate a lot with Nan-hee and Seon-ok.

896
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,760
We spent so much time together, too.

897
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,800
I think I'll miss this place a lot, too.

898
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:00,440
I ran so hard here
and even had to drag tires around it.

899
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,720
When do you have to go back
to Taereung tomorrow?

900
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,280
-Do you think you'll get on the match?
-I think so.

901
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,880
One of the senior members has a
shoulder injury, so I'll probably...

902
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,720
Listen to you. That's awesome!

903
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,360
Do you want to bet on who will win
more medals at the Tokyo Olympics?

904
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,200
-How about 100 dollars? Are you in?
-Hey, 100 dollars is too little.

905
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,880
It should be 1,000 dollars at least.

906
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,760
Besides, I'll be more famous than you
after the Olympics.

907
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,280
Do you want my autograph?

908
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,440
My gosh. Just make sure I'll be able
to see you in Japan.

909
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,840
Bok-ju.

910
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,240
If I win a gold medal this time,

911
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,680
will you marry me?

912
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,720
I'll get pension.

913
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,600
I'll take care of you.

914
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,680
I'll think about it.

915
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,720
But shouldn't you train hard
if you want to win a gold medal?

916
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,600
With that said, let's run together.

917
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,640
Why would you want to run
on our graduation day? No way.

918
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,360
You big slacker.

919
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,880
Your body will stiffen
if you slack off even just a day.

920
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,880
-Let's run.
-No.

921
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,080
-Let's run.
-I said no.

922
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,000
I won't marry you.

923
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,200
Hey. What do you mean you won't marry me?

924
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,880
If you say that,
now I have no choice but to run.

925
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,480
I won't marry you.

926
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,240
Hurry up.

927
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,280
Hug me.

928
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,840
Everyone has their youthful years.

929
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,040
It's a brightly sparkling time...

930
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,600
made more beautiful
because of our immaturity.

931
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,640
We're not afraid because
we have nothing to lose,

932
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,200
and our hearts flutter because
we have endless possibilities.

933
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,720
As a 24-year-old youth,

934
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,640
I'm not complete yet,

935
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,840
but I'm already more than perfect.

936
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,680
