1
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,030
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,830
Hi, Joon-hyung. It's me.

3
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,670
Tell me. What should I tell Dr Jeong?

4
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,250
Hey. What are you up to?

5
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,750
Why do you keep calling
and seeing Joon-hyung?

6
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,230
I heard you like someone else.

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,570
Why are you making passes at Joon-hyung?

8
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,830
Making passes?
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,420
I was the one who left
your diet journal at the gym.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,540
What?

11
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,330
What did you just say?

12
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,830
Are you saying that...

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,580
...you put my diet journal there
on purpose?

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,580
Yes, I'm the one who did it.

15
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,830
Why?

16
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,910
Why would you do that?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,870
I was annoyed and upset
that you're so close to Joon-hyung.

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,080
What?

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,290
-I can't believe this.
-That's right.

20
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,710
I told you that I want to get back
together with him.

21
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,370
Didn't you know that was a warning?

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,420
Whenever I want to be with him,
you're always with him.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,290
You said you like someone else.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,210
Are you dating around?

25
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,540
Listen here.

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,910
I don't date around.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,750
And I have no intention
of dating Joon-hyung at all!

28
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,910
Besides, he doesn't find me attractive.

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,960
Why would he like me
when he's so popular?

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,160
Then...

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,330
-was it my misunderstanding?
-Yes, it was.

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,420
Shouldn't you apologise to me
before bringing that up?

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,160
No, I don't want to apologise.

34
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,750
Joon-hyung hurt my feelings
because of you.

35
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,210
It's not me but you, yourself.

36
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,750
Gosh, you're so aggressive.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,830
Now I know why Joon-hyung dislikes
you and doesn't want you back.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,960
You're two-faced.

39
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,330
What do you know?

40
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,910
You don't know anything
about my relationship with him.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,670
You're right. I don't know.
I'm not interested either.

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,500
Now let me go.
I don't want to talk to you

43
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,910
I'll sleep somewhere else.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,120
It was serious between us.
That's why Joon-hyung was hurt.

45
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,000
Whatever, just let me go!

46
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,330
Hey, hey.

47
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,750
Let go of me now!

48
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,750
How dare you trivialise
our relationship? How dare you?

49
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,420
I'm the one who should be angry.
Let me go!

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,790
My gosh, you're unbelievable!

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,910
Seon-ok, how long
are you going to stay upset?

52
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,620
Like I said, I wasn't
trying to exclude you.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,330
I only found out a few days ago.

54
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,000
Let me sleep here tonight.

55
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,910
What brings you here?

56
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,040
Why don't you sleep in your own room?

57
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,080
I can't think clearly right now.

58
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,420
I'll ask for a room change
when one becomes available.

59
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,910
Let me stay here until then.

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,580
Goodness, did you fight with Si-ho?

61
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,710
Did you punch her?

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,250
Why would I? She was
the one who attacked me.

63
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,710
Seon-ok, can't you even say hi to me?

64
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,120
Are you still upset?

65
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,040
Fine, blame everything on me.
Please don't be upset.

66
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,420
Why did you argue with Si-ho? Tell me.

67
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,960
I don't want to talk about it.
What a mess.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,460
Chubs

69
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,120
It's because of me.

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,580
What? So it all happened
because of Si-ho?

71
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,960
That's what I'm saying.

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,750
Seriously,

73
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,120
she's good at making people hate her.

74
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,500
She wasn't even sorry
when she told me about it.

75
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,580
Wow, she's horrible. I should go
and give her a piece of my mind...

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,910
I've done enough. Stay in bed.

77
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,250
I thought she was different
from other gymnasts,

78
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,750
but that's only her being fake.

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,910
She's a gymnast after all. Of course
she wouldn't get along with us.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,420
What did I tell you?

81
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,290
I told you there was
something off about her from the start.

82
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,290
What?

83
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,500
Bok-ju, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I'm terribly sorry.

84
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,580
I'll buy you your favourite meat.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,420
This isn't right.

86
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,830
Okay, let's say she's here.

87
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,620
Hey, I'm sorry.

88
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll buy you meat.

89
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,420
This isn't right either.

90
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Hey.

91
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,080
Why did you call me out at this hour?
What if the housemistress catches us?

92
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,790
It's because...

93
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,910
...the call was suddenly disconnected.

94
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,420
Is something wrong?

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,580
Joon-hyung.

96
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,330
Can you please leave me alone?

97
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,330
I don't want to cause
any misunderstanding, okay?

98
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,910
Did...

99
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,250
...Si-ho tell you?

100
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,420
So she did.

101
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,370
Speaking of which,

102
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,290
she's way too scary,
I don't dare talk to you now.

103
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,010
I'm really sorry about what happened.

104
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,290
You should be sorry.
It's all because of you.

105
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,000
After arguing with Si-ho,
I've been so angry and stressed out.

106
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,620
I'm sorry, Chubs.

107
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,000
Forget it.

108
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,580
Gosh.

109
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,000
Why does she even like you?

110
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm charming in so many ways.

111
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,330
You're making me angrier.

112
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,330
Hey!

113
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,870
No one's here.

114
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,120
-Did she leave?
-Hold on.

115
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,330
I think so.

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,960
If we get caught like this,
people will misunderstand us.

117
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,820
Your ex-girlfriend might beat you up.

118
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,870
-Be more careful, will you?
-Are you scared of her?

119
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,540
Why would I be scared
of that skinny girl?

120
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm Weightlifting Fairy, Kim Bok-ju.

121
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,210
-This is great.
-What's great about it?

122
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,290
-It's cold. Let's go.
-Not yet. Stay here for a while.

123
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,370
Look, there are many stars
in the sky. Let's watch them.

124
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,420
Aren't they satellites?

125
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,250
There are so many of them.

126
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,000
-They can't all be satellites.
-I guess not.

127
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,080
-Gosh, it's cold.
-I want to go inside.

128
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,500
No, stay a little longer.

129
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,420
-I only have a muffler on me.
-You have me beside you.

130
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,750
At least you're wearing a thick jacket.

131
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,830
-Do you want to share my jacket?
-My goodness. No way.

132
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,710
Stay here a little longer.

133
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,000
-Your nose bridge is so high.
-What?

134
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,670
I'm jealous of you.
My glasses always slide off my nose.

135
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,000
-Why?
-My nose bridge is too low.

136
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,250
Bok-ju.

137
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,210
I can see that...

138
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,120
...you're not so bad-looking yourself.

139
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,080
Are you teasing me?

140
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,160
-Haneol.
-Haneol.

141
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,960
Why are you panting? The jog wasn't long.

142
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,870
And you call yourselves athletes?

143
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,620
-We ran hard.
-We did.

144
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,710
Forget it.

145
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,960
To prepare for next month's competition,

146
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,500
we'll start training
of the highest difficulty level.

147
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,420
Go inside and warm up.

148
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,910
-Go.
-Gosh, how annoying.

149
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,960
-Go in.
-Are you ready?

150
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,250
Hurry inside.

151
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,710
Coach Choi.

152
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,040
Yes?

153
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,830
Don't drink alone from now on.

154
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,210
If you fall into a habit,
you'll become an alcoholic.

155
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,750
I was just tired.

156
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,290
I planned to sleep at home
after two cans of beer.

157
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,120
Let's drink together.

158
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,000
-Are you doing anything tonight?
-Excuse me?

159
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,330
Why?

160
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,790
You don't want to drink with a man
with a pot belly?

161
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,580
I wanted to treat you.

162
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,670
Sure, I'd like that.

163
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,370
Let's go out after the training.

164
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,040
The food stand I told you about
makes good eel dish.

165
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,910
Si-ho.

166
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,370
-Yes?
-Here. It's a present.

167
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,670
I sent the video of
the Moscow competition to your e-mail.

168
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,910
Watch it carefully.

169
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,370
It will help you a lot
for the competition.

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,120
-Keep it up.
-Thank you.

171
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,910
Isn't Coach Seong sly?

172
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,670
After the competition,
she treats Si-ho so differently.

173
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,670
I guess her affection
towards Si-ho came back.

174
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,370
Soo-bin was her favourite for a while.

175
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,790
It won't last long.

176
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,670
Even if you glue back a broken bowl,
it will break again soon.

177
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,080
Why isn't Mum answering her phone?

178
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,830
-Si-eon?
-Si-ho.

179
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,790
-What brings you here?
-Si-ho.

180
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,670
-What is it? Is something wrong?
-I think Mum and Dad...

181
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,500
are getting divorced.

182
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,040
-What?
-They have been fighting a lot.

183
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,370
Dad doesn't come home anymore.

184
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,250
I think they're really
getting divorced this time.

185
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,040
It's okay, Si-eon.

186
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,120
It's okay. Don't cry.
It's going to be okay.

187
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,790
I'll take care of it. It's okay.
Don't cry.

188
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,670
Si-eon told you after all.
I told her not to tell you.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,540
If she hadn't told me,
when were you going to tell me?

190
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,460
After you sign the divorce papers?

191
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,120
Or when you and Dad meet
someone else and get married again?

192
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,830
Were you going to
keep this secret from me forever?

193
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,790
Don't raise your voice.

194
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,960
-People will recognise you.
-What does that matter right now?

195
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,710
I heard you sold our house...

196
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,160
and that Dad has been
a credit delinquent for a while now.

197
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,460
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

198
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,580
Don't worry about our divorce either.

199
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,210
Just focus on your training.

200
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,960
How can I not worry? You're my parents.

201
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,500
-Si-ho.
-I'll quit gymnastics.

202
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,290
I'll start working instead.

203
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,750
Who says you can?
Who says you can quit gymnastics?

204
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,790
Do you think your life is just your own?

205
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,160
Wrong. Your life is a part
of my life, too.

206
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,870
People point their finger at me
and say I exploit my daughter.

207
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,540
I've been fighting
with your dad every day...

208
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,960
and taking all the blames from Si-eon.
What will you do about that?

209
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,370
That has burdened me the most.

210
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,210
The fact that my life is also your life.

211
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,670
Why are you being greedy over my life?

212
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,750
You should've lived your own life better.

213
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,750
Why did you have me
and put me through all this?

214
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,540
Si-ho.

215
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,460
Gosh. Why would you come home
at night and ask me to cook curry?

216
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,670
Come on. I suddenly missed
the curry you make.

217
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,500
Great. I won't be able to marry because
no one makes better curry than you.

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,910
This is your mum's trick.

219
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,790
I'm also a victim.

220
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,620
You should have married a cook, then.

221
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,710
Why did you choose a pharmacist?

222
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Hey. I made a slip of the tongue,
didn't I?

223
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,580
Yes, I think so.

224
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,670
Here she comes.

225
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,910
Gosh, you're so annoying.
Why are you in my seat?

226
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,290
Don't be like that. I was only joking.

227
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,210
Where's my curry?

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,830
You have abdominal obesity.

229
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,040
You're the one who has abdominal obesity.

230
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,120
I deserve to eat the dishes I made.

231
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,910
-I should just keep eating.
-Eat up, dear.

232
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,210
I'll get straight to the result.

233
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,830
-I messed up.
-Why?

234
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:39,290
I thought I'd be okay when I tried to
control my mind through my breathing.

235
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,750
I wasn't.

236
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,210
I need a refund of the counselling fee.

237
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,960
Sorry, I can't do that.
I need to make a living, too.

238
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,750
Listen, I'll buy you a meal.
Don't tell anyone about this.

239
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,870
Why don't we...

240
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,960
think of it as a warm-up exercise
and try to solve it slowly?

241
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,750
I'm sure we'll be able to find
a good solution.

242
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,670
If we can't solve it by this year,
I'll be doomed. I'm getting old.

243
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,870
That's true. You should be
soaring high at this age.

244
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,250
Don't worry. Be happy.

245
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,080
By the way, your mother...

246
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,910
Not the mother you have now,
but your birth mother.

247
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Don't you want to look for her?

248
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,250
No.

249
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,910
I don't want to.

250
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,290
Why? You must have been curious.

251
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,080
She must have reasons for
severing contact with me.

252
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Okay.

253
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,250
Also, I guess I felt bad
for my aunt and uncle.

254
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,500
You think it'd be like betraying them?

255
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,080
My aunt raised me sincerely
with all her heart.

256
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,960
Right. I think I know what you mean.

257
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,370
But I hope...

258
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,710
you will confront that matter squarely.

259
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,330
I'm talking about your resentment
towards your mother...

260
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,330
and your complicated emotions...

261
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,120
towards your uncle's family,
such as gratitude, guilt...

262
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,120
or tiredness from pretending
you don't know the truth.

263
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,080
Those emotions should
burst out at least once.

264
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,910
Only then you'll be completely free
from the trauma you're having.

265
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,580
That's what I think.

266
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,960
I should really call Dr Jeong.

267
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,500
Come on, Seon-ok.

268
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,870
I bought this sausage for you.
Please eat it.

269
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,210
Forget it. I don't want to.

270
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,910
Can you move?

271
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,710
I know I'm a non-person,
but this is still my bed.

272
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,370
Oh, sure.

273
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,250
Seon-ok, can you please stop?

274
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,160
I know you're hurt, but
we didn't exclude you on purpose.

275
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,370
Of course not.

276
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,460
You didn't mean to hurt my feelings,

277
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,290
but I'm being a crybaby.

278
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,960
-That's not what I meant.
-No.

279
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,910
It's all because I'm narrow-minded.

280
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,710
I'm so sorry for
not being understanding...

281
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,080
and not having the personality
that satisfies you.

282
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,910
Hey. Are you going to keep
talking like that?

283
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,290
Gosh, don't raise your voice.
You might start fighting.

284
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,500
She keeps being sarcastic.

285
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,210
I'm disappointed in you, too.

286
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,000
Are you getting mad at me now, Bok-ju?

287
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,370
I'm sad enough as it is.
Do you really have to do this?

288
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,120
Why are you getting angry at
others for your own mistake?

289
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,960
Do you think this is fun for me?

290
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,120
-So just stop it already!
-I tried to, but I just can't.

291
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,210
You're too loud! Fight outside!

292
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,290
Gosh, do you want
the housemistress to kick us out?

293
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,830
Have you guys thought about how I feel?

294
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,500
After I came to Seoul...

295
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,580
and entered this place,
I considered you as my sisters.

296
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,580
But it seems I was deluding myself.

297
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,160
Don't overreact over one incident.
We all feel the same way.

298
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,080
Bok-ju only told me...

299
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,160
because I saw her text message.
She had no choice.

300
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,080
You should've told me
when she got caught by Coach Choi.

301
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,040
You pretended to know nothing...

302
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,910
and told me we should wait
because it must be hard for Bok-ju.

303
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,420
You made me sound like a bad friend.

304
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,790
That's not Nan-hee's fault.
I asked her to keep it a secret.

305
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,870
So why did you make a secret
in the first place?

306
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,250
Do you think I wanted to?

307
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,370
It was hard for me
to keep it a secret, too.

308
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,420
I wanted to tell you all about it
so badly.

309
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,000
But how could I?

310
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,330
Even I knew that I was doing
something ridiculous.

311
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,830
You're my friends,
but I knew you'd hate it.

312
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,460
How could I tell you? It's embarrassing.

313
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,870
Why is it embarrassing? We're friends.

314
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,080
If you told us, we'd understand.
That's what friends are for.

315
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,040
-Is that all we mean to you?
-Seon-ok is right about that.

316
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,960
I thought you'd be disappointed
and think I'm pathetic.

318
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,330
No. I'm sorry. Why are you crying?

319
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,080
It must have been so hard for you.
I feel terrible.

320
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,540
Girls.

321
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,420
I won't keep anything
secret from you again. I promise.

322
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,160
Don't cry. You're making us feel bad.

323
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,670
I told you that my parents run a store.

324
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,500
It's not a store.

325
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,670
It's a motel. I couldn't tell you
because it's embarrassing.

326
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,830
Hey. There's nothing wrong with that.
Why did you hide it?

327
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,040
You wouldn't know...

328
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,460
how it feels to serve drinks and
wet towels to customers at our age.

329
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,790
I'm no better.

330
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I haven't kissed any guy,
let alone have a deep kiss.

331
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,080
-That doesn't matter.
-That's right.

332
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,960
-It doesn't matter at all!
-You can kiss someone later.

333
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,160
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,370
I'm so sorry.

335
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,870
I really didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

336
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,160
I just made up an excuse,

337
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,790
-but things got out of hand.
-Bok-ju. I'm suffocating.

338
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,500
It's hot.

339
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,210
Slow down. You'll have indigestion again.

340
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,870
I've had enteritis,
but I've never had indigestion.

341
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,460
-What is indigestion? Awesome.
-Awesome.

342
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,710
Saying "awesome" with you guys
is the best feeling.

343
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,040
-You want fried rice, right?
-Of course.

344
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,580
-Two bowls?
-I'm hungry. Let's get three.

345
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,120
Excuse me,
give us three bowls of rice, please!

346
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,370
Hey, tomorrow is the weekend.
Shall we party it up today?

347
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,420
-What do you think?
-What will you make us do this time?

348
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,210
Plus, Bok-ju has special training.

349
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,790
Right. You won't get any rest days
for a while, right?

350
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,420
Both Coach Choi and Head Coach Yoon
aren't taking any days off,

351
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,670
so I should do my best.

352
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,040
That's too bad.

353
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,290
Then how about going to karaoke room?

354
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,460
I know that you are super
stressed out because of Si-ho.

355
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,790
Right, that Song Si-ho.

356
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,620
I was trying to pretend
I don't know anything,

357
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,040
-but I want to go teach that fox...
-Hey, don't.

358
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
You don't need dirty blood on your hands.

359
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,120
Let's just eat this
and go to a karaoke room.

360
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,960
I'll pay for the karaoke room!

361
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,290
Let's go.

362
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,580
-Okay.
-So? Shall we have dinner first...

363
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,910
-or just go straight for drinks?
-Let's go for drinks.

364
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,370
We won't have room for drinks
if we have dinner first.

365
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,790
My goodness. How much
are you planning on drinking?

366
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
You're scaring me.

367
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,120
I'm going to be honest with you.

368
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,910
I'm a lightweight compared to you.

369
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,580
Don't say that.

370
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,870
I don't get drunk quickly
only because I try to stay alert.

371
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,790
It sounds like you're implying
that you'll let yourself go today.

372
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,910
-Gosh, I'm terrified.
-That's not what I meant.

373
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,370
Geez, what kind of person
do you think I am...

374
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,710
Yes, Honey.

375
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,710
How did that happen?

376
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,790
I told you not to drive at night.
You're not an experienced driver.

377
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,370
Are you all right?

378
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,620
Okay, I'll be there shortly.

379
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,250
Don't cry.

380
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,210
All right.

381
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,160
-Was that your wife?
-Yes, she got into an accident.

382
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,460
I'm sorry. I should go to her right away.

383
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,250
-Is she seriously injured?
-No, she's not.

384
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,120
I think it scared her.
She gets scared easily.

385
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,960
I'm sorry. I really wanted
to treat you today.

386
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,370
Don't worry. You should get going.

387
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,790
Yes, I better go.

388
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,960
I'll buy you something delicious
next time, okay?

389
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,080
-Hold on, where is my car key?
-In your hand.

390
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,250
Right. See you.

391
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,830
Drive safely.

392
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,000
-Hello!
-Yes, hello.

393
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,790
Why did you come alone?

394
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,120
What's wrong with it?
Am I not allowed to come here alone?

395
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,710
Do I always have to bring people?

396
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,710
It looks like you've already
had a drink or two.

397
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,710
I'll have pupa soup and a bottle of soju.

398
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,040
Sure!

399
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Thank you.

400
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,500
You look a little different today.

401
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,160
-This is...
-My goodness!

402
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,790
Your makeup isn't sitting right.

403
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,000
Your date stood you up, right?

404
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,160
Gosh! I can't believe this.

405
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,000
Aren't I getting my pupa soup?

406
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,420
I just put it on the stove.
I have to heat it up first.

407
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,420
Why does this taste like it's burnt?

408
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
Why are you sitting down?

409
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,500
It's not like I'm sitting on your lap.
This is my chair.

410
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,460
I feel bad that you're drinking solo
and wanted to keep you company...

411
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,210
Are you normally this twisted?

412
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,500
Are you normally this nosy?

413
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,710
Listen to you.
You always have to win, don't you?

414
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,790
Don't drink too much, seriously.

415
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,790
I usually drink until I drop.

416
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,710
Whatever.

417
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,910
You probably can't even
take a lot of alcohol.

418
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,370
Geez, snot came out.

419
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,870
My head is splitting.

420
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,210
Darn it.

421
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,500
It's Bok-ju.

422
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,160
Where am I?

423
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,370
-You woke up, Coach Choi.
-I'm really sorry, Mr Kim.

424
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,370
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

425
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,750
You can certainly stay over
at my place when you're drunk.

426
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,040
Have a seat. I'm making
bean sprout soup for your hangover.

427
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,500
No, it's fine.
I'm being a huge nuisance to you.

428
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,750
-I'll get going.
-What are you talking about?

429
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,120
I got up early to make this soup for you.

430
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,790
Just have a seat.

431
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,120
You woke up.

432
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,910
Have a seat. You should have
this soup, too. Sit down.

433
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,290
Yes. I should eat it for my hangover.

434
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,210
Excuse me.

435
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,290
Did I make any mistake last night?

436
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,790
Why do you ask?

437
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,580
Did something happen?

438
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,000
I also blacked out in the middle
of drinking with you, so...

439
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,210
Why does the soup taste like soju?

440
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,080
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

441
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,250
Oh, my.

442
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,580
-Ouch.
-Gosh.

443
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,910
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

445
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,960
Coach?

446
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,420
Coach...

447
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
I'd lost my mind.

448
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,670
How could I fall asleep there?

449
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,370
How embarrassing.

450
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,580
-Coach Choi.
-That startled me.

451
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,910
You're wearing the same clothes.
Didn't you go home last night?

452
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,040
Yes, I did.

453
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,790
I like this outfit,
so I have several of it.

454
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,500
I don't think it's that nice.

455
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,420
Weight Record

456
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,000
45kg. You made the cut.

457
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,080
It's impossible for everyone
to make the cut.

458
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,420
The scale can't be wrong.

459
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,620
My dear scale.

460
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,420
So this was inside of you.

461
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
I knew it. What is this?

462
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,790
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

463
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,790
Who's the perpetrator?

464
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,670
Are you not going to tell me?

465
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,750
Fine.

466
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,210
Starting tomorrow, we'll use
an accurate electronic scale.

467
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,160
What are you doing?
That's not enough to break it.

468
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,620
Step aside.

469
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,910
Break, break.

470
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,910
-Gosh, you startled me.
-Goodness.

471
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,710
Did I startle you? It's just me.

472
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,040
Why are you here at this hour?

473
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,910
I wanted to practice.

474
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,500
Bok-ju, don't stick out your bottom.
Keep them clenched.

475
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,210
You have to engage your legs more.

476
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,160
Why did you place your arm there?
Let's try again.

477
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,620
-Let's go.
-Let's see.

478
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,620
Okay, keep it there.

479
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,000
That's right.

480
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,460
-Great.
-Hello.

481
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,910
I'm here, Head Coach Yoon and Coach Choi.

482
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,080
-Hello.
-Hello, Sir.

483
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,790
Goodness, you can't take
weekend off because of Bok-ju.

484
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,250
I brought a lot for you to eat over time.

485
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,330
We're only doing our job.
Sorry for troubling you.

486
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
-Coach Choi.
-Yes? Right.

487
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,500
Coach Choi, I see you again today
after this morning.

488
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,330
Head Coach Yoon,
I'll take these downstairs.

489
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,620
-The guys might finish them in one go.
-Okay.

490
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,790
-May I take them?
-Sure.

491
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,420
Let me. I'm sorry.

492
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,160
Are you working hard?

493
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,500
She is.

494
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,910
Don't worry about her.

495
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,250
-Have some food. Aren't you hungry?
-Thank you.

496
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,000
Woon-gi, come and eat with us.

497
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,710
Dr Jeong

498
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,500
I'm going to use the restroom.

499
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,910
Go ahead.

500
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,910
Dr Jeong

501
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,420
Hello, Ms Bok-ju.

502
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,250
I'm sorry for not picking up the phone.

503
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,290
I thought you'd make an appointment
this week, but you haven't called.

504
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,910
Is something wrong?

505
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
No.

506
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,500
Doctor, actually...

507
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,290
Go ahead and tell me.

508
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,160
Actually,

509
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,290
I don't think...

510
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,620
I can go to the clinic anymore.

511
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,290
You can't come at all?

512
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,250
Why not?

513
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,370
Actually...

514
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,870
I'm going to study abroad.

515
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,910
Study abroad?

516
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,960
Is it to play the cello?
Where are you going? Germany?

517
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,750
Oh, yes, to Germany.

518
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,620
That sounds great.

519
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,910
I should congratulate you,
but I feel somewhat sad.

520
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,910
It feels like saying goodbye
to a close friend.

521
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,500
Anyway, congratulations.
Good luck in Germany.

522
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,960
Don't forget about me when you get
famous. Sign me an autograph, too.

523
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,250
Okay.

524
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,500
Take care, Dr Jeong.

525
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,790
Okay. Good luck, Ms Bok-ju.

526
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,710
Stop crying, Bok-ju.
This isn't something to cry about.

527
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,710
Stop it.

528
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,500
-Hey, Chubs.
-It's me.

529
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,330
I know it's you. What's with your voice?

530
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,620
Is something wrong?

531
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,500
I called Dr Jeong and told him...

532
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,420
I can't go to the clinic anymore.

533
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,870
What did he say?

534
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,500
He didn't say much.

535
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,040
Did you cry?

536
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,910
Where are you? Are you already out?

537
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,620
No, I'm in my room. Where are you?

538
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,080
What is your wish these days?

539
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,910
I wish that the person I like
would like me back.

540
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,830
But it's hopeless.

541
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,910
I still pray for it out of habit.
Otherwise, I'd feel sad.

542
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,040
What reason did you tell him
for not going anymore?

543
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,960
I said I'm going to study abroad.

544
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,910
To play the cello.

545
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,250
You must have thought about it carefully.

546
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,710
Don't laugh. This is all because of you.

547
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,420
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

548
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,040
Forget it. It already happened.

549
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,330
You aren't the one to be blamed.
I blame love.

550
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,910
Oh my. You're becoming a poet
after one unrequited love.

551
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,620
I'm more sentimental than you think.

552
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,420
To be honest,

553
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,210
what pains me the most...

554
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,960
is that I still had to lie to Dr Jeong
to the very end.

555
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,080
I wanted to be honest to him
at least once.

556
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,580
Don't think too much.
You'll get a headache.

557
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,250
Just think of it as your first love
and let it go.

558
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Isn't women's last love more important
than their first love?

559
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,500
I'll never find love again.

560
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,790
I might do weightlifting until I die.

561
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,960
That's just self-pity.

562
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
No, that's just the reality.

563
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,790
I should come back to my senses
and focus on weightlifting.

564
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,500
When do you finish your training today?

565
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,040
Shall we go clubbing again?
It's time for you to treat me.

566
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,120
No, maybe next time.

567
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,290
-I don't have enough strength.
-Then how about a movie?

568
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,830
I'll treat you to everything
including popcorn and drinks.

569
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,290
The movies?

570
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,160
Really?

571
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,910
I usually don't go to the movies
with my friends...

572
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,750
because it's a waste of time,

573
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,210
but I've done something wrong
and you also gave me some coins.

574
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,120
I always return what I receive.

575
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,620
What do you think?

576
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,000
You'll go, right?

577
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,500
What time?

578
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,830
-We watch what I want today.
-Bok-sil,

579
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,000
which moment do you remember the most?

580
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,620
Darn, it's the wench.

581
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,710
What are you looking at?
I'm going to punch you.

582
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,160
Let's just go.

583
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,960
Right this moment.

584
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,500
Pharmacy

585
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,620
Hello.

586
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,670
-I have an upset stomach.
-You don't look so good.

587
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,790
Take this. If it doesn't get better,

588
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,000
you should go see a doctor.

589
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,370
Thank you.

590
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:57,370
Pharmacy

591
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,330
My gosh! Miss.

592
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,960
Are you all right?

593
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,210
There's a package from Canada.

594
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Christmas is right around
the corner after all.

595
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,960
She remembers every year.

596
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,120
She sure loves Joon-hyung so much.

597
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,790
-What are you doing? Open it.
-I should.

598
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,420
What did she send this time?

599
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,370
Goodness, it's so nice.

600
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,370
Isn't this totally your style?

601
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,420
Right? It looks like the newest model.

602
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,080
Go ahead and try it on.

603
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,790
It fits perfectly.

604
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,370
Of course it does.

605
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,710
Right, it really fits you perfectly.

606
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,290
How does she know your shoe size so well?

607
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,000
Honey, I'm so amazed.

608
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,370
Parents and children must really
have an inseparable bond.

609
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,790
-I know, right?
-Mum, I have to head out now.

610
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,160
You're not going to eat?

611
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,960
I'm sorry. I'll eat when I get back.

612
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,290
We shouldn't have gotten his exact size.

613
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,960
We should have gone a size up.

614
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,160
We can't get a bigger size
just for that reason.

615
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,960
He won't be able to wear them.

616
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,330
My dear beloved son, Joon-hyung

617
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,670
By the way, don't you want
to look for her?

618
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,870
I just hope...

619
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,250
you will confront that matter squarely.

620
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,870
How to find someone in Canada

621
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,910
How to find someone in Canada

622
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,910
Si-ho

623
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,540
Yes, what is it?

624
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,040
Geez, why isn't he here yet?
Does he want to get punched or what?

625
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,000
Should I buy the tickets first?

626
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:39,290
Gosh, what an eyesore.
Get a room, will you?

627
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,500
I'm so annoyed.

628
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,080
Are you still dizzy?

629
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,580
You got a shot,
so you'll feel better soon.

630
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,960
I'm sorry.

631
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,670
You were the only person
I could think of.

632
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,120
Shouldn't you be going home
instead of the dormitory?

633
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,710
My parents are getting divorced.

634
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,420
It'll be a complete mess there.

635
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,620
If I go home,

636
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,790
I'll feel sick again.

637
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,000
I didn't know,

638
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,000
but we'll lose our house, too.

639
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,160
We couldn't pay back the loan.

640
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,120
Just so I can pursue gymnastics,

641
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,330
my family has been making
too many sacrifices.

642
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,330
I feel burdened by that,

643
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,750
and the sacrifices
my family members have made...

644
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,000
left them all wounded and scarred.

645
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:47,290
I wouldn't have started this
if I had known how hard this would be.

646
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,790
I was too young back then,

647
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,420
and now I just can't quit.

648
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,120
I've come way too far for that.

649
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,620
Is he coming or not?

650
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,290
Gosh, seriously.

651
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,670
I think I shouldn't get better.

652
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,500
I'm so happy to have you
looking after me.

653
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,960
Si-ho, you can go alone from here, right?

654
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,160
I have to meet someone.

655
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,790
Can't you stay with me
for a little longer?

656
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,160
I have to go. I'm late.

657
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,040
Don't forget to take your medicine.

658
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,210
You jerk.

659
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,620
How dare you stand me up?

660
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,290
Do you think I have
that much time to waste?

661
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,210
Wow, you're such a jerk
I seriously can't believe you.

662
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,870
I'm your friend, not your family.

663
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,420
I'm just speechless!
Hey, you need a serious lesson.

664
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,910
You're so full of it.

665
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,910
What, you'll take me
to the movies? You'll treat me?

666
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,960
You're dead now.

667
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,830
Die!

668
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,830
Gosh, this jerk.

669
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,620
Nice, Stage Three. Okay.

670
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,040
The number you are calling
is not available at the moment.

671
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,330
Gosh, why is she not picking up?

672
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,040
Did she leave already?

673
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,210
Darn it, she'll kill me.

674
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,790
Die! Get a taste of this! Die, die, die!

675
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,910
Die, die, die!

676
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,910
Get a taste of this!
Die. Get out of there.

677
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Die! Go away. Die!

678
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,120
Die, die, die! I'll shoot you to death!

679
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,160
Eat my bullets! Here it comes!

680
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,080
Hey! Die! Die!

681
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,370
The movie is over. Why did you come?

682
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,790
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

683
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,290
I want to play this game.
Do not distract me.

684
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,500
-I'm sorry. Bok-ju, I'm sorry.
-Wow, this scum need to die.

685
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,330
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please?

686
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,870
You're really sorry, yet you can't
tell me why you stood me up?

687
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,580
I want to punch you so badly.

688
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,750
Fine, just punch me, then!
Punch me. Hit me.

689
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,620
No guy has ever stood me up before.

690
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,620
I bet you've never gone
to the movies with a guy.

691
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,750
Hey. You punched me once,
so you'll forgive me, right?

692
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,250
I'll treat you to something delicious.

693
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,620
You like barbecue, right?
How about we go for barbecue?

694
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,420
Of course you have to treat me.
Were you going to just call it a night?

695
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,420
Okay! Let's go, Chubs.

696
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,790
Cheap meat isn't good enough for today.

697
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,250
It better be a beef barbecue.

698
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,460
Beef?

699
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,460
All right. I'll just not eat, then.

700
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,080
Hey, will you have room
for barbecue after this?

701
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,870
I didn't even eat much.
Fish cakes are hardly filling.

702
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,500
Hey, you'll hurt yourself.

703
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,330
-Here.
-Thanks.

704
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,040
Goodness. You're so clumsy.

705
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,960
Gosh, your boyfriend is so sweet.

706
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,910
-Good for you.
-He's not my boyfriend.

707
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,210
He's your husband?

708
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,790
You must've gotten married early.
You two look so young.

709
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,120
-We're not married!
-We're not married.

710
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:29,040
-Hey, do you still want to eat more?
-Yes, this one. I'm not done yet.

711
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,910
All right. Eat up.

712
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,420
If you get full from this,
I won't have to spend much money.

713
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,420
-How much do we owe you?
-Hey, wait!

714
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,370
I'd like a corn dog as well.

715
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,460
This is so good.
I'll eat one more of this.

716
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,670
How can you devour everything
at the fish cake place...

717
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,960
and still eat four servings of meat?

718
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,580
That's nothing impressive in my team.

719
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,750
You're seriously unbelievable.

720
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,830
Anyway, thanks for the food, Joon-hyung.

721
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,370
Thanks to you, I was able to de-stress.

722
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,710
All right. Make sure to take
a digestive aid before going to bed.

723
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,710
I already digested everything.

724
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,870
You spent so much money today.

725
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,500
Well, you had to make up
for what you did.

726
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,580
Yes. I'm a horrible friend.

727
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,250
-I'm so terribly sorry.
-Hold on.

728
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,080
Are you being sarcastic now?

729
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,910
You still haven't learned your lesson!

730
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,580
-Hey...
-You still have a lot to learn.

731
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,670
Hey, let go! Gosh, seriously.

732
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,120
-Let go of me first.
-You're too much.

733
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,160
Delete photo

734
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,750
Delete photo

735
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,210
Your album is empty.

736
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,960
Pay attention to your legs.

737
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,620
Watch your feet.

738
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,160
-It's so nice to see you, Ma'am.
-I haven't seen you for so long.

739
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,000
I've been very busy.

740
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,500
What brings you here, Mum?

741
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:50,080
I brought japchae
and other dishes for you all to eat.

742
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,960
-It must be for Dr Jeong's birthday.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

743
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,120
You shouldn't have to.
I was going to buy them dinner.

744
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:00,580
You can still buy them dinner.
This is just me doing what I want.

745
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,000
Jae-yi. Come here.

746
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:08,500
Please give this to your friend,
Ah-young.

747
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:11,040
-Pardon?
-You said she lives alone.

748
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,290
I doubt she cooks
proper meals for herself.

749
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,960
I packed some side dishes as well.
Give it to her today or it'll go bad.

750
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,910
Gosh, Mum. You shouldn't...

751
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,000
-This is too much.
-How is it too much?

752
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,500
I can share food with
your friend, can't I?

753
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:30,750
Also, you're supposed to share
your birthday food to live a long life.

754
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,040
Is that the real reason?

755
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,620
What else would it be?

756
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,830
Are you two more than friends?

757
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,750
I'm grateful that you're
considerate of my friend,

758
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,250
but don't expect something more.
I don't want to lose my friend.

759
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,500
Gosh. I didn't say anything.

760
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:49,160
I'm being nice to her
as her friend's mother.

761
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,370
Next time, invite her to our house.

762
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,500
Tell her I feel lonely
because I don't have a daughter.

763
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,670
Okay?

764
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,500
All right.

765
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,960
Haneol Sport University
Weightlifting Team

766
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,710
Good.

767
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,580
-You did it.
-That's right.

768
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,370
Bok-ju, that was an 80-percent success.

769
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,460
Can you make it 90 percent right
away? You can take a break first.

770
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,000
-I can do it.
-Way to go, Bok-ju.

771
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,460
I think Bok-ju will
break the record today.

772
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,750
If she can...

773
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,290
Hustle it up, girls.

774
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,210
-Let's go!
-Go, Bok-ju!

775
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,370
Let's go!

776
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,120
Get ready. Flex your back
and watch your front leg.

777
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,250
Take a deep breath.

778
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong? Is it your back?

779
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,830
I think the muscles
cramped up a bit. It's okay.

780
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,210
You don't seem okay. Go to the infirmary.

781
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,620
You don't want to let it get worse.
Coach Choi, call the infirmary.

782
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,910
-Okay. Massage her back.
-Yes. Here.

783
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,460
Are you okay?

784
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,910
Gosh, I should fix it quickly.

785
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,160
Hey, Chubs!

786
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:19,910
Chubs.

787
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,670
Where are you going?

788
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,250
I'm going to the infirmary.
Don't mind me and go.

789
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,580
Did you get hurt while training?

790
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,500
You should have been careful.

791
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,460
What about you? Where are you going?

792
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,870
To give my brother... I'm just going out.

793
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,370
All right. I'll see you later.

794
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,580
Get a good massage.

795
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,000
If you mention my name to Ms Go,
she will treat you better.

796
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,500
Look at that. Gosh.

797
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,870
It doesn't seem like she's badly hurt.

798
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,250
I almost said I was going out
to give Jae-yi a birthday present.

799
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,420
I should watch my mouth.

800
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,960
I should place it
where everyone can see it.

801
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,120
Okay.

802
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,000
-Joon-hyung, I brought you a drink.
-Thank you.

803
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,750
Is that a birthday gift for Dr Jeong?
What is it?

804
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,910
It's a speaker.
Don't I have a great taste?

805
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,910
-I want to show him. Did he go out?
-He went out to see his friend.

806
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,370
I think he said he was going
to your school.

807
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,290
He must have gone to see Ms Go...

808
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,830
My mum packed a few dishes for you.

809
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,330
Can I really accept it?

810
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,420
If I do, are you going
to lecture me again?

811
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,910
I'm not going to do that.
I know I was wrong.

812
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,870
By the way, it seems
my mum liked you the other day.

813
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,160
Listen, I can't go out right now.

814
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,620
I have a student who hurt her back.

815
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,330
I shall deliver it
to you personally, then.

816
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,960
The number you are trying to reach
is currently not available.

817
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,080
Bok-ju.

818
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,580
Joon-hyung

819
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,910
If you're here, park your car
and come on up. Okay.

820
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,830
Let's leave it on for another 20 minutes.

821
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,000
Luckily, I don't think you need
a painkiller.

822
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,620
Okay.

823
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,040
Bok-ju, please pick up. There's no time!

824
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:55,790
Hey, Joon-hyung.

825
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,250
Tae-kwon, go to the infirmary
and get Chubs out of there.

826
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,960
You must not let my brother see her.
Just get her out of there, okay?

827
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Gosh.

828
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,000
-Hi, Tae-kwon.
-Hey.

829
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,870
Hey, it's good that I ran into you.

830
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,830
There is an emergency.

831
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,910
You must go to the parking lot and
find a grey SUV that just came in.

832
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,870
Stall the driver no matter what.

833
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,330
It's because Joon-hyung's brother
is in that car.

834
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,830
Joon-hyung says if he goes to the
infirmary, he will see Bok-ju.

835
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,580
-Oh, my gosh.
-That means...

836
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,250
-Let's find that car.
-Okay.

837
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,250
What is this?
I thought the crisis was over.

838
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,710
We shouldn't let him find out.
Keep running.

839
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,500
-That's the car.
-Let's go.

840
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,330
Stop! Stop!

841
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,370
-Nan-hee! Are you okay?
-Gosh.

842
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,750
-Nan-hee!
-My goodness.

843
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,080
How can you drive so poorly?

844
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,160
You should see if there is
a person on the road.

845
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,580
What are you doing?

846
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,370
-That's not him, Seon-ok.
-It's not?

847
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,830
What? Where is he, then?

848
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,120
He should be here by now.

849
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,370
Bok-ju, are you in there?

850
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,710
Bok-ju, this is an emergency.
You need to get out now.

851
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,750
Joon-hyung's brother is
on his way here now.

852
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:34,830
What?

853
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:37,960
I don't know why it's an emergency,
but Joon-hyung wants you to get out.

854
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,080
-Hurry up.
-Did your mum make all these?

855
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,580
I told you my mum is a great cook.

856
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,870
She made so many dishes.

857
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:54,080
Hey. Please give my thanks
to your mum for me.

858
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,540
And please tell her that I won't
stretch the meaning of this, okay?

859
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:01,210
Gosh, I just made one mistake,
and you're giving me such a hard time.

860
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:04,290
You should have a harder time.
I'll keep bringing it up.

861
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,160
Fine. I'm sorry.

862
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,040
-Jae-yi!
-What? Why are you here?

863
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,290
-Did you know I was here?
-Yes.

864
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:13,370
I went to your clinic
to give you a present.

865
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:16,330
Anyway, I want to eat patbingsu.

866
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,620
Ms Go, you should come, too.
Jae-yi will pay.

867
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,910
-What?
-Don't be absurd. It's cold.

868
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,120
You don't even like sweets.
What's with patbingsu?

869
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,750
No, I love patbingsu.

870
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,460
Fine, I'll buy you one.
Let's go together.

871
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,790
Give me a second.

872
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,160
-Jae-yi!
-Gosh.

873
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,330
Listen. I'll be out for a while.

874
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,120
Stay here for five more minutes. Also,
massage your back before bed tonight.

875
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,580
Okay.

876
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,830
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

877
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,080
-Okay.
-All right. Let's go.

878
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,960
-Come on. Let's go.
-Why are you in such a rush?

879
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,670
-Hurry up.
-What's wrong with you today?

880
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,670
Nothing. I just want to eat patbingsu.

881
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:23,910
Jae-yi is gone. We're good now.

882
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,670
Hello, Ms Go?

883
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,500
Jae-yi just took off.

884
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,290
What? He left his phone at the infirmary?

885
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,420
Gosh, how clumsy.

886
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,710
All right. I'll go pick it up. Okay.

887
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,040
Gosh. What a troublesome day!

888
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,960
I'm running around all day!

889
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,250
I guess crime really doesn't pay.

890

Haneol Sport University
Weightlifting Team

891
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,250
Ms Bok-ju.

892
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,960
Why did she sign up at the clinic?
I mean, she's a weightlifter.

893
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,580
Who's the guy she likes?

894
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,000
What if she likes Joon-hyung?

895
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,160
Nothing happened, right?

896
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,250
Is there a match today?

897
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,910
Bok-ju must be going on the match.

898
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,750
A female weightlifter is cool,

899
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,330
but weightlifting isn't exactly pretty.

900
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:09,210
You just have to meet a guy who
will love the way you are.

901
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,040
Did you use to have a crush on me?

902
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,870
Then I'll give you another hint.

903
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,670
Kim Bok-ju, the ace of Haneol Sport
University's weightlifting team.
