1
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,960
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,260
-Hi, Mum.
-Jae-yi, will you be late today?

3
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,350
No, I won't.

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,570
Do you remember the dumplings
we ate the other day?

5
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,530
-You mean the dim sum?
-Yes, that one.

6
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,580
-I'll buy some on my way home.
-Okay, thanks.

7
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,090
Sure.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,850
You must be bored.

9
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,550
Do you want some gum?

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,390
It's sugar-free, so don't worry.

11
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,970
Okay.

12
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,930
I don't have water in my car.

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,420
It's okay. Don't worry.
I'll just hold my breath.

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,340
I was so silly.

15
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,390
Things were going great, and I blew it.

16
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,720
Sorry I kept you waiting.

17
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,890
I couldn't find a convenience store.

18
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,140
I got a warm beverage
from the vending machine.

19
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,930
Here.

20
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,680
Thank you.

21
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,640
How is it? Are you okay now?

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,930
I think so.

23
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,760
The wind is cold in the morning
and evening.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,260
You're wearing thin clothes.

25
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,550
You still have the hiccups.
Drink some more.

26
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,640
Drink some more.

27
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,680
You can drink as much
as you want. It's just tea.

28
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,800
I started to learn swimming
when I was 11 years old.

29
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,600
I was a lonely, awkward...

30
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,150
...and nervous kid.

31
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,340
The water felt like my sanctuary.

32
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,760
Just like...

33
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,340
being in the arms of my mum.

34
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,390
In fact, I was left with my uncle's family
when I was 10...

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,890
...as my mum remarried
and went to Canada.

36
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,590
So the parents you have now are...

37
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,550
They're my aunt and uncle.
Jae-yi is my cousin.

38
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,680
It was okay.

39
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,340
My mum sent me presents
and postcards every Christmas.

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,550
I didn't think I was abandoned.

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,390
I believed we'd meet someday.

42
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,590
But...

43
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,720
Mum, do we have waterproof Band-Aids?

44
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,140
Are you hurt?

45
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,640
Check the drawers next to
the door to my room.

46
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,050
I realised that...

47
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,090
the handwriting on the postcards
were different after the first three.

48
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,220
It looked like...

49
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,760
someone tried to imitate
my mum's handwriting.

50
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,340
It was your aunt.

51
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,680
Was that day...

52
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,590
Yes. It was the day of the match when
I first experienced the symptoms.

53
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,470
Thank you.

54
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,430
I'm sure it wasn't easy for you
to tell me that.

55
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,010
Do you think it has something
to do with my symptoms?

56
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,850
Probably.

57
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,550
As I told you before...

58
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,010
"Panic disorder and conversion disorder
are diseases of the heart."

59
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,970
It can cause hearing problems, too.

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,140
I suppose you were quite shocked
that day.

61
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,260
You probably felt like you'd lost...

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,390
the only connection
you had with your mother.

63
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,800
This is good.

64
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,430
We now know what might have
caused your problem.

65
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,720
Let's take it slow to solve it.

66
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,430
Telling me about it
may have cured it by half.

67
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,510
So now... Let's see.

68
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,260
Which method will be
the most effective for you?

69
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,050
I think we need to do an experiment.

70
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,430
When is your next match?

71
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,430
Thank you for giving me a ride.
Please drive home safely.

72
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,430
What's wrong with her?
What is she wearing?

73
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,550
I gave her a good chance.
She should be wearing a pretty dress...

74
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,550
and show off her charms.
Only then Jae-yi would say,

75
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,930
"You look so charming today, Bok-ju."
But with those clothes,

76
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,300
it's all down in the drain.

77
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,510
Let me drop you off at your house.

78
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,340
It's not polite to let a woman
go home by herself at night.

79
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,550
No, it's fine. I can go home
from here even with my eyes shut.

80
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,140
I also need to stop by the mart
to buy something.

81
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,640
Okay, then. I'll see you at the clinic.

82
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,390
Don't forget to do some stretches
before you go to sleep.

83
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,390
Okay. Goodbye.

84
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
My goodness.

85
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,760
Gosh, you're going to break
your back, Bok-ju.

86
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,720
I can't watch this.

87
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,510
What should I do with you, Bok-ju?

88
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,090
Are you happy, Bok-ju? Are you?

89
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,140
Where is she going?

90
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,180
She never takes the subway.

91
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,640
Three.

92
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,180
Two.

93
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
One.

94
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,890
Okay, there she is.

95
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,640
Geez, I must've caught a cold
because of that dress.

96
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,430
Hey, who's this?

97
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,090
It's the weightlifting fairy, Kim Bok-ju.

98
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,890
Are you watching me 24 hours a day?

99
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,930
Why do we meet every day?

100
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,720
Right? I find it surprising, too.

101
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,300
Why do I always run into you?

102
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,760
What's that?

103
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,800
It's nothing. Mind your own business.

104
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,260
It looks like you're coming back
from a concerto.

105
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,470
You didn't go there...

106
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,850
looking unsophisticated
in a dress and heels, did you?

107
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,090
No way. I wouldn't wear
such an outfit to a concert.

108
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,930
I was checking just in case you did.

109
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,090
My brother despises a fashion style
that's too feminine.

110
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,720
Really?

111
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,090
No, I was kidding.

112
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,720
All men like feminine fashion style.

113
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,930
Hey.

114
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,850
Are you teasing me because
you saw me? You're so evil.

115
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,340
Don't call me evil when I paid for you.

116
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,800
Then why did you tease me?

117
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,220
I spent all of my monthly allowance
to buy those tickets.

118
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,340
Well, thank you for the tickets.

119
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,890
You should thank me.

120
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,090
Did you have a good time with him?

121
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,010
It wasn't bad.

122
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,220
-He drove me, too.
-You went for a drive?

123
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,930
You did everything, didn't you?

124
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,800
Watch out, Bok-ju!

125
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,090
Gosh, that was close.

126
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,930
Thank goodness for my quick motor system.

127
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,760
What's wrong with that driver?

128
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,140
Hey!

129
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,590
Come here, you jerk.

130
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,930
Jeong Joon-hyung!

131
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,550
Are you leaving?

132
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,430
Why don't you rest some more?

133
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,510
It's okay, I'm fine now.

134
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,090
You had a stomach cramp,
so I gave you a shot of painkillers.

135
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,300
Here's some antacid.

136
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,220
Remember to take it after eating.

137
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,890
Thank you.

138
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,640
Stomach cramps are usually caused by
excessive acid due to stress.

139
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,510
Are you stressed out these days?

140
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,090
Yes, a little.

141
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,050
Is it because of a man?

142
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,390
Who is he?

143
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Who is the man that's making
such a beautiful woman sad?

144
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,180
You should dry your hair first.
It's all wet.

145
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,300
Whose fault is that?
Keep your mouth shut.

146
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,760
Give it to me. It'll take forever
to dry your hair like that.

147
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,800
Give it back.

148
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,720
Wait, I'll dry it for you.

149
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,510
Gosh.

150
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,590
Gosh, I'm sorry. Goodness.

151
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,430
Here, do whatever you want with it.

152
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,300
I never asked you to dry my hair,
you punk.

153
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Seriously!

154
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,930
Hey.

155
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,340
Do you think Jae-yi noticed
that you like him?

156
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,850
No, I don't think he has any idea.

157
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,090
I don't want him to find out.

158
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,300
Men don't like women
who does weightlifting.

159
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,430
Look.

160
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,850
It's full of calluses.
Who would like hands like these?

161
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,180
What's wrong with that?
It's because you do weightlifting.

162
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,760
You can feel safe walking at night.

163
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,390
I'd be happy if I were him.

164
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,430
You're only good with words.

165
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,010
Anyhow, I had a good day.

166
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,390
Thanks to you, I went on
something similar to a date.

167
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,090
When Dr Jeong was driving me,

168
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,510
I felt like Cinderella riding
her pumpkin carriage.

169
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,260
And you know how
when the clock hits midnight,

170
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,890
she comes back to reality.

171
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,510
At least she ends up marrying the prince.

172
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,220
You're right.

173
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,090
I don't like watching movies
without a happy ending.

174
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,720
Did you know?

175
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,680
There's a toad in that fountain
that grants your wishes.

176
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,760
-What?
-You didn't know?

177
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,180
Are you sure you go to Haneol Sport
University? It's a famous legend.

178
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,850
You know all of our senior athletes
who won gold medal?

179
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,390
All of them won because of the toad.

180
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
You should work on your creativity.

181
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,930
I'm serious.

182
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,260
You may not know it,

183
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,510
but if you pray earnestly enough,
it grants your wish no matter what.

184
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,010
Why don't you pray to it...

185
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,140
for you and Jae-yi to work out?

186
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,390
You're full of lies.

187
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,590
Did you catch a cold?

188
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,090
My nose has been itching for a while.

189
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,890
I'm sorry,

190
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,050
but I have an important plan,
so I can't catch a cold. I'm leaving.

191
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,970
What are you doing?

192
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,140
I said I really can't catch a cold.

193
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,930
It'll last long.

194
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,640
My germs are very strong like me.

195
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,260
It's an awesome virus.

196
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,800
If I really catch a cold,

197
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,970
I'm going to...

198
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,890
return the virus
by kissing you if I have to.

199
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,050
Wait and see.

200
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,430
Wait for me, Joon-hyung.

201
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,220
Come on, be a loyal friend.

202
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,050
Joon-hyung, wait for me.

203
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,140
I must really have caught a cold.

204
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,890
It's so annoying.

205
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,180
Are you sick? You look so pale.

206
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,890
I'm okay.

207
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,470
I caught a cold myself.

208
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,800
Maybe today's our unlucky day.

209
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,590
Why won't this open?

210
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,010
Here, I'll do it for you.

211
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,640
-It's okay. I'll do it.
-Come on, give it to me.

212
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,930
I said I will...

213
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,930
I'm sorry for being too sensitive.

214
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,760
Even if Bok-ju moves up her weight class,

215
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,220
she'll do well.

216
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,550
Chang-geol, they want more radish.

217
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,010
What are you doing?
The chicken is getting burnt.

218
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,390
My gosh. Oh no!

219
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,640
It's all burnt. Oh no, what a waste.

220
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,800
Were you cooking or were you sleeping?

221
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,340
No.

222
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,470
I was lost in thoughts.

223
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,300
Focus on strengthening the torso
while keeping the same weight.

224
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,090
-Let's increase the number.
-Okay.

225
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,930
Should we increase
protein consumption as well?

226
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,640
Let Woon-gi decide that.

227
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,300
He can adjust it on his own.

228
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,140
I'm glad that Woon-gi decided to move up.

229
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,340
But Bok-ju doesn't seem probable, right?

230
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,930
I can't bring it up without
Mr Kim's permission.

231
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,590
It'll be hard for Bok-ju
to decide as well.

232
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,850
Hello.

233
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,090
You came all the way here.

234
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,590
Why didn't you call?
We could come to you.

235
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,930
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

236
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,050
Let's get down to it
since we're both busy.

237
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,430
Okay, I'm listening.

238
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,220
It's about what you mentioned last time.

239
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,010
Bok-ju's weight class.

240
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,050
What do you think is going on?

241
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,590
I have no idea.

242
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,970
I have a bad feeling about it.

243
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,390
I want to know.

244
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,050
I really want to know.

245
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,260
-It's driving me crazy.
-Stop it.

246
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,180
You're making it worse, so stop it.

247
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,760
Bok-ju, come out now.

248
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Be quiet.

249
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,390
What?

250
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,760
Raise my weight class?

251
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,140
That's right.

252
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,590
I'm sure you're surprised.

253
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,140
Of course you would. I would be, too.

254
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,720
Head Coach and I believe...

255
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,590
that you have the potential.

256
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,050
Increasing your weight a few months
before the competition isn't normal,

257
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,010
but you're strong.

258
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,140
Off the records, you've tied with
the best record from the 63kg class.

259
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,260
That's when I was in my best condition.

260
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,640
You should make it so.

261
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,340
We'll make sure to help you.

262
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,430
As you know,

263
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,220
the competition for
the 58kg weight class is fierce.

264
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,180
In your weight class, the result of...

265
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,140
the competition changes drastically
depending on your condition.

266
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,510
Whereas for the 63kg class,

267
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:12,510
ever since Jang Ran-ran retired,
there's no one who stands out.

268
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,970
I'm not saying this to pressure you,

269
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,720
but if you go up to 63kg,

270
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,930
then the other girls
can try for a medal at 58kg.

271
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,590
That's right. It'll be
a win-win situation for everyone.

272
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,930
It'll benefit you and create
opportunities for the other members.

273
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,220
If you can gain 3 to 4kg,
it'll be totally possible.

274
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,470
Woon-gi is doing the same thing.
We're working on his program now.

275
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,340
If you can make up your mind,

276
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,590
we'll give you all the support you need.

277
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,390
But I have to talk to my dad first...

278
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,220
We already spoke to him.
He gave us the go-ahead today.

279
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,390
What?

280
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,890
My dad did?

281
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,550
How could you do this
without even talking to me?

282
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,680
You fool. It's not like
it was an easy decision for me.

283
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,010
I was tossing and turning all night
thinking about what to do.

284
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,930
But how can you make such an
important decision by yourself?

285
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,010
Do you think going up a weight class
is as easy as blowing a balloon?

286
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,890
Bulking up is a lot harder
than losing weight.

287
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,430
You know it, too!

288
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,470
I know. I'm aware of it,

289
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,300
but life is a challenge.

290
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,640
As a weightlifter, you have to keep
challenging yourself.

291
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,930
Head Coach Yoon is right.
This will put you at an advantage.

292
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,180
It's a pretty good strategy.

293
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,550
-Dad!
-I have to deep-fry chicken.

294
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,050
I'm behind on orders. I have to go.

295
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,090
-Let's talk later.
-Dad!

296
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,590
You always do whatever you want!
You even hung up on me!

297
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,430
Calm down, Bok-ju.

298
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,180
It will be difficult,
but it's not entirely impossible.

299
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,930
I agree. Gaining 3 to 4kg
isn't that difficult for you.

300
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,090
That's not the point. Geez,
this is seriously driving me crazy.

301
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,470
Why would you go crazy over this?

302
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,640
We'll help you.

303
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,010
Yes. As good friends,
we'll pig out with you.

304
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,220
That's not why I'm upset.

305
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,970
Why does it have to be now?
For goodness' sake.

306
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,140
Don't run! You'll lose weight.

307
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,050
Hey, Bok-ju. Wait up!

308
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,050
-Dad always does whatever he wants.
-Calm down.

309
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,140
What? You want to enter the match
hosted by Joongang Bank?

310
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,340
Why?

311
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,220
It's a small match
and won't be of much help to you.

312
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,300
Just as practice.

313
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,260
I see. You're right.

314
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,930
Getting as much practice as possible
will help you overcome the anxiety.

315
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,930
I think it's a good idea.

316
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,640
Use your guts that allowed you to
reject being Tae-hoon's partner...

317
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
to win a medal.

318
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,760
Everyone will badmouth Ronaldo
if he scores a goal in a minor game.

319
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,760
You're getting cheeky again.
All right. Do it.

320
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,180
Okay, thank you.

321
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,760
Geez, Kim Bok-ju.
That girl gave me her cold.

322
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,050
Why did she have to give me
her cold at a time like this?

323
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,640
Hey, Chubs!

324
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,340
Hey, how will you take
responsibility for this?

325
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,340
I caught a cold because of you!

326
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,930
I have a match next week.
How will you take responsibility?

327
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,470
Shut it. My head is already pounding.

328
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,390
Is something going on?

329
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,930
I don't know. Nothing is going my way.

330
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,510
You were happy yesterday. What happened?

331
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,930
-I have to move up a weight class.
-Weight class?

332
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,430
Wow, Bok-ju! You're finally
moving up to the heavyweight class?

333
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,090
But what is the problem?

334
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,430
Hey. Right now, I can't...

335
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,220
You know the bind I'm in right now.
I signed up at the clinic.

336
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,550
Hey, that's not really an issue.

337
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,760
You only go there to see Jae-yi.
Weight loss isn't your goal.

338
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,930
You should do what you have to
unless you quit weightlifting.

339
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,340
That's true, but...

340
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,050
Hey, you can talk easily
because it's not your problem.

341
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,220
Do you think all things
in life are that simple?

342
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,930
But then, you probably have no idea
how life really works.

343
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,470
You're from a good family,
you're a natural swimmer,

344
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,760
you're good-looking
and girls are all over you.

345
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,930
I was an idiot to expect advice from you.

346
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,340
I'm going, you stuck-up.

347
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,010
I should be the one getting mad at you!

348
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,220
How can you yell at me
after giving me your cold?

349
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,140
Weightlifting Department

350
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,140
"You should do what you have to."

351
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,010
He can say whatever because
it's not his problem. What a jerk.

352
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,220
That sly dabbler.

353
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,300
Bok-ju.

354
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,760
What's up? What brings you here?
What is it?

355
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,890
I left my practice journal here.

356
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,260
I see.

357
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,390
So have you given it some thought?

358
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,510
Pardon?

359
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,140
Oh, that?

360
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,470
You'll need to start the special
training now if you want to bulk up.

361
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,590
We've already come up with the plan.

362
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,890
I see.

363
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,340
Then...

364
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,180
I will... I'll give it a try.

365
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,640
Really?

366
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,640
You want to give it a try? Seriously?

367
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,760
Head Coach Yoon! Head Coach!

368
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,390
Bok-ju wants to give it a try.
She has made up her mind.

369
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,050
Is that right, Bok-ju? Are you serious?

370
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,260
You made the right decision.

371
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,010
As we told you the other day,
you can certainly do it.

372
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,470
Of course. Who would be able
to do it if Bok-ju can't?

373
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,760
Your dad will be
so thrilled to hear this.

374
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,300
-Then let's start today.
-All right.

375
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,720
-I'll train Woon-gi.
-Okay.

376
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,430
You should train Bok-ju, Coach Choi.

377
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,430
Gosh, I guess this will also be
a competition of sort between us.

378
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,930
Coach Choi, are you confident?

379
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,300
Of course. You know
how scary I can be as a coach.

380
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,430
You're scary indeed.

381
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,800
Bok-ju, you better watch out.
She might bite you.

382
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,640
One more round.

383
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,430
One more.

384
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,010
Coach Choi, I really can't eat anymore.

385
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,470
There was so much rice.

386
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,760
That's how much you usually eat.

387
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,390
You should go for another round.

388
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,340
It was going so well.
Why did you suddenly gain weight?

389
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,470
Doctor, it's because I haven't
been following the diet.

390
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,050
-The scale isn't broken.
-It's my fault.

391
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,930
It's all right. Your weight
can fluctuate at the beginning.

392
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,550
But I'll give you
two types of treatment today.

393
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,930
Lie down.

394
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,800
That's odd.

395
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,090
Your weight went up by 1kg yesterday.

396
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,340
Why did you lose 0.5kg?

397
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,510
Hey, Bok-ju.

398
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,890
Did you go...

399
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,550
to the bathroom a few times today?

400
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,930
Yes, I did.

401
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,340
We need to fix this.
Let's go fill you up again.

402
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,510
We're having an extra-large size
of bossam for a snack!

403
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,890
Bok-ju, you've got to try harder.

404
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,090
Woon-gi has already gained 1.6kg.

405
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,300
No, I still have a long way to go.
I have to increase my muscle mass.

406
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,140
Bok-ju will get there soon, too.

407
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Bok-ju, eat the meat.

408
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,930
Gosh, your cold is lasting
for such a long time.

409
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,930
But then, you're practically living in
the pool to prepare for the match.

410
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,550
Of course the cold won't go away.

411
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,220
-You can't even take any medicine.
-By the way,

412
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,720
why are you entering that match?

413
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,970
Isn't that match for swimmers
who are just starting out?

414
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,220
You idiots.

415
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,510
Only the incompetent would
fuss about things like that.

416
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,930
Learn from us, you fools.

417
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,390
When I was a freshman,
I was not like you guys...

418
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,970
Shut it and just eat your food.

419
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,010
-You guys are done, right?
-Yes.

420
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,090
-We're going first.
-I'm not done yet.

421
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,180
-I'm not done. I'm still eating.
-Come on.

422
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,800
Do you have a match coming up?

423
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
It looks like you have a cold.
Will you be okay?

424
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,470
You usually get
the stubborn kind of cold.

425
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,430
You're really unbelievable.

426
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,970
You're acting like a stalker.
Is this fun for you?

427
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,890
How could it be fun?

428
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,930
It's exhausting and embarrassing,
and my pride is crushed.

429
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,760
But I'm really desperate right now.

430
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,760
You're the only thing I can hold on to.

431
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,340
That's just in your head.

432
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,930
I'm not that person for you.

433
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm just myself.

434
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,850
Okay.

435
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,930
I'll leave you alone,
so finish your food.

436
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,470
You can't even take medicine,
so you have to eat well.

437
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,800
It looks like Joon-hyung keeps
rejecting you.

438
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,140
Isn't it too demeaning?

439
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,550
You're the most beautiful girl
in our campus.

440
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,220
Did you keep rejecting me for this?

441
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,470
You can always come to me.

442
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,390
I'll treat you better than Joon-hyung.

443
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,390
Get lost, you jerk.

444
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,010
No, no.

445
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,300
-I'll never finish this. No.
-Let me go.

446
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,180
No, no!

447
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,090
Why can't you eat it?

448
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,470
Just have some drumsticks...

449
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,010
and drink the broth. It's not that much.

450
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,470
You must be sick of fried chicken.

451
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,140
That's why I boiled the chicken
with ginseng and abalone.

452
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,720
I already had three plates of food
for lunch today.

453
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,140
I can only eat so much. I can't keep
shoving food down my throat.

454
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,720
-My gosh, you seriously...
-Pick it up! Just wait.

455
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,220
Bok-ju, I know it's hard,
but you should try your best.

456
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,140
I really think you have a shot
at winning. I can feel it.

457
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,760
That doesn't matter.

458
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,680
I'm saying I'm not confident!

459
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,300
Gosh, just eat it.
My arms are about to fall off.

460
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,590
Then put it on your head!

461
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,890
Or put it on your back!

462
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,090
-Just be quiet, you punk.
-I can't put this on my back.

463
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,050
-Hello, Mr Kim.
-Hi, Coach Choi.

464
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,760
You didn't have to go through
the trouble of making this.

465
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,720
I bought some pizza for Bok-ju as well.

466
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,550
Is that so? Shall we go inside?

467
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,720
-Let me carry it.
-No, it's fine.

468
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,470
Lifting things is what I do. Let's go.

469
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,930
Let's eat, Bok-ju.

470
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,890
-Let me carry it.
-It's okay.

471
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,010
-I can't eat anymore.
-Hurry up.

472
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,640
Bok-ju's dad makes
the most delicious food.

473
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,930
He is a master.

474
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,140
-This is perfectly seasoned.
-I know.

475
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,050
By the way, we can eat
as much food as we want...

476
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,550
with people's support.

477
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,180
-Weightlifting isn't so bad, right?
-That's right.

478
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,930
I pity those gymnasts for eating
like a bird every day to lose weight.

479
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,340
Eat up. Why are you picking at
the food? This is all for you.

480
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,090
She's right. Have some pizza.

481
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,930
Should I pick some drumsticks?
You like them.

482
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,340
You even wished chickens had four feet.

483
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,220
I'm already sick of chicken.

484
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,430
I'll soon shed chicken broth
instead of tears.

485
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,890
I'm actually full.

486
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,430
We might all end up
in the open-weight class.

487
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,760
Don't be so weak and give up.

488
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,800
We big eaters always have
our friend, soft drinks.

489
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,720
Help us, dear soft drinks!

490
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,510
Gosh. I have some coins. I'll get them.

491
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,760
Goodness.

492
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,300
One New Message

493
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,720
Hey, don't exert yourself.

494
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,340
You'll lose weight. I'll do it for you.
Let me.

495
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,510
"Ms Kim Bok-ju, your session is at
4:30 p.m. tomorrow. J Weight Clinic."

496
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,760
Your session is at 4:30 p.m.
at J Weight...

497
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,090
Hey, why would you go to a weight clinic?

498
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,510
Nan-hee, let me explain.

499
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,300
-Nan-hee, listen to me.
-What...

500
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,970
Hey! Why would you go
to a weight clinic...

501
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,640
when you're raising your weight class?

502
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,260
What on earth are you up to these days?

503
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,890
Nan-hee.

504
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,300
How could that be?

505
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,930
Great work today.

506
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,340
-So you like that guy?
-You, too. See you tomorrow.

507
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,640
Not Joon-hyung?

508
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,930
Yes.

509
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,930
And he is Joon-hyung's older brother?

510
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,050
Yes.

511
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,510
And you wanted...

512
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,050
to see him at any cost...

513
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,720
that you signed up to get
expensive treatments.

514
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,640
You lied to us to keep going there...

515
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,720
and even lifted the rice bags for
Joon-hyung to keep him quiet.

516
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,050
Did I get all that right?

517
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,090
-Yes.
-You crazy girl!

518
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,470
I know. I deserve that. I am crazy.

519
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,220
No one in their right mind would do this.

520
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,970
I tried hard not to do it,

521
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,010
but he kept popping up in my head
that I started seeing things.

522
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,640
I really couldn't help it.

523
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,760
I just wanted to see his face.
That's all I wanted.

524
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,640
I get it.

525
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,470
He's way better than Joon-hyung
after all.

526
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,220
He's so manly. He looked very sturdy.

527
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,340
-Right? Isn't he handsome?
-Yes, he is.

528
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,970
He's cute. Besides, he's a doctor.

529
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,550
You're so sly.

530
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,970
You pretended you weren't
interested in men at all.

531
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,930
You have such a great taste in men.

532
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,010
By the way, how did you guys meet?

533
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,890
It wouldn't be like in the movie...

534
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,930
where he shared his umbrella
on a rainy day, would it?

535
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,890
He did.

536
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,180
Oh, my. Really?

537
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,550
Did he really do that?

538
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,220
My goodness. He makes my heart flutter.

539
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,340
-He's great and handsome, right?
-I want someone like him, too.

540
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,930
-He's mine.
-Is he? I'm so jealous.

541
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,010
Si-ho, it's ginger extract.
Eat it when you have a cold. Mum

542
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,140
Hey, what are you doing? Get some rest.

543
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,590
You have a match tomorrow,
but you're still sick.

544
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,720
-You should save your energy.
-I need to watch this.

545
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,890
Watching it won't help you. Get a rest.

546
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,090
Sweet dreams.

547
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,970
Fine. Gosh.

548
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,850
Stop nagging me. You're not my mum.

549
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,010
Stop complaining. Just go to sleep.

550
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,550
This is Si-ho.

551
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,850
Can you come out for a bit?
Don't tell Joon-hyung.

552
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm sorry.

553
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,930
You must be surprised
when I suddenly called you out.

554
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,930
Here.

555
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,510
What is this?

556
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,760
It's dates and ginger tea.
Joon-hyung has a match tomorrow.

557
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,590
He won't drink it if I give it to him.

558
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,140
Hey.

559
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,850
What's that?

560
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,720
It's my sincere love for you.

561
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,850
Is this ginger tea?

562
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,340
Don't ask any questions
and just drink it up.

563
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,430
Think of it as medicine.

564
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,050
It's good.

565
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,090
I feel better now.

566
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,140
You do? That's good to hear.

567
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:12,260
You punk. This is why you should
play nice and not be so cold.

568
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,590
I mean, it's because your body
and heart are cold...

569
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,850
that you caught a cold.
That's what I wanted to say.

570
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,970
Hey, I need to go to the bathroom.
I have to go.

571
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,260
I'll be in the bathroom.
Finish it before I get back.

572
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,430
What is he saying?

573
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,720
Do you know how sexy his voice is?

574
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:37,050
It's not too high or too low.
It sounds so sweet.

575
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,890
It must sound like the prince's voice
that Sleeping Beauty heard...

576
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,430
when she woke up from her sleep.

577
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,260
Gosh, really?

578
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,390
I saw his face but didn't hear his voice.

579
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,140
When he smiles,

580
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,340
the corners of his eyes
would wrinkle a bit...

581
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,510
and he'd show a bit of his white teeth.

582
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,140
It makes my heart flutter.

583
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,050
It was enchanting.
He just melts my heart.

584
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,970
Let me tell you the biggest reason
why I fell for him.

585
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,640
This is really important.

586
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,720
It's...

587
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,930
his gentle heart.

588
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,550
I've never seen such a gentleman.

589
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,850
He's not pretentious at all.
It's his natural personality.

590
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,930
When I'm with him,

591
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,640
I feel like I'm a very beautiful woman.

592
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,430
I've never been treated like that,
so I don't know how that feels.

593
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,390
Anyway, he's fantastic.

594
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,010
He's sweet, gentle and reliable.

595
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,930
I can't believe Joon-hyung is
his brother. He's just so mature.

596
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,590
Hey. Listening to you
makes me want to meet him.

597
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,930
Why?

598
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,090
You're not going to make us
fight over a guy, right?

599
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,390
I'm a bit worried that you will.

600
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,260
You flirt with every guy.

601
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,550
No matter how desperate I am,
I won't try to steal your man.

602
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,590
My man?

603
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,970
-Oh, my.
-Bok-ju, gosh.

604
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,180
Hey.

605
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,340
What are you doing here?

606
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,930
We used the toilet, of course.

607
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,340
We were about to leave. Let's go.

608
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,640
Were you two...

609
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,930
badmouthing me?

610
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,850
How can you do that?
You even disappeared without me.

611
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,260
Don't be absurd.

612
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,720
We don't have anything bad
to say about you.

613
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,300
Of course. Don't be silly.
Let's just go out.

614
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,550
Why did you take only one Hamburg steak?

615
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,720
You should eat a lot to put on weight.
Here, take mine.

616
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,590
Thank you, Seon-ok.

617
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,720
Seon-ok, can you get me some water?

618
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,340
The food got stuck in my throat.

619
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,640
Here's your water.

620
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,640
Gosh, eat slowly.

621
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,890
It finally went down.

622
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,090
Wow, you're eating well today.
Here you go.

623
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,260
Have another.

624
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,640
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes, my appointment is at 6 p.m.

625
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,430
Is that what you're going to wear?

626
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,300
-Are you serious?
-Why? Do I look bad?

627
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,550
Yes, you do.

628
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,680
6 p.m., is it? Give me just 5 minutes.

629
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,220
Okay.

630
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,050
I did my best.

631
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,220
Thank you.

632
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,970
Let's go.

633
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,090
Are you really going?

634
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,260
Yes.

635
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,140
Fine. Let me take a look at you.

636
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,140
Since you're going, do a good job.

637
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,430
I know. Go back inside already.

638
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,010
I should go with you because you're sick.

639
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,550
It's unfortunate that I have training.

640
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,930
You should work harder.

641
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,850
You don't swim as well as I do.

642
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,640
You're so cruel.

643
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,010
Fine, you punk.
I get what you mean. Just go.

644
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,340
You better win first place, okay?

645
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,140
Did I upset you? You're so cute.

646
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,550
See you.

647
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,590
Good luck.

648
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,430
Focus on the start.

649
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,720
It's grilled abalone this time?

650
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,680
We had abalone chicken soup last time.

651
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,720
That was regular abalone
I bought at the market.

652
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,680
This time, the abalone is from Wando.

653
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,850
Just for you,

654
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,760
I called my friend whom
I haven't talked to in 10 years.

655
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,590
Please try to come
by the restaurant later.

656
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,390
Don't bring your friends today.

657
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,010
There isn't enough.

658
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,300
I could only get 30 abalone.

659
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,430
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

660
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,850
Where are you going?

661
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,220
-Are you going to the clinic?
-Why do you even ask?

662
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,800
I'm on my way to a competition,
so send me some good energy.

663
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,760
You already know you will be fine.

664
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,930
I don't wish you luck.
I hope you make a mistake.

665
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,680
Gosh, she's so mean.

666
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,680
I'm so nervous, but she tries
to put a curse on me instead.

667
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,220
You wait and see.

668
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,590
Hey, I'm going to get you!

669
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,390
What a jerk.

670
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,640
J Weight Clinic

671
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,930
Your weight increased again.

672
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,720
Why can't you look me in the eyes?

673
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,760
I'm sorry for
disappointing you, Dr Jeong.

674
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,430
You don't need to apologise to me.
This is all for your sake.

675
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,090
It isn't easy to follow
the diet plan, is it?

676
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,090
People around you
probably don't help either.

677
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,430
-Right.
-Evenings are the most difficult.

678
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,090
Unfortunately, socialising in Korea
takes place in the late evening.

679
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,220
Some patients say they want to
move to a deserted island.

680
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:21,050
I know. I can't stop
my contact with friends.

681
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,510
Let's try harder to lose your weight.
Please get changed for the treatment.

682
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,550
Okay.

683
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,970
Joon-hyung has a competition today.

684
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,090
I sent him a message to wish him luck.

685
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,850
He hasn't replied. He must be busy.

686
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,260
He'll do well. He's confident after all.

687
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,050
He may look it,
but he's quite tender-hearted.

688
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,890
It's an important competition for him.

689
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,390
Two years ago, he made a mistake
at the start and was disqualified.

690
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,550
His records from training are
good enough for the national team.

691
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,140
But ever since then, he always made
false starts in important competitions.

692
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,550
I think Joon-hyung is traumatised
by the first mistake he made.

693
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,260
What was that?
He always pretends to be strong.

694
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,850
I had no idea.

695
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,510
I gave him a cold
and wished him bad luck.

696
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,390
Geez, me and my careless mouth.

697
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,510
If Joon-hyung doesn't do well,
he'll blame me. I hope he'll do well.

698
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,850
Also... Was it his trauma?

699
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,470
I hope he overcomes it
so that he can do his best.

700
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,180
Please.

701
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,800
Good luck! You can do it,
Jeong Joon-hyung!

702
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,930
Joongang Bank Swim Competition

703
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,890
When you have the symptom,

704
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:08,760
not focusing on the symptom
is most effective way to overcome it.

705
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,220
When you start to feel nervous,

706
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,510
try to think of something else.

707
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,300
For example, focus on your breathing.

708
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,430
It's also effective to
count down the numbers.

709
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,010
Ten.

710
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,220
Nine.

711
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,220
Eight.

712
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,550
Seven.

713
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,430
Six.

714
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,510
Five.

715
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,140
Four.

716
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,850
Soon...

717
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,090
-Three. Two.
-Joongang Bank Swim Competition...

718
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,180
One.

719
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,930
Please, Joon-hyung.

720
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,220
Take your mark.

721
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,300
Five, four, three,

722
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,090
two...

723
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,090
First place goes to Lee Sang-young
from Dongha University.

724
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,850
Second place goes to Choi Jae-hyung
from Minju City Hall.

725
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,850
Third place goes to Park Jun
from Kyungjin Sport University.

726
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,850
Fourth place goes to Jeong Joon-hyung
from Haneol Sport University.

727
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:09,550
Results of Joongang Bank
Swim Competition

728
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,300
He didn't make it to the top three.

729
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,890
Why didn't he do better?

730
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,760
Did he get disqualified again? That jerk.

731
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,640
Joon-hyung, are you okay? Stay strong.

732
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,010
Joon-hyung, it serves you right.

733
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:40,760
Geez, what should I write him?
I can't send him a sweet message.

734
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:59,850
Drink it up. Don't leave a drop.

735
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,550
Go on.

736
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,680
Finish it.

737
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,550
Good.

738
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,970
Gosh, if I hadn't caught this cold,
I totally would've won the first place.

739
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,680
Why am I so unlucky?

740
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,760
You should've visited us
before the match.

741
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,760
Your mum could easily make you
medicine with special ingredients...

742
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,140
that comply with the doping test.

743
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,510
I should have.

744
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,140
I must be getting punished
for looking down on the match.

745
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,140
Gosh, stop it. It's completely fine.

746
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,050
You said it's not an important match.

747
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,930
Just forget about it.

748
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,090
-Did you talk to Jae-yi?
-Yes, I did.

749
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,180
His nagging is driving me crazy.

750
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,300
He's acting just like you.
All he does is worry about me.

751
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,850
Where are you?

752
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,930
-It's Chubs.
-Chubs?

753
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,590
Who is Chubs?

754
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,930
A friend of mine who is really funny.

755
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,220
Chubs sounds like the name of a dog.

756
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,140
What's up, Chubs? You've never texted me.

757
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,260
I asked you where you are.

758
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,850
I'm home.

759
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,430
I'll head back to school now.

760
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,760
He'll be back soon, then.

761
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,970
What's with this girl asking me
to come to this fountain?

762
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,090
Quack, quack.

763
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,850
Quack, quack, quack.

764
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,850
-Quack, quack, quack...
-What's going on, Bok-ju?

765
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,180
-What's that?
-Here. It's a toad.

766
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,510
I didn't make it because
you talked about it.

767
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,510
I was bored and happened to have
a few pieces of paper lying around.

768
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,800
Who knows? It may be your lucky charm.

769
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,760
You're obviously not crafty at all.

770
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,430
Look how it's all wrinkled up.

771
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,090
How many times did you
undo and redo this?

772
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,680
Hey, give it back, then!

773
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,340
You can't take it back.

774
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,720
It's mine now. We'll see
whether it'll bring me luck or not.

775
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,220
Awesome toad.

776
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,640
-You copycat.
-What's wrong with it?

777
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,850
You and your friends say it all the time.

778
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,090
"Awesome."

779
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,220
It sounds different when I say it, right?

780
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,800
It probably sounds way cooler.

781
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:38,930
What? You must feel better now to be
cracking a joke. Is your cold gone?

782
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,300
It's better.

783
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,850
It'll go away soon.
I took some medicine at home earlier.

784
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,300
I'm sorry for being harsh on you earlier.

785
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,930
I'm on edge these days.

786
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,550
Hey. You should've done
a better job, though.

787
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,470
I know.

788
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,800
I guess I was too full of myself.

789
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,850
Don't worry, though. I'm going
to surprise everyone very soon.

790
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,510
You better not beg me for
100 autographs when that happens.

791
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:12,010
I'll be at the Olympics by then.

792
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,260
You wish.

793
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:16,850
Let's go.

794
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,260
We have time until the roll call.
I'll treat you to something good.

795
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,760
Seriously?

796
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,970
-What are you treating me to?
-Something that will energise you.

797
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,050
Shut your mouth and just follow me.

798
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,550
Why are you heading to the campus?

799
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,390
Gosh, just a moment.

800
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,970
-Do you want to ride this?
-Yes!

801
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,760
-I want to...
-No! Not there!

802
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:51,090
I was bedridden for three days after
giving you a ride the other day.

803
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,220
-No way.
-Do you want to die?

804
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,640
Geez, I said no.

805
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,430
Goodness. I won't go, then.

806
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,220
Joon-hyung, come on. Let's go!

807
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,930
I'm treating you for goodness' sake.
You can't even do this for me?

808
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,140
Joon-hyung, get on your bike. Hey!

809
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,140
-The number you're calling...
-Jeong Joon-hyung!

810
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,760
You're seriously a piece of work.

811
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,800
You said you wanted to ride it.

812
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,720
Hey! I'm going to throw this out.

813
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,550
Gosh, seriously.

814
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,140
-Who is he?
-Say hello. This is my dad.

815
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:37,590
Hello.

816
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,050
-This is...
-Oh, the kid with the tab!

817
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,470
Yes, that's right.

818
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,010
-Do you know him, Dad?
-The other day...

819
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:46,680
I've been here once before
with my friends.

820
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,050
I didn't know it was your dad's.

821
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,510
What exactly is your relationship?

822
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,930
Bok-ju has never
brought a boy here before.

823
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,800
This is very interesting.

824
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,510
We went to the same elementary school.
He's in the swimming team.

825
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,260
I owe him a lot,
so I want to do something for him.

826
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,550
We have a lot of abalone, right?

827
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,760
-What?
-Abalone.

828
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,930
What do you mean?

829
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,340
Wild abalone.

830
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,800
You said we have wild abalone from Wando.

831
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,850
We have a lot, right?

832
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,680
I didn't know that you and Bok-ju
went to the same elementary school.

833
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,430
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

834
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,430
-This abalone is very rare.
-I see.

835
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,090
Hey, eat up.

836
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,930
No, you eat. I don't have much appetite.

837
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,260
Just eat!

838
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,430
I can't stand the feeling
of being indebted.

839
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,720
Eat up so that
you can fight off your cold.

840
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,300
-Dad.
-Yes?

841
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:03,340
Oh, sorry. Make yourself at home.
I hope you enjoy it.

842
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,470
Is it good?

843
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,300
My goodness.

844
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,430
-Gosh, I can't believe that I'm...
-Eat up.

845
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,430
Seeing Bok-ju with a boy right now.
Doesn't it feel weird, Chang-geol?

846
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:37,640
Goodness, getting
those wild abalone was so hard.

847
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,850
I can't believe
that weasel is eating all of them.

848
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,430
Why are you calling him a weasel?
He's too handsome to be called that.

849
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,260
To be honest, in terms of looks,

850
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,850
-Bok-ju isn't good enough for him.
-Just eat.

851
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,850
See? She likes him more.

852
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,720
Are you blind?

853
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,340
-What's wrong with my Bok-ju?
-My vision is perfectly fine.

854
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,010
It's 1.0 on both eyes.

855
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,300
-It can't get any better.
-Shut it, you fool.

856
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,220
Anyway, I don't like that guy.

857
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:07,930
I saw him...

858
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,680
giving Bok-ju naughty looks.

859
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,800
Who?

860
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,180
That guy?

861
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,930
In my opinion, he's in more danger.

862
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,260
One glance and I can tell
that Bok-ju likes him more.

863
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,390
What are you talking about?
She said they're just friends.

864
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,550
Then why is she
giving him all the abalone?

865
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,680
She's not the type
to share food with other people.

866
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,470
It shows that she's
head over heels for him.

867
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,550
Hey, where are we going?

868
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,010
Gosh, just follow me quietly.

869
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,220
It's so beautiful.

870
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,090
Isn't my neighbourhood beautiful?

871
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,930
It's very pretty up here at night.

872
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,140
Everything sparkles.

873
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,760
Yes.

874
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,260
It's pretty.

875
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,430
By the way, your trauma...

876
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,050
What caused it?

877
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:03,930
What?

878
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:06,510
I heard from Dr Jeong.

879
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:09,550
Is it caused by pre-match anxiety?

880
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,180
I'm not sure.

881
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,390
How did you get into swimming?

882
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,930
Did your parents tell you to do it?

883
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,260
No. I just liked water.

884
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,850
I first learned swimming when
I followed Jae-yi to a pool as a kid.

885
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,930
Water comforted me so much.

886
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,010
It felt warm as if it was embracing me.

887
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,640
Oh, you have quite the sensitive soul.

888
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,090
Did your personality change
after you started swimming?

889
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,760
Maybe.

890
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:42,850
I think so.

891
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:45,340
It did. You're right.

892
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,340
That's how I got into swimming,

893
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,850
but now that I'm majoring in it,
it has become quite stressful.

894
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,970
I can't help but obsess over my records.

895
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,340
I feel like a bull going on a bullfight.

896
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:57,550
I know.

897
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,050
"Don't worry about your ranking
and just lift weights."

898
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,430
I'd have so much fun
if that's really the case.

899
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,850
Gosh, I hate that I have to be ranked!

900
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,550
Gosh, I hate that I have to be ranked!

901
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,640
But you know what?

902
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,640
Like it or not,
it's our fate as athletes.

903
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,680
We have to accept it.

904
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,850
Hey.

905
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,470
Cheer up.

906
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,930
I'm a good judge of character,

907
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,930
and I know you'll achieve your goal.

908
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,300
I see something intense in your eyes.

909
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,180
Are you falling into my eyes?

910
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,010
Yes, I totally am.

911
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,390
It's so beautiful!

912
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,930
We can't come here when it's colder.

913
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:04,800
Gosh, Bok-ju must be so full by now.

914
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,140
I know.

915
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,760
Her dad called her, so he'd be
feeding her chicken soup.

916
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:10,930
Watching Bok-ju makes me realise...

917
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,930
-gaining weight is hard.
-Of course.

918
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,010
Raising weight class is much harder.

919
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:19,010
And Bok-ju is working so hard
to put on weight.

920
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:57,340
Name, Kim Bok-ju
Current weight, 57.39kg

921
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:12,220
Right now, I feel like
I won't get sick for one whole year.

922
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:17,510
Now I know why people are so eager
to eat wild abalone.

923
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,220
-Did it give you some energy?
-Yes.

924
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,090
I can feel my energy surging up.

925
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,550
Your dad's food is
what made you so strong.

926
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,010
Now that we ate it together,
let's work hard.

927
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,140
It's not like athletes...

928
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,260
get better overnight.

929
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:34,760
You should have good physical strength
to win the war of nerves.

930
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,340
By the way, how long
are you going to live a double life?

931
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,010
I know.

932
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,760
I should put an end to it soon.

933
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,510
Look, there's a toad!

934
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:57,300
-Do you want me to punch you?
-I'm serious. The toad was this big.

935
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:58,850
Hey! There it is!

936
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,850
Cut it out. You just like to tease me.

937
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:05,800
You better watch out
if you want to live. Okay?

938
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,140
Gosh, why won't you believe me?

939
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,930
There really was a toad this big.

940
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:15,260
Awesome.

941
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,510
What was that? That's not how you say it.

942
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,680
-Awesome.
-Awesome.

943
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,010
This is how you say it. Try again.

944
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,680
Stop laughing and do it again.

945
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,760
You're back. You must be tired.

946
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:34,510
I cleaned your desk and bed.

947
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,260
Okay. Thank you.

948
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,590
Joon-hyung.

949
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,300
You're okay, right?

950
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,640
It wasn't a major competition.
You'll do better next time.

951
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,430
I didn't say anything. I'm fine.

952
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,800
At least I wasn't disqualified today.

953
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,090
That's right.
I knew you were broad-minded.

954
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,390
She's surprisingly cute.

955

956
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,220
You should stick more meatballs into
the chopstick. Two aren't enough.

957
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,340
Bok-ju, do you want more?
I got many of them.

958
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,890
No, just leave them there.
I'll eat them later. Thank you.

959
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:43,970
Okay.

960
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,850
By the way,
why isn't Coach Choi here today?

961
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,550
She'd stand next to Bok-ju
during breakfast and lunch,

962
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,050
and shout, "Have one more plate!"

963
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,260
Maybe she's just sleeping in.

964
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,550
Hurry. We'll be late for class.

965
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,300
Dad

966
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:03,010
Yes, what now, Dad?
Did you make beef bone soup this time?

967
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:05,010
Be quiet and come home right now.

968
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,140
Dad, why did you call me here so early?

969
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,140
What brings both of you here?

970
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:22,510
What is this?

971
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,970
Tell me what it is, you brat!

972
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,680
Weightlifting Fairy

973
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,010
Get over here!

974
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,970
You went to a weight clinic.
Do you now see food as poison now?

975
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,930
Can't you see me, Bok-ju?

976
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,340
Is Bok-ju home?

977
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,090
There you are, Bok-ju!

978
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,300
Weightlifting Fairy, Kim Bok-ju!

979
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:52,720
I had fun today thanks to you.

980
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,140
-Weightlifters can date, too.
-Coach.

981
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,220
This is my second gift.
Today is Jae-yi's birthday.

982
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,930
I'm Kim Bok-ju, a sophomore
at Haneol Sport University.

983
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,180
I like you, Dr Jeong.
