1
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,730
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,890
What's this? What happened?

3
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,730
Contestants' Waiting Room

4
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,310
Where on earth is she?

5
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,810
Contestants' Waiting Room

6
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,350
-Joon-hyung.
-Come on out.

7
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,970
What's wrong?

8
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,810
Joon-hyung.

9
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,810
Why are you here?

10
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,100
Ah-young told me about this.
My friend opened a clinic near here.

11
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,020
She was my patient.
I thought I should cheer for her.

12
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,430
Why would you come and cheer for Bok-ju?

13
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,390
Hey. What's wrong with you?
Why are you so angry?

14
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,930
The guy she likes...

15
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,220
is you, Jae-yi.

16
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,850
Bok-ju likes you.

17
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,310
That's why she secretly
went to your clinic.

18
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,520
She took it hard when
you found out she's a weightlifter.

19
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,140
She was worried you might think
she's a big liar.

20
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,350
Then you show up here of all places.

21
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,220
She's a girl, too.

22
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,180
Do you think she'd want to show
the guy she likes...

23
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,270
her contorted face as she lifted weights?

24
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,970
So just go.

25
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,560
Bok-ju's feelings are already hurt.

26
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,640
-We did it!
-Yes!

27
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,770
Coach.

28
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,640
The corners of your mouth are turning up.

29
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,390
You told me not to dwell on the result,
but you look like Joker now.

30
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,770
Joker or not, I don't care
about that right now.

31
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,730
Listen. Our team...

32
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,770
has achieved the best result in 10 years.

33
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,390
Why would I care about that now?

34
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,890
Our strategy worked perfectly.

35
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,270
We won one gold, one silver
and two bronze medals. Gosh.

36
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm so happy that I could dance
right now. Should I dance?

37
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,520
Please calm down.

38
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,350
Hello? Gosh.
You must be so happy, Mr Kim.

39
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,350
Yes. Oh, really?

40
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,350
Okay. I will do that.

41
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,810
Yes. Thank you.

42
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,850
Stop the music.

43
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,140
-Attention.
-Gosh.

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,310
First of all, some of you
achieved great outcome.

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,390
Min-young, Woon-gi, Jung-woo...

46
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,810
and Bok-ju. You did great today.

47
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,770
-Applause, please.
-Thank you.

48
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,020
-We owe it to you two.
-Thank you.

49
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,560
But I think...

50
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,770
you all deserve to stand on the podium.

51
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,890
Those who cheered for them
when they were warming up,

52
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,430
those who gave them water as
they tensely waited for their turn...

53
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,810
and those who applauded them
when they made good records.

54
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,430
I'm saying...

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
all those people lifted
the barbell with you today.

56
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,730
So on that note,

57
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,100
I've got some hot news.

58
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,430
We're having a dinner party
at Bok Chicken today!

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,270
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy, everyone.

60
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,310
Let me know if you want anything more.

61
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,970
-Awesome.
-Thank you.

62
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,970
All right, quiet down.

63
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,390
Today,

64
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,560
each person must eat
two whole chickens, okay?

65
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,770
-Okay.
-Okay.

66
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,560
Mr Kim, I'll get going now.
I already finished two chickens.

67
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,430
That was impressive, Woon-gi.

68
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,060
You're ahead of the game
since you won the silver medal.

69
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,310
-You'd better eat five chickens.
-Yes, Sir.

70
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,640
Coach Yoon, you deserve to eat the most.

71
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,890
I'm eating a lot.

72
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,730
-Thank you, Mr Kim.
-Thank you.

73
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,640
Thanks to you,
we have a great athlete like Bok-ju.

74
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,560
You provide us food when we're hungry.

75
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,970
Thank you very much.

76
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,310
I did nothing.

77
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,100
You're the one who made her an athlete.

78
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,810
Not at all. It was you.

79
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,810
You've raised your daughter very well.

80
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,430
When Bok-ju was born,

81
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,730
I said that...

82
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,430
Bok-ju was such an outdated name.

83
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,470
I'd like to take that back.

84
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,220
Bok-ju is such a lucky girl.

85
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,560
I think Coach Choi did the most work
in increasing Bok-ju's weight.

86
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,810
You ate pupa stew with
much gusto last time. Here you go.

87
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,810
Oh, thank you.

88
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,270
Last time?

89
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,810
Have you come here to drink without me?

90
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,520
Just once.

91
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,310
-Last time, I made her breakfast...
-Woon-gi!

92
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,730
Isn't this the perfect timing to say
the weightlifting team's chant?

93
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,100
-Weightlifting!
-Weightlifting!

94
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
National Weightlifting Championship

95
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,470
Bok Chicken

96
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,140
Bok Chicken

97
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,890
Chubs

98
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,560
Do you like Messi?

99
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,930
Happy Belated Birthday

100
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,140
-It's on.
-It's starting.

101
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,520
Oh, my goodness.

102
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,730
Why is my face on the screen?

103
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,390
You're impossible.

104
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,680
It's because it's in selfie mode.

105
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,180
Magnifying.

106
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,060
My goodness.

107
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,640
-She looks beautiful.
-I wouldn't exactly call her that.

108
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,680
Of course she is.

109
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,060
All of you did a good job yesterday.

110
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,180
We have another good news.

111
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,560
Coach Choi?

112
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,730
Shall I tell them?

113
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,520
Everyone.

114
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,930
As you know, N.S. Ning sponsors
some of our campus' teams.

115
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

116
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Finally,

117
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,600
they agreed to sponsor us from now on.

118
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,890
Will they start to treat us better?

119
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,890
Can we eat as many snacks as possible?

120
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,100
Of course.

121
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,680
We won't be treated like kings,

122
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,520
but we won't have to worry
about food anymore.

123
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,810
Good job, everyone.

124
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,060
But don't relax just because
the competition is over.

125
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,060
Until everyone sets a new record,

126
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,060
-keep up the good work!
-Let's go!

127
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,770
-Go ahead and enjoy your food. Go on.
-Thank you.

128
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,270
-Enjoy.
-Let's go.

129
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Bok-ju.

130
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,470
N.S. is considering of recruiting you
to their official team.

131
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,060
Let's have a meeting this weekend.

132
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,220
I think they became your fan.

133
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,520
They want to meet you.

134
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,180
Bok-ju, that's awesome.

135
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,970
-N.S. is awesome.
-Awesome.

136
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,850
Girl, it's okay to show that
you're happy. Don't worry about us.

137
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,020
Congratulations.

138
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,600
Don't feel discouraged.

139
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,270
They will recruit a few more
other than Bok-ju.

140
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,100
Work hard so you can be one of them.

141
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,970
-I know, I know.
-That's good.

142
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,180
I get an opportunity
because my friend is an ace.

143
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,390
Thank you, Bok-ju.

144
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,850
Come on. Let's go eat.

145
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,180
Why aren't you eating, Bok-ju?

146
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,350
You've been listless since yesterday.

147
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,810
That's true. Are you sick?

148
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,810
Do you have a fever
after yesterday's competition?

149
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,020
No, I'm fine.

150
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,060
Look who it is.

151
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,640
It's the weightlifter
who was on the news last night.

152
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,890
It's the great Bok-ju.

153
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,810
May I take a photo with you?

154
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,220
-How about a photo?
-Excuse me.

155
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,350
You're not allowed to take her photos.
Keep moving.

156
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,640
She has to finish her meal.

157
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,310
I have no appetite,
so I'll leave first. Take your time.

158
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,060
Bok-ju.

159
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,100
I'm leaving, too. Take care of my tray.

160
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,930
Hey, wait.

161
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,270
What do I do with...

162
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,180
You almost got into an accident.
Stay alert.

163
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,350
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,430
It's fine.

165
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,810
Don't apologise to me.

166
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,810
You should apologise to your body.

167
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,310
Winning the national competition
makes you a national treasure.

168
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,970
Your body is precious.

169
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,390
Sure. I have to go.

170
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,430
Hey.

171
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,810
You didn't even finish your meal.

172
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,520
How will you lift weights later?

173
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,810
I don't know what you like,
so take your pick.

174
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,270
Okay, thank you.

175
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,770
You were really incredible.

176
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,560
I was cynical when people
called you a rising star.

177
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,220
I heard you set a new record this time.

178
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,310
After I saw you on the news,
I bragged to everyone about you.

179
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,060
I see.

180
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,640
Go on and eat.

181
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,770
I spent all my allowance on these.

182
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,350
Okay, I'll eat.

183
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,680
Why are you so down?

184
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,270
Shouldn't you be ecstatic
after setting a new record?

185
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,470
I've never placed first,
so I feel inferior now.

186
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,390
Here, eat it. It's your favourite.

187
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,020
Bok-ju, look at me.

188
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,970
What are you doing? That's so childish.

189
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,890
Was that a sneer? Fine.

190
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,140
I'll show you something really funny.

191
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,810
Copying Bok-ju, number one.

192
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,890
"Hey, I can hit men, too."

193
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,680
Number two, you pretending to be cute.

194
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,890
Take a look.

195
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,220
Number three.

196
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,850
Your running.

197
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,850
Gosh, I wasn't going to go this far.

198
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,310
"Chicken delivery."

199
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,930
"Who ordered chicken?"

200
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,470
"Chicken delivery."

201
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,810
"Chicken delivery."

202
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,640
-"Here's your chicken delivery."
-Joon-hyung.

203
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,970
Don't you have anything to do today?

204
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,060
Gosh, it's very cold.

205
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,100
Chubs, can you give me your jacket?

206
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,060
No, it's fine! I was just kidding.

207
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,850
Cheer up already.

208
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,560
People would think that you
got disqualified, seeing you so down.

209
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,810
Cheer up, okay?

210
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,270
Hey. I'm going to bug you, then.

211
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,640
Do you want to punch me?

212
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,890
I'm tired and sleepy.
I'm going to go take a nap.

213
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,430
I saw the banner.
So you won the first place.

214
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,100
Yes.

215
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,430
Congratulations.

216
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,430
Dr Jeong

217
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,930
Hello?

218
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,310
Bok-ju, do you have a moment to talk?

219
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,140
Yes, of course. Go ahead.

220
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Are you in campus now? Are you training?

221
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,180
No, I'm taking a break.

222
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,180
What is this about?

223
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,850
Then...

224
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,810
can we meet briefly?

225
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,970
Do you mean now?

226
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,390
Welcome.

227
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,810
-Hello.
-Have a seat.

228
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,810
Would you like something to eat?
I'll order.

229
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,810
Doctor, why did you want to see me?

230
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,890
First of all,
congratulation on winning the match.

231
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,730
I see. Thank you.

232
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,310
Joon-hyung lectured me harshly yesterday.

233
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,810
I was in the area,

234
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,930
so I just stopped by
to cheer for you at the match.

235
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,730
I guess I shouldn't have done it.

236
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,180
I'm sorry, Bok-ju.

237
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,600
I hope...

238
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,930
that I didn't hurt
your feelings in any way.

239
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,140
Come to think of it, I think I've made...

240
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,970
many mistakes
even though it wasn't my intention.

241
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,810
I should have been more thoughtful.
I'm sorry.

242
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,470
That's not true at all.

243
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,470
You didn't do anything wrong.

244
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,140
It's all my fault.

245
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,470
I fell for you and did all sorts
of silly things on my own.

246
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,810
I even lied to you.

247
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,430
-It's really all my fault.
-No.

248
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,060
I did it out of goodwill,
but it could've been misleading.

249
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,600
As someone older,
I should've been more thoughtful.

250
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,270
I'm really sorry.

251
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,470
No, it's fine. Please don't apologise.

252
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,850
Every time I see you,
I feel energised and happy.

253
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,350
That's probably why I made the mistake.

254
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,770
Well...

255
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,730
I should've been more careful.

256
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,730
Please don't say that, Doctor.

257
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,100
What's wrong with being kind to people?

258
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,180
This world is full of mean people
who treat others badly.

259
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,640
I'm impulsive and capricious.

260
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,640
I get love-struck easily...

261
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,600
and fall for someone else quickly.

262
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,730
The same goes for celebrities.

263
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,100
I'd be in love with Song Joong-ki today
and Kim Soo-hyun the next.

264
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,390
It changes on a daily basis.

265
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,810
Joon-hyung and I only met again recently,

266
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,680
so he doesn't know this about me.

267
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,180
When I train, I get bored
and look for ways to distract myself.

268
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,470
But as you saw yesterday,

269
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,060
I ended up winning the first place,

270
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,680
so I'll have to really focus
on training from now on.

271
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,810
I see.

272
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,850
Doctor, I actually have to go
meet someone now.

273
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,850
So many people want to see me today.

274
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,520
-It's like I've become a celebrity.
-Oh, okay.

275
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,730
-Let's get going, then.
-Okay.

276
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,270
Gosh, this must be expensive.

277
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,850
Which way are you going?

278
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,350
I'm going this way.
What about you, Doctor?

279
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,600
Really? I'm going that way, too.
I'll give you a ride.

280
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,640
Oh, I was confused.
I'm actually going the other way.

281
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,180
I have to go home first.

282
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,890
Then, please drive carefully.

283
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,430
You know that you don't have to
worry about it, right?

284
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,020
All right. Bye.

285
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,180
Bye.

286
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,180
Hey, Joon-hyung.

287
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,060
Spare me a second.

288
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,390
Gosh, that was scary.
It looks like she's really angry.

289
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,520
Hey, what's going on? You're scaring me.

290
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,180
What is this about?

291
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Why did you do that?
Why did you tell him?

292
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,970
-What?
-Why did you tell Dr Jeong...

293
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,600
that I have a crush on him?
Who do you think you are?

294
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,970
I just saw him.

295
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,970
He said he feels bad...

296
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,100
and kept apologising to me
because he thinks he made a mistake.

297
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,310
Do you know how horrible I felt...

298
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,470
as I watched him do that?

299
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,640
It made me think that's how a man would
apologise if I were to like him.

300
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,520
"I put him in a bind because
he can't reciprocate my feelings."

301
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,680
-Hey, that's a bit of a stretch.
-You shouldn't have done anything.

302
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Why did you have to make me
feel that pathetic?

303
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,520
Who are you to tell him
how I feel about him?

304
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,890
Hey, that wasn't my intention.
I was just...

305
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,890
Fine. I went to
the waiting room yesterday.

306
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,640
I saw you crying and felt bad.

307
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,020
But Jae-yi showed up cluelessly
with flowers,

308
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,020
so I dragged him outside
and lost my temper...

309
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,310
Why would you lose your temper?
Did you have a crush on him?

310
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,890
You shouldn't have done anything.

311
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,350
That's much better than
him feeling all awkward around me.

312
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,810
Why do you always do however you please?

313
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,140
Is this fun?

314
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,890
Do you enjoy watching me
make a fool of myself over him?

315
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,970
Hey.

316
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,600
Do you think I'm a joke?

317
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,970
Do you think I covered up your lies,
tried to make you feel better...

318
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,680
and told Jae-yi
because I'm bored out of my mind?

319
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,310
I don't know. I'm not you after all.

320
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,310
Fine. Let's say that's how I am.

321
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,890
But what about you?

322
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,140
Who walks around like a loser
after winning first place?

323
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,520
Are you that embarrassed about him
seeing you at the match?

324
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,060
You're ashamed after spending
all this time on weightlifting?

325
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,770
-This is a different issue!
-You are ashamed of it!

326
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,640
As a fellow athlete,

327
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,310
I thought you were very cool,
but I'm disappointed now.

328
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,180
Who will love you when
you're that ashamed of yourself?

329
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,810
You're back.

330
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,730
What's the matter with your friend?
She seemed very upset.

331
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,560
-We have no more patients, right?
-Yes.

332
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,350
-Let's call it a day.
-Okay.

333
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,180
Doctor, she wants to go out for drinks.

334
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,810
Let's go for beer.
We haven't done so in a while.

335
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,560
Sure, let's go grab a drink.

336
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,180
-Hi, Joon-hyung.
-Hey, Joon-hyung.

337
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,430
-Are you done for the day?
-Yes. We're going for beer now.

338
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,470
-Do you want to join us?
-I'm sorry,

339
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,890
but I'll need to steal Jae-yi
from you guys today.

340
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,890
Sure. We can go out
for drinks another time.

341
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,730
Go get changed. I'll wait outside.

342
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,600
All right.

343
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,930
It's cold. Why didn't you wait inside?

344
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,180
-I heard you saw Bok-ju today.
-Yes.

345
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,100
I thought I might have been
overly nice to her...

346
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,730
and felt that I shouldn't
have gone to the match.

347
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
-I had to do something.
-So...

348
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,390
-it was to make yourself feel better?
-What?

349
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,600
That's what you're saying.

350
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,430
Didn't you apologise to her to
unburden yourself and feel better?

351
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,810
It's not like that.
I'm older than you guys.

352
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,890
It wasn't intentional,
but I'm still at fault.

353
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,100
I thought I should let her know
that I'm sorry.

354
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,180
Why are you asking, though?

355
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,020
-Did I make a mistake again?
-Yes.

356
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,100
You made a mistake again.

357
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,020
How do you think she felt to see
you all flustered because of her?

358
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,180
Do you think she'd feel better
to see you being sorry?

359
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,810
Why can't you see that...

360
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,350
your consideration for others
can hurt their feelings?

361
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,350
You've always been like this.

362
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,180
Ever since I moved into your house,

363
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,180
you've been excessively
considerate of me.

364
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,730
Even when I broke your things,

365
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,640
even when I drove your car without
telling you and scratched it,

366
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,640
you never get angry at me.

367
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,770
My friends say I have
such a great brother.

368
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,890
But...

369
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,390
it made me sad instead.

370
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,350
"I see."

371
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,850
"It's because I'm not his real brother."

372
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,730
"I'm just..."

373
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,810
"a stranger being protected
by this family."

374
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,180
-Joon-hyung.
-I know.

375
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,060
That's not how you meant it.

376
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,810
It must've been hard for you
to be so understanding and considerate.

377
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,810
But I hoped you would...

378
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,520
get angry at me...

379
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,100
and sometimes beat me up
like other brothers.

380
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,520
That's what I hoped for.

381
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,600
I'll go now.

382
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,810
What's going on with all of you?

383
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,520
Hey. Did you eat something
together yesterday?

384
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,020
-Why are you all slacking off?
-I'm sorry.

385
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,430
Stay and work out until
you lose all the weight you gained.

386
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,560
Next.

387
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,470
You weigh 0.3kg less than yesterday.

388
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,770
If you keep this up, you'll be back
to your old weight very soon.

389
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,520
Lose all the weight before
the competition.

390
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,850
You know the selection match
is close, right?

391
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,220
Yes, Coach.

392
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,100
Next.

393
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,060
Take this.

394
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,270
What?

395
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,850
Thank you.

396
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,640
-Are you sure you can finish that?
-Yes.

397
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,100
I'll eat it, then run
10 laps around the track.

398
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,810
I'll have a three-hour sauna, too.

399
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,390
-Eat it slowly, then. And chew well.
-Okay.

400
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,810
Excuse me.

401
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,430
Are you okay?

402
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,810
Do you have indigestion?

403
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,770
I'll go buy you some medicine.

404
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,680
Aren't you annoyed?

405
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,890
I keep changing my mind on a whim.

406
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,810
We ordered a lot of food
because I insisted.

407
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,730
But why do you still put up with me?

408
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,930
I like you.

409
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,520
I have liked you...

410
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,390
since we were freshmen.

411
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,970
Wait here. I'll get you some medicine.

412
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,600
Couple Pharmacy

413
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,600
What are you doing in there?

414
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,310
Are you meditating?

415
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,680
No. I was about to go in.

416
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,470
Please go ahead.

417
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,890
Bok-ju!

418
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,520
It's late. Why are you still asleep?
Get up.

419
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,810
Bok-ju, let's go to the cafeteria.
I'll buy you sausage.

420
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,430
No, thanks. I don't want them.

421
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,270
Don't be absurd.

422
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,640
You skipped breakfast.
How can you not want sausage?

423
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,310
Get up, Bok-ju.

424
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,100
Just leave me alone. I want to sleep.

425
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,060
What are you, Sleeping Beauty?
Why do you keep sleeping?

426
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,730
Hey, let's just let her sleep.

427
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,640
She's probably still tired
from the competition.

428
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,520
She wasn't the only one competing.
Why would she be so tired?

429
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,270
Bok-ju.

430
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,850
When you wake up, you'd better be
as cheerful as usual. Okay?

431
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,060
My gosh.

432
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,890
You're so boring.

433
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,310
Goodness.

434
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,470
No matter how hard I try,
I just can't understand her.

435
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,520
The competition is over.
She should feel relieved.

436
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,730
Why is she having the blues?

437
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,560
-She even won first place.
-Tell me about it.

438
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,180
But she worked so hard
to raise her weight class.

439
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,100
Maybe she feels a little empty
now that it's over.

440
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,100
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
I've never won first place.

441
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,140
-Hello.
-It's Tae-kwon.

442
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,890
-Why'd you call him? He's too loud.
-What? I think he's nice.

443
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,730
The more I see him, the cuter he looks.

444
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,520
If I don't have a boyfriend
by this year-end,

445
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,180
I'll seduce him and make him my man.

446
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,850
That's what she did.

447
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,890
-Really?
-Really?

448
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,890
Did Bok-ju really barge into your gym...

449
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,600
-and call Joon-hyung out?
-Yes.

450
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,890
I guess you didn't know.

451
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,310
Gosh, she seemed very upset.

452
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,390
Joon-hyung has been grumpy
since then, too.

453
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,810
It looks like something happened
between those two.

454
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,890
What could that be?

455
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,770
Isn't it obvious?

456
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,890
I knew this would happen eventually.

457
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,810
Be it a guy or a girl,

458
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,730
when you're too close with someone,

459
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,970
you cross the line in the end.

460
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,640
Joon-hyung must've teased her so much
and calling her names like "Chubs".

461
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,470
I told him not to do that so many times,

462
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,100
but it looks like he had
a big fight with Bok-ju.

463
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,810
You startled me when you said
they crossed the line.

464
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,270
Gosh, I thought you meant something else.

465
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,730
My goodness.

466
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,020
There isn't even the slightest
chance of that happening.

467
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,770
Don't you worry.

468
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,850
Joon-hyung is immature in a way,
so he only likes pretty girls.

469
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,770
What about you, Tae-kwon?
What kind of girl do you like?

470
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,180
I guess I like...

471
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,640
pretty girls.

472
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,350
Pretty girls?

473
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,810
-Hello, Head Coach Yoon.
-Hello, Head Coach Yoon.

474
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,770
Maybe he didn't see us.

475
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,730
-He seems a bit out of his senses.
-He's in such a hurry.

476
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,020
What are you talking about?

477
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,390
Don't be ridiculous.

478
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,810
Joo-yeon says Coach Choi called
and begged her to...

479
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,100
pay her the operating expenses
in advance.

480
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,180
Is that true?

481
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,640
Yes. She did.

482
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,180
Coach Choi, I'm glad you're here.

483
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,390
Come here. It's good that you're here.

484
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,890
You should talk to them.

485
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,020
They keep talking nonsense about...

486
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,060
-how you used the operating expenses.
-It's true.

487
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,020
I did it.

488
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,560
-What?
-I used it for a personal matter.

489
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,640
I'm sorry.

490
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,270
What personal matter is that?

491
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,770
What was so urgent that
you had to use the operating expenses?

492
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
I'm sorry.

493
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,020
Coach Choi.

494
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,810
-You should start pushing.
-Should I keep going?

495
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,640
Hey, you should lower it more.

496
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,810
Gosh, Woon-gi.

497
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,730
How long are we going
to do the stretches?

498
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,270
Training should've started
10 minutes ago.

499
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,020
Why aren't Head Coach Yoon
and Coach Choi here?

500
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,180
-Did they tell you anything, Woon-gi?
-No.

501
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,350
-I'll try calling them.
-Okay.

502
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,470
Hello, Head Coach.

503
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,430
-Hello.
-Hello.

504
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,730
Woon-gi, take charge of today's training.

505
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,890
Just like yesterday,

506
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,220
have them repeat each set
four times, okay?

507
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,520
Head Coach Yoon doesn't look so good.

508
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,810
-What's wrong with him?
-I know, right?

509
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,730
He doesn't seem well at all.

510
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,680
-Where's Coach Choi?
-That's right.

511
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,060
Head Coach Yoon looked very pale...

512
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,180
-as he ran to the head office earlier.
-The head office?

513
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,930
-Why would he?
-He went to the head office?

514
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,810
-What's going on?
-Why?

515
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,180
He looked like he was in shock.

516
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,310
-Something's going on.
-He ran real hard.

517
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,100
-Why would he go there?
-Quiet down. What are you doing?

518
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,810
You heard the coach, right?

519
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,430
Repeat the set of four
you did yesterday. Go.

520
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,680
-Okay.
-Okay.

521
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,730
-Hurry up and get started.
-Why would he go there?

522
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,100
Sir.

523
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,060
I'm sure there must have been
some reason.

524
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,810
Please take care of the matter.

525
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,890
She's not the type to use the funds
for personal reasons.

526
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,640
Furthermore, it's 3,000 dollars.

527
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,060
It doesn't make sense.

528
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,930
Coach Choi.

529
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,310
Why aren't you in training?

530
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,730
Where did you find the money
for my settlement?

531
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,470
You don't need to know.

532
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,770
I heard there's a problem
with the operating funds.

533
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,730
I overheard Head Coach Yoon.

534
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,810
Was it the operating funds?

535
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,180
Did you use the funds because of me?

536
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,220
-Woon-gi.
-Coach Choi.

537
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,180
If I had known,

538
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,100
I wouldn't have accepted the money
even if I'm sent to prison.

539
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,100
-I'll tell the head office.
-Stop right there.

540
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,140
Nothing will change even if you go.

541
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,930
It's true that I used the funds.

542
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,390
It's my fault.

543
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,730
-You should keep quiet.
-How can I keep quiet?

544
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,310
-This happened because of me.
-I made the decision, so keep quiet.

545
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,100
If you still tell them
after our conversation,

546
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,390
I won't see you anymore.

547
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,430
Why can't you see that...

548
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,270
your consideration for others
can hurt their feelings?

549
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,180
Jae-yi

550
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,270
Hello, Mum.

551
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,180
-Slowly.
-Be careful of the top.

552
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,850
-Hello.
-Hello, Joon-hyung.

553
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,770
You're here. What are you doing?
Come and help us.

554
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,020
Why are you doing a big cleanup?

555
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,930
Your mum has been wanting to do it.

556
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,810
She suggested we do it
before it gets colder.

557
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,520
Honey, you should stop now.

558
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,270
Let the boys do it.
Go and massage your back.

559
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,600
-Isn't your back hurting?
-Shall I?

560
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,930
I'll let you boys take over. Thank you.
We'll organise the medicine.

561
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,310
-Thank you.
-See you later.

562
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,350
-Where should we put it?
-Fix the bottom first.

563
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,430
Goodness, I didn't train my body
for manual labour.

564
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,560
Thanks for the help.

565
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,180
It wasn't a lot of work anyway.

566
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,730
Since you worked hard to train your body,

567
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,890
how about a round of catch ball?

568
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,930
The glove is too small.

569
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,430
It's from a long time ago.

570
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,890
Stop making excuses
and just throw the ball.

571
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,100
Here I go.

572
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,270
Jae-yi!

573
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,020
-Are you okay?
-What are you doing?

574
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,270
You almost got me hurt.

575
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,890
Is that the best you can do
when you're an athlete?

576
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,180
Did you throw it like that
because you're upset?

577
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,180
How dare you!

578
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,180
How was that?

579
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
Do I seem more like an older brother now?

580
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,390
Oh, come on!

581
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,730
You scared me.

582
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,100
Hey, no!

583
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,470
Honestly speaking,

584
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,350
I had no idea that treating you well
would create more distance between us.

585
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,970
Maybe I'm the one with the problem.

586
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,810
No way.

587
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,600
I guess I was a bit oversensitive.

588
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,890
I'm sorry anyhow.

589
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,560
Don't apologise. I'm the guilty one here.

590
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,730
I should be apologising to you.

591
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,600
I complained even though
you were treating me well.

592
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,850
You were quite scary when you got angry.

593
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,310
I thought you'd punch me.

594
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,060
Of course. I may seem sweet to you,

595
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,770
but I can be quite tough.

596
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,470
I'm not sure about that.

597
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,020
Usually, you don't care about
other people's business.

598
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,640
For you to be that upset...

599
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,810
means Bok-ju is quite special to you.

600
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,520
She isn't special to me.

601
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:21,890
I only pity her for having
her first crush at her age.

602
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,430
Fine, I won't care about her from now on.

603
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,180
That's what she asked for as well.
So, okay!

604
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,180
Bok-ju, I won't care about you anymore.

605
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,560
This is it, Kim Bok-ju!

606
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,470
No more!

607
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,100
Your ankle looks terrible.
Look at all those colours.

608
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,890
There's purple and green and...

609
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,970
Are you planning to make it
more colourful?

610
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,930
You look more relaxed today.

611
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,810
Is there any change to your love life?

612
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,180
-Can you see right through me?
-What?

613
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,470
Am I right? Is there someone new?

614
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,730
I'm tired of being obsessive.

615
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,560
I just want to be with someone
who likes me now.

616
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,180
I fully support that.

617
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,220
It's good to love someone,
but you need to be loved...

618
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,520
to boost your self-esteem.

619
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,930
Wait.

620
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,810
I can't move well.

621
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:40,810
Wait a minute.

622
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,810
Didn't you say you're good at skating?

623
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,680
Maybe it's because
I haven't skated in a long time.

624
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,640
Wait, I need to take a break.

625
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,100
Be careful.

626
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,890
Undo these first.

627
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,020
Like this.

628
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,100
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

629
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,600
It's okay.

630
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,350
I know it, too.

631
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,930
That I'm not the one.

632
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,810
Listen, Si-ho.

633
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,520
You can use me as much as you want.

634
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,970
Just stop torturing yourself.

635
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,350
I'll be outside.

636
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,310
What's come over you?

637
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,180
You waited in front of my house
to have a drink with me.

638
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,730
You aren't diagnosed with
some incurable disease, right?

639
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,850
You have such a wild imagination.

640
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,180
Okay, the reason doesn't matter.

641
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,100
You'll see my drinking habits
from our intern days.

642
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,350
-Brace yourself.
-Ah-young.

643
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,560
Do you think...

644
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,020
there's a problem with my personality?

645
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,020
What are you talking about?

646
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,470
Someone told me that...

647
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,810
my consideration for others
may hurt their feelings.

648
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,180
That by caring for someone,

649
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,310
I'd only created more distance.

650
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,180
I don't know who said it, but he's right.

651
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,730
Really?

652
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,100
To be honest,

653
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,100
you're friendly and caring.

654
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,600
But sometimes,
you can feel quite distant.

655
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,730
It makes me wonder if we're close,
and I feel disappointed.

656
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,390
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

657
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,270
I had no idea.

658
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,100
I thought you knew.

659
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,930
I supposed it's possible
that you didn't know.

660
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,060
-When were you disappointed?
-I won't tell you.

661
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,810
-I won't make any comments.
-You might as well tell me.

662
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,600
I'm willing to change.

663
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,600
Just a second.

664
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,810
Hey, Sang-yun.

665
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,850
Really? Okay, I'll see.

666
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,310
All right.

667
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,970
Sang-yun and Dong-hoon
are meeting up with Sang-gu.

668
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,890
I heard he's in Korea now.

669
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,560
I guess he's here for quite a while.

670
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,640
I wonder if Hwan-hee came with him.

671
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:38,390
What do you say?
Do you want to go see them with me?

672
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,180
-Did you go out yesterday?
-No, I didn't.

673
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,810
Then why do you keep chuckling?

674
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,560
I don't know. I'm just excited.

675
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,430
-You definitely went out.
-No.

676
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,390
Hey, it's the weightlifting trio.

677
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:54,680
Hey, girls!

678
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,310
Don't.

679
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,890
You still haven't made up
with your friend yet?

680
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,970
Gosh, just beg her to forgive you.

681
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,680
Shut it. I have nothing
to do with that girl anymore.

682
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,270
What's wrong with him?
Hey, Joon-hyung. Hey...

683
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,730
What is the matter with him?

684
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,060
What are you talking about?
Why would Coach Choi get fired?

685
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,520
My friend at the registrar's office
said...

686
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,810
she got our team's operating funds
paid in advance...

687
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,470
and spent it personally.
That's why she got let go.

688
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,100
That is crazy. I cannot believe it.

689
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,890
How could Coach Choi do such a thing?

690
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,390
-Is it really true?
-I think so.

691
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,640
That must be why Head Coach
was downcast yesterday.

692
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,390
That's impossible. We all know
she'd never do such a thing.

693
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,180
-I clearly heard it yesterday.
-That is really crazy.

694
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,390
-No way.
-I couldn't believe it either.

695
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:39,890
It's just unbelievable.

696
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,020
-Hello.
-Hello.

697
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,730
Why are you all gathered here?

698
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,180
-Woon-gi.
-Yes.

699
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,060
There won't be
any specific training today.

700
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,680
Take everyone to the weight room
for reinforcement training.

701
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,430
I'll leave them with you today.

702
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,180
Coach, it's not true, right?
It's just a false rumour, right?

703
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,100
I'm sorry.

704
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,390
Hold on. The fact that she apologised
means that she's admitting it.

705
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,520
That's just wrong.

706
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,220
-I'm sure she didn't do it.
-Let's trust her.

707
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,680
-I'm not sure.
-Hey.

708
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,560
-How did this happen?
-She'd never do such a thing.

709
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,020
I tried to persuade them not to fire you.

710
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,470
I'm sorry.

711
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:42,930
It's okay.

712
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,810
It's all my fault.

713
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,060
Let me ask you for one last time.

714
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,890
Where did you spend the money?

715
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:57,100
I need to know so that I can ask them
to consider your situation.

716
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,180
It's still my fault regardless.

717
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,310
You don't need to help me.

718
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,850
It was because of me.

719
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,310
Coach Choi spent the money...

720
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,430
to help me pay settlement money.

721
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,060
Woon-gi!

722
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,390
We're closed now...

723
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:22,930
Hello, Head Coach.

724
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,140
-Chang-geol!
-What is it?

725
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,270
Oh, what brings you here at this hour?

726
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:30,930
Did something happen?

727
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,350
It looks like Coach Choi...

728
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,180
is going to get fired.

729
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,270
She had some money of her own
coming in anyway,

730
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,890
so she just used the fund
to help him out first.

731
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:42,730
But it got out of hand.

732
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,470
In order for her situation
to be considered,

733
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,730
I need to tell the university the truth.

734
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,970
But if I do that,
he'll face disciplinary action.

735
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,100
I feel too bad for Coach Choi...

736
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,770
to turn a blind eye to what happened.

737
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,430
But she's telling me not to bother.

738
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,140
She kept the truth from me
because she didn't want to worry me.

739
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,270
Gosh, that woman...

740
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,060
She's too cool for her own good.

741
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,060
-Coach.
-Coach.

742
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,470
Hey, guys.

743
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,730
Coach.

744
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,930
Are you really leaving us?

745
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,180
My gosh.

746
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,390
I'm really sorry, guys.

747
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,680
My goodness.

748
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,560
Gosh.

749
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,100
Oh, boy. You guys...

750
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,680
Keep training hard,

751
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,890
and you better not use this
as an excuse to slack off.

752
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,020
Bye, guys.

753
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,970
-Coach.
-Don't walk me out. I'm fine alone.

754
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,270
Get back to your training, okay?
Where did all of your discipline go?

755
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,100
Go, weightlifting team!

756
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,930
Weightlifting Department

757
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,730
Coach!

758
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,310
Bok-ju, I said to stay and train.
Why did you follow me?

759
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,520
I know you didn't do it.

760
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,970
You'd never do something like that.
There must be some misunderstanding.

761
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,680
It's not true, right?

762
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,890
I'm really sorry.

763
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,390
Then who's going to train me from now on?

764
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,810
You're in charge of my training.

765
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,930
I worked hard to go up a weight class.

766
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,850
Who am I supposed to lean on from now on?

767
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,810
You can't leave like this!

768
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:06,560
You said we're in this together.
Why are you leaving alone like this?

769
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:12,810
-Go back inside.
-No, Coach!

770
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,520
Coach!

771
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:21,180
Coach!

772
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,470
Coach...

773
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,350
Oh, boy. Hey.

774
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,930
Here. Get on.

775
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,100
It's okay. I'm just going to take a taxi.

776
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,100
Gosh. Just listen to me, will you?

777
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,100
Can't you try to be a little nicer?

778
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:50,930
What do you say?

779
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,310
Shall we enjoy a speedy ride?

780
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,640
This isn't what I was thinking.

781
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,310
This is not the picture I had in my mind.

782
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,810
Don't go too fast. Drive slowly, please.

783
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,770
Hey, Woon-gi.

784
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,770
-What's going on?
-Woon-gi.

785
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:50,470
-Woon-gi, what's wrong?
-Woon-gi.

786
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,770
Hey!

787
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,560
Let's go.

788
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,270
Let's go, everyone.

789
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,180
Hey, Woon-gi!

790
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,390
Choi Seong-eun

791
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:05,810
Coach.

792
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,180
Coach...

793
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,850
Coach...

794
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:43,390
Hey.

795
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,140
You know...

796
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,310
that we have a meeting with
your sponsor later today, right?

797
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,310
Let's...

798
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,930
head out together in a bit.

799
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,310
Okay.

800
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,430
Gosh, why do we have to gather
on the weekend?

801
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,930
My shift is starting in a bit, too.

802
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,810
Hey, are you sure
Coach is mad because of Ki-seok?

803
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,100
Yes!

804
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,640
Freshmen had a training
with Coach yesterday,

805
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,810
but that punk didn't show up.

806
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,890
-That's why he called everyone.
-My gosh.

807
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,890
-Hey, have you seen Bok-ju?
-Bok-ju?

808
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,930
We haven't seen her. Why?

809
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,520
We have a meeting with our sponsors,
but she disappeared.

810
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,730
She disappeared? Did something happen?

811
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,520
Our coach got fired today.

812
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,810
Bok-ju was attached to her,
so she must be upset.

813
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,180
Even so, she shouldn't
suddenly disappear like this.

814
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,890
I told you she's been acting weird.
She just kept on sleeping.

815
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,560
Let's check the gym again.
She might have come back.

816
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,930
We'll get going.

817
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,140
Gosh, what's happening?

818
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,430
Bok-ju sure causes all kinds of trouble.

819
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,310
We're late. Hurry up.

820
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,020
Where are you going? We're late!

821
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,730
This phone is turned off.

822
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,770
You'll be directed to...

823
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,470
-Jae-yi!
-What is it?

824
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,470
Did Bok-ju come here?

825
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,390
Bok-ju? No, she didn't.

826
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:42,930
Where did she go, then?

827
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,100
Why? Did something happen to her?

828
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,680
It's nothing.

829
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:51,270
Okay. I should go now. See you later.

830
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:53,970
Hey.

831
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,640
My goodness.

832
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,970
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

833
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,310
Why are you lying out here?
It's dark already.

834
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,520
You'll freeze to death.
Get up and go home.

835
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:11,560
I'm sorry.

836
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,730
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Where on earth have you been?

837
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,560
Everyone was looking all over for you.

838
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,810
Why did you turn off your phone?
Are you a teenager?

839
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:46,730
Did you go in hiding
to make people worry?

840
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,140
How can you be so immature?

841
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,810
Why do you keep making me feel uneasy?

842
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,970
Why do you keep making me wonder...

843
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:00,810
if you're okay or not?

844
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,640
Joon-hyung.

845
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,560
I feel strange.

846
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:11,430
I think I'm sick.

847
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,640
I don't want to do anything.

848
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,060
I don't want to lift weights.

849
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,850
I keep feeling sleepy.

850
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,140
I feel listless.

851
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,730
Bok-ju.

852
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,890
I think a part of me is broken.

853
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:32,310
I feel like something is
pressing on my heart.

854
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,930
It's so frustrating...

855
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,850
and it makes me sad.

856
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,680
What should I do?

857
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:43,350
Weightlifting Fairy

858
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,520
Dad, I hate weightlifting.

859
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,930
I want to quit weightlifting, Dad.

860
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,270
Go out and do the things
you always wanted to do.

861
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,100
Why did you want to meet
in front of my house?

862
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,890
Are you scared that your dad
or uncle might see us?

863
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,810
It's cold. Why?
Did I make your heart flutter?

864
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,020
-Are you really dating her?
-You may be right.

865
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,470
I think I am dating her.

866
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,970
Try to stay in town. Don't go out of
my sight. Don't go too far.

867
