00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,000
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
Si-ho. Where are you going?

3
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,880
Dad, why did you call me here so early?

4
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,920
What brings both of you here?

5
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,340
Diet Diary

6
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,290
What is this?

7
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,420
Tell me what it is, you brat!

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,960
Can't you speak?
Why aren't you answering?

9
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,920
What on earth is this?

10
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,080
Dad.

11
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,960
Don't yell at her right away.
You're scaring her.

12
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,540
-Let her explain first.
-Be quiet, you punk.

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,880
Stay quiet before I beat you up.

14
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,920
Your name is written on here.
Why does it have your name?

15
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,040
Dad.

16
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,790
I hear this place is a weight clinic.

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,290
Why does it have your name?

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,210
Explain why your name is on this!

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,040
Mr Kim, please calm down.

20
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,210
She is out of her mind.
I need to teach her a lesson.

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,380
Dad...

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,380
-Chang-geol, no!
-Come here, you brat!

23
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,090
You should be training.
What on earth have you been doing?

24
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,130
-Dad, I'm so sorry.
-Come here!

25
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,290
-Mr Kim...
-Let go of me.

26
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,630
-Please calm down.
-She deserves a beating. Come here!

27
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,750
Geez, calm down, will you?

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,630
Your blood pressure will go up
and you'll collapse.

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,630
-Do you want to die?
-Fine. Kill me instead.

30
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,250
-Just go, Bok-ju.
-Where do you think you're going?

31
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,250
-Come here right now!
-We'll take care of this.

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,460
Bok-ju! Where are you going? Come here!

33
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,340
22.

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,960
23.

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,840
Bok-ju, do it right.
Straighten your arms.

36
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,820
What on earth were you thinking
while going to that place?

37
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,790
Was it out of curiosity?

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,730
Did you want to see what's inside?

39
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,460
Or did you want to lose weight
and wear miniskirts like other girls?

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Bok-ju.

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,460
You're a weightlifter, okay?

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,000
You're not just an ordinary college girl.

43
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,210
Your father, Coach Choi and I...

44
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,830
have such high hopes for you.
How could you let us down like this?

45
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,960
You should be working hard
to bulk up right now.

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,520
Are you rebelling?
Don't you care about weightlifting now?

47
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,710
-I'm sorry.
-Do 100 squats.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,590
Don't try any tricks and finish it.

49
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,750
Going to a weight clinic?
You went to that ridiculous place...

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
and lost muscles.
You need to put them back on.

51
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,500
Don't let go of the barbell.

52
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,540
She has such a fine figure.

53
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,840
Why did she go there and try to
lose weight? This is so upsetting.

54
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,590
Weightlifting Team

55
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,540
What on earth is going on?

56
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,680
Bok-ju must have gone crazy.
Why would she...

57
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,630
Why would she go to a weight clinic?

58
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,710
She could have gone there
out of curiosity.

59
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,130
Have you gone crazy, too?

60
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,170
You don't do
such an absurd thing out of curiosity.

61
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,210
Why is a weightlifter
aiming for a gold medal in the Olympics...

62
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,460
...going to a weight clinic?

63
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,490
Gosh. I just can't understand her.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,750
Was she lured or something?

65
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,380
Maybe she decided to work on her looks
after Joon-hyung rejected...

66
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,080
That's not true.

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,130
How would you know if it's true or not?

68
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm just saying...

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,210
it didn't seem like
she liked him that much.

70
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,840
Hi, Mum.

71
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,420
Of course I know it's Jae-yi's birthday.

72
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,080
Dinner tonight?

73
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,630
Wasn't it this weekend?

74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,540
Of course I'm okay with it.

75
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,080
Okay, see you later.

76
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,170
That's right. I'm a loyal friend.

77
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,250
I must share
such useful information with Chubs.

78
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,170
Here's your second gift.

79
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,960
Today is my brother's birthday.

80
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,170
One message from Joon-hyung

81
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,130
97.

82
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,250
98.

83
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,340
99.

84
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,880
100.

85
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,340
Here, Bok-ju.

86
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,210
Drink this.

87
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,630
Get a massage later...

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,290
or you can't train tomorrow.

89
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,170
I don't think you went there
simply out of curiosity.

90
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,130
You're not that immature
or irresponsible.

91
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,540
You're so dedicated to weightlifting.

92
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,080
I just don't understand why
you did such a thing.

93
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,250
I want to know why
because I'm worried about you.

94
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,460
Why did you do it?

95
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,630
You must have a reason!

96
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,710
Why did you go there?

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,080
Tell me.

98
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,340
Instead of being a weight clinic,

99
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,540
is it a place that uses innocent
young girls for something else?

100
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,880
No, Coach Choi. It's not.

101
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,540
Then did you really go there
to lose weight?

102
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,670
Are you not going to tell me?

103
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,630
I thought we were...

104
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,210
more than just a coach and a trainee.
I know better now.

105
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm sorry, Coach Choi.

106
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,080
Anyway,

107
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
your training for the heavyweight class
must continue.

108
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,080
You'll be under my watch
24 hours a day now.

109
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,540
You aren't allowed to leave campus.
And if you must, ask for permission.

110
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,630
I'm against violence, but
it shall be utilised if you disobey.

111
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,880
Do you understand?

112
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,090
Yes.

113
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,130
Go and get some rest.

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,290
Bok-ju.

115
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,340
Get up.

116
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Just hang in there.

117
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,040
You'll be more sore without a massage.

118
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,750
Why did you even go there?
Have you lost your mind?

119
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,710
You're strong-willed for nothing.

120
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,710
Why would you do 100 squats
just because they told you to?

121
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,960
Look how hard her calves are.
They're rock hard.

122
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,790
Are you not telling us, too?
Just why did you go there?

123
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,250
Come on, let's give her some time.

124
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,920
She can't talk about it right now.

125
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,720
She needs proper treatment
for her muscles.

126
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,210
How could Head Coach Yoon
make her do 100 squats?

127
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,420
He probably thought
she'd stop after a while.

128
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,540
What a mess.

129
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,130
-It's not like she'll be a model.
-Hey, watch it.

130
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,420
-It's because I'm upset.
-I am, too.

131
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,880
Gosh, hate you.

132
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,630
How far will I go?

133
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,250
This is the worst.

134
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,090
Hey, wake up!

135
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,790
Si-ho.

136
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,710
Ms Go.

137
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,290
I wish we could have some beer together,

138
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,170
but today is my best friend's birthday.
Let's drink this instead.

139
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,670
Do you mind if I ask...

140
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,170
what's making you so upset?

141
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,840
It's because of me.

142
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,210
I hate myself.

143
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,040
I did something terrible to someone.

144
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,670
All because I was jealous.

145
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,960
Jealousy can be scary.

146
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,250
I've been jealous once
because of a man, too.

147
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,170
Is this about the man
you mentioned last time?

148
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,650
That love triangle?

149
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,540
It isn't a love triangle.

150
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,210
I'm not even sure what it is.

151
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,420
Don't blame yourself so much.

152
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,290
Let's have a toast.

153
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,720
To being jealous.

154
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,670
Yes?

155
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,290
Doctor, Ms Bok-ju isn't
answering her phone.

156
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,710
Let's wait a little longer
and get off work.

157
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,960
Okay, Doctor.

158
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,880
She wouldn't miss a session
without notice.

159
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,340
It's delicious.

160
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Restaurant food is the best.

161
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,250
Of course.
My dishes won't taste like this.

162
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,130
It'd be pointless to cook
and annoying to clean up.

163
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,960
I like this, too. We already had
seaweed soup for breakfast.

164
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,290
It's delicious.

165
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,670
-Hello, Ah-young.
-Where are you?

166
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,250
I'm at your clinic,
but it's already closed.

167
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,380
I closed up early.

168
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,130
Why are you calling me?

169
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,080
Are you at your birthday party?

170
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,960
Can I meet you?

171
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm having dinner with my family.

172
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,130
Who is it?

173
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,840
-Tell your friend to come.
-That's right.

174
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,670
It's okay with us. Call them here.

175
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,960
It's a woman.

176
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,520
Can you come here for a bit?

177
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,100
We've only heard about you.
We finally get to meet you now.

178
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,450
You're so beautiful.

179
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,840
No, I'm not. You're more beautiful.

180
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,340
What's going on here?

181
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,540
What's wrong?

182
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,670
Your mum is beautiful.

183
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,540
Her skin is beautiful...

184
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,500
and her skin is beautiful.

185
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,420
Her skin is beautiful.

186
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,920
Only your skin is beautiful.

187
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,670
What did you say?

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
-Mr Jeong, you're funny.
-You think so?

189
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,080
I wondered why Jae-yi and Joon-hyung...

190
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,080
were so different from one another.

191
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Joon-hyung must take after you.

192
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
Let's eat.

193
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,130
Mum, Dad. Eat some more.

194
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,210
-Have some more.
-You, too.

195
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,500
Your friend didn't come for her session
without any notice. Do you know why?

196
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,290
-Do you mean Bok-ju?
-Yes.

197
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,540
She's not the type to do that.

198
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,790
-Did you call her?
-She didn't pick up.

199
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,080
Do you think she's busy playing cello?

200
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,500
Come to think of it, she hasn't
answered my text message either.

201
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,460
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,170
It was uncomfortable for you, right?

203
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,420
No, it was fun.

204
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,670
I like your parents.

205
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I think Mum is worried these days.

206
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,880
She isn't explicit about it,

207
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,750
but she's curious about every young
female customer at her pharmacy.

208
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:15,080
-She's just inquisitive by habit.
-It's fine. I didn't complain, did I?

209
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,880
You're so defensive.

210
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,210
All mothers around her age are like that.

211
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,670
My mum considers all my colleagues
and friends as my potential husband.

212
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,040
It's not a big deal.
Don't take it so seriously.

213
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,170
-You're hurting my feelings.
-I wasn't taking it that seriously.

214
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,540
Are you afraid
I'd hope for something else?

215
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,500
Afraid I might try to
make you as my husband?

216
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,750
No.

217
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,460
I just didn't want you
to feel uncomfortable.

218
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,040
You're making me more uncomfortable.

219
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,420
I don't know why you're so paranoid.

220
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,040
See you later, Friend.

221
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,250
Ah-young.

222
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,040
Happy birthday.

223
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,960
Darn.

224
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,210
Bok-ju would have gone if she
knew today's Jae-yi's birthday.

225
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,210
-The number you have dialled is not...
-What?

226
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,460
Is she ignoring my calls?

227
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,340
Did something happen to her?

228
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,380
Bok Chicken

229
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,790
Is she not here?

230
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,540
Hi, hello.

231
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,790
Oh, you're that abalone thief.

232
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,080
-Pardon?
-What's up?

233
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,210
Is Bok-ju home?
She didn't pick up her phone.

234
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,920
It's not that she didn't,
it's because she can't.

235
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,670
She got into trouble,
so everyone is watching her.

236
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,880
What kind of trouble?

237
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,090
Come closer.

238
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,040
You must keep it a secret.

239
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,880
I'm telling you
because you're her friend.

240
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,040
Okay.

241
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,670
Bok-ju has been...

242
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,380
secretly going to a weight clinic
or whatever it's called.

243
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,340
She got caught
and it turned into a huge deal.

244
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,630
Her coaches showed up here, and her dad
even swung a bat at her in fury.

245
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,880
If I didn't stop him,
she would've been beaten up to a pulp.

246
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,130
Bok-ju's dad is hot-tempered.
Nothing can stop him when he's angry.

247
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,590
When he was an athlete,

248
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,380
people used to call him Crazy Dog.
He was like a crazy old dog.

249
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,960
How did you get caught?

250
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,630
You're so careless, Bok-ju.

251
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,710
Two messages from Joon-hyung

252
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,380
Today is my brother's birthday.

253
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,130
Here's your second gift.
Today is my brother's birthday.

254
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,750
Are you all right?

255
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,380
Are you kidding me right now?

256
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,090
You better take more rice than that.

257
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,090
One more round.

258
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,210
What?

259
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,420
Has the weight clinic made you think
that food is poison or something?

260
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,420
You used to
eat two to three plates easily.

261
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,920
Are you refusing the heavyweight class?

262
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,670
That's not it. I'll be right back.

263
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,500
You punk. We should...

264
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,080
Look, there she is.

265
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,210
Why does everyone look so tense?

266
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,380
Gosh, look at their faces.
It's like a scene from a horror movie.

267
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,960
Even their coach seems so upset.

268
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,380
The coach is keeping a tight rein on her.

269
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,460
You have gained 0.53kg.

270
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,210
If you lose even 0.01kg after this,

271
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,290
I'm ramping up the programme.

272
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,080
So eat instant noodles at night or
do whatever to keep it up.

273
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,210
Do 3 sets of 20 squats. Start now.

274
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,340
Okay.

275
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,250
Woon-gi, your turn.

276
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,540
-Hello.
-Hello.

277
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,630
Hello.

278
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,080
Isn't the training session starting
in 30 minutes? Where is everyone?

279
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,500
-Woon-gi.
-Yes, Head Coach.

280
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,880
Everyone should be warming up now.

281
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,880
Where are the others?

282
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,460
-I'll tell them to gather now.
-These brats...

283
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,500
I've been too lenient with you all.
You need to be disciplined.

284
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,460
Hey, is this how you're going
to manage the team?

285
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,040
-Jung-woo.
-Yes.

286
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,040
Did you get an X-ray of your knee?

287
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,340
It's better now, so I was going
to get it done after the match.

288
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,880
After the match when?

289
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,250
What if you end up with a broken knee?
Will you quit weightlifting?

290
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,420
Why am I even talking to you?
You never listen to me anyway.

291
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,040
You fools.

292
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,750
Gosh, I'm upset. My goodness.

293
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,040
Why is everyone so on edge today?

294
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,040
Bok-ju, I heard you got
yourself in another trouble.

295
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,460
-Isn't Head Coach mad because of you?
-Hey, what did you do this time?

296
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,880
-Did you get dead drunk or what?
-No, I didn't.

297
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,540
Please let us live in peace, Bok-ju.

298
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,630
Worrying about my unstable future...

299
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,670
is already giving me enough headache.

300
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,750
Don't make anymore trouble, okay? Please.

301
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,790
Gosh, my head hurts.

302
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,540
She must've gotten drunk
and caused a scene.

303
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,880
Yes, Uncle.

304
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,250
I think she's in big trouble.

305
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,250
Why did I get involved?
I can't stop worrying.

306
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,840
Hey, are you okay or what?

307
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,790
-Hey, Bok-ju.
-Hey!

308
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,750
Hold up, wait for me.

309
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,250
What was that? Am I invisible?

310
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,500
Where are you going
in such a rush, Bok-ju?

311
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,670
She's so busy.

312
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,540
Darn it.

313
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,880
Hey, you're here.

314
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,630
Is Dad inside?

315
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,380
Uncle, what happened to your eye?

316
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,960
I'm so sick and tired of his bad temper.

317
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,670
He's been throwing a fit, saying
he shouldn't bother getting dialysis...

318
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,750
when his daughter disrespects him.

319
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,880
He punched me when
I tried to drag him to the hospital.

320
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,420
Please wait here for a moment, Coach.

321
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,960
Dad.

322
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,500
Get up. You need to go to the hospital.

323
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,130
It'll be painful for you if you don't go.

324
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,210
Dad, please.

325
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,250
What does it matter?

326
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,540
You don't even care about me!

327
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,710
Whether I live or die,
just mind your own business.

328
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,170
It's good since I can't really
afford the medical bill anyway.

329
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,340
If I die, you can pay for your
sessions at the weight clinic...

330
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,960
with the condolence money.

331
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,170
How could you say that to your daughter?

332
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,040
You can't protest by skipping
your appointment at the hospital.

333
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,790
Yes, I went to the weight clinic,

334
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,750
but how is what you're doing now
any different from what I did?

335
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,130
What? How dare you talk back to me?

336
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,790
Get up.

337
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,170
Where's the clinic? It's the one
after the intersection, isn't it?

338
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm going to teach the scum a lesson...

339
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,460
for seducing a naive student
to make money!

340
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,250
Dad. Dad, Dad!

341
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,420
That father-daughter duo
seriously kills me.

342
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,670
How about it? Would you like a glass?

343
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,790
I bet you're as frustrated as I am.

344
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,960
I don't drink soda on an empty stomach.

345
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,840
I see.

346
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,710
Where did it go?

347
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Gosh, for goodness' sake.
You're getting on my nerves.

348
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,090
No, Dad! No, no! Dad, please...

349
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,250
-Why can't I go talk to him?
-Dad, please...

350
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,540
Darn that weight clinic
or whatever it's called.

351
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,420
I'm going to destroy it
until he has to shut it down.

352
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,960
-Darn it!
-Dad, no!

353
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,630
No, Dad. You can't go there. Dad, please.

354
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,080
-Dad, please don't do this.
-Let go of me!

355
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,420
Let go! You didn't do anything wrong.

356
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,790
This is all
that money-grubbing doctor's fault.

357
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,880
You only used to care about
weightlifting. He must've lured you.

358
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,630
That must be why you went there
when you couldn't even afford it.

359
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,000
Let go, you brat!

360
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,790
That's not true, Dad.
I went there on my own.

361
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,460
Dad, please. I won't go there ever again.

362
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,340
-I won't even go near the clinic.
-Shut it, you brat...

363
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,710
-Chang-geol!
-Dad! Dad, are you okay?

364
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,170
-Dad!
-Mr Kim!

365
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,170
Bok-ju, call a taxi.

366
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,460
I'll do it.

367
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,090
Dad, I'm sorry.

368
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,130
-Let's go to the hospital now!
-Chang-geol.

369
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,920
Dad. Dad, please...

370
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,250
And up!

371
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,750
Your posture is not stable.

372
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,290
Si-ho, are you going to keep this up?

373
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,500
You have to be stable
in the pivot position.

374
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,170
Will you be able to go on
the competition tomorrow?

375
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,960
Do it again.

376
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,000
You're driving me crazy.

377
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,250
Why can't you keep your balance?

378
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,960
It's disrupting the flow.

379
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,540
Gosh, you're stressing me out.

380
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,630
Haemodialysis Room

381
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,540
It's okay. He's getting haemodialysis.
He'll be fine.

382
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,170
-You should get back to the training.
-But Uncle...

383
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,460
It's okay. It will take hours.

384
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,840
Coach Choi, please take her
back to school with you.

385
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,250
I'm sorry we caused you trouble.

386
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,790
Not at all.

387
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,840
Drink it. You must've been shocked.

388
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,500
Thank you.

389
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
It's normal for your father
to react that way.

390
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,460
He has been devoting his life
to look after you.

391
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,710
You should be good to your father.

392
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,090
I know.

393
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,380
Excuse me.

394
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,250
Yes, this is Choi Seong-eun.

395
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,540
I submitted the record of expenses
and the receipts yesterday.

396
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,340
It doesn't add up?

397
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,880
Okay. I'll go and check right now.

398
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,170
Okay.

399
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,250
I have to go
to the administration office.

400
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,500
After you finish this, go to the gym
and set up the equipment.

401
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,790
Woon-gi should be there.

402
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,750
-Go straight to the gym, okay?
-Okay.

403
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,080
Woon-gi.

404
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,080
Why are you alone? Where is Bok-ju?

405
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,130
Bok-ju didn't come.

406
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,130
I thought she went out with you.

407
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,880
I just can't find an answer to this.

408
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,540
I'm talking about Bok-ju.

409
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,290
She was raising her weight class,

410
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,040
and she never cared about
losing weight at all.

411
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,880
Come to think of it, she must've lied
about having haemorrhoids.

412
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,080
She snuck out to go to that clinic.

413
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,250
Why did she do that?

414
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,840
Do you have any ideas?

415
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,080
Of course not. How would I know?

416
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,460
Something definitely feels weird.

417
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,130
I thought I knew Bok-ju well.

418
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,750
I'm a bit disappointed that
she lied to us.

419
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,460
She must've had her reasons.

420
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,340
So what are those reasons?
I can't even guess what they are.

421
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,460
Frankly, why is it so bad that
she went to a weight clinic?

422
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,750
What's bad is that we're weightlifters.

423
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,630
How is it bad to be a weightlifter?

424
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,670
Hello, Coach Choi?

425
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,040
Bok-ju?

426
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,630
She's not in her room.

427
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,670
I thought she was training.

428
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,750
Dr Jeong.

429
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,880
Did you have a happy birthday yesterday?

430
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,750
I don't think...

431
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,790
I'll be able to see you anymore.

432
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,750
If I had been honest with you
from the beginning,

433
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,210
would I have been able to wish
you a happy birthday in person?

434
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,170
I'm Kim Bok-ju,
a sophomore at Haneol Sport University.

435
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,210
And I'm a weightlifter.

436
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,250
I've always had great strength
since I was little.

437
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,960
Rather than elegant classical music,
I like Big Bang's songs much better.

438
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,880
I love sausages.

439
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,250
I like doing morning exercise in winter.

440
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,130
I also like the smell of the ground
on rainy days.

441
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,340
And...

442
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,460
Doctor,

443
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,920
I like you.

444
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,670
It's okay.

445
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,670
I'm dumb and simple-minded.

446
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,420
I'll forget you soon.

447
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,670
I will...

448
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,590
be sad...

449
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
just for today.

450
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,340
Dr Jeong.

451
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,750
Happy belated birthday.

452
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,880
Happy belated birthday.

453
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,250
It's a day late,

454
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,790
but happy birthday to you.

455
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,210
Hi, Joon-hyung.

456
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,250
Wow, you finally answered.

457
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,960
Why is it so hard to get you
on the phone?

458
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,290
Sorry. What is it?

459
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,210
You know why I called.

460
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,250
Are you okay?

461
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,170
Your coach seemed to be
following you everywhere.

462
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,920
Are you holding out okay?

463
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,210
Yes.

464
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,130
How did you know about that?

465
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,960
Bok-ju!

466
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,080
Geez, Bok-ju.

467
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,710
Hello?

468
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,420
Hey, Chubs.

469
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,960
Did you hang up?

470
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,210
She hung up.

471
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,670
Geez, not again.

472
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,340
What is it this time?

473
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,170
I asked you a question, Bok-ju.

474
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,630
Where have you been?

475
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,080
I had some errands to run.

476
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,670
I told you to practice, not run errands.

477
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,420
Give me a good excuse at least!

478
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,670
What errand could be so urgent?

479
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,080
Are you going to stay silent again?

480
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,210
You don't want to talk to me. Is that it?

481
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,130
All right. Fine.

482
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,540
I warned you I'm ready to use force.

483
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,790
I told you.

484
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,750
Assume push-up position.

485
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,790
20 lashes should be enough.

486
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,080
Count it right.

487
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
One.

488
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
Two.

489
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,420
Coach Choi! Coach Choi...

490
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,210
Coach Choi.

491
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,880
I'll tell you what happened.

492
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,960
Nan-hee!

493
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,710
That's why she went there.

494
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,170
She wasn't trying to lose weight.

495
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,040
I asked her where she had been earlier.

496
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,080
She said yesterday was
that doctor's birthday,

497
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,080
so she went to leave him a present.

498
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,500
You know how Bok-ju is.
This is her first time like this.

499
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,500
When you like someone,

500
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,630
you can't let the feelings go easily.

501
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,750
When I was 19 years old,

502
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,420
I ran away from home once.

503
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
I fell in love with a guy.

504
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,250
After a dinner
and a night view of the sea,

505
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,630
he said we must go back home...

506
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,210
or his parents would kill him.

507
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,790
I had given up...

508
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,880
everything including weightlifting
to run away with him.

509
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,840
But...

510
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,960
do you know what bothered me
more than feeling betrayed?

511
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,290
I couldn't get over that jerk.

512
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,340
I guess that's how all girls are.

513
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,380
Once I started to like him,
I couldn't stop easily.

514
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,710
How silly.

515
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,670
Bok-ju.

516
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,500
Hey.

517
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,880
Your heart is breaking inside, right?

518
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,750
It's okay. It will pass. All right?

519
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,460
You know the dead point, right?

520
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,340
You're out of breath
and you feel like you'll die soon.

521
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,040
But if you pass that point,
it becomes tolerable.

522
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,710
Everything works in the same way. Okay?

523
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,880
Coach.

524
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,590
It's good to have
this kind of experience.

525
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,090
Be it now or later,

526
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,880
find and date a guy who loves you,
whom you can be yourself around.

527
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,670
After all, why can't weightlifters date?

528
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,460
You can. I won't stop you.

529
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,460
Coach.

530
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,290
Gosh.

531
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,380
Hey.

532
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,250
Where did she go after
hanging up on me like that?

533
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,790
She's not in the gym.

534
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,130
Who's the punk that made Bok-ju cry?

535
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,540
I'll come and get you
if you give her a hard time!

536
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,460
-Coach Choi.
-Bok-ju.

537
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,540
It's okay.

538
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,080
Everything will be okay
after you finish crying.

539
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,500
I'll talk to the head of your dormitory.

540
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,040
You should sleep at home tonight.

541
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,130
Calm yourself down.

542
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,880
You should spend some time
with your dad, too.

543
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,460
Coach Choi.

544
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,750
You have to start training hard tomorrow.

545
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,380
I won't cut you any slacks.

546
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,340
Bring back your awesomeness.

547
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,210
-Okay?
-Yes.

548
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,670
-Thank you, Coach.
-Go on.

549
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,420
Go on now!

550
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,420
So you're in a lonely love, too.

551
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,250
There is no right answer to love.

552
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,290
Darn it.

553
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,250
-Are you getting off work?
-Yes. How's Bok-ju?

554
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,420
Don't worry so much. She'll work hard.

555
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,290
You said giving trust is also one way
to support, so we must trust her.

556
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,170
Right. Trust is real when you trust
something that you can't see.

557
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,880
Hardships are necessary for growth.

558
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,540
You should go home soon.

559
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,250
Okay, get home safely.
Make sure to have dinner.

560
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,670
Gosh, you aren't my wife.

561
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,630
He's so poetic.

562
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,960
I caught you, Kim Bok-ju!

563
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,880
What are you doing?

564
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,960
I knew it.
Sausage works best to catch Bok-ju.

565
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,920
I bought it for you because
you always crave for it.

566
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,630
It's not even that tasty. Here you go.

567
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,920
-Where are you going?
-I'm going home.

568
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,670
-What about you?
-Me?

569
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,210
I went to buy this sausage.

570
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,170
Why didn't you return my calls
after getting caught?

571
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,460
Some things happened.

572
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,750
But how did you know I got caught?

573
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
There's a way to know.

574
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,130
Let's go. Have you had dinner yet?

575
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,960
-What about the curfew?
-Rules are meant to be broken.

576
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,080
-Let's go.
-Hey.

577
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,460
Hey, what are we going to eat?

578
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,040
-Come on, Seon-ok. Don't be upset.
-So you knew about Bok-ju going there.

579
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,460
I didn't know about it
from the beginning.

580
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,250
You knew about it before I did.

581
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,460
That's why you were so calm.

582
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,250
Otherwise, you would have
made a big fuss about it.

583
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,420
I wasn't sure whether
I should tell you or not.

584
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,540
What gives you the right to decide that?

585
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,960
-It's not like that.
-Forget it.

586
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,090
You're worse than Bok-ju.

587
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,460
Come on, Seon-ok.

588
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,920
-Aren't you awesome?
-Go away!

589
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,210
Gosh, that hurts.

590
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,380
Bok-ju, look! It's meat.

591
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,750
It's your favourite.
You'll get to have this meat.

592
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,840
What's with you?
Why are you being so nice...

593
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,840
-and buying me meat?
-I told you.

594
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,960
I found a 50-dollar bill on the street.
I must spend it quickly.

595
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,210
Go ahead and eat.

596
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,170
I have no appetite.

597
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,750
Here, Bok-ju. Open your mouth.

598
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,000
Here's some meat for Bok-ju.

599
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,460
Bok-ju, open your mouth.

600
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,790
Here. Come on.

601
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,540
Help yourself. Consider it
a celebration for Jae-yi's birthday.

602
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
You don't need to be on a diet anymore.

603
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,080
Why weren't you more careful?
It had to happen on his birthday.

604
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,250
He was worried because you missed
your appointment without calling.

605
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,960
-Really?
-Yes, you should have called.

606
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,250
I'm sure you didn't have
the chance to, though.

607
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,170
Hey, that's not cooked yet. Spit it out.

608
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,540
Spit it out.

609
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,710
Gosh, come here.

610
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,080
You have sauce on your arm.

611
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,090
My goodness.
You're a piece of work, Bok-ju.

612
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,840
It's ready to eat. Go ahead.

613
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,090
You have to finish all the meat, okay?

614
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,380
Let's fill up the stomach
and empty the mind.

615
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,750
I will treat everything for
embarrassing yourself today.

616
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,500
Stop it. You shouldn't drink.

617
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,080
Give it back.
It's okay to have one drink.

618
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,040
You had more than one.

619
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,540
You're going to get all bloated up.

620
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,590
You can only have this much.

621
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,130
You're so cute.

622
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,880
You feel bad about
scolding Bok-ju, don't you?

623
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,630
Think about it.
Bok-ju is already 21 years old.

624
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,090
Wouldn't she also want to
put on make-up, lose weight...

625
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,170
and go on dates like her peers?

626
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,090
She's also a woman.

627
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,710
She's not a woman. She's a weightlifter.

628
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,500
She's still a woman
even if she does weightlifting.

629
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,500
Whenever I see Bok-ju,

630
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,420
I feel bad for her.

631
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,130
She's always in her sweatpants and
making deliveries on the motorcycle.

632
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,090
Her palms are rough
like the back of a turtle.

633
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,750
Those aren't the hands of a lady.

634
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,250
She lost her mum when she was young.

635
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,840
-Her ignorant dad hits her every day.
-Be quiet.

636
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,710
Go to bed
if you'll keep talking that way.

637
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,380
I was on my way anyway.

638
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,840
Don't bring out any more bottle.

639
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,420
Of course I feel bad for her, too.

640
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,960
That's why she shouldn't give up.

641
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,460
She should win a gold medal at least.

642
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,920
She can't have regrets like me.

643
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,920
You just can't stop dancing, can you?

644
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,040
-You might turn into jelly.
-I know.

645
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:22,090
I didn't think I was the clubbing type,
but it wasn't so bad.

646
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,420
Loser pays for the club next time.
Rock-paper-scissors.

647
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,840
-Gosh.
-You pay for the club next time.

648
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,130
Why am I so terrible
at playing rock-paper-scissors?

649
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,960
I always lose
when I play with my friends.

650
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,750
By the way, how did you get caught?

651
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,670
Coach Choi found my diet journal
in the weightlifting room.

652
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,090
Hey, why did you leave it...

653
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,750
You're so clumsy.

654
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,290
I made sure to put it in my bag.

655
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,670
I have no idea how it ended up there.
It's a mystery to me.

656
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,460
You obviously dropped it there.
Do you think a ghost put it there?

657
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,090
I know, right?

658
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,380
Well, what's done is done.
It doesn't matter anymore.

659
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,590
But...

660
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,380
I have no regrets.

661
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,630
I learned a lot thanks to Dr Jeong.

662
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,880
He made me realise that I'm a woman, too.

663
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,880
He taught me that a man
can make my heart flutter...

664
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,080
as much as weightlifting does.

665
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,250
And I made you realise that you can
dance around like this, too.

666
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,750
I was just about to get immersed
in my sensibilities. Goodness.

667
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,210
Hey, will you be okay after
staying outside without permission?

668
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,920
Well, I do it all the time.

669
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,630
Why do you ask?

670
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:44,040
-Are you worried?
-Of course I'm worried.

671
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,210
You might get caught.
How can I not worry?

672
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,000
You're so sweet, Bok-ju.

673
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,500
Hey, don't touch me.

674
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,630
-Why not? Why can't I touch you?
-Do you want to be put behind bars?

675
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,000
You're finally back to being yourself.

676
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,840
Cheer up, you fool.
Being chatty and bubbly is your charm.

677
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,750
Being all quiet makes you so boring.

678
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,500
Call me whenever you need a mood booster.

679
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,080
I'll tease you.

680
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,500
Hey.

681
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,540
You got permission,
so use the front door.

682
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,090
-I'm taking the back door.
-Okay. Be careful.

683
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,080
Hey.

684
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,500
I had fun today...

685
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,250
thanks to you.

686
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,420
Dormitory

687
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,500
I had fun today, too.

688
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,630
Thanks to you.

689
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:56,500
Student Dormitory

690
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Coach Choi found my diet journal
in the weightlifting room.

691
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,080
Weightlifting Department

692
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,670
Gosh, Jeong Joon-hyung.
That was so unlike him.

693
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,380
Oh, well.

694
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,630
They share the same blood after all.

695
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,290
I do see a tiny bit of resemblance
between Dr Jeong and him.

696
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
A teeny-weeny bit.

697
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,500
You woke up early today, Si-ho.

698
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,710
Yes, I have a competition today.

699
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,710
I heard you went home. You're back early.

700
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,920
Yes. I got up early somehow.

701
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,130
How are you feeling?

702
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,290
You didn't look well yesterday.

703
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,340
I'm fine. I'm strong as steel.

704
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,340
Thanks for your concern.

705
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,460
Good luck with your competition.
I'll be rooting for you.

706
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,960
I'm going to take a quick nap now.

707
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,460
They are saying...

708
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,340
-What are you doing?
-I knew it.

709
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,040
-I don't know.
-What do you mean?

710
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,790
-Gosh, I'm so tired.
-Cut it out.

711
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,040
This won't work, right?

712
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,420
You should've woken me up.
How could you leave without me?

713
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
I thought you were skipping the run.

714
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,790
Come here for a second.

715
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,290
What's the matter?

716
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,090
Seon-ok is so mad at us right now.

717
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,880
She's mad that I knew about it
but didn't tell her.

718
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,500
She thinks we excluded her on purpose.

719
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,590
Things got so messed up.

720
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,420
Geez, that's not what happened.
What a fool.

721
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,090
What do we do?

722
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,630
You know how bull-headed she can be.

723
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,290
She can be so difficult.

724
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,750
It's all my fault.

725
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,880
Dad

726
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:45,420
Bok Chicken

727
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,670
I'm here, Dad.

728
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,250
I said to come by when you have time.
You didn't have to come so early.

729
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,000
-Have you had breakfast yet?
-Yes, I ate two plates.

730
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,170
Coach Choi will buy me jokbal, too.

731
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,630
Let me. I'll do it.

732
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,080
How are you feeling by the way?

733
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,500
Didn't you receive haemodialysis
too late yesterday?

734
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,460
Don't pretend that
you're worried about me.

735
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,380
Why did you lie to me
if you care about me that much?

736
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,090
Take this.

737
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,750
-What is this?
-Just open it. I got it for you.

738
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,090
I heard girls use
things like that these days.

739
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,500
Don't use it during training.

740
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,460
Just use it when you go out
or when you want to dress up.

741
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,040
It's a pretty colour.

742
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,250
They said it just came out.

743
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,840
Apparently, it's the most popular
product at the moment.

744
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,630
Everything looked the same to me, though.

745
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
What do you think? Do I look pretty, Dad?

746
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,460
I'm not used to it.

747
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,500
Eat something before you go.

748
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,750
I have ribs in the refrigerator.

749
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,750
Shall I grill some?
Or do you want braised ribs?

750
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,040
Can you make me both?

751
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,290
Have some shame, will you?

752
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,090
Do you want spicy braised ribs?

753
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,500
Best of luck, Song Si-ho
of Haneol Sport University.

754
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Si-ho.

755
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,630
Don't forget to keep your balance, okay?

756
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,090
Do every move accurately
and pay attention to your legs.

757
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:07,960
Be especially careful
with the pivot position.

758
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,000
No. 4 for Ribbon.

759
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:12,840
Song Si-ho of Haneol Sport University.

760
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,500
-Go, Si-ho!
-You got this!

761
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,790
-You look stunning!
-Best of luck!

762
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,090
Hey, Joon-hyung. What are you doing?

763
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,500
Go faster!

764
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,170
Do you think you're out on a walk?
Get ready to do a turn.

765
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,040
Go, go. Keep going.

766
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,170
Goodness!

767
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,250
You have to go faster.

768
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,380
Kick harder. Harder.

769
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,420
Go faster. Keep going.

770
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,880
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Why don't you have energy today?

771
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,290
You used to go another 14 to 15m
effortlessly after a turn.

772
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:17,750
Hey, you fool.

773
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,250
Where did you sleep last night?

774
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,420
What are you talking about?
I told you I was up all night.

775
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,630
My goodness.

776
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,040
Do you expect me to believe
that you stayed out all night alone?

777
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,880
When did you leave, who were you with
and what time did you get back?

778
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,090
Be quiet.

779
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,670
I have a lot on my mind right now.

780
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,880
Gosh, I'm speechless.

781
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,920
I put on a big show
to cover for you yesterday.

782
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,040
I told the house master you had
diarrhoea and ran for the toilet.

783
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,420
Gosh. I was quick to think of that.

784
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,960
He just pretended to be fooled
because he didn't want to bother.

785
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,380
Where are you going? Wait for me.

786
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,250
I have things to do. I'll see you later.

787
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,250
-All right.
-Hurry up.

788
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:03,080
Rhythmic Gymnastics Team

789
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,290
All of you did so well
at the competition today.

790
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,040
Review your mistakes carefully at home.

791
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,920
-Okay?
-Yes.

792
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:15,500
-You're dismissed.
-Thank you.

793
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,750
Congratulations.

794
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,630
I liked your performance today.

795
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,500
Hang in there.

796
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,130
What was that?

797
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,340
Hi, Joon-hyung.

798
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,040
Can I see you for a minute
if you're not practising?

799
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,710
-Joon-hyung.
-You're here.

800
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,710
Did you do well on the competition?

801
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:02,960
Yes, I did.

802
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,040
Good for you.

803
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,710
My mirror broke this morning,

804
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,340
so I thought I'd have bad luck today.

805
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:13,090
But I guess it meant the opposite.

806
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,040
Si-ho.

807
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,040
-Yes?
-Was it you?

808
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,710
I saw you in the morning a few days ago.

809
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,340
You were going
into the weightlifting gym.

810
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,500
It's not you, is it?

811
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,880
Why ask when you already sensed it?

812
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,090
What?

813
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:40,250
Yes, it's me. I did it.

814
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,710
I left her diet journal at
the weightlifting gym on purpose.

815
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,380
Why?

816
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,880
Why did you do that?

817
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,290
What good would it do to you?

818
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,920
Do you know how much trouble
you caused Bok-ju?

819
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,090
What about you?

820
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,420
Why are you so upset?

821
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,790
-What?
-It's none of your business.

822
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,210
Why are you getting angry and
lashing out at me over her?

823
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,080
Is she your girlfriend?

824
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,670
-Si-ho.
-Fine.

825
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,630
I hated seeing you laugh
when you were with her.

826
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,090
It annoys me that she can disarm you.
But a weight clinic?

827
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,630
It was ridiculous that she went there.

828
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,420
Why is a weightlifter trying to
lose weight and for who?

829
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,290
What has become of you? We're not...

830
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:26,380
We're not in whatever relationship
you're thinking.

831
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,090
-She likes someone else.
-What about you?

832
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,210
How do you feel about her?

833
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,040
I don't even know
why I have to explain this to you,

834
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,290
-but we went to the same school...
-I hate that, too.

835
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,630
I don't know what's wrong with me,

836
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,460
and I'm worried if I'm going crazy.

837
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,630
But I hate it.

838
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,000
I hate that you're with someone,

839
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,040
and I hate that you're smiling
at someone other than me.

840
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:59,420
So don't push me or I'll go crazier.

841
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:16,710
He was worried because you missed
your appointment without calling.

842
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,380
I should call the clinic and tell them
that I won't be going anymore.

843
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,080
What excuse should I give?

844
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,210
Joon-hyung

845
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,590
Hi, Joon-hyung. It's me.

846
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,250
Tell me. What should I tell Dr Jeong?

847
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,710
Hey. What are you up to?

848
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,210
Why do you keep calling
and seeing Joon-hyung?

849
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,670
I heard you like someone else.

850
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,090
Why are you making passes at Joon-hyung?

851
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:57,340
Making passes?
What are you talking about?

852
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,960
I was the one who left
your diet journal at the gym.

853
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,750
What? What did you just say?

854
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,040
Weightlifting Fairy
I don't think I can go there anymore.

855
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,920
-I'm going abroad to study.
-What is your wish these days?

856
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,420
I wish the person I like
would like me back.

857
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,090
-Do you want to go see a movie?
-A movie?

858
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:32,880
Gosh. Your boyfriend is so sweet.

859
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,090
Joon-hyung wants you to leave.
His brother is on his way here.

860
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,630
I'm angry that
you're close with Joon-hyung.

861
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:41,790
-I'm sorry, Chubs.
-I'll never find love again.

862
