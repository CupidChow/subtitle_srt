1
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,850
-Go, Blue Team!
-Go, White Team!

2
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,850
-Go, Blue Team!
-Go, White Team!

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,700
2005 Jangyi Elementary School's
Autumn Field Day

4
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,590
-Go, White Team!
-Go, White Team!

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,360
Joon-hyung, you better run fast.

6
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,410
If you lose, you'll be in trouble.

7
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,510
If you don't do this right,
I'll punch you.

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,830
-Go, White Team!
-Go, White Team!

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,630
Hurry up and run!

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,330
-Hurry up!
-Come on.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,420
Run! Hurry up!

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,830
-I'll kill him.
-What's wrong with him?

13
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,830
What are you doing, Mr Reverse?
Are you cleaning?

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,960
Our team lost because of you.

15
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,770
You're saying you can eat
the whole thing at once?

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,590
It's true. I can eat it in one bite.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,270
-Stop lying, Bok-ju.
-What? I'm serious.

18
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,930
He only runs the opposite way.

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,520
Don't talk to a fool who only
runs the opposite way.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,520
Move, you punk!

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,020
Help!

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,140
-Wow, it's Kim Bok-ju.
-That was amazing.

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,980
No wonder her nickname is Chubs.

24
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,930
Will you get off now?

25
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,600
Oh my gosh!

26
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,890
You can touch the bottom with your feet.

27
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,270
There you go.

28
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,020
Here.

29
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,060
Take this, too.

30
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,060
Anyway, thank you.

31
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,140
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you.

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,730
I don't know why the handkerchief
shouldn't be washed but sorry anyhow.

33
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,480
Kim Bok-ju.

34
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,100
So it's you.

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,730
Chubs!

36
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,680
Oh, that. Are you...

37
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,130
...that skinny Mr Reverse?

38
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,100
Yes, I'm Joon-hyung who ran
the race the opposite way.

39
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,140
Hey, you've changed so much.

40
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,230
You're all grown up.

41
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,740
You're all grown up, too.

42
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,720
I thought you'd grow chubbier
instead of getting taller.

43
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,180
It's really great to see you.

44
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,200
Yes, it's great to see you, too.

45
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,890
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,410
I have training, so I need to go.
Gosh, I'm late.

47
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,910
I knew she looked familiar.

48
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Hey.

49
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,680
I accept your apology.

50
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,390
We're even now
after the bicycle accident.

51
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,810
It was good to see you.

52
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,350
See you again, Chubs.

53
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,930
Take care.

54
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,320
EPISODE 2
When I Fall in Love with You

55
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,090
Really?

56
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,600
That handsome swimmer went to
the same elementary school as you?

57
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,270
That's right.

58
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,160
He was so short and skinny back then.

59
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,230
How did he get so tall?

60
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,310
Now he's such a cool and smooth talker.

61
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,980
What a misfortune.

62
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,770
What do you mean? It's a blessing.

63
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,360
Introduce me to him.
I'll take care of the rest.

64
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,820
Do you think he's a fool?
He's not going to fall for you.

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,690
My mum said plump women
are like a hidden beauty.

66
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,240
Once I lose weight,
I'll be as beautiful as any celebrity.

67
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,960
Stop talking nonsense.

68
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,050
-You're still a weightlifter.
-Be quiet.

69
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,140
I'm in a serious situation.

70
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,830
I don't have a good feeling
about it at all.

71
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,520
Hey, Chubs.

72
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,390
-Who dared call me "Chubs"?
-Who was that?

73
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Hey!

74
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,600
I knew I had an ominous feeling
about this.

75
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,850
Chubs.

76
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Come on.

77
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,050
Hey, let's go.

78
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,600
-Wait for us.
-Hey.

79
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,930
Where are you going? The cafeteria?

80
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,140
Today's menu is bulgogi.

81
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,890
Enjoy it.

82
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,350
Chubs.

83
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,730
You have such broad shoulders.
Keep working hard.

84
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,710
-Let's go.
-Okay.

85
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,980
-Hey, why is he calling you Chubs?
-Was that your childhood nickname?

86
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,820
-You were called "Chubs"?
-"Chubs"?

87
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,160
Chubs, Chubs!

88
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,730
They're eating so much.

89
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,520
It's impressive.

90
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,060
How could they eat so much?

91
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,140
Shall we get one more tray?

92
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,310
-One more tray?
-I think Bok-ju is already full.

93
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,850
-No, I'm not.
-You hesitated. It means you're full.

94
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,850
I can eat one more tray.

95
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,980
Hey, Chubs.

96
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,480
-What, Chubs?
-Chubs?

97
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,390
Why are you eating so little?

98
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,390
No, wait. It must be your second tray.

99
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,310
Enjoy your food, Chubs.

100
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,770
Hey.

101
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,980
-Did he call her Chubs?
-I think so.

102
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,560
-Go, weightlifters.
-Let's go!

103
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,480
-Go, weightlifters.
-Let's go!

104
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,100
Haneol Sport University

105
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,060
Good morning, Chubs.

106
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,790
Give me a high-five.

107
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
Give me a high-five.

108
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,830
High-five.

109
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,650
I'll leave you alone if you do.

110
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,110
-Give me a high-five.
-You punk.

111
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,680
Come on, run.

112
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,140
-Stop it.
-Be careful, okay?

113
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,350
Hello, Chubs.

114
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,680
Jeong Joon-hyung.

115
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,520
From now on,

116
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,810
stop calling me Chubs.

117
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,140
I'm not Chubs anymore.

118
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,770
I'm warning you.

119
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,270
For your information,

120
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,680
I beat up men, too.

121
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,100
Understand?

122
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,520
You don't like that nickname, do you?

123
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,980
I'm sorry, Chubs.

124
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,100
-What?
-Yes?

125
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,390
No, I won't come.

126
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,100
Come on, I don't want to.

127
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,850
What do you want to tell me now?

128
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,770
What is it?

129
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,770
Closer?

130
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,600
What is it?

131
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,060
-Hey!
-I said I beat up men, too.

132
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,180
This is just a warning.

133
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,180
You better be careful.

134
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,480
Hey!

135
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,890
I can't help
calling you by that nickname.

136
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,180
Once Chubs, always Chubs.

137
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,020
See you again, Chubs.

138
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,430
Her body seems heavy.

139
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,520
What's wrong with you?

140
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,430
-What did I do?
-Stop it.

141
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
When she came forward,
I thought my life was at risk.

142
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,020
She's a weightlifter after all.

143
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,060
Why do you keep teasing her?

144
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,520
I don't know, but it's so much fun.

145
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,800
It's funny that Bok-ju is a weightlifter.

146
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,390
It's also fun to see her get upset.

147
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,270
Other than getting taller,
she hasn't changed much.

148
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,810
You're having fun upon your life.

149
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,980
-You're a man of great calibre.
-It's so much fun!

150
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,380
Geez, Joon-hyung is driving me crazy.
Who does he think he is?

151
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,810
He teases you more
because you get so upset.

152
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,930
I can see that he's having a lot of fun.

153
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,980
It's not like you're completely innocent.

154
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,860
You made him look like a pervert.

155
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,770
Hey, it was just a misunderstanding.

156
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,060
-I already apologised to him.
-Anyhow,

157
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm so jealous of you.

158
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,600
I wouldn't mind if he teases me.

159
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,930
I'd love to have
such a handsome friend like him.

160
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,770
Isn't it pleasing just to look at him?
He's such an eye candy.

161
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,730
Aren't you proud that you know him?

162
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,520
He's not an eye candy.
He makes my blood boil.

163
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,890
You say that, but
doesn't your heart flutter a little?

164
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,730
What?

165
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,600
Such a handsome friend
approaches you out of the blue,

166
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,970
but your heart doesn't flutter at all?

167
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,680
I bet she's itching
to go on a date with him.

168
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,060
He's not handsome at all.
And I don't fall for every handsome man.

169
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,100
Unlike you two,
I'm not interested in men at all.

170
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,140
I can't think about dating.
I'm too busy with weightlifting.

171
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,890
Of course you fall for handsome men.

172
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,060
-Could you give us more pickles?
-Coming. Oh, goodness.

173
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,520
Excuse me?

174
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,180
Please give us more water.

175
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,230
-This is Bok Chicken.
-Four glasses of beer coming up.

176
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,730
We have many deliveries.
You'll have to wait 30 minutes.

177
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,770
Okay, we'll hurry. Thank you.

178
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,850
Dad, one half fried, half spicy.

179
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,850
The business is going really well.

180
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,140
-I think this place will get bigger.
-You're right.

181
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,100
-It's delicious.
-Help yourself.

182
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,850
Did you hear the order?

183
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,430
I'm not deaf.
You should go back to school.

184
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,680
-You're fired now.
-Oh, come on.

185
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,810
We didn't even discuss it.

186
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,060
Fine.

187
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
What?

188
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,970
I'm not asking you to read my palm.

189
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,680
I'll have you pay for my work.

190
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,100
Otherwise, I'll report you to the
Ministry of Labour for not paying me.

191
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,520
What did you say?

192
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,770
Then you should pay me
for raising you all these years.

193
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,810
You eat twice as much as other people.

194
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,600
I work so hard to support you,
yet you don't work on weightlifting.

195
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,600
And you're worse than her, you punk!
Why did you call her here?

196
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
How could we refuse to serve
a big group of customers?

197
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,060
If you cook and I serve,
who would do the deliveries?

198
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,520
Don't talk back at me.

199
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,390
Could we get some more popcorn?

200
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,730
Yes, Sir.

201
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,020
-Isn't the popcorn delicious?
-I'm thirsty.

202
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,180
My goodness.

203
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,020
-Your popcorn is coming up soon.
-Shall we order some chicken?

204
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,890
-This place makes good popcorn.
-Fine.

205
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,390
Please bring us a lot of popcorn.

206
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,100
Those cheap punks,
how much popcorn do they need...

207
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,020
-for just two glasses of beer?
-Watch your mouth.

208
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,270
He's the pride of
Haneol Sport University.

209
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,980
He's on the national shooting team.

210
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,600
It's Jong-suk.

211
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,020
People like him help us
with our business.

212
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,060
You don't know how to run a business.

213
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,680
He totally belongs to me.

214
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,680
Get the popcorn.

215
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,430
Get it before I beat you.

216
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,180
-Joon-hyung, your laundry.
-We did your laundry.

217
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,140
Gosh, thank you.
It must be hard being the minions.

218
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,980
-Didn't you do mine?
-No.

219
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,730
You rarely put out your laundry.

220
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,230
Put it out already. Stop wearing
the same clothes over and over.

221
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,890
Hey, let me clear this up.

222
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,770
I swear I'm not dirty or lazy.

223
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,850
I just don't want to trouble them.

224
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,810
By the way, I'm hungry.
Our dear juniors are working so hard.

225
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,850
Why don't you treat them some food?

226
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,890
You're the one who's hungry.
I don't know why I should...

227
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,730
buy them food.

228
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,350
-Do you want me to?
-Thank you.

229
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,060
-You want it?
-Yes.

230
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,930
-All right!
-Yes!

231
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,060
Let's go!

232
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,100
-Yes!
-Joon-hyung is the best!

233
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,390
What's this? A dressing table?

234
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,930
Dad must've picked it up
on the street again.

235
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,020
Why are you giving it to them?

236
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,770
I don't know if you'd like
this popcorn or not.

237
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,060
Please help yourselves.

238
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,310
Wait. Excuse me.

239
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,310
Have we met before?

240
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Weren't you on the weekend drama?

241
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,140
You're the patient next to the
lead character in the hospital.

242
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,100
Gosh.

243
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,060
Yes. I think that's me.

244
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,850
That was me.

245
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,520
That was only a few scenes.
You have a good eye.

246
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,390
I've never seen a celebrity before.
This is amazing.

247
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,100
-He's handsome.
-You're so handsome.

248
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,520
Celebrities are nothing special.
We also drink, pass gas,

249
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,890
go to the toilet
and do everything normal people do.

250
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,230
Come on. You also look like
the main character of a cartoon.

251
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,730
You can eat all this. Please eat up.

252
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,270
He called you a celebrity.

253
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,680
Dad, where'd you get the dressing
table? Is it from the street again?

254
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,020
No, it's not.

255
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,770
You've been complaining that
we don't have a big mirror.

256
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,310
Are you saying you actually
bought that? You?

257
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,560
Of course I did.

258
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,180
I got it at a cheap price
off the Internet.

259
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,890
You said athletes don't need a mirror.
You're cold outside and warm inside.

260
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,060
What? I'm cold?

261
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,600
But warm inside.

262
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,180
I'm saying you're considerate,
but pretend not to be.

263
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,640
Gosh. What are you saying?

264
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,480
Dae-ho, go deliver this chicken.

265
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,850
I'm a celebrity that people recognise.
I can't be seen as a delivery guy now.

266
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,680
Dad, I'll deliver it. Where is the place?

267
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,770
-Your school.
-All right.

268
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,890
I should... I should go instead.

269
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,730
My goodness.

270
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,600
It's been over 30 minutes
since we ordered.

271
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,600
-Let's order some place else.
-Why?

272
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,680
That place's chicken is delicious.

273
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,520
-You little...
-It'll be here. Be patient.

274
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,060
I'm starving.

275
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,850
Did somebody order fried chicken
from Bok Chicken?

276
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,390
Chicken delivery. It's from Bok Chicken.

277
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,060
-We did!
-It's us!

278
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,020
Do you deliver chicken, too?

279
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,060
One fried chicken, one spicy
and one teriyaki.

280
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,770
-That'll be 38 dollars.
-All right.

281
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,680
You do all sorts of things. Can you
work and train at the same time?

282
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,350
That'll be 38 dollars.

283
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,890
Pay her already. She's waiting.

284
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,390
Chubs looks tired.

285
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,600
I should let her rest.

286
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,520
I'll try them first.

287
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,680
I'll pay you if they're delicious.

288
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,060
Why don't you take a seat over there?

289
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,180
Looking at a big person like you sweat
makes me very worried.

290
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,810
Let's eat! Give me the drumstick.

291
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,930
-Okay. Let's eat.
-Give me the drumstick. Let's eat.

292
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,810
-Okay.
-It's my treat.

293
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,600
I owe you one, so it's my treat.

294
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,060
Enjoy.

295
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,180
-Then, let's eat. Let's eat first.
-Okay.

296
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,850
Where is it?

297
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,100
I should've just paid her.
Why did I put myself in trouble?

298
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,890
Bok Chicken

299
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,520
I found it.

300
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,100
You should go.
It's time for the individual training.

301
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,180
All right. Go inside, Dad.

302
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,060
Dad?

303
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,600
That's right. This is from the delivery.

304
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,430
-Didn't they pay with a card?
-What?

305
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,390
No, they paid cash.

306
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,930
-I'll see you at the hospital.
-Forget it. You don't have to come.

307
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,730
All right, Mr Kim.
Please go inside and get some rest.

308
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,680
-Bye.
-I said go inside. Come on.

309
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,810
-Just go.
-Fine.

310
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
She's a good daughter.

311
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,020
Do we have to ride this
to the training centre?

312
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,890
Why? Did our bus break down?

313
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,180
I guess so.

314
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,180
They didn't even tell us about it.

315
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,890
Hey, enough dawdling.
We don't have time, so get in there.

316
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,680
-This won't work.
-It'd be so suffocating.

317
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,180
Be quiet.

318
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,270
Consider yourselves lucky.

319
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,100
Hyung-chul's great-grandmother
passed away, so he's not here.

320
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,060
If that fatso was here... Gosh.

321
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,600
-Be thankful and get in.
-That's a relief.

322
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,600
-Come on.
-Coach Choi!

323
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,520
Guys!

324
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,640
Wait for me.

325
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,850
I took a cab here.

326
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,600
My mum said I don't have
to go to the cemetery.

327
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,850
-Gosh.
-Your mum said...

328
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,060
you don't have to go to the cemetery?

329
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,230
Get in. Hurry up.

330
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,270
-Let's go.
-Hyung-chul.

331
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,980
-Yes, Ma'am.
-Why didn't you go to the cemetery?

332
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,270
-My mum said...
-Get in.

333
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,810
-All right.
-Get in now.

334
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,310
-Let's go.
-Hurry up.

335
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,060
-My goodness.
-Oh, boy.

336
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,350
-Gosh, no!
-Wait!

337
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,180
-Goodness.
-Move a bit.

338
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,140
-Come on.
-Quiet down.

339
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,520
All right.

340
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,810
-We can't go on like this.
-Gosh.

341
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,230
-Don't come here!
-Oh, dear.

342
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,480
-I'm good here.
-Goodness.

343
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,890
Hey. Wait here. My gosh.

344
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,850
I can't take this anymore.

345
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,600
Wait here.

346
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,480
Thank you, Sir.

347
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,350
Are you happy now?

348
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,310
Weightlifting Team

349
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,560
This is what I'm talking about.

350
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,600
This is surprising.
They never do the things we ask for.

351
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,600
They reduced our budget by 30 percent.

352
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,390
What? That's absurd.

353
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,180
They already cut it by 10 percent.

354
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,520
That doesn't mean they can't do it again.

355
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,480
They can reduce it as much as they want.

356
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,180
They told me to cut down
on our food expenses.

357
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,180
Makes you want to go
throw a fit at them, right?

358
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,060
I can't believe they'd do this to us.

359
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,390
How can they expect us
to feed the kids less food?

360
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,060
-They can't lift weights that way.
-The kids are watching. Smile.

361
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,770
Coach, hurry up.

362
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,310
Giving them less food
will teach them a lesson.

363
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,890
It'll motivate them.

364
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,850
-Hurry up and get in.
-Don't push me.

365
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,100
Why would he want to eat chicken?

366
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,350
Welcome. Please have a seat.

367
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,520
Hey. You said you'd treat us lunch.

368
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,850
What? Why can't you eat chicken
for lunch?

369
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,810
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

370
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,100
We'll have two fried chickens
and one spicy chicken.

371
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,390
Two fried and one spicy? Okay, got it.

372
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,140
Weightlifting Champion

373
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,060
Let's go.

374
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,230
-How much is it?
-Yes.

375
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,430
Two fried chickens, one spicy chicken
and three cans of coke are 46 dollars.

376
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,270
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

377
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,560
Oh, right.

378
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,850
Here.

379
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,600
This is what I owe you.

380
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,810
What? From when?

381
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,390
About two, three or four weeks ago?

382
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,060
-Thank you for the food.
-Two, three...

383
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,730
Hey, wait!

384
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,270
Chang-geol.

385
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,850
What's the matter?

386
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
I don't remember
putting anything on tab for him.

387
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,520
He's saying I did.

388
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,520
Let's split it.

389
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,180
Gosh, it hurts.

390
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,390
Come here.

391
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,060
Good work today, everyone.

392
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,680
Go to a sauna and relax.

393
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,600
And don't forget to do some stretching
before you go to bed.

394
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,890
Great work! You're dismissed.

395
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,730
Dismissed!

396
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,100
Good job, everyone. Now go. Go on, go.

397
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,100
Bye.

398
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,140
-Let's go, Coach. We should...
-Coach Choi.

399
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,100
What, you're dismissed.

400
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,930
You two said you'd take us out
for dinner after today's training.

401
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,180
Dinner?

402
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,020
-Yes.
-That's right.

403
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,520
-You said you'd take us out.
-You said you'd treat us to a meal.

404
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,810
Did I say that?

405
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,520
-You did!
-We clearly heard you!

406
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
-Don't back out now.
-You said we'd eat barbecue!

407
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,930
You said you'd treat us to barbecue!

408
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,680
-All right. All right.
-You promised us.

409
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,350
-Seriously.
-Let's do it. Let's go for dinner!

410
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,020
Since when are burgers
the same thing as barbecue?

411
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,270
Tell me about it.

412
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,480
-Isn't this just a snack?
-Hey.

413
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,310
This is a meal. What you eat
in-between meals is called a snack.

414
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,100
You guys are so spoiled.
Give it to me if you don't want it.

415
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,810
-Give it back.
-Thank you for the burger!

416
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,140
Hey, eat mine. I don't have any appetite.

417
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,810
It's okay.

418
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,520
Please don't worry, Coach.

419
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,430
Just eat yours. Hey.

420
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,680
Hyung-chul, eat mine.

421
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,600
I ate instant noodles earlier,
so I'm not hungry.

422
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,560
I'm really okay.

423
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,890
Don't worry. Just eat it. Eat it already.

424
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,600
Was there something wrong with the
noodles? It's sitting in my stomach.

425
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,270
Should I prick my finger
to make it go down?

426
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,060
-Ouch, my stomach.
-Guys.

427
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,270
Get up. Let's go.

428
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,430
Go where?

429
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,850
Those burgers won't give you
enough energy to lift weights.

430
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,270
Let's go for barbecue. Come on.

431
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,770
-Sweet!
-Nice!

432
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,390
-Let's go!
-Head Coach Yoon.

433
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,600
-Let's go.
-Come on, guys!

434
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,350
-Coach, you're the best!
-Where are we going?

435
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,730
My feet are cramping.

436
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,350
My darling!

437
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,310
You didn't answer my calls.
Where have you been?

438
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,520
Gosh, where did I leave my phone?
Oh, I left it inside.

439
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,020
I'm so forgetful.

440
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,890
You're still so gorgeous.

441
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,890
It's been a long time, ex-boyfriend.

442
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,520
I know.

443
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,230
It's been a long time.

444
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,480
I guess the food in Taereung is good.

445
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,810
You look healthy and well.

446
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,930
They do have good food there,

447
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,810
but I decided to come back
because I missed you.

448
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,180
If you're trying to sound me out,
don't bother.

449
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,480
I'm at peace now.

450
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,480
I know.
I was just kidding to break the ice.

451
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,020
But I must say that I'm happy to see you.

452
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,020
I'm glad to see you looking well.

453
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,890
I have to go inside now.

454
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,270
Right. Okay.

455
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,930
I can say hi to you
when I see you, right?

456
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,180
Of course. Ignoring each other
would be uncool and childish.

457
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
See you.

458
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,520
Ouch, it's hot!

459
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,480
-Eat up.
-You, too.

460
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,680
-Eat quickly.
-I'm going as fast as I can.

461
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,480
-We'd like 3 more servings of ribs.
-No, just 2 more.

462
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,270
Girls, make sure to control your pace.

463
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,680
-You know our routine, right?
-Of course.

464
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,810
We have to eat BFN.

465
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,390
That's how it should be done! Awesome.

466
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,680
By the way, what does BFN stand for?

467
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,100
Gosh, Ye-bin.

468
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,890
I'm disappointed in you, Ye-bin.

469
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,430
Shouldn't you know the basics?

470
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,350
Okay, listen up.

471
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,020
When eating at a barbecue place,

472
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,390
you get full quickly if you eat
without a proper strategy.

473
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
We came up with BFN...

474
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,560
to reduce chances of such mistakes
and enjoy our meal to the fullest.

475
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,430
First.

476
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,060
Step 1 Grilled meat

477
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,850
You eat grilled meat.

478
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,480
-Next is grilled marinated meat!
-Grilled marinated meat!

479
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,680
Step 2 Grilled marinated meat

480
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,560
When you're getting a little full
from the barbecue,

481
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,060
you have to order
the must-eat item, fried rice!

482
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,600
Five servings of fried rice, please.

483
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,980
Step 3 Fried rice

484
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,350
Step 4 Naengmyeon

485
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,310
The last step is cleansing
the palate with naengmyeon...

486
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,350
to conclude an authentically perfect
barbecue in the most efficient way.

487
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,980
So what do you think, girls?

488
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,430
You got first-hand tutelage
from the expert herself.

489
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,430
-We admire you.
-We admire you.

490
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,730
You girls are so adorable.

491
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,270
Eat some wraps, too.

492
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,680
Coach Choi, you should eat, too.

493
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,310
We live to eat after all.

494
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,730
Let's pig out today.

495
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,480
-Wait. Take this box, too.
-All right.

496
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,020
Take out all the recycling.

497
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,890
-My gosh. He startled me.
-My goodness, gosh.

498
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,850
Silly brat, you startled me.

499
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,060
-You startled us. Silly boy.
-I'm here.

500
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,230
-I'm hungry, Mum.
-You haven't eaten dinner yet?

501
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,390
I didn't have time.

502
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,520
-You lost weight.
-Shall we get something delicious?

503
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
-That sounds awesome.
-I'd love that.

504
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,980
-Let me take this out first.
-Okay.

505
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
-Go help your dad.
-Dad, wait up.

506
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,100
Dear Joon-hyung

507
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,310
Merry Christmas! From Mum

508
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,930
"From Mum."

509
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,680
Gosh, my pride is crushed.

510
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,180
I can't believe that was so close.
I mean, I'm a professional swimmer.

511
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,930
Hey, I know you went easy on me.

512
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,730
How dare you try to fool me.

513
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,180
You're so bold now, Joon-hyung.

514
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,730
Was it that obvious?

515
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,730
But honestly,
you're better than most amateurs.

516
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,850
-I've been swimming regularly.
-I know.

517
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,230
Aren't you a doctor?
How can you be so athletic?

518
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,270
You're too perfect that you irk me.

519
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,560
You even know so much
about classical music.

520
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,480
Hey.

521
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,890
You're so good at swimming.

522
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,390
Not really.

523
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,270
If I was so good, I wouldn't
get disqualified all the time.

524
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,810
What's up with him?

525
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,640
-Goodness.
-Here.

526
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,020
Are you worried about it?

527
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,060
-Starting it, I mean.
-Of course.

528
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,980
All I'm good at is swimming.
Obviously I'm stressed out about it.

529
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,930
Jae-yi.

530
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,350
If I don't swim,

531
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,100
would I be
just an average college student?

532
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,770
Maybe I'd work part-time...

533
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,310
and go on backpacking trips
during vacation.

534
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,930
Do you want to travel?

535
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,180
No, I'm just saying.

536
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,520
Swimming isn't going so well right now.

537
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,350
I feel restless.

538
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,270
You miss her, don't you?

539
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,890
Your mum.

540
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,350
Of course I always miss Mum.

541
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,680
-Our mum is great.
-I'm not talking about her.

542
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,180
Come on, I'm not a kid
who misses his mum.

543
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,140
Let's go home.

544
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,770
Haneol Sport University

545
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,140
Coach, time to get up.

546
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,480
-Gosh.
-Did you fall asleep here again?

547
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,310
You should sleep at home.

548
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,930
If you keep doing this,
it'll become a habit.

549
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,810
I must have fallen asleep.

550
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,270
-You're here early.
-Head Coach.

551
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,810
Why don't you two get back together?

552
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,520
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

553
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,980
signing as a guarantor
for her friend isn't a sin.

554
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,560
How could you divorce her just like that?

555
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,680
You can't go on like this.

556
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,060
You drink a lot
because you miss your children.

557
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,520
You pay a lot for child support, too.

558
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,600
And doesn't your wife only shop at
expensive department stores?

559
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,060
-Why are you angry?
-I'm not angry.

560
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,560
I'm saying this
because it's so frustrating.

561
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,930
She's a little immature
because she's still young.

562
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,310
Age has nothing to do with immaturity.

563
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,600
I'm sorry if it wasn't
my place to say this.

564
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,640
Don't spend your own money anymore.

565
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,270
I'll figure it out within our budget.

566
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,680
Come on, you can't do it alone.

567
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,520
I'll make it work somehow.

568
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,100
You should sleep at home from now on.

569
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,890
Please, I beg you.

570
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,270
Take care of yourself.

571
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,230
Gosh.

572
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,480
Look at that.
He has an upset stomach again.

573
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,430
I should've bought them earlier.
This is so annoying.

574
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,890
What did women do to deserve this?

575
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,060
What are you praying for?

576
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,060
A gold medal?

577
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,810
Just move along.
It's none of your business.

578
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,020
You're right. Good luck with training,
and don't get injured.

579
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,180
Why isn't he prying like usual?

580
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,930
Next.

581
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,270
I'm sorry for being late.

582
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,520
Coach Choi.

583
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,020
-What's that?
-I brought some snacks.

584
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,730
-Huddle, everyone.
-What is it?

585
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,480
Didn't you already digest your breakfast?

586
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,730
Let's take a break for some snacks.

587
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,770
Ta-da.

588
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,430
Here, catch it.

589
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,270
-Thank you.
-Let me have one.

590
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,060
-Here you go, Coach.
-I'm fine, thanks.

591
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,930
Come on, I bet you didn't have
proper breakfast either.

592
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,730
I had some rice with soup.

593
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,020
When did you get the snacks?

594
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,180
-I...
-Coach Choi.

595
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,730
It doesn't taste the same.
Isn't it from the same shop?

596
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,020
I got it from a different shop.
Doesn't it taste good?

597
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,890
-It's not good.
-It tastes fine to me.

598
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,520
-I don't like it at all.
-Me neither.

599
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,060
-It tastes strange.
-It's bad.

600
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,020
The ham doesn't taste the same.

601
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,430
-It smells bad.
-How different can gimbap get?

602
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,060
Just eat it.

603
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,310
You don't know how to be grateful.

604
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

605
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,890
Thank you.

606
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,480
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

607
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,480
Take your mark.

608
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,140
Keep it up. Keep going.

609
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,680
Move, move, move! Hurry up.

610
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,930
Come on, let's go.

611
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,270
Keep going.

612
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,600
You're almost there.

613
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,480
Stop the time.

614
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,430
Good job.

615
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,730
-Good job.
-Hurry up.

616
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,060
Good job.

617
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,350
This might make me lose all of my hair.

618
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,930
-Do you want it?
-Yes, please.

619
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,140
Joon-hyung.

620
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,310
I heard you were offered to be
Tae-hoon's private training partner.

621
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,140
-What?
-I heard you rejected it.

622
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,520
-Is that true?
-What?

623
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,600
You're impressive.

624
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,270
You even rejected an offer
from a famous swimmer.

625
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,850
You should have taken it.

626
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,140
You could earn money
by being his partner.

627
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,100
You could also travel abroad
with Tae-hoon.

628
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,060
Wouldn't that be better?

629
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,020
Having high self-esteem
can be a bad thing.

630
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,430
What a sociopath.

631
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,520
I'm sure he feels inferior to you.

632
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,930
Hey, are you okay?

633
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,810
Joon-hyung.

634
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,390
Yes.

635
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,560
What do you think?

636
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,270
Don't you think it's better?

637
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,730
I was thinking of suggesting
psychotherapy to Joon-hyung,

638
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,890
but some athletes reject
the idea of getting therapy.

639
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,600
Don't you have a knack...

640
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,270
for making people take your advice
by your extra friendliness?

641
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,560
Give it a try.

642
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,890
That sounds like a command.

643
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,180
Come on, that doesn't look good.

644
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,020
I'll do it.

645
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,520
There you go.

646
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,310
What's this?

647
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,430
-Were you the one who called me?
-Did I surprise you?

648
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,060
I was surprised to see him here for
some coffee, but it turns out...

649
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,100
-he wanted to see you instead.
-Don't say that.

650
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,730
I stopped by because
I was in the neighbourhood.

651
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,390
We already saw each other this morning.

652
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,890
What's wrong with seeing me again?
Silly boy.

653
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,020
You two sure are something.

654
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,350
Why don't you make a film
about brotherly love?

655
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,390
No, we're the opposite.

656
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,390
He's the kind but unattractive brother,
while I'm bad but very charming.

657
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,520
-Let me put this over your mouth.
-I'm sorry.

658
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,060
-Come here.
-I'm sorry. I was wrong.

659
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,520
I was thinking.

660
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,890
How about seeing a therapist?

661
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,430
I know some well-known therapists.

662
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,480
You could get a recommendation.

663
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,100
Is that what you thought about all day?

664
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,480
Gosh, you concern yourself too much.

665
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,310
It's better than not trying at all.

666
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,810
Many athletes see therapists, too.

667
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,060
Joon-hyung.

668
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,680
I understand, so text me when
you get me an appointment.

669
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,730
I'll give it a try.

670
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,100
I'm glad you decided to do it.
There's no harm in trying.

671
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,810
Okay.

672
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,980
Gosh, I didn't bring an umbrella.

673
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,980
Take this. I'll run.

674
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,100
It's not raining much. Let's share it.

675
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,100
I'm not crazy
to share an umbrella with a guy.

676
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,730
Bye, see you again.

677
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,230
Lost Dressing Table

678
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,020
Wow, it looks very similar to mine.

679
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:52,770
On November 16th, someone took my
dressing table. Please return it.

680
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,020
Oh, Dad! Seriously!

681
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,390
Why did you pick it off the street?
We aren't poor.

682
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,560
I really thought someone threw it away.

683
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,060
You're driving me crazy.

684
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,060
Why do you pick things off the street?
We're not a junk shop.

685
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,730
Fine, I'll put it back.

686
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,560
I'll put it back, okay?

687
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,390
What are you doing?
You might pass out again.

688
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,140
Then what should I do?

689
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,180
Dae-ho went out to play pool.

690
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,890
What do I do about Dad?
Why did he have to bring this home?

691
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,140
Is it okay for this to get wet?

692
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,680
Darn it.

693
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,560
Come on, hurry up.

694
00:43:58,850 --> 00:43:59,890
Do you need a hand?

695
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,480
-Pardon?
-It looks heavy.

696
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,390
No, no. It's all right.

697
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,810
Let's go.

698
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,430
Gosh, thank you.

699
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,810
Which way are you going?

700
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,600
If you're going this way,
I can walk with you.

701
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,810
I'm really okay.

702
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,100
I see.

703
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,270
I think people will badmouth me...

704
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,060
for making a lady carry this.

705
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Sorry?

706
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,770
A lady?

707
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,350
-Let me help you.
-No, no. It's okay.

708
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,480
He has such a nice voice, too.

709
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,560
My crazy heart,

710
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,640
calm down already.
He'll hear how fast you're beating.

711
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,180
You can put it down here.

712
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,600
Thank you so much.

713
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,430
It was on my way anyway.

714
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,350
Take the umbrella.

715
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,930
It's fine, I'm just going over there.

716
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,600
That's not exactly close.

717
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,850
I'm going right there.

718
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:32,100
-Thank you.
-No problem.

719
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,020
-I have to go this way.
-Right.

720
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,640
A lady.

721
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,060
I'm a lady?

722
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,600
Lady?

723
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,100
He called me a lady.

724
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,350
A lady.

725
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,480
Yes, Lady speaking...

726
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,310
No. I mean, Kim Bok-ju speaking.

727
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,930
Hey, Seon-ok.

728
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,390
What?

729
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,390
Emergency Medical Centre

730
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,100
Hey!

731
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,560
Woon-gi, are you all right?

732
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,270
Hey, are you okay?
Are you all right? My gosh.

733
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:25,600
Oh my gosh.

734
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,140
Are you okay? My goodness.

735
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,560
Nan-hee! Are you all right?

736
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,060
-I'm in so much pain.
-Bok-ju, you made it.

737
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,850
-What is going on?
-We're in so much pain.

738
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,060
Head Coach!

739
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,600
-Head Coach!
-Oh, hi.

740
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,980
Bok-ju, you're here.

741
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,100
They're okay.
It's because of the gimbap they ate.

742
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,100
It's mild food poisoning.
They just need to get a shot.

743
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,600
That's a relief.

744
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,060
Coach.

745
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,680
You're missing a shoe.

746
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,270
Gosh, when did I lose it?

747
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,850
Aging is making me forgetful.
Hang on a minute.

748
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,060
Good heavens.

749
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,020
You must've been so scared.

750
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,310
We've been eating gimbap every day.
What was wrong with it today?

751
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,180
Coach Choi, it was from
Elephant Snack House, right?

752
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,430
We should complain.

753
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,770
No.

754
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,350
It was me.

755
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,680
Pardon?

756
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,180
I made the gimbap.

757
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:28,850
Everyone got food poisoning
from the gimbap I made.

758
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:35,520
I shouldn't have bought those things
on clearance. I feel so guilty.

759
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,270
I must've been out of my mind. Goodness.

760
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,140
I'm so stupid.

761
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,520
You're being such a crybaby.

762
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,520
-I'm not.
-You're acting like you can't walk.

763
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,180
-Lie down.
-Gosh!

764
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,430
Oh, boy.

765
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,350
Seon-ok is totally fine.
Just how much gimbap did you eat?

766
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,980
Seon-ok has a strong stomach.

767
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,980
This country girl is used to eating
anything and everything.

768
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,890
You must be feeling better.

769
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,890
You couldn't even talk earlier.

770
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,850
I think I lost some belly fat.

771
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,560
Oh, right. Bok-ju.

772
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,600
What do you mean Coach Choi
made the gimbap herself?

773
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,480
-Was she trying to embezzle...
-Hey.

774
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,390
Don't you know what she's like?

775
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,140
Watch your tongue.

776
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,310
Why are you getting mad at me?

777
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,810
I'm sick.

778
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,560
Why did she do that?

779
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,020
I can't figure it out.

780
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,020
Hi, Woon-gi. It's me, Bok-ju.

781
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,060
I'm sorry, Coach Choi.

782
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,890
-It's because I'm incompetent.
-Please don't say that.

783
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,520
It's all my fault.

784
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,730
In order to save a bit of money,

785
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,180
I bought expired ingredients.

786
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,480
I'm sorry.

787
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,180
No.

788
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,850
I should've secured the budget...

789
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,480
one way or another.

790
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,520
You guys should be resting.

791
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,890
Head Coach Yoon, Coach Choi.

792
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,310
Don't forget to take the medicine.

793
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,020
Except for Bok-ju,

794
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,890
all of you should take tomorrow off.

795
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,390
Head Coach, we heard...

796
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:39,270
everything from Bok-ju.

797
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:43,480
We had no idea about the budget cut.
We should've been more thoughtful.

798
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,180
You know I have a big mouth.

799
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,100
We had a meeting about this issue.

800
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,060
We'll only have a snack
every three days...

801
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,930
in the form of either
one row of gimbap or a burger.

802
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,310
We'll buy sausages with our own money
to snack on when we're really hungry.

803
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,680
We'll get the medium size
instead of large.

804
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,180
We also agreed to use
toilet paper and other supplies...

805
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,060
at our dormitory
instead of the ones here.

806
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,890
And we'll only go out
for dinner together after matches.

807
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,140
Bok-ju can get us 50-percent
family discount at Bok Chicken.

808
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,810
That is all.

809
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,350
Gosh, these fools.

810
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,060
Hey.

811
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,770
Who said you can go ahead
and have a meeting about it?

812
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:39,730
Shall I teach you guys a lesson?

813
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,680
We know that we spend the most
amount of money on food and snacks.

814
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,180
We took it for granted
and didn't think about the cost.

815
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,890
We'll be more thoughtful from now on.

816
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,770
And we'll work hard!

817
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,560
-We'll do our best!
-We'll do our best!

818
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:07,930
All right.

819
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,060
It's...

820
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,350
This, too, shall pass...

821
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,100
and become precious memories.

822
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,100
It also motivates us to work harder.

823
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,390
Let's turn this around...

824
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,980
by doing a great job at the tournament.

825
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,980
-Got it?
-Yes!

826
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,060
-You guys are confident, right?
-Yes!

827
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,390
How many gold should we aim for?

828
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,270
-100.
-200!

829
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,100
We'll aim for four.

830
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,180
Let's win three. Please, guys.

831
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,730
You guys better win medals.

832
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,520
Here. I brewed this coffee myself.

833
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,600
The test is really long, right?

834
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,600
It makes me want to puke.
It's like the college entrance exam.

835
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:55,020
It's a basic test I need for the
counselling. Hang in there.

836
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,600
Let's talk after we get the result.

837
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:58,980
Okay.

838
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,480
Gosh. You're a promising swimmer.

839
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,270
The burden I feel is quite heavy.

840
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,930
-You have to finish it in an hour.
-The whole thing?

841
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,600
-You can do it.
-Are you serious?

842
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,980
-Begin.
-That's impossible.

843
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,600
-Begin.
-You must be kidding.

844
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,600
You have 59 minutes.

845
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,310
Weightlifting Team

846
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:26,100
Bok-ju, are you done with the training?

847
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,640
Hurry up and come home. Your dad...

848
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:36,930
Dad!

849
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,600
Dad!

850
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,350
Dad! Dad!

851
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,430
What's this? I thought Dad was sick.
Are you okay?

852
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,100
We tricked you.

853
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,850
Your dad pulled a trick
to show you the new dressing table.

854
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,270
-Uncle! Dad!
-What?

855
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:59,770
You wanted one, right?
You said it yourself.

856
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,100
It's pretty. I like the colour, too.

857
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,600
It looks classy. Is this expensive?

858
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,980
Wow. It has a drawer.

859
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,600
It looks good.

860
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,890
-You're early, Dr Jeong.
-Is my patient here?

861
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,770
Not yet. You still have 10 minutes.

862
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,230
Of course.

863
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,270
He's so handsome and polite
because he's a doctor.

864
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,060
Why does that make me so depressed?

865
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:54,100
What was I expecting?

866
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,140
-Hey, Bok-ju.
-Bok-ju.

867
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,060
What took you so long?

868
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,730
We can eat now.

869
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,810
Today's menu is your favourite
meat stew. Hurry up.

870
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,930
-Hey!
-Let's stop dreaming, Bok-ju.

871
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,810
He's a doctor for goodness' sake.

872
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,310
-He's in a different class.
-Hurry!

873
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,850
Bok-ju!

874
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,060
I'm coming.

875
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,730
-Hurry.
-I'm hungry. Hurry up, Bok-ju.

876
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,270
I'm starving here.

877
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:25,600
-Come on.
-I'm so hungry.

878
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,060
What are you doing, Bok-ju?

879
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,770
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going, Bok-ju?

880
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,180
Thank you for calling J Weight Clinic.

881
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,100
At 5 p.m.?

882
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,890
We'll make a reservation
for you, then. Okay.

883
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,560
Ms Kim Bok-ju.

884
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:49,810
Yes.

885
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,140
-Your next patient is here.
-Okay.

886
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,730
Ms Kim Bok-ju...

887
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,430
Aren't you...

888
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,060
-Yes. I met you a few days ago.
-Right?

889
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,560
Did you get home safe?

890
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,520
Is your arm okay?

891
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,560
-I'm fine.
-That's good to hear.

892
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,520
You carried such a heavy thing.

893
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,310
Are you here for a consultation?

894
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:20,430
Please sit down.

895
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,270
I guess we have...

896
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:27,680
a special bond.

897
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,180
Doctor.

898
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,980
Do you like Messi?

899
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,680
Excuse me?

900
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:48,730
Do you like Messi?

901
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,060
Special thanks to Lee Jong-suk.

902
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,310
Weightlifting Fairy

903
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,810
That's right.
There are no men in my life.

904
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:08,430
The dean even offered a prize.

905
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,180
-Why didn't you come to my clinic?
-Hey, Chubs!

906
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:14,270
-Am I a ghost? Talk to me.
-Go away, you punk.

907
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,810
You're drunk. You might fall.

908
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,890
Your hand is warm as always.

909
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,480
You don't even look like girls.

910
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,390
-Do you want a piece of me?
-What is it?

911
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,140
-Run!
-Did you fight because of me?

912
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,640
