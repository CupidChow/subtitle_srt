Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,330
Haneol Sport University
Weightlifting Team

3
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,900
Ms Bok-ju?

4
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,980
It is you, Ms Bok-ju.

5
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,900
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,360
Bok-ju! You should've called me
if you got here.

7
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,030
She said she wanted to see my school...

8
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,530
before she goes abroad,
so I told her to come.

9
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,380
Haneol Sport University
Weightlifting Team

10
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Jae-yi, let me explain.

11
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,690
Actually...

12
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,900
I'm a student here
in the weightlifting team.

13
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,980
I lied about majoring in cello
and also about going abroad to study.

14
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,360
I'm sorry, Dr Jeong.

15
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,360
I was also surprised
when I first saw her in your clinic.

16
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,730
But what could I do?

17
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,400
Bok-ju begged me to keep it a secret.

18
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,900
Still, you should've given me a heads-up.

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,440
I had no idea.

20
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,610
I'm saying I couldn't do that.

21
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,610
-She was so desperate.
-What's the reason?

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,940
-What?
-Why did she lie to come to my clinic?

23
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,280
She's a weightlifter.

24
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,780
Well, that's...

25
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,570
Maybe she wanted to lose weight.

26
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,610
It seemed like she recently
started liking someone.

27
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,320
She's a girl, too, after all.

28
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,150
That's understandable.

29
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,730
Anyway, Bok-ju had
a very hard time herself.

30
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,780
Her team found out about it.

31
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,980
Her coaches got so mad...

32
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,150
and her dad was furious.
It was a total mess.

33
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,780
Really?

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,690
Gosh, I feel guilty.

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,480
What should I do?

36
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,150
You didn't know anything.

37
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,070
It's her fault that she lied to you.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,980
But she's a strength athlete,
and I made her lose weight.

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,650
Forget it. It's all over now.

40
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,440
She lied to you about
going abroad to study...

41
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,070
because she can't
go to your clinic anymore.

42
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,820
Just don't mind her.

43
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,570
Who is the guy she likes?

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,570
Jae-yi.

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
What?

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,480
I'm hungry.

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,360
Why did he suddenly come back again?

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,820
It's all over now, right?

49
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,780
He must think I'm nothing
but a big liar, right?

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,150
This wasn't supposed to happen.
It's the worst. What do I do?

51
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,280
In order to make one lie true,

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,980
you need to make up seven more lies.

53
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,900
As one lie produced another lie...

54
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,900
and that lie bore yet another lie,

55
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,570
I've unintentionally become
a lying machine.

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,730
I'm so ashamed of myself.

57
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,690
EPISODE 9
The Merits of a Secret Crush

58
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,400
Bok-ju!

59
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,980
She's not here either.

60
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,940
Where did she go?
She's not answering her phone.

61
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,650
Did she eat ginseng or something?
What's wrong with her?

62
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,940
I'm not sure.

63
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,860
What if she ran into that doctor
despite our efforts?

64
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,150
That can't be.
Joon-hyung got her out safely.

65
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,280
-Tae-kwon said so.
-I know.

66
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,440
Then what's the source of
that superhuman strength?

67
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,150
-She hurt her back earlier, right?
-That crazy girl.

68
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,650
Hey, she stopped.
Go and stop all the crazy running.

69
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,980
I can't handle her either.
She's like a crazy bull right now.

70
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,980
-Stop it!
-Stop already!

71
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,150
You're losing your balance
as you go on, Si-ho.

72
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,980
All your movements are delayed because
you only focused on your turn.

73
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,280
This won't work. Let's play it safe
and just do four turns.

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,780
No, I'll try it again.

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,780
Okay. Keep on practising for now
and adjust it later if you can't.

76
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,900
That was amazing. Coach, did you see
how Soo-bin just did that?

77
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,280
That was amazing.

78
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,650
Why don't you practice
your own work instead?

79
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,400
I just wanted to give it a try.

80
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,690
To see how difficult it was.

81
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,940
Hello, Si-eon.

82
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,860
Did Dad really leave home?

83
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,780
-Did he take his things, too?
-Yes.

84
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,360
He said he'll be in Ulsan.

85
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,280
He found a job there on purpose.

86
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,070
Mum went to work
without even looking at him.

87
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,110
People keep coming to the house
to see if they want to buy it.

88
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,030
What have you been doing?

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,480
I asked you to stop this
from happening no matter what.

90
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,860
You should have stopped her.

91
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,320
-I talked to Mum, but...
-Did you think...

92
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,530
Mum would stop
if you talked to her just once?

93
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,480
You should have threatened her,

94
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,030
begged her to stop
or done anything you could.

95
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,360
This happened to us
all because of your gymnastics.

96
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,190
Don't look for me.

97
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,320
Si-eon!

98
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,690
No one can stop her. She's lost her mind.

99
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,070
I don't care anymore.

100
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,690
She'll be exhausted
before the night ends.

101
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,940
Just what is wrong with her?
I really want to know the reason.

102
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,480
I don't know either.

103
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,070
She must be dissatisfied about something.

104
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,980
I don't even want to know.

105
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,110
I'm tired of her acting like this.

106
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,530
It looks like she'll stop soon.

107
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,320
My goodness.

108
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,650
Take it off.

109
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,900
Get up.

110
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,980
My goodness, Bok-ju.
I'll die earlier because of this.

111
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,730
Hey.

112
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,650
-Aren't you going to tell me?
-It's none of your business.

113
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,480
Knowing won't do you any good.
Stay out of it.

114
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,690
Why can't your brother,
who's a gentleman unlike you,

115
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,690
meet with Bok-ju?

116
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,230
What's that? Are you trying to
make fun of me?

117
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,690
I prepared a special event to mark
our exeat in a long while.

118
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,030
I won't tell you if you don't tell me.

119
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,480
Fine, I don't care anyway.

120
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,610
It's a three-on-three date.

121
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,400
They're the queens of
Sukyoung Women's University.

122
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,980
One of them is my friend on social media.

123
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,280
She's absolutely beautiful
and photogenic like a celebrity.

124
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,610
What do you say?

125
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,570
I don't believe you.

126
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,400
What have we got to lose?
Let's check it out.

127
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,980
This might be a great opportunity for us.

128
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,820
Hello, Si-ho.

129
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,320
She's cold like the Ice Queen.

130
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,070
Your grip is too close.
Hold the weight more like this.

131
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,070
Bok-ju, tighten your hands more.

132
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,070
More, more!

133
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,780
Engage your abs more.

134
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,570
That's right. Engage them more.

135
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,900
Engage your abs. You look out of focus.

136
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,780
-Squat quicker.
-Coach Choi.

137
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,150
You should send them home early.

138
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,030
It's the last exeat before the match.

139
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,070
Coach, their weight
hasn't increased enough yet.

140
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,360
They need more strength.

141
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,980
-They can't be taking time off.
-Exactly my point.

142
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,860
They should eat
some healthy food at home.

143
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,860
Okay, Coach.

144
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,070
Eat with determination
and not for the taste.

145
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,530
Woon-gi must increase by 1kg
and Bok-ju by 1.5kg.

146
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,780
-Understand?
-Yes, Coach.

147
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,940
-Yes, Coach.
-Go and get some fresh air.

148
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,860
Let your family encourage you.
Relax and eat delicious food.

149
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,530
However, if your weights don't increase,

150
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,940
be prepared to eat 10 meals a day, okay?

151
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,280
Yes, Sir.

152
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,440
Isn't it difficult
to increase your weight?

153
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,690
It's okay. I'm not the only one
having a hard time.

154
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
If you're tired of eating protein,
try eating eggs with bread.

155
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,650
Sang-chul told me about it, so I tried.

156
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,070
I like it because of the texture.

157
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,900
Okay, I'll try it.

158
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,320
-Are you going straight home?
-Not yet.

159
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,190
Someone is picking me up.

160
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,150
-Goodness gracious.
-I'll try the recipe.

161
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,440
You can't just leave
after messing up the seat.

162
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,320
It's only some milk powder.

163
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,530
I don't need to pay for laundry, do I?

164
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,570
Bok-ju, I have to get going.

165
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,730
See you, Woon-gi.

166
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,400
Since you're English Literature majors,

167
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,360
travelling abroad wouldn't be
a problem...

168
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,360
since you're fluent in English
like native speakers, right?

169
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,570
That's not true.

170
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,860
You don't swim across the Pacific Ocean
just because you're a swimmer.

171
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,030
Cross the Pacific Ocean?

172
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,400
You have such a great sense of humour.

173
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,650
Are you...

174
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,980
usually this quiet?

175
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,780
Yes, compared to him.

176
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,530
Which category do you compete in?

177
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,940
Is it short distance?

178
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,730
Yes, that's why I don't talk much.

179
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,690
He's a short-distance swimmer.

180
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,980
Chubs

181
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,400
Excuse me for a moment.

182
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,360
Is this the incredibly busy Bok-ju?

183
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,860
Thank you so much for calling
after missing three of my calls.

184
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,110
Where are you? Are you home already?

185
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,280
No, I'm out.

186
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,400
Was Dr Jeong shocked yesterday?

187
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,570
-What did he say?
-Good job for holding back this much.

188
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,150
You must've been itching to find out.

189
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,400
Are you at the campus?

190
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,730
Hey.

191
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,530
Hey, Chubs!

192
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,980
Oh my gosh!

193
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,730
Why didn't you say you arrived?
You startled me!

194
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,400
Geez, why did you have to startle me?

195
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,150
What are you doing?

196
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,190
Why did you make holes in
the face of someone innocent?

197
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,150
It's because I was getting
bored of waiting.

198
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,280
What did Dr Jeong say?

199
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,440
Wow, finally you ask me that.

200
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,280
How did you manage to hold yourself back?

201
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,110
He probably thought that
I was just a crazy...

202
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,900
and stupid girl.

203
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,860
That's not necessarily true.

204
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,690
He was just flustered.

205
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,650
Of course he would be.
He found out that...

206
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,650
his patient is a weightlifter.

207
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,650
He asked why you had to lie to him,
so I made up an answer.

208
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,650
I said maybe you have a crush on someone.

209
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,570
Did you tell him who it was?

210
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,110
I have common sense, too.
Why would I tell him that?

211
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,320
Does he think I'm pathetic?

212
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,690
No, I don't think so.

213
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,150
He was just flustered.

214
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,190
If I hadn't told him
that I was a cellist,

215
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,610
he wouldn't see me as a crazy liar.

216
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,610
Why did I ever say
that I played the cello?

217
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,150
-I even went to a concert with him.
-Watch it.

218
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,650
You were happy to go on a date with him.

219
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,230
Are you blaming me for it now?

220
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,940
You can't do that!

221
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,230
I wasn't blaming you. I was just saying.

222
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,150
What's wrong with you?
Have you lost your mind?

223
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,360
Why am I so unlucky?

224
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,730
Forget weightlifting.

225
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,860
I want to turn into a puff of smoke
and disappear from Earth.

226
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,900
Turning into a puff of smoke...

227
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,480
would be impossible.

228
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,440
You weigh too much.

229
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,610
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,320
Being playful has become a habit.
I'll be careful from now on.

231
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,070
Do you want to go relieve your stress?

232
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,780
Come on, hurry up.

233
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,480
-Let's stop.
-We almost died, didn't we?

234
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,400
Bok-ju, watch me carefully.

235
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,230
I'll set a new record.

236
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,280
How's that? No one will be able
to break my record in three years.

237
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,190
Not even...

238
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,610
a male weightlifter can break it.

239
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,070
I set another record.

240
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,530
Take that, take that!

241
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,690
-Why doesn't it work?
-Be careful.

242
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,980
-You might break your fingers.
-Gosh!

243
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,690
It's not coming back up.
I think it's stuck.

244
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,980
Geez, I told you to be gentle.

245
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,280
-Why doesn't this work?
-Hey, stop it.

246
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Hey, get up.

247
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,860
-Why?
-Be quiet. Just get up.

248
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,030
Why should I?

249
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,780
-Excuse me. Excuse me!
-Run!

250
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,650
I hate running so much.

251
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,440
Why am I always running
when I'm with you?

252
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,400
I'll become a track and
field champion in no time.

253
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,440
You're an athlete. Shouldn't you be
better at controlling your emotions?

254
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,150
What are you talking about? I still
have so much stress to relieve.

255
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,650
Hey, do you know if
there's a boxing gym nearby?

256
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,030
Are you good at boxing?

257
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Bok-ju, shall we grab a drink instead?

258
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,530
Drink?

259
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,980
I have a feeling I'll drink a lot
if we go for drinks now.

260
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,940
Mum

261
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,570
-Hello?
-Si-eon didn't come home yesterday.

262
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,780
It looks like she took
some clothes with her, too.

263
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,400
-Hey, where are we going to sleep?
-I have no idea.

264
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,780
-Goodness.
-Do we have any money?

265
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,780
We have no money. Gosh, I'm annoyed.

266
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,030
-We have nothing?
-None.

267
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,230
What? Did we spend it all?

268
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,650
Gosh, what does she want?

269
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,480
-What's she doing here?
-How annoying.

270
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,940
-Who is she?
-Don't mind her. Let's go and...

271
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,570
Don't tell Si-eon that I told you.

272
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,280
She has a friend who
ran away from her family.

273
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,440
She said she'd stay
with her for a little while.

274
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,150
Where are you taking me?

275
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,360
Gosh, what do you want?

276
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,320
Why do you even care? It's my life.

277
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,070
Are you saying that I should
just watch you ruin your life?

278
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,780
Since when were you
so interested in my life?

279
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,360
-Don't act like you suddenly care.
-Just come with me.

280
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,440
Taxi.

281
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,150
Get in.

282
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,070
-Gosh, seriously.
-Just get in.

283
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,610
-Hey. Open this!
-Sir, please go. I don't know her.

284
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,320
Hey, Si-eon!

285
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,730
Look at you chug that drink.

286
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,150
-You drink like an old man.
-Shut it.

287
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,360
I can't afford to worry
about how I look right now.

288
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,650
Hey, let me fill up your glass.

289
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,230
Yes, this is what friends are for.

290
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,980
A friend must help me let it all out
when I feel like crying...

291
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,530
and let me get drunk
when I want to get drunk.

292
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,780
But why does this taste so weak today?

293
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,730
This isn't enough to get me drunk.

294
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,320
Hey. Don't do that, please.

295
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,570
Hey, don't. Goodness.

296
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,610
Here. Eat this.

297
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,650
Excuse me. We'd like another bottle.

298
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,690
Excuse me!

299
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,230
Haneol Sport University

300
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,690
Is that you, Si-ho?

301
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,570
What are you doing alone here?

302
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,570
Nothing. I had to go somewhere.

303
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,980
I just finished my practice.

304
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,980
I'm going to play pool with my friends.

305
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,110
Can I join you guys?

306
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,440
I'll just watch.

307
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,150
This is driving me crazy.

308
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,610
I keep drinking, but I'm still sober.
I'm not even tipsy.

309
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,980
I'm not sure about that.
I think you're a little drunk.

310
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,940
Not at all. I'm completely sober.

311
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,820
Look at this.

312
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,480
I don't even get drunk
when I'm determined to get drunk.

313
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,570
I was going to focus on my training,

314
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,440
yet I got distracted
by something so random.

315
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,110
The guy I like doesn't like me back.

316
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,980
And the guy I don't like
doesn't like me either.

317
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,280
Right. Life is certainly not easy.

318
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,150
Hey, Joon-hyung.

319
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,980
Do you know when things
started going wrong?

320
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,150
-The dressing table.
-Dressing table?

321
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,730
My dad found it on the street.

322
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,940
If he hadn't brought it home,

323
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,280
I wouldn't have had
to walk by that intersection.

324
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,690
And if I hadn't walked by there,
I wouldn't have met Dr Jeong.

325
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,070
No, that's not quite right!

326
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,900
-It's you!
-Me?

327
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,440
If you weren't his brother, things
wouldn't have gotten this complicated.

328
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,530
You have to fix everything!

329
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,190
Hey, why are you
blaming everything on me?

330
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,730
Did I ask you to fall for him?

331
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,690
You're right.

332
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,860
You didn't force me to like him.

333
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,860
It's all my fault.

334
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,440
By the way, Joon-hyung,

335
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,730
do you know
what really started this fate?

336
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,360
You're going to talk about fate now?

337
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,780
-What is it?
-The dressing table.

338
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,150
The dressing table my dad found
and brought home.

339
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,610
If he hadn't brought it home,
I wouldn't have had to walk by there.

340
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,400
And if I hadn't walked by there,
I wouldn't have met Dr Jeong.

341
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,440
So...

342
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,980
-you have to fix everything!
-Hey, you're drunk. Let's go now.

343
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,900
-Get up.
-Hey, I'm not drunk.

344
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,480
But...

345
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,980
do you know when things
started going wrong?

346
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,070
Yes. It's either
the dressing table or me.

347
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,400
How did you know?

348
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,440
Look at you. You're quite clever.

349
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,860
Hey, what's your IQ? Is it over 100?

350
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,400
Hey, no! Gosh!

351
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
Why is this girl so extreme
even when she drinks?

352
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,360
I was not mentally prepared for this.

353
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,780
-Gosh, I'm exhausted.
-Fix everything, Joon-hyung.

354
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,900
You have to take responsibility
for everything!

355
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,320
Hey, what more can I do?

356
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,320
You have to fix everything.

357
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,900
Fix everything...

358
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,940
Hey, you can't throw up now.
Do not throw up, please!

359
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,440
Hold it in, please.

360
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,730
I'm cold.

361
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,400
You're cold?

362
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,570
Look, there's newspapers...

363
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,400
that happens to be lying around
right here.

364
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,940
Bok-ju.

365
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,280
This will help.

366
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,070
Why is she sleeping with her eyes open?

367
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,530
Gosh, Bok-ju.
Let's put your hand over this.

368
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,440
This hand, too.

369
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,730
You'll learn how much difference
a piece of newspaper can make.

370
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,070
Hey. Goodness.

371
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,690
Take responsibility for everything.

372
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,690
What are you talking about?
I've done more than enough.

373
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,280
She's totally knocked out.

374
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,530
How can someone look like this?

375
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,230
Gosh, it's so cold.

376
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,900
Hey, Bok-ju. Bok-ju, let's go now.

377
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,150
Get up already.

378
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,480
How am I going to carry her?

379
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,730
Plus Supermarket

380
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,980
My mum would be so proud of me
if she sees this.

381
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,530
Sir, where are we going?

382
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,980
Wake up already, Kim Bok-ju!

383
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,400
Thank you for calling Bok Chicken.

384
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,860
Half and half? No problem.
Dad, half and half!

385
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,820
How long will it take
to get to your place like this?

386
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,860
Take responsibility for everything,
Jeong Joon-hyung.

387
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,530
Enough is enough.

388
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,110
Hey, you're actually
awake now, aren't you?

389
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,610
I'm getting carsick. Please drive slowly.

390
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,570
Bok-ju. You wench!

391
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Goodness.

392
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,030
Be careful. Be gentle with her.

393
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,980
Yes, be really careful.

394
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,940
-Do it slowly. Be careful.
-Jeong Joon-hyung...

395
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
You punk! I said put her down easy.

396
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,480
Take out the thick blanket.

397
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,150
She shouldn't be cold.

398
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,570
-My gosh.
-Why, you punk.

399
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,690
You always...

400
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,480
scold her, but you love her
so dearly, don't you?

401
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,860
How much did she drink
to pass out like this?

402
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,780
Do you think she drank with that guy,
just the two of them?

403
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,610
Until this late hour?

404
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,570
What are you trying to say?
Shut your mouth.

405
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,530
Take responsibility for everything,

406
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,980
Jeong Joon-hyung.

407
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,690
For what?

408
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,730
I'm going to kill him!

409
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,400
That punk is dead!

410
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,230
Are you saying...

411
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,360
you've done nothing...

412
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,650
-to take responsibility for?
-Of course.

413
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,360
-Are you sure?
-We're just friends.

414
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,820
We went to the same elementary school.

415
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,190
We all know that, but who knows what
can happen between a guy and a girl?

416
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,280
A friend can become a boyfriend, and
a boyfriend can become a baby daddy.

417
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,820
Gosh, that won't happen.
We're just friends.

418
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,320
That will never happen.

419
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,150
I swear it won't happen.

420
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,320
-You swear?
-Yes, I swear.

421
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,780
Why would you swear?

422
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,280
What's wrong with my dear Bok-ju?

423
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,900
She doesn't dress up
because she's busy training,

424
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,480
but if you look at her closely,
she has such a pretty face.

425
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,860
Pardon?

426
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,030
Chang-geol, come here for a second.

427
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,650
You sound like a psycho right now.

428
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,480
Please pick a side and stick with it.

429
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,690
Is that so?

430
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,940
Okay.

431
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,150
Anyway,

432
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,150
this applies not only to Bok-ju,
but to you as well.

433
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,610
You're an athlete.
Your body is your asset.

434
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,730
You shouldn't stay out late
and make your friend drink.

435
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,570
You won't become the top player this way.

436
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,360
Don't you have dreams?

437
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,230
I'm sorry.

438
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,030
Are you really?

439
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,150
Yes, Sir.

440
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,730
May I go home now?

441
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,150
Try to understand him.
It may not seem that way,

442
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,400
but my brother is
very protective of Bok-ju.

443
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,570
She's his only daughter.

444
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,690
After his wife died young,
he has felt so bad for Bok-ju.

445
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,570
I see.

446
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,480
I'll get going now.

447
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,650
Okay. See you later. Oh, wait.

448
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,280
Here. Take a cab with this money.

449
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,230
You must be exhausted
from carrying Bok-ju.

450
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,280
It's fine. I can take the bus.

451
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,690
It's disrespectful not to accept it.

452
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,110
Actually,

453
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,860
I'm in favour.

454
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,900
-Pardon?
-I'm in favour of you two dating.

455
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,900
Let's have a drink sometime later,

456
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,280
Bok-ju's future husband.

457
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,480
No, it's not like that.

458
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,820
I'll be going now.

459
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,280
Okay, here I go.

460
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,440
Joon-hyung.

461
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,440
-Yes, Jae-yi.
-Where have you been?

462
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,690
I just came out to go to the supermarket.

463
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,860
You're lying.

464
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Jae-yi.

465
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,650
Mum is angry, isn't she?

466
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,440
She doesn't know. I told her...

467
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,650
you're asleep now.

468
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,980
That's good. I wasn't sure if
I could take her nagging.

469
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,320
Where were you?

470
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
-Were you drinking?
-I didn't drink much,

471
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,230
but Bok-ju passed out after drinking
too much when she can't even drink.

472
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,280
I had to take her home.

473
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,610
-Just you and Bok-ju?
-Yes.

474
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,110
You should go.

475
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,230
I'll sneak in and get some sleep.

476
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,940
Okay. I'll see you.

477
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,400
You're causing all kinds of
trouble these days.

478
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,780
You made me cook hangover soup for you.

479
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,150
We have tons of alcohol here.

480
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,280
Why did you have to go out to drink?
Furthermore, it's with a guy.

481
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,280
I'm sorry, Dad. It won't happen again.

482
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,690
Eat it slowly.
I'm heating up the boiled pork.

483
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,900
It's too early to have boiled pork.

484
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,780
Sure. Having boiled pork in the
morning will help me put on weight.

485
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,780
Our dear Bok-ju.

486
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,650
I actually...

487
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,730
like him as your future husband.

488
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,900
-What?
-We need a handsome guy like him...

489
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,360
to improve the seed of our family.

490
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,400
Forget it. Nothing will happen
between me and him.

491
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,610
He's already seen things
he shouldn't have.

492
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,150
"Seen things..."

493
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,900
"he shouldn't have?"

494
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,690
What are you thinking?

495
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,940
-It's nothing weird.
-It's fine. I can understand that.

496
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,070
We're living in the 21st century.

497
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,610
Things can happen when a grown man
and a woman drink together.

498
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,780
You're two vigorous youths after all.

499
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,230
I'm not an old-fashioned person.

500
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,900
Just admit it.

501
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,730
I told you it's not like that.
We just drank.

502
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,860
-It's true.
-Fine. I guess you're too shy.

503
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,150
Okay, then. I'll tell you first.

504
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,900
-I lost my virginity when...
-Gosh, Dad!

505
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,230
-I was...
-Stop Uncle!

506
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,780
-Dad!
-What did he do now?

507
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,230
-He's a pervert!
-What did you...

508
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,980
say to her?

509
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,360
-Dad.
-Eat up.

510
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,690
What time did you get home, Joon-hyung?

511
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,280
Right after you went to bed.

512
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,730
Gosh, you must've drunk a lot.

513
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,070
I can smell alcohol from your clothes.

514
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,440
Don't you know I grew up
in this neighbourhood?

515
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,440
Keep this up, and everyone will
say my son always stays out late.

516
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,900
Gosh, Mum. I'm sorry.

517
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,530
I'm sorry, Mum. I really am.

518
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,820
My gosh. You're so sly.

519
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,980
When are you going back to campus?

520
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,940
After I'm done eating. Why?

521
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,980
Your dad keeps saying
he feels listless these days.

522
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,980
I want to go buy him milk vetch roots.

523
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,780
Gosh, a daughter would be perfect
for this kind of things.

524
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,440
What about you, Jae-yi?
Do you have plans?

525
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,150
Yes. Ah-young is buying a stereo
and she wants my input on it.

526
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,730
-I can cancel, though.
-Ah-young?

527
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,650
Then you should go and help her.
I can go to the market by myself.

528
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,860
You should go. Go and help her. I'm fine.

529
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,400
-Don't forget your medicine.
-Yes, Mum.

530
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,690
Woon-gi.

531
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,360
-Hello.
-Coach.

532
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,530
What's this about you
punching a taxi driver?

533
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,530
Goodness.

534
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,150
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

535
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,730
I'm sorry.

536
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,360
We registered our marriage and
had our baby after much consideration.

537
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,360
I just couldn't tell you.

538
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,150
You're right. I wouldn't be able to
say it if I were you, too.

539
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,320
You brat.

540
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,860
You have a wife and a child.

541
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,860
Why did you hit someone?
What were you thinking?

542
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,440
He swore at my wife.

543
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,480
-I couldn't stand it.
-My gosh.

544
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,230
It looks like he's holding out,
thinking he hit the jackpot.

545
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,190
For now,

546
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,780
let's try to settle it
with the money I got.

547
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,150
No, Coach.
I'll figure out something and...

548
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,980
How will you find 3,000 dollars?
Do you have money?

549
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,360
Your wife is working because you can't
afford putting her in a postnatal care.

550
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,610
I'll make sure...

551
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,230
to pay you back that money.

552
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,650
Of course you will.

553
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,070
-Have you named your baby yet?
-She's Soon-ri.

554
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,030
We wanted her to go with the flow
and live in comfort.

555
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,570
That's a good name.

556
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,820
Hey, Soon-ri's dad.

557
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,440
If you ever keep a secret from me again,

558
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,030
I will kill you.

559
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,980
Hi, it's me.

560
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,980
It's about the money
you borrowed from me before.

561
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,780
Can you pay me back this month?

562
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,980
If you're going to put it
in the infirmary,

563
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,610
I think a Bluetooth stereo
would be better.

564
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,030
It's more convenient.

565
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,530
You think so?

566
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,940
But there are so many kinds.
I don't know which one to pick.

567
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,900
I think this is better than
the one we saw earlier.

568
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,780
Is that so?

569
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,650
I'll listen to the expert, then.

570
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,480
I'll take this.

571
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,150
-Okay. Please have a seat and wait.
-Okay.

572
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,480
There are so many.

573
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,900
Since you recommended it,
you should install it, too.

574
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,230
-For free.
-Wow.

575
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Now I know why people
get conned without realising.

576
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,150
I'll buy you an expensive meal instead.

577
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,360
Oh, hey.

578
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,070
Do you know someone named Kim Bok-ju
in your campus' weightlifting team?

579
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,570
Bok-ju?

580
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,690
She's the ace of her team.
She's the tall one.

581
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,650
I mentioned a patient who asked me
about Messi. Do you remember?

582
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
I do. You said it was memorable.

583
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,530
That patient is her.

584
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,400
What? That can't be true.

585
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,780
Why would a weightlifter
go to a weight clinic?

586
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,610
She told me she was a cellist.

587
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,150
But I bumped into her in campus.

588
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,280
That's how I found out
she weight-lifts at your campus.

589
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,940
That's so strange.

590
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,320
Joon-hyung said it's because
she has a crush on someone.

591
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,070
Also, Bok-ju and Joon-hyung were
elementary schoolmates.

592
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,980
Really? What a small world.

593
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,480
Who does she have a crush on?

594
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,900
She has a regular schedule,
so she doesn't meet many men.

595
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,030
Does she like Joon-hyung?

596
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,650
He's popular in campus after all.

597
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,860
He's popular among many freshmen girls.

598
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,320
Is that so?

599
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,230
They do seem quite close.

600
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,570
-They drank until late last night.
-Really?

601
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,110
Maybe it's him.

602
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,480
Why do I feel excited?
I hope they get together.

603
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,440
Thank you, Jae-yi.

604
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,610
I took a lot of your time, so I'll
treat you to anything you choose.

605
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,980
Tell me.

606
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,570
Do you want spaghetti or pasta?

607
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,690
My hourly rate is high.
What's something that's expensive?

608
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,070
Just say the word.

609
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,070
Bok-ju.

610
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,480
Hello, Dr Jeong.

611
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,030
Bok-ju, I heard about what happened.

612
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,940
You caused such a big trouble.
It must have been so much fun.

613
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,360
See you later.

614
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,280
You still have some time.
Let's go eat together.

615
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,070
-Call Joon-hyung, too.
-Pardon?

616
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,530
No, it's okay.

617
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,780
You should join us.
I wanted to treat you to a meal.

618
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,860
Let's go.

619
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,030
-Let's go.
-Get in.

620
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,360
-How about a steak?
-Let's eat steak.

621
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,610
You love meat.

622
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,320
-What else?
-How about soup?

623
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,860
-Let's order a salad for Bok-ju.
-A salad?

624
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
Wait.

625
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,400
You can eat something else.

626
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,570
How about...

627
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,440
How about this one?

628
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,570
Jae-yi, Dr Go.

629
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,030
-Hey.
-Hi, Joon-hyung.

630
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,110
Why are we meeting together?

631
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,940
Jae-yi set up the sound system.
We met Bok-ju on our way to eat.

632
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,940
I didn't know you two
went to the same elementary school.

633
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,110
It's not something to brag about.

634
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:31,230
It turns out that Bok-ju was the one
who asked Jae-yi about Messi.

635
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,190
I was so surprised.

636
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,690
I had no idea.

637
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,570
It's a lot of food. Help yourselves.

638
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,610
Enjoy, Jae-yi. Thank you for your help.

639
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,900
Thank you for the food.

640
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,320
Thank you.

641
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,530
I can't help myself when
I'm curious about things.

642
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,900
May I ask you a question?

643
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,150
Do you have a crush on someone
in our campus?

644
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,230
Well, I...

645
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,230
I...

646
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,230
Stop it. You're invading her privacy.

647
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,900
Right, I'm sorry for being nosy.

648
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,230
Since when were you close to Joon-hyung?

649
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,150
I've been working at the campus
for over a year, but I had no idea.

650
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,900
We met again only recently.

651
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,530
-He's changed so much.
-Really?

652
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,360
I bet you were surprised.

653
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,530
He used to be so small, but
he's so tall and all grown up now.

654
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,480
My heart would have fluttered
if I were you.

655
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,030
Speaking of which,
you two look great together.

656
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,730
Is it because they're both tall?

657
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,860
I guess so.

658
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,690
Come on, Dr Go. You're exaggerating.

659
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,570
Do you realise how unnatural you sound?

660
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,940
No, I'm not exaggerating.

661
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,440
-You two look great together.
-Enough already.

662
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,980
Let's stop talking and eat.
The food is getting cold.

663
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,610
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

664
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,440
So you want me to shut it and eat? Fine.

665
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,900
Come on.

666
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,980
Here you go.

667
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,070
-What?
-It's a rib.

668
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,190
-It's so delicious.
-Here you go.

669
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,400
-Here's one for you, Bok-ju.
-It's okay.

670
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,780
-Please take one.
-Here.

671
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,480
Here you go.

672
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,320
Enjoy.

673
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,440
You have to try it.

674
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,480
Look how meaty it is.

675
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,530
Eat it with the pasta.

676
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,360
-You try, too
-You like this, don't you?

677
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,070
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

678
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,860
Thank you for the company.

679
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,070
You helped me today,
so I'll give you a ride.

680
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,360
Do you want a ride, too?
I can drop you off.

681
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,400
-It's okay. We can walk.
-Okay.

682
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,230
You'll look great walking together.

683
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,610
-See you later.
-Take care. See you again, Bok-ju.

684
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,690
Dr Go totally got us wrong, doesn't she?

685
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,980
That's not important.

686
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,280
Nothing matters.

687
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,230
Thinking about it,

688
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,360
it turned out for the better.

689
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,360
What do you mean?

690
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,230
The lunch today.

691
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,480
I felt uncomfortable about
how we parted last time.

692
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,570
Now I feel like
things have come to a close.

693
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,690
All I have to do now is
concentrate on my competition.

694
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,400
Can you get ready for the competition
when you sound so weak?

695
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,860
That's true.

696
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,730
Why do I feel so listless and empty?

697
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,360
I'm not even sure.

698
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,980
By the way, Dr Go and
Dr Jeong looked great together.

699
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,440
They seemed close.

700
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,900
It's because they went to
the same medical school.

701
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,230
They're on the same level.

702
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,530
Dr Go is pretty.

703
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,940
She has a great personality,
and she's a doctor.

704
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,280
You're good, too.

705
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,230
You're healthy.

706
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,780
Is that supposed to make me
feel better? You're terrible.

707
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,070
Do you want to eat something?

708
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,400
We just had lunch.

709
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,690
-I don't eat all the time.
-How about...

710
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,690
watching a movie?

711
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,440
Or go to a club?

712
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,480
How about a drive to the beach?

713
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,650
Can you drive?

714
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,690
-Do you have a car?
-I have a car that isn't mine.

715
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,150
It won't take long to get to the beach.

716
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,030
No, it's too far away. Forget it.

717
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:12,150
Come on, let's go to the beach.
Rock-paper-scissors.

718
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,030
Let's go.

719
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,780
-Can we really?
-Yes, we can.

720
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,690
Hey, why are you looking
very aggressive there?

721
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,070
Get in.

722
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,280
-Hey, isn't this Dr Jeong's...
-It is, but it's also mine.

723
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,570
I've been driving it secretly
for some years.

724
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,150
I have the emergency key.
I'm sure Jae-yi knows that I drive it.

725
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,530
Can you drive well?

726
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,070
Of course, I'm the best driver.

727
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,070
Where's the seatbelt?

728
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,980
Put on the seatbelt.

729
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,400
-I wonder if this is okay.
-Okay.

730
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,320
We don't have much time
if we're to come back by midnight.

731
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,980
Hold on tight.
There won't be any turning back.

732
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,320
What do you think? Don't I drive well?

733
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,150
You drive like a beginner.
I'm getting motion sickness.

734
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,230
-It's keeping me perfectly alert.
-This is all a strategy.

735
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,150
It's hard to pretend like
I'm bad at driving.

736
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,150
Anyhow, it's good to be out.

737
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,730
Aren't you glad that you listened to me?

738
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,320
Do you regret...

739
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,480
lying to Jae-yi about weightlifting?

740
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,900
No.

741
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,690
Even if I were to go back in time,

742
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,900
I would have lied again.

743
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,320
Why? Aren't you proud
of your weightlifting?

744
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,320
What's wrong with a woman
who does weightlifting?

745
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,780
Of course I'm very proud of myself...

746
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,900
as a weightlifter.

747
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,150
A woman who does weightlifting...

748
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,440
may be impressive,
but weightlifting isn't exactly pretty.

749
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,980
What's the difference?

750
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,780
Here's the difference.

751
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,900
The senior female weightlifters
who have boyfriends...

752
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,570
don't usually invite
their boyfriends to competitions.

753
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,230
We lift heavy lumps of metal after all.

754
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,400
In that moment,

755
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,070
we can't help but show
our veins popping out,

756
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,570
our faces getting red,
our double or triple chins,

757
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,030
and our belly fat sticking out
from the belt. It's so ugly.

758
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,650
Sure we say that
looks aren't everything...

759
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,030
and that being dedicated to
achieving our dream is more important.

760
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:57,280
But it's not something
we want to show to the guy we like.

761
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,280
So in some ways,

762
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,280
choosing to be a weightlifter...

763
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,280
means that I have to...

764
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,940
give up living as a woman
to a certain extent.

765
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,650
That's what I've been thinking.

766
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,780
That is complete nonsense.

767
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:20,150
You just have to meet a guy
who will love the way you are.

768
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,150
Easier said than done.
It's hard to find a guy like that.

769
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,070
Hey, they exist.
Take me for an example...

770
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,900
Hey, did you see
those seagulls over there?

771
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,320
There's a flock of them. Did you see?

772
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,690
-Over there.
-I have to look straight ahead.

773
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,150
Do you want to do that thing?

774
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,320
What's it called? Go on a boat and
feed seagulls. Is this the off-season?

775
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,610
Hey, I have to drive.
I can't look around right now.

776
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,400
You haven't done it? You're so lame.

777
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,280
-What a loser.
-Choose between seagulls and me.

778
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,530
Seagulls.

779
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,230
Let me ask you one last time.
Seagulls or me?

780
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
Hey.

781
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,940
Do you want to go for barbecue?

782
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,730
Look at the ocean!
The sea breeze feels so nice.

783
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,190
Hi, seagulls!

784
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,190
Haven't you ever been to a beach?
Stop acting so lame.

785
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,110
I've been so stressed out, but
being here has totally refreshed me.

786
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,820
I should really be here with a boyfriend.

787
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,440
It'd be so romantic
to play silly games...

788
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,070
and write each other's names in the sand.

789
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,230
Hey, aren't you
a little too old for that?

790
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,070
You're so immature.

791
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,900
Grow up already, will you?

792
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,980
Hey.

793
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,280
-Hey, hey!
-Try and catch me!

794
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,440
You!

795
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,650
Hey, Joon-hyung!

796
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,400
I need head support. Let me use your arm.

797
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,360
Chubs, is it because you lift weights?
Even your head is heavy.

798
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,570
Get a taste of this.

799
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,820
I actually tasted death.

800
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,320
It was for fun.
Why did you have to get all feisty?

801
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,780
You know how competitive I can be.

802
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,570
You're actually a pretty good runner.

803
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,780
I ran away to survive.

804
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,070
You little...

805
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,780
I've shown you all sorts of things.

806
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,530
How did this happen?

807
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,690
So? Do you think it's unfair?

808
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:30,860
Of course I do.

809
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,650
I've told you everything about me, but
all I know about you is your trauma.

810
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,110
I don't know anything else.

811
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,860
Okay!

812
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,360
Then I'll tell you something, too.

813
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,360
When we were in elementary school...

814
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,730
Ouch! Who pulled my hair?

815
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,030
Whose chocolate is this?

816
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,860
-I don't know.
-What is it?

817
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,650
I'll eat it if no one claims it!

818
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,150
-Okay!
-Go ahead.

819
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,690
-Can I really eat it?
-Yes!

820
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,570
Someone used to put chocolates
and candies on your desk, right?

821
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:22,820
It was me.

822
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,150
Seriously?

823
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,070
Did you have a crush on me?

824
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,070
Goodness, you're over-reacting again.

825
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,150
You saved my life after all.

826
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,360
I wanted to thank you.

827
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,900
I also thought you were cool.

828
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,940
You know how timid I was back then.

829
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,030
But you got along
with other kids so well,

830
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,530
and you were always brave...

831
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,030
and strong.

832
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,400
That was nothing special.

833
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,360
It wasn't even a big secret.

834
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,530
You want something bigger?

835
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,730
Gosh, I thought it was
a pretty big secret.

836
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,690
Then I'll let you in on a huge secret.

837
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
Yes, please. Tell me everything.

838
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,320
It's about Jae-yi.

839
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,690
He's not really my brother.

840
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,280
He's actually my cousin.

841
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,900
The people I call my parents now
are actually my uncle and aunt.

842
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,940
When my mum remarried,

843
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,030
she left me with my uncle and aunt.

844
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,650
Then she moved to Canada.

845
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,980
Is that why you transferred to
a different school all of a sudden?

846
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,730
That's what happened.

847
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,440
I couldn't even say goodbye to you.

848
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,860
Hey.

849
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,570
Don't give me that pitiful look.

850
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,530
It wasn't too bad.

851
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,820
My uncle and aunt
have been so good to me,

852
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:50,280
and Jae-yi couldn't have
been any sweeter to me.

853
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,530
See, my personality has changed so much.

854
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,440
I wouldn't have changed like this
if I had an unhappy childhood.

855
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,980
You know...

856
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,530
that everyone has a few painful wounds
buried in their heart.

857
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,860
It's great if they can move on.

858
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,150
And even if they can't,
they'll still live.

859
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,150
Time helps numb the pain.

860
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,360
You'll be fine soon, too.

861
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,230
You're right.

862
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,780
I already feel much better than earlier.

863
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,900
You have a match in two weeks, right?

864
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,900
Tackle what's in front of you first,
then just wait.

865
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,110
Time will take care of everything.

866
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,570
One good thing about
having a crush on someone...

867
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,150
is that I get to decide when to end it.

868
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,110
My feelings have been out of my control,

869
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,780
but I've decided
to tame my heart as of today.

870
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,650
You've been a good sport, my heart.

871
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,730
You were definitely...

872
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,480
passionate enough.

873
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,190
D-7 to the tournament
Okay. Good, you're doing great.

874
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Flex your stomach. Flex! More.

875
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:23,820
Keep going.

876
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,780
The gold medal goes to Kim Bok-ju!
Gold medal!

877
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,650
D-6 to the tournament

878
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,480
D-5 to the tournament

879
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,230
-I'd love it if you can gain more.
-This is good, Bok-ju.

880
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,030
Keep up the great work, okay?

881
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,320
D-4 to the tournament

882
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,650
An adequate amount of effort
is never enough.

883
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:05,280
D-3 to the tournament

884
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,780
Here it comes. Eat this, too. Eat up.

885
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,780
Oh, there's more. There's one more dish.

886
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,400
The day before the tournament

887
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,190
Hey, you did it.

888
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,690
This is good enough. Head Coach, look.

889
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,070
See? I knew it.
I told you that Bok-ju would make it.

890
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:42,320
You just have to maintain your form.
I have really good instincts!

891
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,030
Isn't the tournament today?

892
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,980
Yes.

893
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,150
Good luck.

894
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,900
I really mean it.

895
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,030
I have to wear this today.

896
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,570
Oh, no. What do I do?

897
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,150
I knew you'd be here, Bok-ju.

898
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:27,690
Hey, you.

899
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,780
How are you feeling? Do you feel ready?

900
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,650
No, I feel horrible.

901
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:34,150
I think I'll be terrible today.

902
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,440
I even spilled my protein shake
on my lucky shirt this morning.

903
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,730
I'm getting a bad feeling.

904
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,860
What if I make a mistake?

905
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:42,320
Kim Bok-ju.

906
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,280
The ace of HSU's weightlifting team.

907
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,280
You won't make any mistakes.

908
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,320
You've been training so hard
and you're such a strong person.

909
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,360
You know that not everyone gets
to be the ace, right?

910
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,320
All right, then. Go get on the bus now.

911
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:00,860
I'll be there later to cheer you.

912
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,030
All right.

913
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,280
Go!

914
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,280
Go, Bok-ju!

915
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,070
I'm rooting for you!

916
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,480
You need to march triumphantly.

917
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,360
You're going there to win.

918
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,980
It's new. Why is it breaking already?

919
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,860
-Did we get scammed?
-It was working fine.

920
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,070
Did you plug this in properly?

921
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,730
Hey, do you think I'm an idiot?

922
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,480
That's the first thing I checked.

923
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,070
I tried pressing all the buttons,
but I just can't get it to work.

924
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,780
Oh, the power bar.

925
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,280
I didn't think to check that.

926
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,440
It works fine.

927
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,230
Do you want to grab food with me?

928
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,780
No, I have to visit Dr Kang's new clinic.

929
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,860
Are you going, too?

930
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:53,780
No, I'm on the night shift today.

931
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,780
The other doctor has to work
at a weightlifting match today.

932
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,980
-There's a weightlifting match today?
-Yes.

933
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,980
Bok-ju will compete, too.
It's at the Olympic Stadium.

934
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,150
Isn't Dr Kang's hospital near there?

935
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:06,860
Yes. I believe so.

936
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,940
2016 National
Weightlifting Championship

937
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,030
Go, Woon-gi!

938
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,320
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

939
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,900
-Yes!
-You can do it!

940
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,230
Woon-gi! Just go with the flow!

941
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,070
Let's go!

942
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:48,650
The judges agree...

943
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,480
it's a success.

944
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,150
Bok-ju.

945
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:59,070
-It's time.
-Break a leg, Bok-ju.

946
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,900
Be calm and do what you always do.

947
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,070
The next contestant is...

948
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,400
Kim Bok-ju from Haneol Sport University.

949
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,320
It's her third and final attempt
in the Clean and Jerk.

950
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,900
That's right, Bok-ju.

951
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,980
Everything depends on this one shot.

952
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,570
Don't be nervous.

953
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,110
You're strong.

954
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,110
You can do this.

955
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,070
Don't doubt yourself.
Just focus on the barbell now.

956
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,230
Dr Jeong?

957
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,190
-You can do it, Bok-ju!
-Let's go!

958
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,110
Bok-ju.

959
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,780
What are you doing, Bok-ju?
Get in there now.

960
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,610
We lift heavy lumps of metal after all.

961
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,150
In that moment, we can't help...

962
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,530
but show our veins popping out,
our faces getting red,

963
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,320
our double or triple chin,

964
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:07,190
and our belly fat sticking out
from the belt. It's so ugly.

965
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:12,110
It's not something we want to show
to the guy we like.

966
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,280
What's this? What happened?

967
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:08,780

01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,980
Why can't you see that
your consideration...

969
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,320
for others can hurt their feelings?

970
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,530
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

971
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:19,150
I see. If I like someone,
he won't like me back.

972
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:20,690
It puts him in a difficult position.

973
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,030
Who'd think you're pretty when
you're so embarrassed of yourself?

974
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,980
Have you seen Bok-ju?
She suddenly disappeared.

975
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,780
-What's the matter with you?
-Joon-hyung.

976
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,690
Why do you keep making me feel uneasy?

977
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,900
Why do you make me
worry about you, Bok-ju?
