1
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,900
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,460
My goodness. Look at them snuggling up...

3
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,860
to each other when they're
supposed to be training.

4
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,420
Gosh. Their parents would be
so upset if they saw this.

5
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,580
I wonder who their parents are. My gosh.

6
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,780
Wear your hood.

7
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,980
Here you go.

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,900
-What are they doing?
-My goodness.

9
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,660
Why are they doing that in campus?

10
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,860
Look at them hugging and kissing.

11
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,660
Get a room, would you? Darn it.

12
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,660
I hate to see that.
I hope they trip on a stone.

13
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,690
EPISODE 14
This Girl Is Mine

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,700
You've decorated your house.

15
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,780
-Yes. Aren't those paintings nice?
-Yes.

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,980
They're presents for myself
for my hard work last year.

17
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,820
But it's been a while
since I put them here.

18
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,900
Gosh, come to think of it,
you haven't been here for a while.

19
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,100
I'm sorry.
I've been very busy with some stuff.

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,900
Don't be.
It's good to have things to focus on.

21
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,340
I'm curious, though.
What kept you so busy?

22
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,620
I'm just...

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,900
meddling in other people's business.

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,380
Not very beneficial, is it?

25
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,980
I think it's very beneficial.

26
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,220
You look much happier
and more comfortable,

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,500
and there's an optimistic energy
coming from you. Am I wrong?

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,420
You're right. I don't have ringing
in my ears at all these days.

29
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,180
I'm going to take a careful guess.

30
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,380
Are you seeing someone?

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,100
Bingo.

32
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,420
Dating is one of the most effective
ways to heal your emotions.

33
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,140
Doctor.

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,580
You're a great doctor.
I really admire you.

35
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,420
My goodness. Good for you.

36
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,860
Is your girlfriend pretty?

37
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,020
She's just...

38
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,660
To be honest, I'm too handsome for her.

39
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,580
Gosh, my back is sore now.

40
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,860
-She rejected me.
-Do my feet stink?

41
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,740
My gosh!

42
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,060
You two are so strange.

43
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,500
When are you going to have lunch?

44
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,940
I'm outside. I'll go
to the cafeteria when you go.

45
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,980
At 12:00.

46
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,380
Look at that.

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,060
You're not supposed to get
all romantic in our gym.

48
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
You're as sly as a cat.

49
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,980
Did you think we wouldn't know
if you kept it a secret?

50
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,860
You just can't take your eyes
off each other.

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,900
Hyung-chul and Ye-bin!

52
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,900
Goodness. Did something happen
while I was gone?

53
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,860
-What is this? Are you serious?
-I knew it.

54
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,140
When Hyung-chul collapsed,
Ye-bin was shouting in tears.

55
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,580
Wow, while my hands and feet
were numbed by the cold,

56
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,660
you were shooting a romantic film.
I can't believe you!

57
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,660
I feel so betrayed.

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,300
When did they start seeing
each other? What is this?

59
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,540
Please stop. Ye-bin didn't do anything.

60
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,460
-I asked her out first.
-That's not true.

61
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,660
Hyung-chul didn't do anything wrong.

62
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,180
I came on to him first.

63
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,780
What are you doing?

64
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,740
-Look at that!
-I can't believe this!

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,700
Wow, yet another shocking news after
the whole fuss...

66
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,780
with Coach Choi and Bok-ju's uncle.

67
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,380
Ye-bin always said she felt lonely.
She's finally dating someone.

68
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,900
Hasn't Hyung-chul been saying...

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,180
-his ideal type is Han Ye-seul?
-Yes.

70
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,500
Your ideal type doesn't always match
the person you actually date.

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,940
That's what I hear.

72
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,180
Anyway, I'm so jealous.

73
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,020
Maybe because it's winter now,
I see so many couples.

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,900
Just yesterday, we saw a gross couple
fooling around over there.

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,260
You two better not betray me, okay?

76
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,860
Especially you, Bok-ju.

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,820
No way. Bok-ju would never do that.

78
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,100
A guy put her through so much
not so long ago.

79
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,100
She would be crazy
to date another guy again.

80
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,020
Of course.
I'd be crazy to date this soon.

81
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,380
Okay. We've all been single
our whole lives.

82
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,580
I'll kill you
if any one of you betrays me.

83
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,620
-Being single is awesome.
-Awesome.

84
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,980
Awesome.

85
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,980
Gosh, I'm tired of these meatballs.

86
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,100
-Chubs.
-Hello, hello.

87
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,420
It looks like you just started eating.
Why don't we eat here?

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,700
Shall we?

89
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,540
It's been a while since
I saw all three of you together.

90
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,580
When did you come back, Seon-ok?

91
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,460
Yesterday. Long time no see.

92
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,300
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,700
Gosh, did my fingers get bigger?

94
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,220
Joon-hyung, are you okay?

95
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,820
Are you okay?

96
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,220
Did you get hurt?

97
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,140
It hurts. I think I got a bruise.

98
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,860
Does it hurt a lot?
Do you want to go to the infirmary?

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,100
You're the one who hurt me.

100
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,380
Why did you take my hand
around our friends?

101
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,340
What's wrong with that?
We weren't doing anything wrong.

102
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,940
Since we're on the topic,
let's talk about it.

103
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,420
I've been wanting to ask you.
Why should we see each other in secret?

104
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,700
Are you underage or married?

105
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,500
Or...

106
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,180
do I...

107
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,660
embarrass you?

108
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,860
It's not that.

109
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,500
Then why?

110
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,460
Will you break up with me
after a little while?

111
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,180
Do I embarrass you? Are you testing me?

112
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,420
Don't say things like that.

113
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,260
If my friends find out,
they'll call me a betrayer.

114
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,460
After Dr Jeong, I said
I wouldn't ever see men again.

115
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,980
This will make me look nuts.

116
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,820
Usually, you get over men
by seeing other men.

117
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,300
They don't know anything.

118
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,700
Anyway, now isn't the right time yet.

119
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,220
Let's keep it a secret for now.

120
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,660
Let's tell them when
they're more open to the idea.

121
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,580
Okay, okay?

122
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,700
What are you doing?

123
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,420
Are you trying to act cute?

124
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,540
Forget it if you don't want to.

125
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,100
Do it one more time.

126
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,260
Then I'll consider it.

127
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,660
I can't do it again. Forget it.

128
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,180
Come on, do it once more.
I want to see it again.

129
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,900
Do it one more time.

130
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,780
-What?
-Act cute like you just did.

131
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,980
I can't hear you.

132
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,060
Do it one more time. It was so good.

133
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,060
Do it one more time, please?

134
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,180
Please do it just one more time.

135
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,180
Please?

136
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,460
Oh, my goodness.

137
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,860
You startled me.

138
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,940
-Are you just getting off work?
-Yes.

139
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,820
I almost missed you.

140
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,420
Why didn't you call me in advance?

141
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,220
I got two tickets to a concert.

142
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,820
Remember my classical music CD
that you liked?

143
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,180
The violinist came to Korea.

144
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,660
I'd like to take you to his concert
if you are free.

145
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,980
Jae-yi.

146
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,860
Actually, I'm not interested
in classical music.

147
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,540
I only pretended to like it
because of you.

148
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,100
I don't even remember that violinist.

149
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,180
How about dinner?

150
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,900
You need to eat anyway, right?

151
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,460
You didn't pretend to like steak
when you don't, right?

152
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,140
No, I do like steak.

153
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,540
Really?

154
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,300
Thank goodness.

155
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Please go ahead and eat.

156
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,180
Ah-young, what are you doing
this weekend?

157
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,780
If you're free,
let's do something you want to do.

158
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,580
Not what I want to do.

159
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,140
No, thank you, Jae-yi.

160
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,380
I'm going to sleep this weekend.
I'm tired these days.

161
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,060
Shall I come to your house?

162
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,980
I'll make you spaghetti.

163
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,740
I'll cook for you and you can
go back to sleep after eating.

164
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,820
Jae-yi.

165
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,940
Don't try too hard.

166
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,100
It could be worth it, don't you think?

167
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,140
No.

168
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,740
Trying hard won't make you fall
in love with me after 10 years.

169
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,900
You can't force someone to fall in love.

170
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,700
I have the experience, so I know it.

171
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,620
Gosh, you guys.

172
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,620
You're always here. Why don't you
just switch rooms with me?

173
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,780
Getting rid of dead skin
is easier in your room.

174
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,540
Same here. For some reason,
your room is more comfortable.

175
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,220
-Is that made with potatoes?
-Yes.

176
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,940
Don't eat it. Yield it to the skin.

177
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,620
It's made with flour, potatoes and honey.

178
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,980
It's my special facial mask.

179
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,380
It moisturises and
brightens the skin right away.

180
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,940
How do I look?
Doesn't my skin look clear?

181
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,340
Wow, your skin got so soft.

182
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,380
Do you want to try it?

183
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,860
I've never done it before.

184
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,580
Can I try it for fun?

185
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,260
I'll do it for you.

186
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,580
What's gotten into you, Bok-ju?

187
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,620
You were never interested
in facial masks.

188
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,100
It's about time she changed.

189
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,300
If your skin gets clear
because of the facial mask,

190
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,500
buy me a packet of sausages, okay?

191
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,700
-Adjust it so that it fits.
-Close your eyes.

192
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,580
Take it off after 20 minutes.

193
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,020
Don't fall asleep.

194
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,300
-Hello.
-Hello.

195
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,300
Hello.

196
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,380
How can you be bothered
to do this every day?

197
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,180
-For how long?
-20 minutes.

198
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,860
-Hold it still.
-I'll do it.

199
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,700
Make it fit on my face.

200
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,980
Do you do this four times a week?

201
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,060
What is this?

202
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,340
Your skin got so young that
it's back to its adolescent days.

203
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,380
Why did you get a big pimple at your age?

204
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,020
Isn't it because of that facial mask?

205
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,180
That's strange. I never had
any side effects from the facial mask.

206
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,580
You told me to yield it to the skin
instead of eating it.

207
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,300
Did you sleep with the mask on?

208
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,980
Did you take it off after 20 minutes?

209
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,100
I fell asleep,

210
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,700
so I only took it off this morning.

211
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,260
That's why, silly.

212
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,700
Facial masks are effective
only if you put it on for...

213
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,100
the right amount of time.
Otherwise, it's not worth it.

214
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,500
My goodness.
How can I go outside like this?

215
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,540
It's not a big deal.
It's not like you have a boyfriend.

216
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,140
Hang in there for a few days.

217
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,340
It looks as if you got the pimple
because you didn't wash properly.

218
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,740
Gosh, it seems dirty.

219
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,340
-Let's go, weightlifting!
-Let's go!

220
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,100
Hello.

221
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,340
-Hello.
-Hello.

222
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,660
Hello.

223
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
-Hello.
-Hi, Bok-ju.

224
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,900
Did you catch a cold?

225
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,340
Yes.

226
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,380
Is it bad?

227
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,060
It's contagious.

228
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,700
I'll call you later.

229
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,860
You seemed fine yesterday.
Are you very sick?

230
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,500
Yes.

231
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,980
It started with a cough
and developed into a fever last night.

232
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,460
It's tough.

233
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,980
I'm sorry to hear that.

234
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,980
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

235
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,260
When I have a cold,

236
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,980
I cover myself in a blanket and rest,
and I'll get better.

237
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,260
I'll get some rest after training.

238
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,260
I don't think I can see you today
since I'm sick.

239
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,140
Okay.

240
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,020
Take it easy.

241
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,660
I'll call you again.

242
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,100
What am I doing? I can't see Joon-hyung
because of this huge pimple.

243
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,740
Hey, Bok-ju.

244
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,620
You look like someone
from the countryside.

245
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,300
One pimple is good enough
to make you look silly.

246
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,500
Rhinoceros, look away.

247
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,300
I can't work out
because you make me laugh.

248
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,780
You look terrible.

249
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,380
I have an idea.

250
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,620
If you eat a lot of oily food,
it'll get inflamed.

251
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,940
Why don't you pop it when it does?

252
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,220
That makes sense.

253
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,260
Shall I touch it with my dirty hand?

254
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,780
You're annoying me. Go away.

255
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,780
-Shall I put on some chalk?
-Gosh.

256
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,780
-Go away.
-Isn't it funny?

257
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,860
-It looks terrible.
-Go away.

258
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,780
You're being very considerate.

259
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,620
Who has a cold that you'd come
all the way home to get medicine?

260
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,300
It's a close friend of mine.

261
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,020
-You know these are expensive, right?
-Of course.

262
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,260
I picked out the herbs myself
to give them to you.

263
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,980
-Tell your friend not to waste any.
-Okay, thank you.

264
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,340
That's it?

265
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,940
You haven't kissed me much these days.

266
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,260
Do you have to be explicit?

267
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,300
Ask Dad for the rest.

268
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,140
-See you later.
-See you.

269
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,660
He's so cute.

270
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,900
It's suffocating.

271
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,260
I can't even go to the cafeteria
in case I bump into Joon-hyung.

272
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,180
Gosh, darn it.

273
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,820
Hello, Joon-hyung.

274
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,300
You sound worse.

275
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,060
Are you in your room?

276
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,780
Yes.

277
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,180
I'm in my room.

278
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,060
Come to the lobby.

279
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,060
I brought medicine from home.

280
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,180
What? No! No, I can't. I mean...

281
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,740
I don't think I can.

282
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,100
My legs are all wobbly
because I've been coughing so much.

283
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,860
Besides, I don't want to get you sick.
You're a swimmer after all.

284
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,660
That doesn't matter.

285
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,860
You sound so sick. Can you
come down for just a few seconds?

286
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,380
Well, I'm too sleepy right now.

287
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,380
I should get some sleep.

288
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,460
All right, then.

289
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,380
Get some sleep. I'll call you later.

290
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,180
Okay. Bye.

291
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,100
Why did he go all the way home for me?
I feel terrible.

292
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,820
It sounds like her cold is getting worse.

293
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,340
Taking medication before sleep will help.

294
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,060
Can I pop this now?

295
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,420
I don't think the head has come out yet.

296
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,340
What if I die of excessive bleeding
from popping this pimple?

297
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,940
Ouch, it hurts so much. What should I do?

298
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,580
Gosh, whatever.

299
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,260
You drive me crazy, Kim Bok-ju.

300
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,100
A pimple is not a big deal
that you had to lie.

301
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,100
I was so worried about you.

302
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,180
I even went home and
brought my mum's special medicine.

303
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,340
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,460
Now that I'm seeing it from up close,
it actually looks a bit funny.

305
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,380
Why are you trying to cover it?
I already saw it. Don't bother.

306
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,580
No, I don't want you to see
me looking so ugly.

307
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,420
You're such a girl, Bok-ju.

308
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,260
You're seriously very charming.

309
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,380
It wasn't all bad, though.

310
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,060
Thanks to that,
I finally get to see your room.

311
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,260
It really is a girl's room.
It feels different from my room.

312
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,140
You have girly things, too.

313
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,780
That's your ex-girlfriend's.

314
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,380
I knew it.

315
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,540
I was thinking it's not my style.

316
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,700
Where's your closet? Is this it?

317
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,660
No! No, you can't open it.
I didn't organise it.

318
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,420
-You can't.
-Come on.

319
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,700
-I'm messy, too. Let me see.
-No, you can't.

320
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,100
-No, no, no.
-Hey. My gosh!

321
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,140
Hey, what are you doing? We can't.

322
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,100
What are you talking about?
I didn't even do anything.

323
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,100
Bok-ju, the super supreme
family size is here.

324
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,300
Bok-ju, we're coming in.

325
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,220
-What were you doing?
-I was just stretching.

326
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,180
-You must be hungry. Let's eat.
-What is that?

327
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,980
I've been craving this so much.
Let's eat.

328
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,660
No, eat it in the lounge.

329
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,260
You know I have a room mate.
I can't smell up the room.

330
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,060
Those skinny gymnasts are there.
We can just open the window after.

331
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,700
-Since when did you care?
-My goodness. You girls...

332
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,900
Hey, sit here. This chair!

333
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,020
-Sit here.
-Okay.

334
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,980
Don't dirty my blanket.
I want to keep it clean...

335
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,660
-because I just washed it.
-My goodness.

336
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,700
-What's with you today?
-I'm cold.

337
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,580
-Let's eat.
-Pizza! Let's eat this pizza.

338
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
-Doesn't this look so delicious?
-Why can't you eat it in your room?

339
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,460
Why did you have to come here?

340
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,140
Hey, why aren't you eating?
You're underperforming today.

341
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,980
I know, right? She usually
eats two pizzas by herself.

342
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,580
-I'm just...
-Is it because of that huge pimple?

343
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,780
-I'm just feeling a little queasy.
-Is it indigestion? Drink some soda.

344
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,100
I want it, too.

345
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,380
That's delicious.

346
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,660
What are you doing?

347
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,180
Girls! Seriously.

348
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,820
Do you really have to burp like that?
You're disgusting.

349
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,540
Who cares? It's just us.
I thought it was about something else.

350
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,300
You burp all the time, too.
What's the matter with you?

351
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,860
Hey, when did I burp?

352
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,780
Not just that. You don't even
take a shower after running.

353
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,620
Exactly. And you only wash your bangs
when it comes to your hair.

354
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,300
When did I do that?
Take this pizza and go to your room.

355
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,780
Hello.

356
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,700
We'll finish this quickly
and open the window.

357
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,300
It's okay. Don't mind me
and take your time.

358
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,500
This pizza is so good.

359
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,060
My gosh.

360
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,220
Girls. I'm sorry about this,

361
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,820
but I feel so tired all of a sudden.

362
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,860
Can you guys finish soon?

363
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,180
-All of a sudden?
-She said we could stay.

364
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,300
You're quite whimsical.

365
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Let's go. Bye, Bok-ju.

366
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,180
All of a sudden?

367
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,940
Bye, girls. I'm sorry.

368
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,380
My goodness, you guys.

369
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,380
Come on out.

370
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,980
The night view here is amazing.

371
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,860
The view from here is better at night.
I should've come here sooner.

372
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,620
What have I been doing in university?

373
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,100
-I didn't know so many things.
-Well, now you know.

374
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,260
Thanks for earlier.

375
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,620
Thanks, Si-ho. Ta-da!

376
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,980
Is that your hiding place?

377
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,300
Since you're offering it to me,
I'll have a sip.

378
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,700
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

379
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,740
It's so good.

380
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,940
But the competition is around
the corner, so I'll stop now.

381
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,380
I guess weightlifting and swimming are
much easier than gymnastics.

382
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,420
I wouldn't be able to live if I had
to watch my weight like that.

383
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,020
Well, you had to put on weight.
That's a lot more difficult to do.

384
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,460
What are you two doing right now?
I'm not used to this.

385
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,060
What's the problem? We would've been
close if you didn't get involved.

386
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,100
Si-ho, when is your competition?
We'll be there to cheer you.

387
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,420
This weekend.

388
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,380
-Let's go. We should cheer her.
-Hey, we can't.

389
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,020
-It'd be great if we can be there.
-We shouldn't.

390
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,700
Why not? It'll make Si-ho so happy.

391
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,940
Gosh, I should head in now.

392
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,540
I think I stayed for too long.
Don't stay out too late.

393
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,460
-Bye.
-See you.

394
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,100
Si-ho, you're not taking that?

395
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,940
Thanks to you,
I got to hide in a closet today.

396
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,540
We had quite a day today, didn't we?

397
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,580
By the way,

398
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,300
-did you wash your hair today?
-Hey.

399
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
That's only when I was too tired from
the extra training.

400
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,180
I'm usually very clean.

401
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,180
-All right. I'll believe you.
-Why do you sound so doubtful?

402
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,780
-I am really clean.
-Okay.

403
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,340
By the way, how long must we hide
from everybody?

404
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,700
Let's keep it a secret just until
the new semester begins.

405
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,700
Especially from your best friend,
Tae-kwon. He's dangerous.

406
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,180
Be careful, okay?

407
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,380
He's a nice guy.
Are you badmouthing him or what?

408
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,980
I'm just telling you to be careful.

409
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,700
I'm always careful.

410
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,020
-Are you getting annoyed with me?
-No, I'm not.

411
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
-I'm always careful.
-Do you want to punch me?

412
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,300
How could I punch you?
You're too adorable.

413
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,260
My gosh, don't say things like that!

414
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,100
It makes you look too cute.

415
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,300
There!

416
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,900
Is your training done?

417
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,300
It just ended.
I will call you when I go out.

418
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,780
Joon-hyung. Joon-hyung!

419
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,380
Goodness. What is it?

420
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,980
Hey, it's an emergency.

421
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,380
I need you to come with me now.

422
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,940
-I'll explain when we get there.
-What is it? Come where?

423
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,100
-My gosh.
-Come on now!

424
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,460
-Hey, where are you going?
-What do you think you're doing here?

425
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,420
Listen. She suddenly called
and said she wanted to see me.

426
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,660
She told me to bring you as well.

427
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,140
You just left without saying anything
last time. So-hee was so disappointed.

428
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,780
-She'll be upset if I don't bring you.
-Geez, I just...

429
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,420
-can't do this.
-Look.

430
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,220
How can I send away such pretty girls?

431
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,220
Hi. Wow, you look even prettier
than last time.

432
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,380
-Hello.
-It's been a long time.

433
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,220
Well, yes. Hello.

434
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
Have you eaten?

435
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,180
Did you guys order?

436
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,300
Oh, he's that handsome swimmer.

437
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,620
Hyung-chul.

438
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,020
What would you like to drink?

439
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,860
-Coffee, please.
-Me, too.

440
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,060
All right. I'll get it for you.

441
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,060
What's going on?

442
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,780
He said he'd call when he's out.
Why isn't he calling yet?

443
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,740
Hello, Bok-ju.

444
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,660
Hey. Where is your dear boyfriend?

445
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,380
He went to the bathroom.

446
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,860
He will be here soon.

447
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,260
Oh, right. Bok-ju.

448
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,740
I saw the guy from the swimming team
who put a scarf and jacket on you.

449
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,540
You mean Joon-hyung?

450
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,780
I guess you two are really just friends.

451
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,300
I thought there was something
between you and him.

452
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,780
He was on a blind date
at the café nearby.

453
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,180
A blind date?

454
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,740
Yes.

455
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,860
Where?

456
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,460
Bok-ju, I'm starving.
Why would you want to drink coffee?

457
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,140
You don't even like coffee.

458
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,860
And you can just drink from any café.

459
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,300
Why do you have to go around
looking for certain coffee?

460
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,140
They all taste the same.

461
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,940
I can't do this. I'm going in and
getting some tteokbokki or something.

462
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,820
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

463
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,460
What? Aren't those Tae-kwon
and Joon-hyung?

464
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,740
Where?

465
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,900
You're right.
They're obviously on a blind date.

466
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,140
What are they doing?
Those girls aren't even that pretty.

467
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,940
We're much better. Let's go.

468
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,820
Let's go inside and watch them.

469
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,460
I think this place would make
the best coffee.

470
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,580
All right. It'll be fun.

471
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,980
How spicy?

472
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,980
I thought you liked spicy food.

473
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,980
Hey, hey. Stop watching and eat first.
Eating should always come first.

474
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,580
That's right. Watch with your eyes
and eat with your mouth.

475
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,340
Look at those girls.

476
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,340
They're all dressed up, which means
they're determined to reel them in.

477
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,060
Do you see that foxy girl?

478
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,260
I'm pretty sure she's after Joon-hyung.

479
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,540
I'm not really good at this,
but I think so, too.

480
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,140
Look at her smiling.

481
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,060
She's even touching him on the sly.

482
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,900
You will die. I will kill you!

483
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,980
You better finish up within five minutes.

484
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,500
-Look at you two.
-Look at you.

485
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,740
Do you like spicy food?

486
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,940
I love spicy food.

487
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,580
I like eating extremely spicy food
and just sweat.

488
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,660
-Hey, Tae-kwon.
-Yes?

489
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,420
I think we should hurry up and go.

490
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,660
I just got...

491
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,100
...a text message saying all
sophomores should gather up now.

492
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,580
What are you talking about?

493
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,780
I'm the leader.
I didn't get any messages.

494
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,140
No. I did get a message just now.

495
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,740
-Don't be absurd.
-Hey!

496
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,780
We're having a tournament soon.

497
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,620
We should go now and practice.

498
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,300
You know I'm not going
to the championship...

499
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,980
after messing up the last one.

500
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
He's just bragging about himself.

501
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,060
He messes up the start sometimes,
but he's the ace of our team.

502
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,340
No wonder. I thought he had
the build of Michael Phelps.

503
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,540
You have such broad shoulders.

504
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,700
Why are you doing this to me?

505
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,660
Your shoulders are so broad.

506
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,340
-What are you...
-They're really broad.

507
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,540
Get that filthy hand off of him.

508
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,580
Bok-ju.

509
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,260
Who are you?

510
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,500
I'm the girlfriend of the guy
you just touched!

511
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,980
I just can't believe this.

512
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,700
I feel so betrayed, Bok-ju.

513
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,860
What happened?

514
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,340
How long have you...

515
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,060
It's not since we went to
the amusement park, is it?

516
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,700
No. We were just friends back then.

517
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,420
I had a crush on Bok-ju then.

518
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,340
What?

519
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,100
So, when exactly did you start dating?

520
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,500
Yesterday? Last week?
The week before that?

521
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,580
The day I came back to school.
It was since then.

522
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,020
So when we were on the hunger strike
and he gave you a scarf and jacket...

523
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,980
I get it now. If I had known,

524
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,260
I wouldn't have been so jealous
of her having such a sweet friend.

525
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,060
I knew it.

526
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,260
He gave her such a significant look.

527
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,260
Why did you keep it a secret
from us yet again?

528
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,540
You had many chances
to tell us the truth.

529
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,820
I didn't want you to think of me
as a betrayer.

530
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,220
It hasn't been long since I made a fuss
about a guy after all.

531
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,700
We said it would be a betrayal,
but we didn't really mean it.

532
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,380
How could you secretly date him?

533
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,820
Bok-ju is such a dishonest girl.

534
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,860
She keeps lying to us.

535
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,540
That's not fair.

536
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,700
You two kept pressuring her.

537
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,500
-Bok-ju had no choice...
-Hey.

538
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,660
It's fine to side with your girlfriend,
but can't you see now's not the time?

539
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,860
All right.

540
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,620
Anyway, I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you, guys.

541
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,660
-Saying you're sorry won't cut it.
-Apologising is not enough.

542
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,260
What, then?

543
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,940
Your boyfriend will have
to pay for what you've done.

544
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,820
Think of it as a hazing.

545
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,980
Hazing?

546
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,700
Hey. Are they going to beat me up?

547
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,340
Since you took away our Bok-ju,
you should treat us.

548
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,700
Of course.
I'd love it if you buy us meat.

549
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,540
Meat? I see.

550
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,060
All right. If I buy you meat,

551
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,220
are you going to forgive us?

552
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,860
Can we now see each other
without sneaking around?

553
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,140
You shouldn't buy them meat.

554
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,980
Let's go home, Coach Choi.

555
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,100
Gosh, I feel so tired today.

556
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,420
Coach.

557
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,260
If you don't have any plans,

558
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,860
let's have a drink.

559
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,260
Can I take a rain check?
I'm so tired today.

560
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,740
No, you can't.

561
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,180
It has to be today.

562
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,300
All right, then. Let's go.

563
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,220
Weightlifting Team

564
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
Gosh, you startled me.

565
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm right on time, aren't I?

566
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,500
I thought you'd be getting off
work around now.

567
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,660
Let me take you home.

568
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,420
I have something to talk
to Head Coach about.

569
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,860
I see. Are you going to have a drink?

570
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,180
That's great. I wanted to have
a drink with Head Coach, too.

571
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,700
I'll just eat some food
and take you home afterwards.

572
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,300
Dae-ho...

573
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,540
-Listen, Dae-ho.
-Coach Choi.

574
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,540
I'll just go. See you.

575
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,500
No, Coach. I must tell you today.

576
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,100
What's the matter, Seong-eun?

577
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,180
You can tell him another day.
He says he wants to go home.

578
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,580
-That's...
-We can talk another time.

579
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,580
-I'll go now.
-Wait...

580
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,660
My gosh.

581
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,460
Dae-ho.

582
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,100
What is wrong with you?

583
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,660
What did I do?

584
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,100
My goodness!

585
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,940
-Oh my gosh! Oh gosh!
-Coach?

586
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,700
Oh, gosh.

587
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,060
We're here, Coach. Hang in there.

588
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,980
-Wait, ouch.
-Hold on for a second.

589
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,060
What should I do?

590
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,180
Be careful. Take it slow.

591
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,060
-How do I turn on the lights?
-You're doing great, Head Coach.

592
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,540
Oh, the lights.

593
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,340
-Go easy. Easy.
-All right.

594
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,900
Okay. Take one step at a time.

595
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,700
You're okay, right?

596
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,060
No, I'm not okay.

597
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,940
-Goodness, what do we do?
-It's a bit messy...

598
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,100
Gosh, it stinks.

599
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,940
Wait. Hold on a second.

600
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,500
Here.

601
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,980
I got you.

602
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,260
Hold on.

603
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,420
Are you okay?

604
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,740
Gosh, it hurts.

605
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,860
My goodness.

606
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,580
My goodness.

607
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,380
It'll hurt more when the painkiller
wears out. I feel so terrible.

608
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,100
No, I'm okay.

609
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,100
At least I didn't break any bones.

610
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,780
I'll get better after the weekend.

611
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,180
You got a fracture in your tail bone.

612
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,460
I can't leave you like this.

613
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,940
You can't wash properly and
should eat before taking medicine.

614
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,580
-I'll return with groceries tomorrow.
-You better not!

615
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,300
What I mean is that...

616
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,300
rumours might spread if
a woman visits a man who lives alone.

617
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
I'm completely against the idea.

618
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,060
What other alternative is there?

619
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,220
He won't be able to even get
a glass of water by himself.

620
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,100
My goodness.

621
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,660
Fine, I'll do it.

622
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,700
I'll take care of him.

623
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,860
I'll get his groceries,
make him porridge...

624
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,140
and support him
when he goes to the bathroom.

625
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,180
I might as well sleep here.

626
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,860
Don't worry about a thing and leave.
I'll take care of him.

627
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,380
Gosh.

628
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,580
I can't eat fast because it's hot.

629
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,700
Two more orders of seasoned meat, please.

630
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,380
Nan-hee, you're eating quickly today.

631
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,780
I was hungry because
I only had bread today.

632
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,940
Meat is the best when
someone else is buying it.

633
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,580
-Here you go.
-Calm down.

634
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,260
You should chew thoroughly,
not just swallow it.

635
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,860
It's okay.
Don't you know we have steel stomachs?

636
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,220
-Steel stomach is awesome.
-Awesome.

637
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,220
Isn't the seasoned meat too salty?
Do you want some rice?

638
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,260
You're acting like an amateur.

639
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,980
We'll fry the rice later.
Don't you know it's FSRN?

640
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,860
FSRN? What's that?

641
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,820
Fresh meat, seasoned meat, rice and
noodles are the basic course meal.

642
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,460
I've never had such a meal,
but seeing you two eat...

643
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,660
awakens my appetite.

644
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,820
-You should join us.
-Join us.

645
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,100
I'm in. Two additional orders
of seasoned meat, please.

646
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,380
-What's wrong?
-What are you doing?

647
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,580
Is Bok-ju's boyfriend giving us
a look for being tactless?

648
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,300
Gosh, I won't eat anymore.
Bok-ju kept giving me a look, too.

649
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,260
What are you talking about?
Help yourselves.

650
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,740
You should help yourselves.
You won't get this chance again.

651
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,140
You already had a lot of
fresh and seasoned meat.

652
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,860
How will you finish
the fried rice and cold noodles?

653
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,260
Thank you, Joon-hyung.

654
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,700
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

655
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,180
Excuse me?

656
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,700
How much is it?

657
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,380
It's 128 dollars.

658
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,980
-128 dollars?
-Yes.

659
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,980
128...

660
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,260
I'll pay with this.

661
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,580
Did you get a new mobile phone?
It's the new colour.

662
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Was it expensive?

663
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,540
No, it was only
half of my monthly allowance.

664
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,980
Gosh, we should have said
we'd treat them next time.

665
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,940
I had to treat them at some point.

666
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,220
I'll consider that today.

667
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,220
Eating with professional eaters
was nice and strategic.

668
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,260
I ate twice more than usual.

669
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,700
Right? I told you.

670
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,900
-Are we going to karaoke next?
-Karaoke?

671
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,220
-Karaoke?
-Are you being serious?

672
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,700
You had a lot of meat already.

673
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,900
-Karaoke!
-Karaoke!

674
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,580
-Karaoke!
-We aren't going to karaoke.

675
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,940
-Joon-hyung!
-Joon-hyung!

676
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,820
Karaoke. Joon-hyung.

677
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,980
-Karaoke. Joon-hyung.
-We'll see you there.

678
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,700
Let's go.

679
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,460
Text from Ah-young

680
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,140
Jae-yi, I'm going to my hometown.

681
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,700
I decided to work
at my father's hospital for now.

682
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,700
I didn't tell you in person in case
I still have feelings for you.

683
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,340
Take care.

684
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,940
The number you have dialled
is not available at this moment.

685
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,060
There will be charges after the beep.

686
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,340
You sang very well.

687
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,740
-It was fun.
-Didn't Joon-hyung spend too much?

688
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,540
-I feel a bit bad now.
-No way.

689
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,500
Did he? We'll treat you next time.

690
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,060
No, I'll treat you next time.

691
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,380
FSRN.

692
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,820
-Awesome.
-Awesome.

693
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,300
See you later. Let's go.

694
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,220
Aren't you coming?

695
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,220
What?

696
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,980
I'm coming,

697
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,580
but I need to talk to
Joon-hyung for a bit.

698
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,220
It's our curfew soon. We have to go.

699
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,420
-We have to go.
-Come on, let's go.

700
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,620
-Let's go.
-Come this way.

701
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,580
Come on, you punk.

702
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,940
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

703
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,660
-Let me go. Gosh.
-Hurry up.

704
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,740
See you in our dreams, Bok-ju.

705
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,540
Joon-hyung.

706
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,260
My goodness.

707
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,660
Let's go.

708
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,060
Where are you going?

709
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,900
Where are you going, Bok-ju?

710
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,340
I have so many questions to ask you.

711
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,220
You're sleeping in our room tonight.

712
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,940
You cunning girl. You won't get
any sleep tonight. Let's go.

713
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,860
Why?

714
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,980
Tell us how far you two went.

715
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,900
What do you mean?

716
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,780
I don't understand the question.

717
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,340
Look how she's pretending
not to understand.

718
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,780
You better answer us now
rather than later.

719
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,260
Nan-hee asked how far you two went.

720
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,700
This is how far we went.

721
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,740
We went to
the movie theatre and the beach.

722
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,580
Come on.

723
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,620
Have you two...

724
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,260
kissed perhaps?
There's no way you didn't.

725
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,620
That's private. I won't make any comment.

726
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,660
They definitely did it. My goodness.

727
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,860
I can't imagine Bok-ju
and Joon-hyung kissing.

728
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,420
I shouldn't be jealous.

729
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,180
I don't want to admit it,
but I'm really jealous.

730
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,100
When did you kiss?
Where and how did it happen?

731
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,100
Tell us in detail.

732
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,780
-Do you mean the first or the second?
-Oh, my goodness.

733
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,780
-Why, you wench...
-Goodness.

734
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,380
You're the ones who asked.

735
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,660
Look at her bragging.

736
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,780
I'm so jealous of you.

737
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,900
Oh, my gosh!

738
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,020
Come to your senses.

739
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,860
You're basically destroying yourself.
Don't live that way.

740
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,540
What's wrong with Bok-ju?

741
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,660
Sure, I like her, too.
She has a great personality after all.

742
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:28,380
But great personality is not enough
to make her your girlfriend.

743
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,900
More than anything,

744
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,020
she eats too much!

745
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,860
-And she's too strong.
-What's wrong with that?

746
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,660
I think...

747
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,860
she's sexier that way.

748
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,580
Sexy?

749
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,420
You're driving me crazy.
This is game over.

750
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,540
You're head over heels for her,
aren't you? My gosh.

751
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,820
Your competition's today, right?
How do you feel?

752
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,940
I'm okay.

753
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,900
Actually, I'm not.

754
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,580
Though I've been competing
since I was a child,

755
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,940
I'm most nervous today.

756
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,500
Do you have a moment?

757
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,740
I don't show this to anyone.
I'm showing you since today is special.

758
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,820
Make your wish.

759
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,100
-Does it grant your wish?
-Of course.

760
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,380
I always pray here before competitions.

761
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,940
-I won, remember?
-Okay.

762
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,260
Do you feel much better?

763
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,660
-Did you wish for the nationals?
-No.

764
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,780
I wished for
a competition without regrets.

765
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,700
Joon-hyung and I will come see you
at the competition. You can do it.

766
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,940
I'll treat you guys if things go well.

767
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,140
You can do it.

768
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,380
I should be gentle
since you're so delicate.

769
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,620
You should eat.

770
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,820
Come on. This is a pretty good meal.

771
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,580
Did you expect a feast or what?

772
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,660
Actually,

773
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,780
I can't eat eggs without ketchup.

774
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,500
Come again?

775
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,260
Never mind.

776
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,180
I'll just eat it.

777
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,860
-I'll go get you a new one.
-Here. Take this.

778
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,780
I have money.

779
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,820
Hey.

780
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,100
Can you get mayonnaise, too?

781
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,820
It's me.

782
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,500
The door was open.

783
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,380
Is he a kid or what?

784
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,620
Why can't he eat eggs without ketchup?

785
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,580
-It's so cold.
-Just stay still.

786
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,700
Warm compresses will help you
recover quickly.

787
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,420
Gosh, it's okay.

788
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,500
I'll do it later,
so don't worry about it.

789
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,900
You should leave.

790
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,860
Dae-ho is right.

791
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,940
People will get the wrong idea
if they see you here. Get going now.

792
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,420
I don't care.

793
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,660
Who cares about what people think?

794
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,260
You know...

795
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,100
that I've had...

796
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,780
a crush on you for the longest time.

797
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,740
Stop talking nonsense.

798
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,220
Why would you?

799
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,060
Why on earth would
a woman like you have a crush...

800
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,140
-on an old divorced man?
-Don't think about those things.

801
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,900
As a man to a woman,

802
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,500
what do you think of me?

803
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,580
Is that a no?

804
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,580
You don't find me attractive at all?

805
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,220
All right, then.

806
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,820
I'm really sorry.

807
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,260
I will never...

808
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,820
put you in an awkward position again.

809
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,220
I'm sorry.

810
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,500
Are you okay?

811
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,220
-Gosh.
-Are you all right?

812
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,220
-Why did you do that?
-Leave it. I'm okay.

813
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,620
It's my fault, isn't it? I'm sorry.
What should I do?

814
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,980
Gosh, I'm so nervous for her.
I hope Si-ho does a good job today.

815
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,420
Girls bond in an unnatural way
that I can't understand.

816
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,740
You're talking about her
as if she's your best friend.

817
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,620
Are you being sarcastic?
You're mocking me now, aren't you?

818
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,620
No, not at all.

819
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,900
I'm just saying that you girls
are very broad-minded.

820
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,020
Anyway, I'm so happy.

821
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,020
We no longer have to see
each other in secret.

822
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,620
We should've told everyone
a long time ago.

823
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,300
How can you say that? They gave you
such a hard time yesterday.

824
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:52,500
Exactly. I've paid my dues, so I can be
open about how much I like you now.

825
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,700
I'm already worried.

826
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,980
People will badmouth me like crazy.

827
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,300
"Is Bok-ju's family rich?"

828
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,420
"Did she threaten Joon-hyung?"

829
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,380
"Bok-ju hit the jackpot."

830
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,260
"She's not good enough for Joon-hyung."
They'll go on about it.

831
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,660
Hey, don't say that.

832
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,460
You're a pretty girl yourself.

833
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,780
Don't worry.

834
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,860
I'll show everyone that I like you more
so that people don't say those things.

835
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,700
Look, okay?
Hello, isn't my girlfriend pretty?

836
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,140
-Sure.
-Isn't she stunning?

837
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,180
-She's so gorgeous.
-You're crazy. Let's go.

838
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,580
This girl is mine!

839
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,260
Hey! What is wrong with you?

840
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,060
Stop it. Let's go.

841
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,060
2017 Gymnastics National Team
Selection Competition

842
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,150
2017 Gymnastics National Team
Selection Competition

843
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,900
2017 Gymnastics National Team
Selection Competition

844
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,300
Hey, Si-ho.

845
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,580
Are you ready?

846
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,980
How are you feeling today?

847
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,300
I'm feeling good.

848
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,020
Just stay calm and do your best.

849
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,700
You know this is your last chance and
a new beginning for me, right?

850
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,180
Team A's Na Eun-ji
of Yongsan Sport University...

851
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,660
and Song Si-ho of Haneol
Sport University, please get ready.

852
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,540
Song Si-ho of Haneol Sport University
is entering.

853
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,860
I'm sure all gymnastics fans
know who she is.

854
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,980
She actually made a mistake
in the preliminary round.

855
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,300
That's right. No matter
how experienced you are,

856
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,340
competitions like this
are very nerve-racking.

857
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,020
Her hoop and Indian club performances...

858
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,900
-were done flawlessly.
-Yes.

859
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,700
She got an especially high score
for artistry.

860
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,140
That's right.

861
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,420
Oh, no. That's too bad.

862
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,900
That was a very big mistake.

863
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,700
Yes. She threw the ball too high.

864
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,780
She'll get 0.1 penalty points per step...

865
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,860
and additional 0.3 points deduction
for going over the line.

866
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,460
It's too bad.

867
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,500
Don't be nervous.
You'll get a good score.

868
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,420
Just control your facial expressions,

869
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,180
and good luck
with the ribbon performance.

870
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,020
Look. Her score is 18.2

871
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:52,020
No points were deducted aside from
those penalty points from the mistakes.

872
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,700
Right. I don't think she got penalty
points for going over the line.

873
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,700
It's honestly so unfair.

874
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,500
We get penalty points for
just slightly touching the ribbon,

875
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,700
-while someone gets no penalty.
-That's what I'm saying.

876
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,460
We can only blame our coach
for not being as influential.

877
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,180
Now, we'll watch a ribbon performance...

878
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,460
by Team A's Song Si-ho of
Haneol Sport University.

879
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:30,900
Haneol Sport University's
Song Si-ho's speciality is the ribbon.

880
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,300
That's right. I hope she can forget
the mistakes earlier.

881
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,220
"Libertango" by Astor Piazzolla.

882
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,180
Hopefully, her performance is
as liberating as the title.

883
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,660
Let's watch it now.

884
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,260
2017 Gymnastics National Team
Selection Competition

885
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,020
-Is she crazy?
-What is she doing?

886
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,940
-What's going on?
-Pick it up.

887
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,020
-Is she okay?
-What's wrong with her?

888
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,020
-Pick it up.
-Did she give up?

889
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,540
-What are you doing?
-Pick it up now.

890
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,900
Hurry up and pick it up.

891
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,580
-What's happening?
-Is she okay?

892
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,220
What is she doing? Si-ho, are you crazy?

893
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,820
-Pick up the ribbon.
-Pick it up, Si-ho!

894
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,500
Your ex-girlfriend was a bit cool today.

895
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,140
I'll admit that.

896
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,380
I know. She was so cool.
I kind of regret breaking up with...

897
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,420
I take that back.

898
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,300
You just ask for pain.
You should watch your words.

899
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,180
If you don't, I will tear your hair out.

900
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,100
You brought it up.
All right, I'll be careful.

901
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,820
Joon-hyung.

902
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:25,820
We'll have our last competition
someday, too, right?

903
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:31,100
Would I be able to
let everything go just like Si-ho?

904
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,900
I'm not sure I can do that.

905
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,820
You don't know that. We can't be
sure what will happen in life.

906
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,180
It suddenly scares me.

907
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,980
Hey. Even if it's scary,
it's not something you can avoid.

908
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,380
Don't be scared.

909
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,100
Let's just work hard
and get through one day at a time.

910
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:52,380
Let's work hard
to lift weights, swim and...

911
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,660
date.

912
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,420
You sound so classy and cool
when you say that, Joon-hyung.

913
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,220
Should I try to be less cool?

914
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,780
That's not funny.

915
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,300
Fine. I will stop, okay?

916
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,820
But if you keep hearing it,
you'll get used to...

917
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,220
That's enough.

918
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,460
-Let's go.
-Okay. Let's go.

919
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,380
Couple Pharmacy

920
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,820
Gosh, I guess Jae-yi is
going to be late again.

921
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,380
He said he has a seminar to prepare.
He should be at his clinic.

922
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,420
I just hope he will get married soon.

923
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,780
He's handsome and has a decent job.

924
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,060
But he never leaves his clinic
when he should be dating.

925
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,300
Are you complaining
that he's working too hard?

926
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,580
People will say you're too greedy.

927
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,660
I just feel bad for him.

928
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,860
I really liked that Ah-young girl
we met before.

929
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,500
I think she likes Jae-yi, too.

930
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,340
I could just tell it right away.

931
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,180
Gosh. Is that so?

932
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,500
Why don't you become
a fortune teller instead, then?

933
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,180
Maybe I should.

934
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,900
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

935
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,140
Hello.

936
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,500
Hi.

937
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,060
What happened?

938
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,380
Why haven't you contacted us?

939
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,180
Whenever we see Joon-hyung, we felt so...

940
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,140
How could you be so heartless?

941
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,740
I'm sorry.

942
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,100
I'm very sorry to you, too.

943
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,300
It's fine. We don't have
to talk about the past.

944
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,380
So how have you been?

945
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,420
You still live in Canada, right?

946
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,900
When did you arrive in Korea?

947
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,500
I've been in Vancouver, Canada.

948
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,180
I arrived in Seoul a couple of days ago.

949
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,980
I didn't plan on coming back,

950
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,460
so I couldn't call you beforehand.

951
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,580
I have something to tell you.

952
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,060
You must think...

953
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,020
I'm such a shameless person.

954
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,220
Those girls have no sense of loyalty.

955
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,780
They didn't even wait for me
while I tidy up the mattresses.

956
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,580
I know eating tonkatsu is important,
but still...

957
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,220
Excuse me.

958
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:49,700
Could you tell me the way to the pool?
I've never been to this university.

959
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,220
It's in that building over there.

960
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,900
Would you like me to take you there?

961
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,700
Thank you.

962
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,820
If you go this way, you'll see the pool.

963
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,420
Thank you.

964
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,980
Joon-hyung!

965
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,820
Bok-ju.

966
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,820
Joon-hyung.

967
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,500
Joon-hyung.

968
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,580
Do you recognise me?

969
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,620
It's me. Your mum.

971
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:17,500
Your mum must've missed you a lot, too.

972
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:20,700
I'm sorry, Joon-hyung.
I should've come to see you sooner.

973
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,700
Bok-ju, you brat.
They want you at Taereung.

974
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,180
-Hey!
-Congratulations!

975
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,220
I'll just drink. I won't touch you.

976
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,420
Did my mum come back
to ask for money? Did she?

977
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,780
You couldn't reach Joon-hyung
since yesterday?

978
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,180
Joon-hyung!

979
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,340
This is even sadder than...

980
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,340
when my mum abandoned me, Bok-ju.
