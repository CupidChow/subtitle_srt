Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,620
Who are you?

3
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,930
What are you doing...

4
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,990
What... What are you doing here?

5
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,010
Where are you going?
Why are you doing this?

6
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
Hey.

7
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Si-ho!

8
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,430
Hey. Are you okay?

9
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,150
Are you all right?
Don't you recognise who I am?

10
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,790
EPISODE 12 Her Bucket List

11
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,470
When did you get here?
Are you back on the program?

12
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,430
No, I just came by.

13
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,750
Don't you remember seeing me last night?

14
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,070
You saw me in front of the fridge
in the lounge.

15
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,510
Oh, last night.

16
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,550
You must've been surprised. I formed
a habit of binging while half-asleep.

17
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,630
You're not sick or anything, are you?

18
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,590
What do you mean?

19
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,150
I just heard that there has been
a fuss in the dormitory...

20
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,630
...about some people saying
they've seen a ghost.

21
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,150
What does that have to do with me?

22
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,470
You're quite nosy. When you have
your own problems to deal with.

23
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,110
It was good to see you.

24
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,710
Side effects of sleeping pills

25
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,150
Sleeping pills initially cause...

26
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,950
...side effects such as drowsiness
and dizziness.

27
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,070
But later, you might develop delusions,
memory defects and even sleepwalking.

28
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,350
I'd recommend you
to stop taking the pills first.

29
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,150
Please come to the hospital and get
checked up as soon as possible.

30
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,390
What took you so long?

31
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,310
- Hey, Bok-ju.
- Bok-ju!

32
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,350
It's so nice to see you.
Are you back for real?

33
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,310
Good for you.

34
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,750
You are the glue of your group.
Without you here,

35
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,030
your friends were depressed,
and it made me feel bad.

36
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,390
It's too early to make a fuss.
Are you heading out?

37
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,230
Yes.

38
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,350
Listen.

39
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,750
What?

40
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,630
Leave us alone, will you?
Take the hint already.

41
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,390
Oh, I get it now.

42
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,190
It's not like you guys are dating.
Why do you have secrets?

43
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,230
Just try not to fight.

44
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,910
Anyway, I'll let you two talk.
See you soon.

45
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,910
What is it? Do you have something to say?

46
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,830
Joon-hyung, have you seen...

47
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,910
- Si-ho recently?
- Si-ho?

48
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,830
- Why?
- She just didn't look so good.

49
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,950
Actually, last night...

50
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,990
You're quite nosy. When you have
your own problems to deal with.

51
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,990
- Bok-ju.
- Right.

52
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,350
Never mind. I'm being nosy again.

53
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,670
Forget it. I'll go now.

54
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,750
What? What do you want this time?

55
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,030
Didn't you lose anything?

56
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,510
Nothing except my mind.

57
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,350
What's that over there? Wait.

58
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,590
What's that?

59
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,990
What's wrong with you?

60
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,030
You aren't working today, right?
What are you doing?

61
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,910
I don't, but why?

62
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,150
So we can hang out.

63
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,030
You said you're up for the experience.

64
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,510
Stop talking nonsense. Experience what?

65
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,910
You promised to do it for a month.
You can't change your mind now, Miss.

66
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,030
Miss? You've lost your mind.

67
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,150
Be quiet.

68
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,790
I'm free at night starting today.

69
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,470
I'm free after the morning,
so think of what you want to do.

70
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,630
I'll call you.

71
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,550
Okay? I'll call you.

72
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,390
See you.

73
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,910
Gosh.

74
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,470
He startled me.

75
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,030
Goodness.

76
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,150
He really startled me.

77
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,390
Gosh, that arrogant punk.

78
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,270
Do you know you're allowed to spend
the night off-campus starting today?

79
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

80
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,550
As the weightlifting team,

81
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,070
there's something you must do
when you go home.

82
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,270
What is it, Woon-gi?

83
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,230
- It's to eat well.
- That's exactly right.

84
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,110
You haven't been home in a while.

85
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,510
Go home and eat your parents'
cooking as much as possible.

86
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,030
Those who had to lose weight
are allowed to eat...

87
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,110
because when you return,

88
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,990
you'll need to strengthen your muscles.

89
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,230
This isn't a favour. It's an order.

90
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,870
Go and eat!

91
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,230
You must starve.

92
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,670
You'll be in big trouble
if you gain any weight.

93
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,510
Just because you have
a three-day break...

94
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,710
doesn't mean you eat 1.5 days
and starve 1.5 days.

95
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,790
You may think otherwise, but
the scale will always tell the truth.

96
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

97
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,470
I'm going to review your routine
on the very day you come back.

98
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,830
It's a special break before you
start the difficult winter training,

99
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,030
so get a lot of rest.

100
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,910
Please stay out of trouble, okay?

101
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

102
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,710
- You're dismissed.
- Thank you.

103
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,950
Joon-hyung, what do you want to do?

104
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,870
Sorry, but I already have plans. See you.

105
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,590
Hey, where are you going?

106
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,950
- Let me go.
- Where are you going?

107
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,550
- Let me go.
- Where are you going?

108
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,030
- Let me go.
- Wait, don't go.

109
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,110
Hey, hey, Joon-hyung!

110
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,310
You little punk!

111
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,670
17, 18, 19, 20.

112
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,030
I made 200 dollars already.

113
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,670
There's always a return to labour work.

114
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,150
Gosh, this is the smell of labour.

115
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,150
Now let's see.

116
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,990
I'll set aside some money
to buy a present for Dad.

117
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,470
This is to register for piano lessons.

118
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,430
In front of Bok Chicken in 30 minutes.

119
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,230
Why does he insist that I get
the experience? It's annoying.

120
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,350
Bok-ju.

121
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,550
Hey, Dad.

122
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,270
Have you seen your uncle?
He was at the restaurant a minute ago.

123
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,550
I haven't seen him.

124
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,990
That little punk.

125
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,590
He's been suspicious lately.

126
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,430
Is he hanging out
at the Race Park like last time?

127
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,590
No way.

128
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,550
After you scolded him,
he signed a contract not to go again.

129
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,750
He can't be there again, right?

130
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,310
Dad.

131
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,910
Are you sick? Why are you sweating?

132
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,870
I'm fine.

133
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,830
I just finished cleaning
the frost in the refrigerator.

134
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,150
Did you go to the hospital yesterday?

135
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,550
Dialysis isn't as effective
after a long time.

136
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,830
What if that's the case?

137
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,630
You don't look so good.

138
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,790
I'm fine. I know my body
better than anyone.

139
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,190
Don't worry about me.
Can you call your uncle?

140
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,630
Where did Uncle go?

141
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,590
Bok-ju

142
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,630
Hello.

143
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,390
- Welcome.
- Welcome, Ma'am.

144
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,550
Gosh.

145
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,670
I thought you were older because of
your grey hair, but you aren't.

146
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,510
You should dye your hair.
I feel bad for you.

147
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,430
- Shall I dye my hair?
- Yes.

148
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,550
Ms Choi, we have to nourish her hair.

149
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,390
The dye colour should be number eight.

150
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,390
I thought you were only good at sports,

151
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,150
- but you're also talented in dating.
- We aren't dating.

152
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,310
- Come on, you might get eczema.
- What are you doing?

153
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,950
Let me do things like this.

154
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,670
Here you go, Miss.

155
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,670
- Please come back to your seat.
- Okay.

156
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,030
Here you go.

157
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,110
Bok Chicken

158
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,190
Hello, Miss.

159
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,670
Why are we meeting in front of my house?

160
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,150
There's nothing wrong with
meeting my girlfriend at her house.

161
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,150
What did you say?

162
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,710
Why?

163
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,670
Are you worried
your dad or uncle might find out?

164
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,390
Why would I worry?
They know you're just my friend.

165
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,990
What are you doing?

166
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,270
It's nice to be relaxed.

167
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,950
I also have you by my side.

168
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,830
What shall we do today?

169
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,390
I'm free all day long,
so you're responsible for it.

170
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,910
Responsible for what?

171
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,910
Bok-ju's Bucket List

172
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,790
Go to an amusement park on a weekday
and ride five attractions.

173
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,710
How about the amusement park?

174
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,350
It's been such a long time
since I've been there.

175
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,990
Amusement park?

176
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,550
How old are you? That's so childish.

177
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,870
What's wrong with that? Let's go.

178
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,950
It won't be crowded since it's a weekday.

179
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,550
Gosh, look at this.

180
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,270
There's a bus
that goes directly from here.

181
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,150
We have no reason not to go.

182
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,950
That's true.

183
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,670
Then, shall we go?

184
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,950
Okay, the amusement park is confirmed.

185
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,950
I almost forgot.
I'm meeting my friends later.

186
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,630
Do you mean your friends in campus?

187
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,750
They wanted to hang out
before they go back home.

188
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,750
Gosh, I completely forgot.

189
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,230
Do you have to meet them today
after talking with them all night long?

190
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,630
Can't you cancel it?

191
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,870
No, they'll throw a fit.

192
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,270
Come on, let's go to
the amusement park together.

193
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,950
I'm so excited.
I haven't been here in a long time.

194
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,870
It's my first time
being here on a weekday.

195
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,590
It's best to come here on a weekday.

196
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,070
- We don't have to wait in line.
- That's right.

197
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,390
Let's get in first
before you start talking.

198
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,470
- Otherwise, we won't make it in.
- Wait, give me a second.

199
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,710
Is someone else joining us?

200
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,950
Joon-hyung!

201
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,870
Bok-ju!

202
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,230
I called him. The more, the merrier.

203
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,310
This is unbelievable.

204
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,950
You're such a team player.

205
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,350
I ran here as fast as I could
after you called me.

206
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,950
You're a traitor.

207
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,390
Why didn't you let me know
about this beforehand?

208
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,670
- You haven't gone home yet.
- I'll take the last bus later.

209
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,590
We don't have anyone else
joining us, right?

210
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,350
Let's go in.

211
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,510
Joon-hyung, wait up.

212
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,150
- Let's go.
- It's show time.

213
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,350
Look how pretty this is.

214
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,870
- Look at the hairbands.
- Hey, hey.

215
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,110
- Let's go in.
- Come on, let's go in.

216
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,910
Let's get one each.

217
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,070
Look at this one.

218
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,350
- How do I look?
- That looks so childish.

219
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,070
What's wrong? Everyone gets one
at the amusement park.

220
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,270
How about this one for you?

221
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,310
No, I hate things like this.

222
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,910
- Goodness.
- Wow, that one matches mine.

223
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,350
Let's get a couple look.

224
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,830
Those look cute together.

225
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,550
- Honey.
- We look like a couple.

226
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,030
- That hurts.
- Here's another.

227
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,470
- You said you don't want it.
- No, it's mine, okay?

228
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,750
- You said you don't want it.
- It's mine. It's totally mine.

229
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,950
You said it looks good on me,
so it's mine. This is mine, mine, mine!

230
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,350
I'll take this one.

231
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,350
- It's mine.
- Fine, you take it.

232
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,310
It looks good on you
since you look like a devil.

233
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,590
Take that one. It looks cute.

234
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,670
- Do I look cute?
- Why is there only one of those?

235
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,830
- The eyes look like yours.
- I turned into a devil.

236
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,630
- Really? Thank you.
- It looks cute on you.

237
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,550
It looks great on you.

238
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,550
Doesn't it look cute?

239
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,910
Don't do that.

240
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,750
The back seat of Pirate Ship
is the most exciting.

241
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,630
Of course, Pirate Ship is awesome.

242
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,870
Which one shall we ride next?
I want to ride Mad Swing.

243
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,910
I don't like that one.

244
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,910
I want to go on the merry-go-round
to take good selfies.

245
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,630
I'm in. Merry-go-round is the best
for selfies.

246
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,350
I'm in, too.

247
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,670
When will I get a chance
to ride that again?

248
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,590
We aren't children
to ride a merry-go-round.

249
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,230
I want to ride Mad Swing.

250
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,150
- I want to ride Mad Swing, too.
- Aren't you afraid of heights?

251
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,750
- You were about to barf...
- No, I'm not.

252
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,150
I came here to ride Mad Swing.
I love that ride.

253
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,950
I love Mad Swing. I love it so much.

254
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,830
I have to ride it today.
I must ride it now. Right now.

255
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,070
Then let's split up and meet again here
in 30 minutes, okay? Go.

256
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,030
- Hey, Joon-hyung!
- Let's go ride the merry-go-round.

257
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,990
- Come on.
- Let's take selfies.

258
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,350
Will you be okay? Are you riding this
just because of me?

259
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,870
No, I like this.

260
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,830
You look so pale, though.

261
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,790
I have pale skin.

262
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,990
I won't worry about you, then.

263
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,150
- Gosh, hold on.
- Here we go.

264
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,630
Safety harness, checked.

265
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,630
I like this ride.

266
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,790
This is the most thrilling moment.
Oh, my goodness.

267
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,030
Here we go.

268
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,950
How refreshing. This feels so refreshing.

269
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,310
Bok-ju, Bok-ju!

270
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,110
Bok-ju, Bok-ju. Bok-ju!

271
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,230
Bok-ju!

272
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,270
Stop!

273
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,470
You're not passed out, are you?

274
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,070
Gosh, Bok-ju is like the energizer bunny.

275
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,070
I feel so nauseous right now.

276
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,430
What should I get for her?

277
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,670
Corn dog.

278
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,310
Churros.

279
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,830
Soda...

280
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,990
Bok-ju's Bucket List,
Share a drink with my boyfriend.

281
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,230
Okay. What a great timing.

282
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,310
Hello. I'd like two churros...

283
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,110
and a cup of soda with two straws.

284
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,470
- Here you go.
- Nice, churros!

285
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,670
- Why did you only get one drink?
- I just want a sip.

286
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,750
What is it?

287
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,070
Is your heart fluttering?

288
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,070
That's quite a face you're making there.

289
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,590
What are you talking about? You're crazy.

290
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,670
Hey! I'm just startled
because it was so sudden.

291
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,390
I don't want this. You drink it all.

292
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,310
All right, sorry.
You can have it all. I won't drink any.

293
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,670
- Hey, Nan-hee.
- Where are you guys?

294
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,550
Come to the square right now.
There will be fireworks.

295
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,630
Okay.

296
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,550
Hey, let's go watch the fireworks!

297
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,230
I'd recommend you
to stop taking the pills first.

298
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,630
Please come to the hospital and get
checked up as soon as possible.

299
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,830
I think it already started.

300
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,150
Wow, it's so beautiful!

301
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,430
How pretty.

302
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,750
It's cold. Use what you can.

303
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,150
What's wrong?

304
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,030
Is your heart fluttering again?

305
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,630
It is, isn't it?

306
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,110
Will you need emergency
cardiac care soon or what?

307
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,230
I won't stop you
if you want to experience it,

308
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,110
but your safety is my top priority.

309
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,830
I'm very worried about you now.

310
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,230
You're crazy!

311
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,510
You've been going on about it
all day long. You're too much.

312
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,670
Out of my way! You're so annoying,
I can't stand you.

313
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,750
Where did those guys go? Goodness.

314
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,150
Gosh, was I too forward with her?

315
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,310
She was uncomfortable enough as it is.

316
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,030
I thought going by her bucket list
was a great strategy.

317
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,270
- Gosh, this is amazing.
- Nan-hee, let's take a photo.

318
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,510
- It looks so pretty from here.
- Hey, guys.

319
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,470
- What took you so long?
- Where have you been?

320
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,750
- It looked even cooler earlier.
- You missed out.

321
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,870
- I want to take photos of it.
- You should.

322
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,750
- Just enjoy it with your eyes.
- It's so pretty.

323
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,150
It's mesmerising.

324
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,910
Wow, it's so beautiful.

325
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,670
Isn't it so pretty, guys?

326
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,590
Gosh, I'm so happy to be here.

327
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,830
My crazy heart.

328
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,950
What is wrong with you today?

329
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,030
Please come to your senses, okay?

330
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,430
All right, it's time to practice.

331
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,430
You're doing that again.

332
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,310
You're going too fast.
You have to follow the beat.

333
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,630
Try it again.

334
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,510
No, be gentle.

335
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,110
I'm sorry. I'm used to doing things
with all my might.

336
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,670
Repeat it 10 times.
If you don't get this right,

337
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,830
- we won't be able to progress.
- Okay.

338
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,710
Why can't I do this?
Do I have no sense of rhythm?

339
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,470
He hasn't called me at all today.

340
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,030
Were you all talking
or are you taking today off?

341
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,910
- Hey, Nan-hee.
- Bok-ju.

342
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,590
Are you back in campus?
Did you rest well at home?

343
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,190
Yes, I'm back in campus now.

344
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,990
But Seon-ok isn't back yet.

345
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,670
I think she can't leave home
for some reason.

346
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,430
So...

347
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,990
- you want to go to Seon-ok's place?
- Yes.

348
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,670
I think I should.

349
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,030
Her phone is off, too.
I'm worried about her.

350
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,390
All right. Then...

351
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,190
you should go and see what happened.

352
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,950
You're getting dialysis today, right?

353
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,070
- Did Uncle go out again?
- Yes. He said...

354
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,630
his friend is throwing a birthday
party for his daughter today.

355
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,150
It's probably a lie, though.

356
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,470
- Get going.
- I'll see you later, Dad.

357
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,150
Make sure you take a taxi, okay?

358
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,150
Bye, Dad.

359
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,310
Cheonji Motel

360
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,630
Bok-ju.

361
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,470
This place is in the middle of nowhere.
It was so hard to find.

362
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,230
Why did you come all the way here?

363
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,830
Hello. Just a second, okay?

364
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,910
- For half a day or overnight stay?
- Half a day, please.

365
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,270
That will be 20 dollars.

366
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,910
Bok-ju, wait for me in this room.
I'll be right back.

367
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,030
This way, please.

368
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,470
Why are you standing? Have a seat.

369
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,630
- Do you want some yogurt?
- No, I'm okay.

370
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,150
Drink it. It's the only
drink we have here.

371
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,990
- Here.
- Okay.

372
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,630
Thank you.

373
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,950
Sit down.

374
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,270
I guess you were worried.

375
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,150
Did Nan-hee call you?

376
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,630
Yes.

377
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,110
What happened?

378
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,470
My parents want me
to drop out of university.

379
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,070
They think I'll never make
the national team,

380
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,750
and I won't earn much money
in a semi-professional team.

381
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,150
I may not even get into one.

382
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,550
They want me to work here
and not waste the tuition.

383
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,310
They're short of hands here.

384
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,510
My parents are working part-time
doing wall-papering job.

385
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,470
And I still have a younger sibling.

386
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,550
I didn't know how to answer my parents.

387
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,270
It's true that I have no talents
for weightlifting.

388
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,750
What are you saying? In high school,
you won a prize...

389
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,430
- in a provincial tournament...
- That was effort, not talent.

390
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,350
Do you know what my nickname was
in high school?

391
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,710
Weightlifting Ghost.

392
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,910
It's because I never left the gym
just like the ghost in the story.

393
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,830
Back then, I stayed there
not because I liked weightlifting,

394
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,390
but because I hated to be home.

395
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,150
I didn't want to man
our motel's front desk.

396
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,030
Weightlifting was the only excuse
I could give to escape here.

397
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,550
But somewhere along the way,

398
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,150
I actually started to like weightlifting.

399
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,470
It's an honest sport.

400
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,550
People appreciate exactly
how much I lift.

401
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,030
I envy you, Bok-ju.

402
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,150
You have talents...

403
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,270
and a father who supports you heartily.

404
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,710
I'd be grateful if my parents
aren't so opposed to it.

405
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,150
Seon-ok.

406
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,830
I told you to take out the trash.

407
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,830
Don't leave it lying around
outside like that.

408
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,270
- Hello.
- Hi.

409
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,070
Mum, this is my friend, Bok-ju.

410
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,670
I told you about her before.
She's my best friend in university.

411
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,910
I see.

412
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,430
What brings you all the way here?

413
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,670
- Did you give Seon-hee dinner?
- Not yet.

414
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,950
Can't you just let her eat ramyeon?

415
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,390
Why would you let her eat ramyeon
when we have food here?

416
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,670
Go prepare dinner for her.

417
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,670
And while you're at it,
hang out the laundry as well.

418
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,310
Seon-ok, I should get going now.

419
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,150
No. You came all the way here.
Let's go together.

420
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,630
Let's have dinner, spend the night
and go back tomorrow.

421
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,550
No. My dad will worry. I'll just go.

422
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,510
Goodbye.

423
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,910
- See you later.
- All right. Goodbye.

424
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,030
Sir. Are you okay?

425
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,870
Can I get some help over here?

426
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,990
The girl who will receive these
will be so happy.

427
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,750
It's for your girlfriend, right?

428
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,030
Well...

429
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,630
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

430
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,110
- Thank you.
- Please come again.

431
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,550
I hope this will work.

432
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,470
I guess Bok-ju is a girl after all.

433
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,510
I thought she would hate flowers
because she can't eat them.

434
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,310
Hey, Joon-hyung.

435
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,870
- Where are you?
- I'm in Daejeon.

436
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,830
I came to see Seon-ok.
I'm on my way home now.

437
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,430
Why did you go there?

438
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,990
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

439
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,270
I should get on the bus now.

440
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,870
So you're getting on the bus
from Daejeon, right?

441
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,990
Okay. Be careful on your way.

442
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,470
My gosh.

443
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,030
Ready to Go Out Hair Salon

444
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,910
Now I'm all ready to go out.

445
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,590
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

446
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,150
What do you want to do?
Do you want to catch a movie...

447
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,470
- or get a couple's massage?
- Dae-ho.

448
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,630
Look... Just a second.

449
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,950
I'm very sorry,

450
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,870
but I actually...

451
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,030
Hello, Coach?

452
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,150
I'm still talking to the university.

453
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,590
I'm asking them to hire you back,

454
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,510
so don't lose hope and be patient.

455
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,750
I'm fine.

456
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,750
I'm doing okay at the hair salon.

457
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,750
How are the kids? Are they well?

458
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,070
I heard about Bok-ju...

459
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,230
from Bok-ju's uncle.

460
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,990
It just turned out that way.

461
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,190
I guess it's not bad for her
to take a break.

462
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,150
Seong-eun.

463
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,270
You'll get enough protein from this.

464
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,270
I'm good.

465
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,070
By the way,

466
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,310
when did you two become so close?

467
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,750
I didn't know you see each other outside.

468
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,950
Well...

469
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,910
Actually, we...

470
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,230
We're friends.

471
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,910
We're drinking buddies.

472
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,270
I see. You're drinking buddies.

473
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,270
Everyone needs a drinking buddy.

474
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,630
Let's drink.

475
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,870
Oh, no. Hold on, Head Coach.

476
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,750
Gosh, you should be more careful.

477
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,750
Goodness.

478
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,750
But somewhere along the way,
I started to like weightlifting.

479
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,550
It's an honest sport.

480
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,350
People appreciate exactly
how much I lift.

481
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,150
I envy you, Bok-ju.

482
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,870
You have talents...

483
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,950
and a father who supports you heartily.

484
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,710
A year ago

485
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,670
I lifted it!

486
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,750
There was a time when
I genuinely liked weightlifting, too.

487
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,230
Hello?

488
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,510
Is this the guardian of
Mr Kim Chang-geol?

489
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,350
This is Gangdong Hospital.

490
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,470
What is this about?

491
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,910
I bought flowers and offered
to be her temporary boyfriend.

492
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,150
Bok-ju makes me do all kinds of things.

493
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,430
Bus Terminal

494
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,870
Bok-ju.

495
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,110
Bok-ju.

496
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,550
Joon-hyung, I must get to the hospital.
My dad was getting a dialysis and...

497
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,430
- Calm down, Bok-ju.
- I must get to the hospital.

498
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,230
What do I do? What if
something goes wrong with my dad?

499
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,510
He's in the hospital, right?

500
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,430
They must've helped him right away.

501
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,630
He'll be okay, then. Let's go.
I'll take you to the hospital.

502
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,430
Dad. Dad...

503
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,350
Dad...

504
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,590
We're looking for a patient.

505
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,550
- His name is Kim Chang-geol.
- He's in Room 1101.

506
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,790
- Room 1101?
- Yes.

507
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,070
Bok-ju, he's in here.

508
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,270
Dad.

509
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,710
Dad!

510
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,350
Dad...

511
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,550
Chang-geol!

512
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,350
Mr Kim.

513
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,270
He's here.

514
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,110
Chang-geol!

515
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,430
Dad, are you okay?

516
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,030
Chang-geol, I'm so sorry.

517
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,790
Please don't die.

518
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,510
Gosh, you're so noisy. I'm fine.

519
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,750
- Why are you making a big fuss?
- Please don't be sick.

520
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,070
Doctor, my dad is okay, right?

521
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,270
He isn't going to die, right?
I can't live without him.

522
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,270
He's not in a critical state,

523
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,470
but his phosphorus level is high.

524
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,550
And his blood creatinine level
is over 10.

525
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,990
He should stay in the hospital for
a few days and get a full check-up,

526
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,310
but I think he should get
a transplant as soon as possible.

527
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,150
A transplant?

528
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,110
Don't stress yourself up and just rest
until tomorrow.

529
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,310
- Okay.
- Yes, Doctor.

530
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,310
Chang-geol. I'm sorry, Chang-geol.

531
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,990
Dad, Dad.

532
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,430
Geez, how noisy.

533
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,990
- Long time no see.
- Here you go.

534
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,150
I haven't seen you in a while, Jae-yi.

535
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,990
Let's have a shot.

536
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,150
Let's cheer.

537
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,950
You two have been close
ever since school.

538
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,510
Why don't you just get married?
Wouldn't that be nice?

539
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,150
Do you want to get married?

540
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,390
Come on, friends don't get married.

541
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,470
- Gosh.
- I got rejected.

542
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,350
I feel totally embarrassed.

543
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,510
Oh my gosh. It's Sang-gu and Hwan-hee.

544
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,550
I got a call from Sang-gu.

545
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,830
He said he's seeing her tonight.
But I didn't think they'd come here.

546
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,150
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
It's great to see you.

547
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,470
How have you been?

548
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,190
Have you been well, Jae-yi?

549
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,230
Yes.

550
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,190
- How about you?
- Me, too.

551
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,270
You haven't changed at all.

552
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,670
I was surprised when I first saw you.

553
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,430
You're exactly like how I remember you.

554
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,070
Let's have a drink, Jae-yi.
I haven't seen you in a long time.

555
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,630
I can't drink anymore.
I have work tomorrow.

556
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,630
You're still so proper.

557
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,270
You have always been.

558
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,390
You were very proper and nice.

559
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,590
You were popular among women.

560
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,870
- Isn't he your ideal type?
- Why are you bringing up the past?

561
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,270
You still like men like him, don't you?

562
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,350
You said you don't like me
because I have no manners.

563
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,750
She still gives me a hard time.

564
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,430
Maybe it's because she hates me
or because she still can't...

565
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,910
forget about you.

566
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,990
Pardon me, but I'm leaving.

567
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,190
I'm sorry, everyone. See you later.

568
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,230
Hey, what's wrong?

569
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,990
It'd be sad if you leave.

570
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,990
Hwan-hee probably counted the days
until she could see you again.

571
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,670
Stay a little longer.

572
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,990
Sit down, will you? Sit back down.
Sit down!

573
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,750
Please stop.

574
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,950
You'll regret this tomorrow morning.

575
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,630
Hey.

576
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,630
I'm not drunk.
I'm only telling you the facts.

577
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,750
Hwan-hee.

578
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,590
Didn't you want to come to Seoul
to see this guy?

579
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,070
- Here he is.
- What's wrong with you?

580
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,070
- You're too drunk. Let's go.
- Let go.

581
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,310
Look at him.
Look as much as you want now.

582
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,470
- Jae-yi.
- Hey.

583
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,550
Didn't you know that Sang-gu
has always been mannerless?

584
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,150
You should have just ignored him.

585
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,830
Did you have to punch him?

586
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,310
You're not a child.

587
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,150
Are you an adolescent?

588
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,750
You're usually reasonable...

589
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,670
and almost never lose your temper.

590
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,710
Why were you so upset?

591
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,950
Were you annoyed by Sang-gu?

592
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,470
Or was it because of Hwan-hee?

593
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,270
Do you still have feelings for her?

594
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,750
- No, it's not that.
- Then what is it?

595
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,630
I'm tired of you being stuck
on your first love.

596
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,150
Isn't it about time...

597
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,950
that you forget her
and date other people?

598
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,190
Let's go. It's late.

599
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,830
When will you ever consider me?

600
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,590
You didn't know?

601
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,150
Did you think I stayed 10 years
by your side like a shadow...

602
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,030
just for the sake of our friendship?

603
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,670
Ah-young.

604
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,390
You really had no idea, did you?

605
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,470
That means you've never once...

606
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,270
considered me as a potential girlfriend.

607
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,230
I suspected it,

608
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,270
but it feels worse to confirm it.

609
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,150
Ah-young.

610
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,710
Fine.

611
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,150
I'm tired of liking you, too.

612
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,350
I'm tired of wishful thinking.

613
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,030
I think it's better to stop now.

614
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,470
This is the end.

615
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,510
It's okay. Just go home.

616
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,390
- Your uncle can take care of me here.
- I don't want to.

617
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,830
I want to stay here, too.

618
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:19,070
Bok-ju, just go home.
There's only one bed for the guardian.

619
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,150
- It's already too small.
- Go home now.

620
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,230
You're only being a nuisance.

621
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,430
There's no need for the whole family
to be here.

622
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,710
I still want to stay here.

623
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,630
You're annoying me. Go home.
I need some rest.

624
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,470
I'll get some things you need
downstairs. You don't have tissue.

625
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,150
Bok Chicken

626
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,630
We're closed for the afternoon.
Bok Chicken

627
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,470
We're closed for a few days.

628
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,870
Towels, Dad's clothes...

629
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,310
What else?

630
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,310
I should pack some inner wear.

631
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,630
Let's pack some inner wear.

632
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,590
What's this? Is it important?

633
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,310
Proof of insurance

634
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,190
What are these? There's a lot.

635
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,990
Proof of insurance

636
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,150
Income under Kim Bok-ju

637
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:20,110
What are all these insurances?

638
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,630
What's the point of having money
when Dad dies?

639
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,870
He should get a new scooter
with this money.

640
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,990
Geez, Dad.

641
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,630
Dad.

642
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:48,030
Oh, seriously. Come on, Dad.

643
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,230
What's this?

644
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,590
Dad.

645
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,350
What's this?

646
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,390
Why aren't you sleeping?

647
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:32,950
What about you?

648
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,350
- Were you sleeping?
- I'm about to sleep.

649
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,310
Why are you still awake?

650
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,150
Are you scared to sleep alone?

651
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,350
I'm not a child.

652
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,230
Dad...

653
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,870
Dad,

654
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,270
I'm sorry.

655
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,670
What are you sorry about?

656
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,270
Just everything.

657
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,270
I'm sorry about everything.

658
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,470
I'm sorry for making you worry.

659
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,830
I'm sorry for making deliveries
when you told me not to.

660
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,990
I'm also sorry that I was rude to you.

661
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:24,070
I'm sorry I said your gimbap was ugly
and didn't eat it when I was a kid.

662
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,150
Cut it out, you silly girl.

663
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,830
I'm more sorry.

664
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,750
I'm sorry that I made you
do weightlifting...

665
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,750
and I feel bad that I could only run
a fried chicken place to raise you.

666
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,270
What I'm most sorry about...

667
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,870
...is the fact that you...

668
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,550
...could never...

669
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,190
say the word "mum"
when you were growing up.

670
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,550
That's not your fault.
It's Mum's fault for leaving first.

671
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,270
I'm sorry nonetheless.

672
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,270
I'll apologise to you on her behalf.

673
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,110
I'm really sorry.

674
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,140
I felt so bad about it...

675
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,270
...the whole time you were growing up.

676
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,470
Don't say that.
I'm the one who should apologise.

677
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,390
I'm really sorry, Dad.

678
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,070
You should go to bed now.

679
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,430
Good night.

680
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,630
Dad...

681
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,910
Weightlifting Department

682
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:34,630
Good morning, Coach.
Did you have breakfast?

683
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,030
It looks like you slept in today.

684
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,470
Your hair...

685
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,350
...is all messy.

686
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,150
Bok-ju.

687
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,110
What's going on?

688
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,830
- Are you back now?
- HSU sophomore,

689
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,630
Kim Bok-ju reporting my return
to the weightlifting team...

690
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:52,990
...for the winter training
after a short hiatus. Salute!

691
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,710
I haven't seen your smile
in such a long time.

692
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,990
Good.

693
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,270
That's the spirit of a weightlifter.

694
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,110
This is great. I'm glad to have you back.

695
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,550
With you gone,

696
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,550
the weightlifting room felt so empty.

697
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,830
I'm sorry to have worried you, Coach.

698
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:15,710
It's okay.

699
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,910
I'm grateful that
your hiatus didn't last longer.

700
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,070
I was only gone for a short while,

701
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,550
but this place has gotten
so messy and disorganised.

702
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,430
It's the freshmen's job
to keep this space tidy.

703
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,230
Where did their discipline go?

704
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,550
I'll assemble them
and train them properly.

705
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,350
Okay. Teach them a lesson.

706
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,030
They're dead now.

707
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,870
Hey, Bok-ju!

708
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,350
- Hi!
- Hey, what happened?

709
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,110
- Are you back now?
- Why did you disappear?

710
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,830
It wasn't because of us, was it?

711
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,350
We were never harsh on her, right?
Were you sick?

712
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:55,030
You should've told us if you were sick.
We were so worried about you.

713
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,550
I'm really sorry. I'll be on my
best behaviour from now on!

714
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,270
You're back, so all is good now.

715
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,710
Stop giving her a hard time.

716
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:02,990
Look at this one. She's crying.

717
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,750
Bok-ju...

718
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:07,950
Bok-ju!

719
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,710
What is wrong with you?
You're overreacting.

720
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,310
Seon-ok is gone, too.

721
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,670
Do you know how lonely I've been?

722
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,910
If you talk about quitting
weightlifting once again,

723
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,150
I'm going to crush you with a barbell.

724
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,630
Gosh, how scary. I'm so scared.

725
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,150
I won't say it ever again. I'm sorry.

726
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,390
Woon-gi, have everyone warm up
and get ready for the training.

727
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,150
Okay. Guys, let's start.

728
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,830
- Okay.
- All right.

729
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,230
If Seon-ok was here,

730
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,550
our trio would be complete
again. It's too bad.

731
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,430
I actually went to see her yesterday.

732
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,550
What did she say?
When is she coming back?

733
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:48,670
I don't think she'll be able
to come back for a while.

734
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,670
I missed you. My life without
you girls has been so tough.

735
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:57,030
I kept having dreams
about the ghost and...

736
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,430
Seon-ok left me, too.

737
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,350
Who did you eat with?

738
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,950
- I ate alone.
- Gosh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

739
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,150
Si-ho.

740
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,710
What are you doing?

741
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:28,870
Even junior high gymnasts
don't make mistakes like that.

742
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,590
Seriously, what is the matter with you?

743
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,590
You're experienced enough to know
how to manage stress.

744
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,030
This won't do.
I'll check on you again tomorrow...

745
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,030
and decide whether or not
to send you on the second round.

746
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,950
- Got it?
- Yes.

747
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,230
Ouch, it's hot!

748
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,750
That means you've never once...

749
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,030
considered me as a potential girlfriend.

750
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,550
I'm tired of liking you, too.

751
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:11,950
I think it's better to stop now.

752
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,270
This is the end.

753
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,390
Hello?

754
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,430
Jae-yi.

755
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,230
It's me, Hwan-hee.

756
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,310
Oh, hello.

757
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,550
I'm sorry about yesterday.

758
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,030
Sang-gu is on edge these days.

759
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:51,870
I see.

760
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,470
I'm sorry...

761
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,750
about that time, too.

762
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,670
I didn't even apologise to you properly.

763
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,990
I've been feeling bad about it.

764
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,150
It's okay.

765
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,750
Thanks for calling.

766
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,270
I hope you can be happy.

767
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,990
This is driving me crazy.

768
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,070
I'll check on you again tomorrow...

769
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,550
and decide whether or not
to send you on the second round.

770
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,070
You went back?

771
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,190
Seriously?

772
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,590
Do you always have to do
the opposite of everything I say?

773
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,230
It was hard for me to be okay
with you taking a hiatus.

774
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,430
Why did you go back all of a sudden?

775
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:36,270
Okay, fine.

776
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,150
I don't care if you need to
catch up on your training.

777
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,990
It's your life, not mine.

778
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,150
Me?

779
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,110
I'll be discharged tomorrow afternoon.

780
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,630
Gosh, don't come.

781
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,910
You said you have to practice.
I have to go.

782
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,870
What was that? Did Bok-ju go back?

783
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,430
She did, indeed.

784
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,510
Gosh, she's such a handful.

785
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,510
Hey, Bok-ju.

786
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,590
It's me. Where are you right now?

787
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,310
I'm at the pool.

788
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,990
I was wondering about you. Where are you?

789
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,590
Are you at the hospital?

790
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,630
I'm in campus now.

791
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,790
Can we meet up for a few minutes?

792
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,590
Indoor Swimming Pool

793
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,590
Wow, it's snowing!

794
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,630
It's so pretty.

795
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,150
Bok-ju.

796
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,110
Why did you come running?
There's no hurry.

797
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,230
I was worried you'd be cold.
When did you get here?

798
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,310
- How is your dad? Is he okay?
- Yes.

799
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:38,470
He got a check-up, and they said
his condition isn't critical.

800
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,110
But they think he'll need to have
a kidney transplant soon.

801
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,550
That's a relief. I was worried.

802
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,550
Thank you.

803
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:50,350
If you weren't there yesterday,
I would've been so flustered.

804
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,150
My mind went blank when I heard
Dad collapsed in the hospital.

805
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:55,430
I couldn't think straight.

806
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,430
Your face was so pale.

807
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,870
Really?

808
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,950
It's snowing a lot.

809
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,390
You're right. It's snowing hard.

810
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:12,910
Joon-hyung.

811
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:17,750
- I came back to university today.
- Really?

812
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,230
Yes, really.

813
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,990
That's great. You belong
in the weightlifting team.

814
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,510
I think so, too.

815
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:29,150
- Weightlifting is awesome.
- Awesome.

816
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,950
When I was coming back to university
this morning,

817
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,870
you strangely came to my mind first.

818
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,350
Even after the training,

819
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:41,030
I thought I should let you know
that I'm back.

820
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,270
Joon-hyung.

821
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,350
I decided not to return you.
I'll keep you.

822
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,470
I think...

823
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,510
I like you, too. No.

824
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,390
I like you.

825
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:08,510
I don't know yet if I like you
as a friend or a guy,

826
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:10,950
but I don't want you to leave my side.

827
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,590
I want you to keep calling my name.

828
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:17,630
You can call me either Bok-ju or Chubs.

829
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,710
We thank Seo-hyun
for her guest appearance.

831
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,150
Did you get in safely?
You should go to sleep first.

832
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,470
No. You should go to sleep first.

833
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,550
- Hey, did something good happen?
- No, nothing happened.

834
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,310
Si-ho? Wake up, Si-ho!

835
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,990
- Joon-hyung, I feel very strange.
- Hi, Bok-ju.

836
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,830
Aren't you allergic to pollen?
What's going on?

837
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,310
Is she not answering my calls on purpose?

838
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,710
Why are you upset?

839
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,830
Do you think you're Mother Teresa?

840
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,350
