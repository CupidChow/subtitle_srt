Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,950
Did you get in safely?

3
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,910
Did you get in safely?

4
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,510
How about you?

5
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,590
How about you?

6
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,030
You must be tired. Go to sleep.

7
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,750
You should go to sleep, too.
You have training tomorrow.

8
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,510
You should go to sleep, too.
You have training tomorrow.

9
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,830
You should go to sleep first.

10
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,750
No. You should go to sleep first.

11
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,790
No. You should go to sleep first.

12
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,070
This will take all night.

13
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,630
I'll go to sleep now, then.

14
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,990
This will take all night.
I'll go to sleep now, then.

15
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,150
Are you asleep?

16
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,870
Are you asleep?

17
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,310
Stop it.

18
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,590
I can't sleep because of you.

19
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,310
Stop it. I can't sleep because of you.

20
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,110
EPISODE 13,
Round off Love, and It Becomes Jealousy

21
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,430
Hello, guys.

22
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,630
-Hi.
-Hello.

23
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,230
Nan-hee. Good morning.

24
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,310
Hurry up.

25
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,630
What's with you?
Did you find a big piece of meat...

26
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,390
in your short rib soup earlier?

27
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,670
Mine only had broth.

28
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,030
Did you? I thought
the soup was delicious.

29
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,910
Why are you so optimistic today?

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,990
You used to say you'd become the
student president and add more meat.

31
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,630
Hey, did something good happen?

32
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,670
No, nothing happened.

33
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,510
It definitely looks like
there's something going on.

34
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,510
Come to the toad's house.

35
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,190
Come to the toad's house.

36
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,870
-What is it?
-A spam message.

37
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,270
Yes!

38
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,070
Okay.

39
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,310
Why did you call me out so early?

40
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,590
I tossed a coin for you. Make a wish.

41
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,710
Hey. You told me to make a wish
to do this, didn't you?

42
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,310
When did you get so sly?

43
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,310
You're no better yourself.

44
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,630
Don't you remember
you threw yourself on me?

45
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,750
I didn't do that.
You're the one who kissed me...

46
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,110
Yes, I kissed you,
but you grabbed my face...

47
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,390
and went wild like
someone who had been starving...

48
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,590
All right.

49
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,910
Let's just say I threw myself on you.

50
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,150
By the way, isn't that hairpin...

51
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,230
the one you used to wear
when you went to see Jae-yi?

52
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,310
-What? Yes.
-Jae-yi said it's pretty, right?

53
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,270
Or did he say it suits you well?

54
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,350
-No, he didn't say that.
-Don't you lie to me! I know he did!

55
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,150
Don't wear that anymore.
Wear something else.

56
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,830
I have nothing else. Isn't this pretty?

57
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,750
It's not pretty at all. It's so ugly.

58
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,750
-Take it off.
-No way. I only have this hairpin.

59
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,550
Take it off! Take it off now.

60
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,030
Take it off.

61
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,270
Just take it...

62
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,750
You pulled out my hair!

63
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,110
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,110
Why don't you come with me? Let's go out.

65
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,510
Stop. My hands are coarse
because I didn't put on hand cream.

66
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,830
It's fine. It feels like acupressure
treatment. I like it.

67
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,950
Let's go, Weightlifting...
I mean Chubs. Let's go.

68
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,590
Where are we going?

69
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,750
Hey, why did you want to come here?

70
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,990
I don't get you.

71
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,910
-Pick something you like.
-What?

72
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,190
Pick something you like.
I'll buy you one.

73
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,950
From now on, don't wear
anything else than that.

74
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,950
Don't wear that
bow hairpin anymore, okay?

75
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,910
Joon-hyung, you're a very jealous guy.

76
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,350
My gosh. How can I not be jealous?

77
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,670
I've seen you crying out in tears
because of Jae-yi.

78
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,670
You shouldn't be so petty
to remember things like that.

79
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,350
It's all in the past.

80
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,950
Listen. Let me say this
while we're at it.

81
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,110
I hate guys who get jealous
over little things...

82
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,110
and play hard to get just because
they're in a relationship.

83
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,190
I can't stand it. It's so childish.

84
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,270
So, don't expect me to be okay with it.

85
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,270
-Are you going to pick one or not?
-I will. Which looks good?

86
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,990
What about this? It suits you very well.

87
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,950
A star?

88
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,670
My gosh. Bok-ju.

89
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,710
Why are you here, Bok-ju?

90
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,270
Bok-ju, why are you on a hairpin?

91
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,790
I like this big one. What do you think?

92
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,910
Let me see.

93
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,590
Try it on this side.

94
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,190
How about this one?

95
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,830
It's a strawberry.

96
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,910
I know it's pretty
even if I can't see it.

97
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,430
Gosh, Si-ho! Si-ho!

98
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,590
Wake up, Si-ho. Is anyone out there?

99
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,110
Si-ho.

100
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,590
Goodness.

101
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,110
Please help!

102
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,670
Ambulance

103
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,990
She looks very sick.

104
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,750
What is it?

105
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,150
What's going on?

106
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,950
Joon-hyung, Joon-hyung!

107
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,870
Hey, Joon-hyung.

108
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,630
Gosh, calm down.

109
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,470
Did Ki-seok call for a meeting?

110
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,310
It's not about Ki-seok. It's about Si-ho.

111
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,230
Si-ho took pills to kill herself.

112
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,590
Bok-ju found her passed out.

113
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,990
The ambulance took her
to the hospital just now.

114
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,830
Emergency Centre

115
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,510
Are you Ms Song Si-ho's guardian?

116
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,870
Well, I guess so.

117
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,750
We cleaned out her stomach.

118
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,950
Her blood test shows that
she didn't take many pills.

119
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,110
I don't think she tried
to commit suicide.

120
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,070
However, she's very weak.

121
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,550
She's malnourished with
elevated levels of liver enzymes.

122
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,750
She has reflux esophagitis.

123
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,270
She's also been suffering
from bulimia and anorexia.

124
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,590
-We'll check her condition for now.
-Okay.

125
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,710
Thank you, Doctor.

126
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,030
Si-ho.

127
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,510
Si-ho, what happened to you?

128
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,790
What happened?

129
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,310
Please open your eyes.

130
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,150
Si-ho.

131
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,950
Si-ho.

132
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,070
Can you see me?

133
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,510
Mum.

134
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,430
Si-ho, it's me.

135
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,190
Si-ho.

136
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,830
Are you okay?

137
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,470
How's Si-ho? Is she okay?

138
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,110
I saw her wake up.

139
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,190
The doctor said
she isn't in critical condition.

140
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,910
Thank goodness.

141
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,830
I think she's been taking pills
for her insomnia.

142
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,670
She suffered from eating disorder, too.

143
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,230
She has to stay in the hospital
because she's very weak.

144
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,750
Are you okay? Weren't you startled?

145
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,590
That's not that important.

146
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,230
I made a mistake.

147
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,070
When I told you that
Si-ho wasn't doing well,

148
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,870
I should have done something.

149
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,190
I saw her binging at night.

150
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,150
You didn't know this would happen.

151
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,750
Don't blame yourself.

152
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,310
Still, I'm her roommate.

153
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,430
I should have checked on her
when she was sleeping in.

154
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,670
I was too excited
after getting your text.

155
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,550
-I'm so stupid.
-Hey.

156
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,150
Stop it. Your head isn't at fault.

157
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,590
Come here.

158
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,870
Gosh.

159
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,670
Missed call from Si-ho

160
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,150
-How about this?
-I like the big one.

161
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,750
What about this Santa?

162
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,150
-Where is it?
-It's over here.

163
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,470
Be careful, Sir.

164
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,270
Mr Kim.

165
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,270
You promised me, okay?

166
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,950
You promised to reconsider...

167
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,670
hiring back Coach Choi, okay?

168
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,590
Okay, don't worry about it.

169
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,510
No, I still don't believe you.

170
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,470
Promise me, please.

171
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,750
You're so silly. I promise.

172
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,310
Please get in the car.

173
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,510
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

174
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,550
-Be careful, Sir.
-Wait.

175
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,670
-Please take him home safely.
-Okay.

176
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,590
You promised me, okay?

177
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,670
Please get home safely.

178
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,790
I only have two dollars left.

179
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,190
Okay, I'll walk home, then.

180
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,550
Seong-eun.

181
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,590
Hey.

182
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,990
You just wait.
I'll make sure you get hired back.

183
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,150
Song Si-ho

184
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,390
Joon-hyung.

185
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,550
Why are you alone?

186
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,310
My sister is at school
and Mum is at work.

187
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,670
Shouldn't you be lying down?

188
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,430
I feel completely fine after
a deep sleep.

189
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,190
It's as if nothing ever happened.

190
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,270
Shall we go out?

191
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,670
-Let's sit here for a while.
-Okay.

192
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,790
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm okay.

193
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,470
I'm sorry...

194
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,190
for missing your call yesterday.

195
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,150
I didn't know that you were sick.

196
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,310
I should have answered it.

197
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,990
It's okay. It's because
I didn't take good care of myself.

198
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,870
Joon-hyung.

199
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,390
I feel very strange right now.

200
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,790
What happened was only a day ago.

201
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,790
But everything that happened
before today seems like long ago.

202
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,710
Maybe it's because I almost died.

203
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,710
As you know,

204
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,190
we matured only through sports.

205
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,590
Life seemed to be over
if we didn't stay competitive.

206
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,710
That's why I hung on to it
without accepting it.

207
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,590
I knew I was going downhill,

208
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,230
but I still struggled to hang
at the edge of a cliff.

209
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,550
But now,

210
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,630
I can let everything go and
train myself without much stress.

211
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,750
I knew it wasn't possible,

212
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,030
but I was persistent about
getting back together.

213
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,310
I'm really sorry.

214
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,870
I guess now we're even.

215
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,270
We have something to apologise for.

216
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,830
Let's be friends.

217
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,030
You'd better respect me.

218
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,270
-When are you getting discharged?
-Tomorrow or the day after.

219
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,270
The doctor said I'm better physically,

220
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,670
but I haven't gotten better mentally.

221
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,510
I might see a psychiatrist.

222
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,190
I have a psychiatrist whom I'm seeing.

223
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,670
He's amazing.

224
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,470
Shall I introduce him to you?

225
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,030
That'd be nice.

226
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,550
Hello, Bok-ju.

227
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,070
-Where are you?
-Me?

228
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,270
I'm at the hospital.

229
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,710
My coach let me have free time,
so I stopped by.

230
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,230
I see.

231
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,110
How is Si-ho?

232
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,390
I think she's okay.

233
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,790
She's calmed down a lot.

234
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,590
I'm relieved to hear that.

235
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,030
I was thinking of visiting her.
Why didn't you wait for me?

236
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,310
I thought you were in training.

237
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,270
Do you want to come now?

238
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,350
Should I? I'll be right there.

239
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,350
Okay, see you soon.

240
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,950
See you.

241
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,510
Why didn't he tell me before?

242
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,030
I'd have come with him.

243
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,230
What are you saying?

244
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,830
Why are you hiring a new coach?

245
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,870
This isn't what you said yesterday.
You said you'd reconsider.

246
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,630
You said you'd hold a committee meeting
and convince the other members.

247
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,470
That was my intention,

248
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,070
but the higher-ups
just notified me. What can I do?

249
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,230
The reason I'm trying to help
Coach Choi get her job back...

250
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,070
is because she knows the students best
and she's been a great mentor to them.

251
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,070
And I know for a fact that she will
continue to guide them well.

252
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,470
The decision has already been made.

253
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,910
My head is pounding, too.
Let's stop talking about this!

254
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,270
Mr Kim!

255
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,670
Fine.

256
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,950
If you're going to push through
such an unfair decision,

257
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,910
I'm going to quit, too.
Do whatever you want!

258
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,870
Wait. How dare you.

259
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,590
Come in.

260
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,230
Hey.

261
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,070
We were outside for a bit, so I was cold.

262
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,550
I see.

263
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,270
Are you feeling better?

264
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,190
I almost died.
I'm happy to see you, my roomie.

265
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,590
Come have a seat.

266
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,030
Come here.

267
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,310
-This is for you.
-Thanks.

268
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,870
I figured you probably should
be careful with what you eat now.

269
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,510
I thought they'd suit you
because you're so feminine.

270
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,390
Thanks.

271
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,870
You're allergic to pollen, though.
Will it be okay?

272
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,030
My nose is a little itchy,
but it should be okay.

273
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,510
I didn't know about your allergy.
Had I known,

274
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,110
I would've just gotten some drinks
for you. I'll take it back.

275
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,870
It's okay. Let's just put it at the back.

276
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,190
I guess I talked too much.
I'm dizzy. I should lie down.

277
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,110
I see. I'll do it for you.

278
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,430
I'll do it.

279
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,950
Here.

280
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,510
Why are you so quiet today?
It's very unlike you.

281
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,790
Do I have to be chatty all the time?

282
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,550
Well, you're just unusually quiet today.

283
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,190
It'd be more unusual
to spot a horse here.

284
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,390
Goodness!

285
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,790
That was such a terrible joke.
It wasn't funny at all.

286
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,870
Thanks to my dad, I'm great
at coming up with corny jokes.

287
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,430
How about we have a showdown?

288
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,510
Cut it out. Stop talking to me.

289
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,870
Gosh. Why are you
so irritable today, Chubs?

290
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,790
I know why.

291
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,430
It's long past your snack time.

292
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,870
You're all grumpy
because you're hungry, aren't you?

293
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,990
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

294
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,110
Okay. Let's go get you something to eat.

295
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,030
Forget it. I'm not hungry.

296
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,910
You're not hungry?

297
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,790
Don't lie to my face.
You're always hungry.

298
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,470
Come on. Let's go grab something to eat.

299
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,430
-I said I don't want to.
-Let's go.

300
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,790
Let's start with eomuk, which you love.

301
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,390
-Hello.
-Hello.

302
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,950
Here.

303
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,190
Which one shall I eat?

304
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,230
Hey, Si-ho.

305
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,270
No, I'm still out.

306
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,270
My psychiatrist?
No, he's not at a big hospital.

307
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,710
He owns a small clinic.

308
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,150
My brother introduced him to me.

309
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,110
Well...

310
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,230
If you want long-term treatment,

311
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,710
I think it'll be better for you.

312
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,030
They just saw each other. Why do
they have so much to talk about?

313
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,910
Get back together, then.

314
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,190
You can ask for a referral,

315
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,550
but my psychiatrist is really good.

316
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,150
No, it's not far from campus.

317
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,750
Do you remember the pasta place
we went together a long time ago?

318
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,430
It's about a block away from there.

319
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,070
Okay. Tell me if you want to see him.

320
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,030
I'll ask him his availability.

321
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,750
All right.

322
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,190
Hey, eat slowly
or you'll get indigestion.

323
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,910
You said you didn't feel
like eating anything.

324
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,190
You're a true natural-born glutton.

325
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,910
How about you aim for setting
a new Guinness records, Piggy?

326
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,590
What? Piggy?

327
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,270
All right, sorry. I take that back.
You're no Piggy.

328
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,470
You're just Chubs.

329
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,350
I can't even call you Chubs?

330
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,470
I've been calling you Chubs, though.

331
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,510
Fine. If you're going to be
that sensitive,

332
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,550
I won't call you by nicknames like
Piggy or Chubs ever again, Chubs.

333
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,190
Hey, stop. I'm sorry. Wait up.

334
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,870
-How much do we owe you?
-16 dollars, please.

335
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,710
-How much?
-16 dollars.

336
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,150
How many did she eat?

337
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,350
-Did she eat all of these?
-Yes.

338
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,590
Come on, Bok-ju.

339
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,190
What's wrong? It's so unlike you
to get mad over something like that.

340
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,230
Just leave me alone.

341
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,510
All right.
I'll watch my mouth from now on.

342
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,670
Forgive me, okay? Please forgive me now.

343
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,670
-Come on.
-Leave me alone.

344
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,990
I told you to leave me alone.
Why did you keep bugging me?

345
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,510
Bok-ju, look at this. I'm bleeding.

346
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,750
Look, I'm bleeding.

347
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,790
It's just a tiny scratch.
Don't be such a cry baby.

348
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,070
What are you talking about?
Scratches like this sting so much.

349
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,070
Just tell me why you're mad at me.

350
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,270
I don't think it's because
I called you Piggy.

351
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,070
-I'm not mad.
-You are.

352
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,830
-I said I'm not.
-You totally are.

353
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,430
Why do you keep saying that? You're
making me angry. You're so weird.

354
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,510
Go away! I have to go to my training.

355
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,790
She's definitely mad at me.
What's the problem?

356
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,430
If he wants to know the reason,
he should reflect on what he did.

357
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,390
Bok-ju, I didn't think you'd be
like this. You're such a girl.

358
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,750
Have some manners.

359
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,590
What was he doing with
his ex-girlfriend in front of me?

360
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,950
Did he have to remind me
they used to date?

361
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,620
I can't even say why I got mad
because I don't want to look childish.

362
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,030
I'm so angry!

363
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,310
I can't believe Head Coach quit, too.

364
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,470
What are we supposed to do now?
Do we have to quit weightlifting?

365
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,630
Hey, I'm sure he didn't actually quit.

366
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,950
He probably just said it out of anger.

367
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,510
What happened to Head Coach?

368
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,750
I think he's been trying
to get Coach Choi rehired.

369
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,110
But they hired a new coach
without telling him,

370
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,110
so he said he wants to quit
and stormed out.

371
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,070
Guys, let's just leave.
Why are we even here?

372
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,870
-Even our professor doesn't care.
-Exactly.

373
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,190
He only cares about Coach Choi who
spent our team's funds.

374
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,910
He doesn't care about us at all.

375
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,390
Guys, let's just quit this.
Forget training. Let's go.

376
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,030
-Let's go.
-It's not Coach Choi's fault.

377
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,630
It's all my fault.

378
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,270
Coach Choi spent our operating funds...

379
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,590
to help me.

380
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,390
I'm sorry, guys.

381
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,790
It's all my fault.

382
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,790
I should've told everyone as soon
as they started accusing her.

383
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,310
I couldn't because she didn't want me to.

384
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,310
See? I told you guys that Coach Choi
would never do such a thing.

385
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,230
What should we do now?

386
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,870
We now know what happened.

387
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,510
Are we going to just let Coach Choi
and Head Coach Yoon leave us?

388
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,470
Shouldn't we ask the school...

389
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,070
to consider the situation
and forgive them?

390
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,790
Will they listen to us, though?

391
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,990
We'll have to make them listen to us.

392
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,550
We're a very persistent lot after all.

393
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,110
The weightlifting team
wants Coach Choi Seong-eun back.

394
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,270
-We want her back!
-We want her back!

395
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,110
Please understand our situation.

396
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,870
-Please understand!
-Please understand!

397
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,710
-Please hire her back.
-Hire her back.

398
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,590
For Whom Does
the Weightlifting Team Exist?

399
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,870
Gosh, it's a lot colder than I expected.

400
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,710
I shouldn't have suggested
doing this outside.

401
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,870
Hey, you said that we have
to protest outside...

402
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,070
in order to show how much we want
her back. It's seriously so cold.

403
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,830
Well, that's true.

404
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,950
I can stand the cold,

405
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,710
but I'm starving right now.

406
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,710
Hyung-chul, are you okay?

407
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,990
-I know you can't skip meals.
-I'm all right.

408
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,910
My life's motto is,

409
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,590
"I'd rather be a hungry Socrates
than a satisfied swine."

410
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,110
We Want Our Coach Back!

411
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,790
Gosh, I smell soy bean paste stew.

412
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,590
It must be on the menu today.

413
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,510
No. It smells like soy bean paste stew,

414
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,950
but I'm also getting a whiff
of the ocean. It must be...

415
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,990
crab stew made with soy bean paste.

416
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,350
Bok-ju is right.

417
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,070
-It's totally crab stew.
-It sounds so delicious.

418
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,390
It tastes amazing with rice.

419
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,030
-Gosh, it'll be so good.
-My goodness.

420
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,270
Stop, guys. You'll get hungrier
if you keep on chatting like that.

421
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,630
We Want Our Coach Back!

422
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,950
For Whom Does
the Weightlifting Team Exist?

423
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,350
Shall We Disband?

424
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,390
What are they doing over there?

425
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,070
Members of the weightlifting team
want Coach Choi back.

426
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,750
-It seems they're on a hunger strike.
-Goodness. They're really something.

427
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,230
Both the professor and his students are
putting on a big show.

428
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,190
It's cold. I'm sure they'll stop soon.
Let's go in, Sir.

429
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,310
"It's a day late,
but happy birthday to you."

430
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,350
I guess the winter training
is not hard enough.

431
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,270
You have so much free time.

432
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,310
I just came by during my dinner break.

433
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,710
I have to go after this coffee.

434
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,710
How about you? Are you seeing anyone?

435
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,590
You rarely come to campus
to see Dr Go these days.

436
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,030
I know.

437
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,310
I have a lot on my mind right now.

438
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,070
Why? Did Dr Go tell you she can't
wait for you to like her anymore?

439
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,350
Did she want to end things?

440
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,430
You're good.

441
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,510
-She said something like that.
-I knew it.

442
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,470
A man and a woman can never be friends.

443
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,710
You have...

444
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,550
such a big problem.

445
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,390
How can you not sense things
that even I can sense?

446
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,550
Tell me about it.

447
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,670
How about you?
Are things going well with Bok-ju?

448
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,190
Of course they are. I'm not like you.

449
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,150
What?

450
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,990
-You confessed to her, didn't you?
-Well...

451
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,990
It's just...

452
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,710
Congratulations.

453
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,350
But it's still a bit hard.

454
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,950
Why do girls...

455
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:21,750
not tell guys what they're mad about
and expect us to just know it?

456
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,470
Do they just like quizzes?

457
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,750
That's the charm of
being in a relationship.

458
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,350
-Why? Is Bok-ju mad at you?
-Yes.

459
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,190
I have no idea why.

460
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,110
I feel like I'm in a maze.

461
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,390
Think about it carefully.

462
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,550
If you keep wandering through it,
you'll find an exit eventually.

463
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,510
You're now in a relationship.

464
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,710
You're much better than me.

465
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,950
Of course I'm much better than you.

466
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,430
Isn't that Bok-ju?

467
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,670
Hunger Strike Day 1,
We Want Coach Choi Seong-eun Back.

468
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,830
What is she doing there?

469
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,990
We want Coach Choi Seong-eun
to come back.

470
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,270
What are you doing here?

471
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,870
What are you doing?

472
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,510
Can't you read?

473
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,030
We're on a strike. A hunger strike.

474
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,510
Hey. The temperature is
below zero tonight.

475
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,430
What are you doing out here
on a winter night?

476
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,270
Why do you care?

477
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,310
Mind your own business.
My team has to do this.

478
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,470
How can I... How can I not care?

479
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,510
If you keep doing this,
you'll freeze to death.

480
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,110
Even if I do,
that's none of your business.

481
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,310
Don't you have other things
to care about?

482
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,910
You're surprisingly nosy.

483
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,070
Hey!

484
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,270
Stop talking to me like that.

485
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,310
I'm just worried about you.

486
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,510
Fine. No one can stop you.

487
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,670
Do whatever you want.

488
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,270
You didn't answer your phone.

489
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,390
You did it on purpose, right?

490
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,390
Yes, I did.

491
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,750
I got too emotional that day.

492
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,310
I'm sorry.

493
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,710
I've been thinking about what you said.

494
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,190
For the past 10 years,

495
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,190
you've always been there for me.

496
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,430
When I had no one to eat with,

497
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,310
when I wanted to have a drink,

498
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,510
and when I needed a company
to a party, you were there.

499
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,950
But I took you too much for granted.

500
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,630
Let's go out.

501
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,310
Let's try dating for real.

502
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,830
Jae-yi, you're seriously...

503
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,350
Do you think dating is a charity work?

504
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,710
You can't love someone
by efforts, you fool.

505
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,790
Ah-young.

506
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,990
I appreciate the friendship
you've shown me.

507
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,590
It's cold. You should go.

508
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,670
What is she doing out there
in the middle of winter?

509
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,110
Dumb people ask for trouble.

510
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:13,830
Why is she mad at me?
I'll never know if she doesn't tell me.

511
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,510
-Gosh, it's snowing again.
-Hey.

512
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,710
-Is it snowing?
-Yes.

513
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,630
Gosh, it doesn't look like
it will stop soon.

514
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,150
Gosh, it's so cold.
The roads will become icy soon.

515
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,710
I'm so sick of winter.
I hate cold weather.

516
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,070
Shall we take a break?

517
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,190
-Yes.
-That sounds good.

518
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,590
Let's take a break and brace ourselves.

519
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,110
-Okay.
-I should go to the bathroom.

520
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,830
We want Coach Choi Seong-eun
to come back.

521
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,270
My feet are cold.

522
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,030
Put on your shoe.

523
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,710
Your arms.

524
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,310
Don't overstrain yourself.

525
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,950
Please.

526
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,190
What is Bok-ju doing there?

527
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,710
What? Who is that?

528
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,150
I don't know.

529
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,310
What is she doing there?

530
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,950
Isn't he from the swimming team?

531
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,430
-What?
-He is.

532
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,950
-I see.
-Oh, him.

533
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,350
I'll go now.

534
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,790
What is he doing here?

535
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,870
They look serious.

536
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,790
He's just my friend.

537
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,790
He's just a nosy guy,
who got worried about me.

538
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,470
I'm so jealous.

539
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,350
I wish I had a friend like him.

540
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,870
I'm so jealous of you.

541
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,150
The road is frozen
from the snow yesterday.

542
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,270
Chang-geol, go in and lie down.

543
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,950
Am I a corpse or something?

544
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,830
I just got up. Why would I lie back down?

545
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,350
My back hurts from
lying down for so long.

546
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,550
Don't you dare pass out again.

547
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,950
Why did that fall off out of the blue?

548
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,950
It seems fine.

549
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,950
I had a strange dream last night.

550
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,630
Give Bok-ju a call right now.

551
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,310
Why would anything happen to her?

552
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,870
She's returned to her training and...
Okay, I will.

553
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,510
Where are you, Bok-ju? Have you eaten?

554
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,590
Second Day of Hunger Strike

555
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,270
Of course I have. Today's menu
was dried radish greens porridge.

556
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,190
I'm at the gym. How's Dad?

557
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,870
I'll call you later. Talk to you soon.

558
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,270
-Hyung-chul, don't fall asleep.
-Okay.

559
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,390
Keep your eyes open.

560
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,910
Wake up.

561
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,590
-Oh, my goodness.
-Hyung-chul!

562
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,590
Goodness.

563
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,430
I'll stay here.
Take him to the infirmary.

564
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,070
-Let's take him to the infirmary.
-Goodness.

565
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,950
-Let's hurry up.
-Hyung-chul.

566
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,310
Poor Hyung-chul.

567
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,150
This is Unfair.

568
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,710
I can't do this anymore.

569
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,150
My legs are about to fall off.

570
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,830
Nan-hee, are you okay?

571
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,550
-Nan-hee.
-I'm not okay.

572
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,190
Bok-ju, your nose is bleeding.

573
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,270
Bok-ju.

574
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,830
Her nose is bleeding. What are we doing?

575
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,350
We can't continue this.
You two should go in.

576
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,150
-I think you've done enough.
-No way. If we quit now,

577
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,350
we won't make any difference.

578
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,510
We might never see Coach Choi
or Head Coach Yoon again.

579
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,310
It's all because I felt guilty.
What have I done?

580
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,590
Woon-gi.

581
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,390
Bok-ju. Nan-hee.

582
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,790
-Hello, Woon-gi.
-Seon-ok?

583
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,590
Seon-ok, why did you come so late?

584
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,910
I was worried, so I ran away
when Mum went to the market.

585
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,150
Aren't you proud of me?

586
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:15,270
Do you have any idea how hard
it's been for me?

587
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,150
Don't worry anymore. You know
my hourly rate is expensive, right?

588
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,470
Seon-ok.

589
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,070
Don't cry.

590
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,030
Come here, my babies.

591
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,870
I really missed you, Seon-ok.

592
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,710
Seon-ok.

593
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,750
You're my roommate.

594
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,710
-You weren't there with me.
-I know.

595
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,350
Woon-gi, we have big news.

596
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,990
This is what we just heard.

597
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,790
The new coach is hired because of
his personal connections with Mr Kim.

598
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,590
He's never done weightlifting.
He minored in physical education.

599
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,070
-Does that even make sense?
-Now the problem isn't...

600
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,910
only about Coach Choi.

601
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,710
Our team can't be
a target for corruption.

602
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,990
Let's start a real fight.

603
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,790
-Let's do it.
-Let's fight.

604
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,670
I can't believe this. Let's do it.

605
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,310
-Okay.
-Goodness.

606
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,470
-HSU is wrong!
-Stop the corruption.

607
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,510
-Stop the corruption.
-HSU is wrong!

608
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,950
HSU is wrong!

609
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,710
Our coach can't be hired
through personal connections.

610
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,470
Don't look down on us.

611
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,470
-HSU is wrong!
-HSU is wrong!

612
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,910
-Don't look down on us.
-Don't look down on us.

613
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,630
Our coach can't be hired
through personal connections.

614
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,670
Our coach can't be hired
through personal connections.

615
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,990
What time is it?

616
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,990
Mr Kim

617
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,030
This is Yoon Deok-man.

618
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,430
What?

619
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,350
My athletes did what?

620
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:20,590
-What kind of hiring is this?
-What kind of hiring is this?

621
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,270
Rise, HSU.

622
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,070
-Rise, HSU.
-What are they doing?

623
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,710
-What kind of hiring is this?
-What kind of hiring is this?

624
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,390
You guys, have you lost your mind?

625
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,870
Who told you to do this?
You should be in training.

626
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,470
I'm really sorry, Head Coach.

627
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,830
However, we had to do something about it.

628
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,470
We want Coach Choi to come back,
but that's not the only problem.

629
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,990
I can't accept a coach who's
never done weightlifting before.

630
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,830
Why, you punks.

631
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,550
Even so, what will you do
if you also get in trouble?

632
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,670
-Go back to the gym now.
-No.

633
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,070
-Go back now.
-No, Head Coach.

634
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,830
-Go back now!
-No.

635
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,750
Gosh, I got it.

636
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,830
I have no choice. Step on me
if you want to keep going.

637
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,470
-No, Head Coach Yoon.
-Please get up.

638
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,870
I will never get up. No!

639
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,270
-Please get up.
-Get up.

640
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,390
-No, I won't.
-Head Coach.

641
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,030
-Please get up.
-Come on.

642
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,310
Fine, fine. I have a call.

643
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,950
-I knew this would happen.
-Please get up.

644
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,270
Hello? Yes, Mr Kim.

645
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,070
I'm blocking the athletes right now.

646
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:33,670
Pardon me? Do you mean that?

647
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,390
Really?

648
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,670
Okay, thank you.

649
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,910
Thank you so much, Sir.

650
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,710
They've agreed to re-hire Coach Choi.

651
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,750
-What?
-Are you serious?

652
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,030
-Really?
-Yes.

653
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,950
The committee will dock her pay
for three months, but she's re-hired.

654
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,710
-We did it.
-Yes.

655
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,430
Haneol University.

656
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,070
This is great.

657
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,910
Hot pads

658
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,590
Hello, Head Coach Yoon.

659
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,790
Pardon?

660
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,310
What?

661
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,350
They'll re-hire me?

662
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,790
-This is delicious.
-Here it is.

663
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,750
Here you go.

664
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,350
-This is awesome.
-Help yourselves.

665
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,710
This is my treat because
I'm so proud of all of you.

666
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,910
You can eat everything
in this restaurant tonight.

667
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,870
All right, raise your glasses.

668
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,990
I'm very moved by how
our team came together this time.

669
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,110
Your determination showed that
anything's possible.

670
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,470
There's no fear in solidarity.

671
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,790
As your professor, I learned a lot more.

672
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,870
Now that everyone is back on the team,

673
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,790
the only thing left to do now
is to train hard.

674
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,270
Let's go, everyone. We can do it.

675
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,270
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

676
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,670
Wait a minute.

677
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,190
Let's hear from Coach Choi
who's finally back.

678
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,270
-Come on out.
-No, it's okay.

679
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:39,710
-Come on, Coach Choi.
-Stop it.

680
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,750
It's been a long time.
Let's hear from Coach Choi.

681
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,310
Coach Choi!

682
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,950
Everyone.

683
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,030
I feel very embarrassed
about what happened.

684
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,390
I'm sorry.

685
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,270
I'm grateful to you.

686
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,350
I really missed you all.

687
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,510
My goodness.

688
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,790
-Don't cry.
-Don't cry.

689
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,710
-Don't cry.
-Don't cry.

690
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,870
You should link arms and take
a shot together to celebrate.

691
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,870
-What are you saying?
-No, thank you.

692
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,870
-Come on.
-Take a shot together.

693
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,470
Take a shot together.
Take a shot together.

694
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,910
-Stop it. We won't do it.
-Okay, fine.

695
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,710
Go!

696
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:25,070
Do you want to do it?

697
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:27,070
All right, here we go.

698
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,350
-There.
-Level 2.

699
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,110
-Level 2.
-Level 2.

700
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,070
-Gosh.
-Level 2.

701
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,990
-Level 2.
-Level 2.

702
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,190
Here, let's try it.

703
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,510
Wait!

704
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,350
Please take...

705
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,030
your arm off of her.

706
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,110
What are you doing?

707
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:01,870
Well...

708
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,150
That's right.

709
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,030
We're dating.

710
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,470
Coach Choi.

711
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,390
-My gosh.
-Seriously?

712
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,790
-Goodness.
-I'm so surprised.

713
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,870
Seong-eun and I are in a relationship.

714
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,030
-Coach Choi.
-My goodness.

715
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,870
-Gosh.
-This is awesome.

716
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,030
I can't believe this.

717
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,550
Dae-ho.

718
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,060
What was that about?
Have you lost your mind?

719
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,710
What? What did I do?

720
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,950
How could you just go and make
that kind of announcement?

721
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,510
Well, it's not like I made it up...

722
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,070
Why are you so mad at me?

723
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,630
-Look here, Bok-ju's uncle.
-Don't call me like that.

724
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,670
My name is Dae-ho, Kim Dae-ho.

725
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,150
And it's true that we're going out.

726
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,070
Am I wrong, Seong-eun?

727
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,550
Dae-ho.

728
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:56,150
I'm really sorry.

729
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,830
I should've told you a long time ago,
but I was too drunk, so...

730
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,590
What are you talking about? We...

731
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,750
We kissed.

732
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,590
Gosh, this is crazy.

733
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,550
You should take responsibility
for what you've done.

734
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,110
You can't do this now.

735
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,710
Does a kiss mean nothing to you?

736
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,310
Dae-ho, I'm really sorry.

737
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,350
Go ahead and slap me. Here.

738
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,590
Come on. Just slap me.

739
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:23,070
-Come on. Just punch me!
-Gosh, why are you...

740
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:27,710
Goodness, I should really quit drinking.

741
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,670
This is driving me insane.

742
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,190
Is it because of Head Coach Yoon?

743
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,270
Are you not opening up to me...

744
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,870
because of Head Coach Yoon?

745
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:43,550
What are you talking about?

746
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:46,910
-That's not the reason.
-All right. That's great, then.

747
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,870
I didn't hear anything you said today,

748
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,310
so I'm going to keep liking you.
Don't try to change my mind.

749
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,510
Dae-ho, wait.

750
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,390
Dae-ho!

751
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,230
What's going on?

752
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,110
Is she unable to pick up
or just ignoring my calls?

753
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,390
What if she got sick and went
into the emergency room?

754
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,390
-Why didn't they finish this?
-Goodness.

755
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,110
Let's clean up.

756
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,190
By the way, isn't that such big news?

757
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,510
It totally is.

758
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,910
I wonder when Coach Choi
and Bok-ju's uncle started going out.

759
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,430
Who knows? I had no idea.

760
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,590
I'd love to have a romantic
announcement in front of everyone, too.

761
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,670
I'm honestly so jealous.

762
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,070
"We're dating."

763
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,350
My gosh! Go, Uncle Dae-ho!

764
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:45,070
-My goodness!
-You silly girls.

765
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,950
You girls have no time to date now.

766
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,190
You don't even
have enough time for training.

767
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,790
You can date guys when you're older.

768
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:53,950
Just look at Bok-ju's uncle.

769
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:56,430
I've always been worried
about that immature guy,

770
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,910
but he managed to find
a good woman for himself.

771
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,670
-Yes, you're absolutely right.
-We'll remember your advice.

772
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,710
-No dating!
-Okay.

773
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,790
-"We're dating."
-My gosh!

774
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,430
Why do you keep ignoring calls?
Who is it?

775
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,710
I keep getting calls
from an unknown number.

776
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,910
It must be a spam call.

777
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,710
Girls, our trio is finally together.

778
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,710
We have to do something special tonight.

779
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,590
Bok-ju, how about staying up
all night and chatting in our room?

780
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,990
I have a stash of chips, too.

781
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,510
Will you guys be okay?
Shouldn't you get some rest tonight?

782
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,390
The warm compresses helped, so I'm fine.

783
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,590
-Bok-ju, are you tired?
-What?

784
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,070
Well, I'm not feeling so bad...

785
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,990
But my arms and legs hurt a little,
and I have a bit of a headache.

786
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:45,750
All right, then.
Let's just rest tonight...

787
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,510
and have fun after the training tomorrow.

788
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,310
I'll treat you girls tomorrow.

789
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,910
Okay! It's on you, then.

790
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,670
-Go in, Bok-ju.
-All right. Good night.

791
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:54,670
Good night.

792
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,150
-Come to our room if you're scared.
-Okay.

793
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,790
I'm sorry, girls.
I'm such a horrible friend.

794
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,270
I used to hate girls
who neglect their friends...

795
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:14,110
when they get boyfriends,
but I need to date, too. All right?

796
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,510
Why didn't you answer my calls?

797
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,350
I didn't know you called.
I just saw it now.

798
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,990
I kept calling you.
I think I called you over 10 times.

799
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,550
Are you all right?

800
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:40,270
My body aches a bit and my feet hurt,
but other than that, I'm okay.

801
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,870
Good.

802
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:45,430
Do you want to meet up?

803
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,870
We have some time
until the evening roll call,

804
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,150
and I have something to give you.

805
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,030
Why did you want to meet here
instead of the toad's house?

806
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,910
It's cold outside.
You're not fully recovered yet.

807
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,510
Here. Thanks for letting me use it.

808
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,390
What? Is this what you wanted to give me?

809
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:20,830
How disappointing.

810
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,870
You could've kept it for longer.

811
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,350
Goodness. What else were you expecting?

812
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:31,710
-Do I need to replace your hot pads?
-No, it's fine.

813
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,190
I need to know this, though.

814
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,790
Why are you mad at me?

815
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,590
What are you talking about?
I'm not mad at you.

816
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,910
I know that you are.

817
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,350
That's why you threw a fit at me.

818
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:44,670
And I really don't think it's because
I called you Piggy.

819
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,430
What is it? I won't know what I did
wrong if you don't tell me!

820
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:52,950
Hey.

821
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,030
I didn't want to look childish,
so I wasn't going to say anything...

822
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,150
Tell me.

823
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,870
You're so sweet to your ex-girlfriend.

824
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,510
Fine, I get it. She's sick.
I understand that part.

825
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,430
But how could you go on about
her pollen allergy in front of me?

826
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:10,870
Did you have to be that obvious?

827
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,510
Then you didn't even
notice me pigging out...

828
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,390
and talked to her on the phone
for so long.

829
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,590
Did you two have that much to talk about?

830
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,670
Was that the reason?

831
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,990
Yes, you inconsiderate and mean jerk!

832
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,350
Gosh, I had no idea you'd be like this.

833
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,670
Didn't you say you hate
the childish, jealous type?

834
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,190
You went on about it.

835
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:34,710
Yet you're totally the jealous type.
My goodness. How very refreshing.

836
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,430
Are you mocking me now?

837
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,710
Hey.

838
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,670
I know that Si-ho and I used to date,

839
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:45,470
but I was feeling bad for not answering
her call on that fateful day.

840
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:47,990
And we sorted it all out
before you arrived.

841
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:50,430
She said we should just be friends.

842
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,030
How can you stay as friends
with your ex-girlfriend?

843
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,430
To be perfectly honest,
don't you have a past, too?

844
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:01,710
Mine was just a crush.
It's different from your case.

845
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:05,870
You're really something, Bok-ju.
You're so cute.

846
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,430
You're seriously so adorable.

847
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,350
Go away. I don't like physical contact.

848
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,390
Don't lie to my face. I know you love it.

849
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,390
-What are you talking about?
-Okay. I'll be careful from now on.

850
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,310
So just tell me, okay?

851
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,030
That way, I'll know.

852
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,390
Let's tell each other everything.

853
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,110
Whether we're stressed out
or feeling sad or embarrassed.

854
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,590
I'll see.

855
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,470
This is so cute. Who got it for you?

856
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:36,590
Dr Jeong.

857
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,470
I'm going to go see Si-ho.

858
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,510
Hey.

859
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,550
All right. Come here.

860
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,030
Come here.

861
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,510
So are we good now?

862
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,110
No, I'm still mad at you.

863
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:56,990
Seriously?

864
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,350
Oh, hello.

865
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:16,830
Haneol Sport University

866
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:22,070
Did you sleep well?

867
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,750
People will see us.

868
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,070
-Did you dream about me?
-Let go of me.

869
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,830
-You can't catch a cold.
-Gosh, hey.

870
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,910
Hey.

871
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,590
There's Si-ho. Si-ho!

872
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,310
Did you just get discharged?
Let me help you.

873
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,310
Are you feeling better?
I'll help you with your bag.

874
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:54,310
It's okay. I would've stayed at the
hospital if I couldn't carry it.

875
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,350
It looks like you two
have gotten very close.

876
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,710
Don't make it so obvious, though.

877
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,870
I'll get all jealous and be sick again.

878
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,990
No, we're not that close.

879
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,590
Never mind, then. I'll see you later.

880
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,150
What?

881
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,190
Hey! Gosh, seriously.

882
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,910
You're cold, right?

883
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,190
Turn around. Look at me.

884
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,590
You're doing so well, Joon-hyung.

885
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,590
Act as you just did
and never look at other girls,

886
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,870
and you can be as mannerless as you want.

887
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:45,070
Also, don't wear things
that show your chest. Got it?

888
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,710
Yes, Ma'am.

889
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,470
You're so cute. Let's go.

890
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,030
Come on.

891
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,670
You're hurting my arm. It hurts.

892
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,390
Win or lose, rock-paper-scissors!

893
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,670
-You lost.
-What is this for?

894
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,270
A flick on the forehead.

895
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,910
Come here.

896
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,910
All right.
So this is how you want to play it.

897
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,590
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

898
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,030
Come here.

899
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,790
Rock-paper-scissors.

900
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,390
Gosh. Go ahead.

901
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,150
You're so dead.

902
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,430
Hey. Hold on. Go easy.

903
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,070
-I'll flick you twice if you dodge.
-All right.

904
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,670
I let you win. Wait.

905
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,270
There!

906
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,030
It hurts, doesn't it? I'm so sorry.
I forgot to control my power.

907
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,790
-Gosh, it really hurts.
-I'm sorry.

908
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:35,870
-Let's break up.
-Don't get mad.

909
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,070
-Let's break up.
-No, Joon-hyung.

910
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:41,030
-Laugh it out. Come on.
-My gosh.

911
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:43,990
Hey, stop it. Stop.

912
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:45,830
Stop it.

913
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:11,030
Weightlifting Fairy

914
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,870
Don't you ever betray us, okay?

915
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:14,910
Especially you, Bok-ju.

916
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:17,910
I was going to ask you. Why do we
have to see each other secretly?

917
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,110
Do I embarrass you?

918
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:21,670
What on earth is this?

919
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,670
It's fine. It's not like you have
a boyfriend to impress.

920
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,510
I can't even go to the cafeteria
because Joon-hyung might see me.

921
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,750
Come down to the lobby.
Can't you come out just for a second?

922
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,870
Hey, stop it. We shouldn't do this.

923
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,750
Bok-ju, we're coming in.

924
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:46,590
Weightlifting Fairy
