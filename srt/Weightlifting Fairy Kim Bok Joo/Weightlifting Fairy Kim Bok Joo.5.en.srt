1
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,120
Weightlifting Fairy

2
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,920
Chubs, what are you doing here?

3
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,570
Why...

4
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,860
What are you wearing?

5
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,730
-Why...
-Joon-hyung.

6
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,860
What brings you here?

7
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,160
Hey, Jae-yi.

8
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,360
-What?
-I was just in the neighbourhood.

9
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,020
I stopped by to eat with you.

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,820
Do you know each other?

11
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,440
-We went to the same...
-Elementary school.

12
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,520
We attended the same elementary school.

13
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,070
Gosh, Joon-hyung.

14
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,320
I haven't seen you in so long.
I can't believe we met again.

15
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,860
We haven't seen each other
for 10 years, right?

16
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,440
You still recognised me.

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,270
It's a small world after all.

18
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,820
She's the cellist
I mentioned to you before.

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,400
That was Ms Bok-ju.

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,190
She's a cellist?

21
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,860
A cellist?

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,440
Yes.

23
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,520
Your major is cello?

24
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,440
You were gifted in music
since elementary school.

25
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,520
-She's also a great singer.
-She is?

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Am I?

27
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,230
You must have been very close
to remember such details.

28
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,190
Of course. We were best friends.

29
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,640
It's great to see you again, Bok-ju.
We'll have a great time together.

30
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,980
-Don't you think?
-Sure.

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,070
It's good to see you again.

32
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,770
I can't believe that
you two know each other, too.

33
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,270
We sure have a strong connection,
don't we, Ms Bok-ju?

34
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,520
You went to the same elementary
school with my brother.

35
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,860
How do you play the cello so well?

36
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,480
She's also very strong.

37
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,820
A cellist is...

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,290
-as strong as a weightlifter.
-I like classical music, too.

39
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,230
It's a dream. This must be a dream.
Such a thing can't be possible.

40
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,350
Why?

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,980
They don't even look like one another.
This is just so absurd!

42
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,390
Hey!

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,060
Cellist Kim Bok-ju.

44
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,270
Wait for me.

45
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,440
I think we're going to the same destination.

46
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,480
EPISODE 5
I'm Happy Because I'm a Woman

47
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,650
You're a cellist?

48
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,130
It makes sense.

49
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,840
Your arms are more fit for a cello
than a violin or a flute.

50
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,510
You understand exactly
what the best thing is for you.

51
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,770
Stop acting like a know-it-all.

52
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Hey,

53
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,520
are you upset with me?

54
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,770
You would call me a know-it-all
after I helped cover up for you?

55
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,230
How could you call me that?

56
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,150
Is he really your brother?

57
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,770
Of course we're brothers.

58
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,650
How long have you been going there?

59
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,270
If you went there simply to lose weight,

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,690
you wouldn't lie about being a cellist,

61
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,400
which means that
you had an ulterior motive.

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,230
Have you...

63
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,940
...fallen in love with my brother?

64
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,270
Isn't that why you go there?

65
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,320
No way.

66
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,400
You and your imagination.

67
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,650
Even if I fell for him, I wouldn't
pay so much just to go there.

68
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,110
Then why are you paying so much money
and going there, Weightlifter Bok-ju?

69
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,400
That's because... Gosh, there's a mayfly.

70
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,520
You've matured a lot, Chubs.

71
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,520
You're willing to go far for a man.

72
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,820
Wouldn't you be in trouble
if other weightlifters find out?

73
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,480
A weightlifter falling for a doctor
at a weight clinic.

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,230
Oh, my goodness.

75
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Hey!

76
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,290
You'll keep it a secret, won't you?

77
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,300
Of course I will.

78
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,900
Announcing it won't do me any good.

79
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,940
You thought I'd keep quiet?

80
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,320
It's unnecessary for me
to keep it a secret.

81
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,940
I'll decide...

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,860
...depending on how you behave.

83
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,360
Come on, what do you mean by that?
You're seriously...

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,820
Are you getting angry at me?

85
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,690
No, I just have a loud voice.

86
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,070
Maybe that's why I sounded angry.

87
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,400
No, I think you're angry at me.

88
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,610
No, I'm not.

89
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,340
I'm getting upset.

90
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,440
I'm not angry at you.

91
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
I'm really not.

92
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,230
Let me think about it.

93
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,320
Think about what? I'm not angry.

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,520
I'm leaving.

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,860
I'm not angry at you. Come on.

96
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,110
I was just... Gosh, I'm sorry!

97
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,110
My goodness.

98
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,680
I can't believe it.

99
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,190
Why did she fall for my brother
of all people?

100
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,150
Gosh.

101
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,730
Oh no.

102
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,690
Why must he be Joon-hyung's brother?

103
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,360
All right, I love fish cutlet.

104
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,400
-Goodness.
-Hey.

105
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,150
Be careful when you sit.

106
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,790
I'm fine.

107
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,960
No, you're not. You should be careful.

108
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,610
Shouldn't she carry a cushion with her?

109
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,860
That would make it too obvious.

110
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,860
Okay, you're exempted
from eating a lot for a while.

111
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,020
-Our friendship is awesome.
-Awesome.

112
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,980
Awesome.

113
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,820
It's very good to see you.

114
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,620
Did you sleep well last night?

115
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,110
I'm done. See you later.

116
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,940
No way. You just started eating.

117
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,410
Come on, we're colleagues.
Why are you acting like this?

118
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,670
Sit back down.

119
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,150
What are you doing? Take a seat.

120
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,860
It's not like we're strangers.
Come and sit down.

121
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,400
Please excuse me.

122
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,020
Why do my hands feel weak today?

123
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,520
Chubs, do it for me.

124
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,820
What?

125
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,070
Cut it for me.

126
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,860
Don't make it too thin.

127
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,020
I'm sorry, but can you
get me some water, too?

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,520
Make it half cold and half hot.

129
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,520
Joon-hyung, why can't you do it yourself?

130
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,070
-I'll get it for you.
-It's okay.

131
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
I'll get it.

132
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,400
I was thirsty myself anyway.

133
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,650
Make it a six-to-four ratio.

134
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,480
It's sweet.

135
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,940
The water tastes especially sweet today.

136
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,110
What's going on between
you and Joon-hyung?

137
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,730
What are you talking about?

138
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,770
Then why are you suddenly
so obedient to him?

139
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,190
Didn't you hate him?

140
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,650
You wouldn't get water even for us.
Something is definitely strange.

141
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,770
What are you talking about?

142
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,020
It wasn't such a big deal.

143
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,610
I just realised
that he isn't a bad person after all.

144
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,360
He's a bit immature,

145
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,020
but I should overlook that
since we're colleagues.

146
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,930
You should've overlooked him
a long time ago.

147
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,070
What made you change your mind...

148
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,110
-...so suddenly?
-I know.

149
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,440
Is there really nothing between you two?

150
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,480
No way.

151
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,560
It's not because I like him...

152
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,440
or because he knows some secret about me.

153
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,110
You guys are too sensitive.

154
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,110
My beautiful skin will be damaged
again the day after tomorrow.

155
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,610
I don't know
if I'd call your skin beautiful,

156
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,070
but I don't want to compete either.

157
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,850
Nevertheless, a competition is necessary.

158
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,440
It's the only event that makes us proud.

159
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,400
That's true. If we win,
we'll get a big dinner, right?

160
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
-Yes. Of course.
-Guys...

161
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,190
Guys, I should take off.
I need to go to the hospital.

162
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,230
Okay.

163
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,110
If anyone asks for you,
we'll make up a story.

164
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,520
I'll get going now. Thank you, guys.

165
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,730
Be careful.

166
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,690
See you later.

167
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,070
She seems so uncomfortable.

168
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
-It's hard to watch.
-Is it?

169
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,270
26.27 seconds. Your head sticks out
too much. Keep it down.

170
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,900
Go.

171
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,400
-Come on.
-I'm tired.

172
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,270
Now, go. That's right. Keep going.

173
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Okay. Good.

174
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,150
If I go to the dormitory,
Ki-seok would know.

175
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,570
Chubs...

176
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,230
I can see where she's headed to.

177
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,270
Okay! Kim Bok-ju, I choose you.

178
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,020
You're maintaining your weight,
but it's not decreasing.

179
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,940
It's not easy to lose weight
in a healthy way, right?

180
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,900
No, it's not.

181
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,440
But I often do sit-ups.

182
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,820
You're doing well.

183
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,190
Let's not be greedy
and get ahead of ourselves.

184
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,110
By the way, I guess you haven't
changed since you were little.

185
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,190
-Excuse me?
-Joon-hyung recognised you at once.

186
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,400
-He has changed a lot, right?
-Yes.

187
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,360
I didn't recognise him at first.

188
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,190
I suppose. He got taller
and his personality has changed.

189
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,940
He was quite the opposite
when he was little.

190
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,980
That's right. But seriously,

191
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,440
he's so sly now.
He keeps messing with me.

192
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,110
I wish I could just punch him.

193
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,770
You only saw him for a minute.
How did you figure all that out?

194
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,690
It's amazing.

195
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,400
It was only for a minute,

196
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,110
but he's so much different from before.

197
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,400
You're right. He's changed a lot.

198
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,360
Instead, he got so handsome.

199
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,480
I wonder. I'm not sure about that.

200
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,610
Why not? Everybody says
he's more handsome than me.

201
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,230
No, he's not.

202
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,020
You're a million times
more handsome than he is.

203
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,520
I'm flattered that you think so,

204
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,400
but I can't really jump up and down
with joy. I'll lose face.

205
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,610
You're really a million times
more handsome.

206
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,190
Really?

207
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,070
Let me see.

208
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,190
Let's begin your treatment.

209
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,320
Do we have more patients?

210
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,020
Ms Joo Hye-jeong changed her
appointment to tomorrow.

211
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,070
Is that so? Let's finish up, then.

212
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,730
-Really?
-Hi, Brother.

213
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,610
What's this?
You come here so often these days.

214
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,690
So? Aren't you happy to see me?
Should I just go?

215
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,940
I am happy to see you.

216
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,520
You still owe me a dinner.

217
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,650
-You didn't buy me one the other time.
-Goodness.

218
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,860
Like someone said, you're sly.

219
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,150
Says who? Who said I'm sly? Who is it?

220
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,110
Who is it? Who?

221
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,440
Hello, there.

222
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,690
I didn't expect to see you here.

223
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,940
Hello.

224
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm having dinner with Jae-yi.
You should come, too.

225
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,110
You don't skip meals
to lose weight, right?

226
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,690
Sure. You should come.
We can go to a buffet.

227
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,270
It's fine I have plans.

228
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,070
Really? Let's eat by ourselves, then.

229
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,520
I should have a nice chat
with my brother.

230
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,940
I have so many things to tell him.

231
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,360
Where are we eating?

232
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,940
Bok-ju, are you seeing this?

233
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,190
Let me.

234
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,770
Do you want this? Here you go.

235
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,690
He's so sweet.

236
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,770
It's seasoned konjac.

237
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,020
It has a lot of fibre
and low in calories.

238
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,320
You can eat it without worry.

239
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,190
Thank you.

240
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,320
Gosh, that's...

241
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,520
You're such a sweet guy, Jae-yi.

242
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,270
This is why you're so popular
among girls.

243
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,940
Gosh, Bok-ju. Be careful.

244
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,650
I feel bad watching you only eat
vegetables trying to lose weight.

245
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,440
To lift weights... No, barbells...

246
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,860
I mean, you should be strong
to lift a cello.

247
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,820
Thank you so much for your concern.

248
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,400
It's hard to be on a diet
while studying music, right?

249
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,730
No, it's fine.

250
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,150
Sure. Some people are gifted
with strength.

251
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,940
Look at her arms.

252
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,400
Gosh. With arms like this,
you'd make a great athlete.

253
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,770
I think you'd be good at
something like this.

254
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,520
Lifting 130kg!

255
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,320
-No. I don't like sports.
-What's that?

256
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,730
You like soccer. Messi, in particular.

257
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,650
-Messi?
-That's...

258
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,860
She asked me if I liked Messi
when she first came to my clinic.

259
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,520
She seems to be a big fan of his.

260
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,630
Do you like Messi?

261
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,940
That's right. I'm a big fan of Messi's.

262
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
So you're a fan of Messi, too.

263
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,730
That's right.
Did you see him score yesterday?

264
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,610
Wow, he scored from a free kick.

265
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,190
The ball went from an angle like this...

266
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,020
Excuse me.

267
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,400
No, I'm not busy. Yes.

268
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Hey.

269
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,230
Do you and your friends ask everyone
if they like Messi?

270
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,070
Is Messi aware of this terrible fact?

271
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,190
Stop it.

272
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,400
-How long are you going to do this?
-Do what?

273
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,320
-What am I doing?
-Cut it out.

274
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
You know what I mean. If I could just...

275
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,520
Drink some water. You'll get indigestion.

276
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,570
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,020
It was my close friend. Oh, the goal.

278
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,190
It was fantastic. Did you see it?

279
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,360
No, I watched weightlifting last night.

280
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,940
Why would you watch weightlifting?

281
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,940
During last night's match,

282
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,360
they lifted weight like it was nothing.

283
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,940
Please eat.

284
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,860
Get in, Joon-hyung. You, too, Bok-ju.

285
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,190
Okay, thank you.

286
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,440
I'll give you two a ride. Get in.

287
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,610
Wait.

288
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,610
Joon-hyung and I will stay
and talk for a while.

289
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,110
Talk about what?
We've been talking all along.

290
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,190
It's been 10 years.
We have a lot to talk about.

291
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,440
Let's catch up, shall we?

292
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,150
She's right. You should
spend some time together.

293
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,730
You still have time until roll call.

294
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,270
I'll get going now.
I'll see you later at the clinic.

295
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,020
-See you later.
-Take good care of her.

296
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,900
Jae-yi, wait. I'll go with you. Jae-yi.

297
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,400
Take me with you. Jae-yi.

298
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,650
Goodbye. Please drive safely.

299
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,400
Do you want me to die?
Jae-yi, take me with you.

300
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,190
You better follow me quietly.

301
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,690
Let's not make a scene.

302
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,020
Why are you lowering your voice?
It's scary.

303
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,360
Why are we here?

304
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,520
-Joon-hyung.
-Don't lower your voice.

305
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,320
You're scaring me.

306
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,070
You're not...

307
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,860
going to kill me...

308
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,520
and bury me, right?

309
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,480
Let's make a deal.

310
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,520
-What deal?
-I've been on tenterhooks...

311
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
you might say something to someone.

312
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,320
I can't live like this.
It will kill me soon.

313
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,860
I'll let you have a big one
and we'll call it a day.

314
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,270
A big one?

315
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,650
What do you mean by that?

316
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,440
You should decide that.

317
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,650
Here. Do you want to punch me?

318
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,440
Gosh, you startled me.

319
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,690
If you're going to shove your face
into mine, give me a warning first.

320
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,520
Also, I'm not a thug.

321
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,520
What do you want, then? Money?

322
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,190
Just how much money can you give me?

323
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,650
I'm a little short on cash right now,

324
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,360
but I'll try to raise some.

325
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,320
How much will it take
to buy your silence?

326
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,820
I'm not sure.

327
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,440
I'm quite enjoying knowing your weakness.

328
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
And...

329
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,980
...at the moment,

330
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,900
I'm not really in need of money.

331
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,070
But if I punch you,
I'll just end up with a sore fist.

332
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,070
So?

333
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,360
Okay.

334
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,610
Let's think about it carefully.

335
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,020
I only have one chance,

336
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,770
so I can't waste it.

337
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,110
Aren't you coming? We'll be late
for the evening roll call.

338
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Let's go.

339
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,770
A deal?

340
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,440
How did she even come up with that?

341
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,440
That Bok-ju girl is such a lunatic.

342
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,070
Hey, hey.

343
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,270
Hey.

344
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,150
-Did you see Ki-seok?
-No, I didn't.

345
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,730
-Why? Did he say he'll kill me?
-Yes.

346
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,190
Also...

347
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,730
There's more?

348
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,730
He signed you for the bags of rice event.

349
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,070
The thing everyone hates the most at
the track meet is lifting bags of rice.

350
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,730
No one wants to do it, so that jerk
put your name down for it.

351
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,690
It's what you're getting
for not showing up.

352
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,860
-You should've stopped him, you fool.
-How exactly was I supposed to do it?

353
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,820
I have no power whatsoever.
How can I stop that jerk?

354
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,770
Just accept it, okay?

355
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,770
It won't look cool, but you should
just do it and get it over with.

356
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,520
I don't care.
I'm going to disappear that day.

357
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,230
How will you handle the consequences?

358
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,230
It's not like that sociopath will
become fond of me after that.

359
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,520
I'd rather just get scolded
and punished later.

360
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,320
I'm going to run away,

361
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,610
so you better keep your mouth
shut about it. Are we clear?

362
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,610
I don't know anymore.
Do whatever you want.

363
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,610
What will you be doing?

364
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,110
I've been assigned with something.
The cheer.

365
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,650
-What?
-The cheer. You know?

366
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
Stop mumbling, will you?

367
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,520
Cheerleading. Cheerleading, you punk.

368
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,360
I'll be a cheerleader.

369
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,940
Jeong Joon-hyung.

370
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,520
You sneaked out again yesterday.

371
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,980
I guess you can consider
the duck walk as part of training now.

372
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,820
Something came up at home.

373
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Right.

374
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,400
I should refrain from giving you
any muscle-building punishment.

375
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,980
The pool water will start
getting cold now.

376
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,020
Just clean the pool, you idiot.

377
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,070
Darn it.

378
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,940
Are you really going to be okay?

379
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,480
You won't be able to handle Ki-seok
once he loses it.

380
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,190
I don't know. I'll cross the bridge
when I get there. My head hurts.

381
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,860
How's your cheerleading practice going?

382
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,320
It's going all right.

383
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,110
I need to pick a colour for my uniform.

384
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,860
Shall I go for silver or pretty purple?

385
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,940
Hey.

386
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,440
You seem to be enjoying it.

387
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,940
What are you talking about?
I'm totally enjoying it.

388
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,730
I've never been so focused
in my entire life.

389
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
You idiot.

390
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,270
What's your problem?

391
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,860
Did you have good training?

392
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,940
I've been waiting for you
to grab pizza with you.

393
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,980
You like wood-fired pizza.

394
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,070
I found a good place.

395
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,690
-Have a great time.
-Hey.

396
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,820
Hey.

397
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,900
Just what are you doing here?

398
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,190
I want to try my best.

399
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,020
Just get used to it.

400
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,650
Relationships aren't like sports.
Effort does not guarantee success.

401
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,150
I still want to give my all
and see if it makes a difference.

402
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,940
I can only give up when I know
that it's absolutely not possible.

403
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,190
I was fine when I was in Taereung, but...

404
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,980
I realise I can't give up
after seeing you.

405
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,020
You're the only thing...

406
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,440
I can hold on to now.

407
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,230
Learn to stand on your own two feet.

408
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,770
Everyone lives their own life.

409
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,980
You can't expect others...

410
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,860
to solve your problem.

411
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,020
I don't want to go for pizza with you.

412
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,360
Gosh, your hair.

413
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,900
I told you to dry your hair properly.

414
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,940
What are you going to do
if you catch a cold?

415
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,360
I was in a rush because of someone.

416
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,820
-Let's go for pizza.
-What?

417
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,730
I want to watch you eat.

418
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,070
Then I'm going to watch you
watching me eat.

419
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,860
What?

420
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,520
What was that about?

421
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,480
Gosh, seriously!

422
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Wait up!

423
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,150
Okay.

424
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,690
I'll accept my punishment.

425
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,650
I'll do whatever you think I deserve...

426
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,770
...if it means we can get back together.

427
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,730
You guys know that the track meet is
finally happening tomorrow, right?

428
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,940
-Yes!
-Yes!

429
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,570
What's our slogan, guys?

430
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,860
"The Best Team with the Best Teamwork".

431
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,770
Let's flaunt our strong teamwork...

432
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,110
and show everyone
that the track meet is our day.

433
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,860
Let's prove it to everyone once again.

434
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,320
-Okay!
-Okay!

435
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,940
-Attention.
-Head Coach.

436
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,360
Why is it our day?

437
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,860
Ye-bin, that's a great question.
You freshmen probably don't know yet.

438
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,940
Since the very first track meet,

439
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
our weightlifting team
has always won first place...

440
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,520
due to our remarkable strength,
endurance and perseverance.

441
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,440
It goes all the way back to 1991...

442
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,980
-when I was a freshman...
-Head Coach.

443
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,110
You said you have a meeting
in the afternoon.

444
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,150
Right, I forgot.

445
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,770
I'll tell you guys next time.

446
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,020
You're dismissed.

447
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,440
Attention. Bow.

448
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,980
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

449
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,360
-We're going to teach you a lesson.
-You better watch out.

450
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,900
Hey.

451
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,610
I overheard a conversation between
Head Coach Yoon and Coach Choi.

452
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,270
Woon-gi is changing his weight class.

453
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,190
Why would he do that all of a sudden?

454
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,520
It's obviously a strategy.

455
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,980
Woon-gi is strong,
so if he bulks up a little,

456
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,270
he can aim for that class as well.

457
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,440
Also, you two are in the same
weight class now.

458
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,190
Then I'd be grateful.

459
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,190
So he wasn't practising
for the semi-professional match?

460
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,070
-I guess not.
-Suddenly I feel so apologetic.

461
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,980
Weightlifting Department

462
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,820
-Thank you for today.
-Bye, guys.

463
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,770
Thanks.

464
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Hey.

465
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,230
Why would you bulk up
just before graduation?

466
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,400
Do you feel that responsible
as a team leader?

467
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,940
I just want to do it.

468
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,730
I want to test my limits.

469
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,230
Your limits, my foot.

470
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,610
It could ruin your health.

471
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,820
Hey, learn to put yourself first.

472
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,980
Don't go overboard for us.
Think about yourself first.

473
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,360
See you.

474
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,570
See you tomorrow.

475
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Sure.

476
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,770
Joon-hyung.

477
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,400
Shall we wrap the weight training
and go play a game for an hour?

478
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,400
Forget it. I don't want to.

479
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,440
Hey, our fingers need exercise, too.

480
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,440
Otherwise, I'll tell Ki-seok
that you won't show up tomorrow.

481
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,020
Do whatever you want, you jerk.

482
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,520
Come on, Joon-hyung. Let's go, please!

483
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,270
He's supposed to be my friend,

484
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,860
but he never cooperates.

485
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,980
Did you have a good meal?

486
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,940
I'm practicing right now.

487
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,860
What does happiness mean for me?

488
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,440
Getting into the national team?

489
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,820
Are you all right?

490
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,940
Give me your arm.

491
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,020
-That feels nice.
-You've been coming here every day.

492
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,190
Did you miss me that much?

493
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,940
My gosh, you read my mind.

494
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,270
I think you got a message.

495
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,480
Song Si-ho

496
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,610
-I don't need to check it.
-It must be from a girl.

497
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,230
Don't be too difficult.

498
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,110
You'll lose her if you play hard to get.

499
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,820
Don't worry about me.
Worry about yourself first.

500
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,520
What do you mean?

501
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,230
You can't afford
to waste your time like this.

502
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,940
Get your act together.
Jae-yi is so popular these days.

503
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,520
Hey, what are you talking about?
We're just friends.

504
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,020
What do you mean, though? He's popular?

505
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,940
Is he really seeing someone now?

506
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,400
I guess it bothers you after all.

507
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,650
I'm not bothered by it.

508
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm just curious.

509
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,820
Just get ready to turn on your signal.

510
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,900
If you hesitate, you may miss
your chance to change lanes.

511
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,610
There must be someone in Jae-yi's life.

512
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,900
Is it that gorgeous model
who comes to his clinic?

513
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,270
What model do you mean?

514
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,940
-You're working hard.
-Yes.

515
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,150
My abs don't seem very strong these days.

516
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,940
It's good to see you working so hard.

517
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,190
By the way,

518
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,190
have you seen Joon-hyung today?

519
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,860
No.

520
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,360
Si-ho, I'm sorry,

521
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,440
but can you not mention him for a while?

522
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,610
I'm going through a hard time
because of him.

523
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,730
Why?

524
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,860
There's just something and
it's uncomfortable. Don't ask anymore.

525
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,980
Infirmary

526
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,690
-Hello, don't I look pretty today?
-Yes, you do.

527
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,860
I'm the queen of HSU today.

528
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,190
-Sure, go on.
-Bye.

529
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,650
Swimming Team

530
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,690
Gymnastics Team

531
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,440
Weightlifting Team

532
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,110
It looks good on you.

533
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,980
I'm so flattered.

534
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,940
-Where's Joon-hyung?
-Joon-hyung?

535
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,150
This is actually a secret.

536
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,520
He ran away because
he didn't want to lift bags of rice.

537
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,230
Where did he go?

538
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,020
Players, please step forward.

539
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,980
-Gymnasts!
-Gymnasts!

540
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,020
All of you are doomed today.

541
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,980
We'll destroy all of you.

542
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,730
I'll attack only one person.

543
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,820
Get ready, set, go.

544
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,730
-Let's go.
-Go, Bok-ju.

545
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,940
Let's go!

546
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,400
Swimming Team

547
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,320
-That's amazing.
-Everyone.

548
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,940
Next up is lifting bags of rice.

549
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,150
Those of you who are playing,
step forward.

550
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,150
List of participants

551
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,360
Jeong Joon-hyung. Joon-hyung.

552
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,480
-Tae-kwon.
-Yes?

553
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,400
Where did Joon-hyung go this time?

554
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,940
I'm not sure. He was here a moment ago.

555
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,440
Did he go to use the bathroom?

556
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,190
Are you kidding with me?
Bring him here right now.

557
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,610
Now!

558
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,520
Are you still playing games?

559
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,610
-What's this?
-The places you go are obvious.

560
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,020
You're either at the swimming pool,
the basketball court or the cyber cafe.

561
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,940
I don't like track meets either.

562
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,360
I didn't know that
you were a good detective.

563
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,020
Were you busy yesterday?
You didn't read my messages.

564
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,070
No, I didn't read them
even though I wasn't busy.

565
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,650
Tae-kwon

566
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,230
Answer the phone, you punk.

567
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,860
What did I ever do to you
to deserve this?

568
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,650
How can I find him
when he's determined to hide?

569
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,400
He finds it easy to use me.
I should just tell on him.

570
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,980
Did I scare you? Sorry, I'm just too hot.

571
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,440
Have you seen Joon-hyung?

572
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,610
No, I haven't. What's wrong?

573
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,070
-It's nothing. Take care.
-Sure.

574
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,980
-Hello, Sir.
-Tae-kwon!

575
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,770
Haven't you found Joon-hyung yet?

576
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,110
I'm still looking for him,
but I don't think he's on campus.

577
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,400
Are you kidding me?

578
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,190
Find him in five minutes.

579
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,190
Do whatever to bring him.

580
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,230
If he doesn't show up,
both of you are doomed.

581
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,770
Ki-seok?

582
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,020
Ki-seok? Ki-seok, you punk!

583
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,360
I'm not Joon-hyung's partner in crime.

584
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,730
Why does he always blame me
for his fault?

585
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,070
I'm not the one who's skipping it.

586
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,230
Excuse me.

587
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,940
Did Joon-hyung do something wrong?

588
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,900
He ran away because
he didn't want to lift bags of rice.

589
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,860
I don't think it'll end with
the usual punishment this time.

590
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,360
He's going to destroy us.

591
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,480
There's an old saying that
one's partner can determine his life.

592
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,020
I completely empathise with that saying.

593
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,190
I shouldn't have been friends
with him in the first place.

594
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,690
Are you saying that...

595
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,230
if Joon-hyung...

596
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,900
doesn't participate in the game
of lifting bags of rice,

597
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,190
he'll risk getting destroyed
by his senior. Is that right?

598
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,270
That's right.

599
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,270
Why is he calling me so much?

600
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,230
What?

601
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,610
I'm glad you answered. It's me.

602
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,270
Who is this?

603
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,270
Bok-ju?

604
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,820
I got your number from your friend.
I think today's the day.

605
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
What are you saying? What's with today?

606
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,360
Let's make the deal before happen today.

607
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,150
-What?
-Listen to me carefully.

608
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,690
I'm going to save you today.

609
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,650
In return, don't ever tease me again...

610
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,320
about my weakness, okay?

611
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,190
I'll take your silence as a yes.

612
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,610
Hey, Chubs. Kim Bok-ju!

613
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,190
Bok-ju!

614
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,320
-Bok-ju? What's going on?
-The phone is turned off...

615
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,980
Where are you going?

616
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,520
Am I sick?

617
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,150
Looking at those bags of rice
makes me want to do something.

618
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,690
Guys, I think Hyung-chul is hungry
again after seeing those bags of rice.

619
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,190
It's unfortunate.

620
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,520
If the weightlifting team could
participate in this game,

621
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,900
-we'd be the winner.
-Come on.

622
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,770
That would be unfair.

623
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,230
If the track and field team runs
the relay races and jumps hurdles,

624
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,610
the track meet would be a talent show.

625
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,270
That's true.

626
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:46,770
Anyhow, as long as the judo team
defeats the swimming team,

627
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,110
we'll definitely be the winners.

628
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,150
Don't worry.

629
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,110
There's no way the swimming team
is stronger than the judo team.

630
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,610
-Judo Team.
-Let's go, Judo Team.

631
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,270
-Judo Team.
-Let's go, Judo!

632
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,070
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go, Judo!

633
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,360
Participants from the swimming team,
please step forward.

634
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,440
Swimming team, are you giving up already?

635
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,820
Anyone who's strong should step forward.

636
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,860
I'm here. I'm right here.

637
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,610
Here I am.

638
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,230
I'm sorry,

639
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,190
but the person who was
supposed to participate is sick.

640
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,520
Instead of him,

641
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,940
can someone else play?

642
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,650
-Someone else?
-Who?

643
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,320
What are you talking about?
Where on earth is Joon-hyung?

644
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,150
I couldn't find him.

645
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,770
Isn't it more important to win?

646
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,940
-Hold him back.
-Why, you...

647
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,110
Here's the player...

648
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,980
who will represent the swimming team
in lifting bags of rice.

649
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,980
Gymnastics Team

650
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,110
Swimming Team

651
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,520
Who is that?

652
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,820
All right, this player...

653
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,150
will participate
in place of Joon-hyung...

654
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,110
and represent the swimming team.

655
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,190
-What are you doing? Get back here.
-You've lost your mind.

656
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,270
Give her a round of applause.

657
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,770
-What's wrong with her?
-I don't know, but she's crazy.

658
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,980
Did you know about this?

659
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,360
We're running late,
so we'll allow her to participate.

660
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,480
For the first round,
we'll start with 40kg!

661
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,730
That's so easy. I'm sure she can
lift 40kg with one hand.

662
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,980
Are we allowed to do this?

663
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,110
-Nice!
-Okay, great!

664
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,400
-Okay.
-Did you guys see that?

665
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,980
-That was awesome.
-My goodness.

666
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,270
This time, it's four bags.

667
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,570
Go!

668
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,360
-Oh, my!
-Amazing!

669
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,020
-Kim Bok-ju!
-Kim Bok-ju!

670
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,610
-Kim Bok-ju!
-Kim Bok-ju!

671
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,440
-Kim Bok-ju!
-Kim Bok-ju!

672
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,150
-Kim Bok-ju!
-Kim Bok-ju!

673
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,020
-She did it.
-Nicely done!

674
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,190
Let's move on to the final round
with five bags. Go!

675
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,400
This is the last round.

676
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,440
-Kim Bok-ju.
-Kim Bok-ju.

677
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,110
-Kim Bok-ju!
-My goodness.

678
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,150
-Kim Bok-ju!
-Go, weightlifting team!

679
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,570
-Kim Bok-ju!
-Kim Bok-ju!

680
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,520
-Oh, no!
-No!

681
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,940
-He lost.
-Hey!

682
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,440
What was she doing, seriously?

683
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,820
We got second place because of you!

684
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,650
-Gosh, I'm so angry.
-Bok-ju!

685
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,650
Bok-ju.

686
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,980
Hey, Bok-ju!

687
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,730
-Good work!
-You were amazing!

688
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,520
-We need better teamwork.
-We've never lost.

689
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,690
-Guys, it's okay.
-It's too bad.

690
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,020
We got second place.

691
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,520
Good work, everyone.

692
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,520
Winning the second place...

693
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,190
is good enough, of course.

694
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,400
We can't win first place every time.

695
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,980
We should pat ourselves
on the back for beating...

696
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,190
the judo team at the tug-of-war match.

697
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,940
Of course...

698
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,690
I'm very sad that our legacy as
the strongest team was broken...

699
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,440
while I'm in charge of the team.

700
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,480
Not even two points.

701
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,270
One point would've been enough...

702
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,520
to make us the co-champion.

703
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:01,320
It's not the end of the world, though.
Process matters more than outcome.

704
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,020
I'm happy if you guys had fun.

705
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,820
Eat. Eat up.

706
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,690
You're not eating, Head Coach?

707
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,650
I don't really have any appetite.
I'm not going to eat anything!

708
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,860
No, I mean...

709
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,070
Eat it and get some rest, okay?

710
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,110
Good work, everyone.

711
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,520
Don't forget to massage your muscles,

712
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:30,480
and don't be late tomorrow.

713
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,440
Geez, Kim Bok-ju!

714
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,770
Do they want us to eat this or not?

715
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,820
This isn't even much.
Head Coach is so mean.

716
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,190
We were so close to winning, though.
We lost by one point.

717
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,190
Exactly. You should've run faster.

718
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,270
We could've earned five points
if you got into the top three.

719
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,020
Why are you putting the blame on me?

720
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,520
What did they call her again?
A helper? A rat?

721
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,020
If she didn't betray us,

722
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,940
the swimming team wouldn't have won.

723
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,070
You're right.

724
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,400
Hey, Bok-ju.

725
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,520
What on earth were you thinking?

726
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,320
I didn't know that this would be
the outcome. I'm sorry.

727
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,770
You're a psycho if you did it
expecting this outcome.

728
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,770
Hey, don't eat that burger.

729
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,320
Go to the swimming team
and ask for one. Don't eat it!

730
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,150
That's enough, guys. What's done is done.

731
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,110
Bok-ju.

732
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,190
You should clean up everything after.

733
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,940
You can do that, right?

734
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,520
How light.

735
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,150
That's way too light
of a punishment for a betrayer.

736
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,150
You're really something.

737
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:35,940
What are you looking at?

738
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,020
Get your act together, will you?

739
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,190
I've never...

740
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,520
I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say.

741
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,480
Bok-ju.

742
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,320
You have a crush
on Joon-hyung, don't you?

743
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,480
Hey.

744
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,230
What are you talking about?

745
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,320
Don't lie to my face.

746
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,320
You can't fool me.

747
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,480
That's the only plausible explanation
there is.

748
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,730
A substitute?
You've got to be kidding me.

749
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,520
Why would you stand in for him
and help the swimming team otherwise?

750
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,440
You obviously like him.

751
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,190
That's why you risked worsening...

752
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,440
your condition and lifted all those bags.

753
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,900
I knew something was up
between the two of you.

754
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,020
Hey, Bok-ju.

755
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,520
-Is that really what happened?
-Not at all!

756
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,900
I wish I could turn my heart
inside out and show you.

757
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,230
-You're driving me crazy.
-You're driving us crazy.

758
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,820
Explain why you did that
so we can understand.

759
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,190
You got it all wrong.

760
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,900
-I don't like him.
-You do like him. I can tell.

761
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,730
I can't believe you did that because
of a guy. How could you betray us?

762
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,610
I really...

763
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,520
Anyway, I really don't!

764
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,860
Hey, you should've stopped her.

765
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,940
How could you just let her do that?

766
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,480
She said she was indebted to you...

767
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,650
and wanted to do it
so she could call it even.

768
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,770
I couldn't stop her.

769
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,150
Shut it, you fool. This puts her
in such an awkward situation.

770
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,480
The weightlifting team
lost because of her.

771
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:02,110
She has become a traitor to them!

772
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,110
It's just a track meet.
Don't be so dramatic.

773
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,020
I'm just saying. You piece of...

774
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,230
Oh, there she is.

775
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,150
Girls, believe me.

776
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,610
That's really not what happened, okay?

777
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,190
-All right, we heard you.
-I'll explain.

778
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,980
-We heard you.
-Enough. We already figured it out.

779
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,770
Hey, no, no.
It's not what you're thinking.

780
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,940
Let's talk.

781
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,320
-All right. Let go of me first.
-Bok-ju...

782
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,520
Okay, but let go of me. I said, let go!

783
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,020
Wait, why is that jerk dragging Bok-ju?

784
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,110
-Where is he taking her?
-It seems we have a big problem.

785
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,940
What is this about? What do you want?

786
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,860
What on earth were you thinking?

787
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,190
I told you on the phone. We're even now.

788
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,980
I no longer want to worry
about you exposing it,

789
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,980
and I'm done getting teased by you.
What? Need I explain more?

790
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,650
You're insane if you go ahead
and reveal my secret after this.

791
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,400
Be sure to keep your mouth
shut from this moment on.

792
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,860
You better keep my secret safe.

793
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,480
What kind of person do you think I am?

794
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,980
Even if you think I'm thoughtless,

795
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,440
how can you assume that
I'd tell your team members?

796
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:10,940
I'm not talking about that.

797
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,940
Don't tell Dr Jeong.

798
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
He's your brother.
What if you let it slip?

799
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,400
I don't want him to think
that I'm a liar,

800
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,650
so please don't tell him, okay?

801
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,980
Do you like him that much?

802
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,270
-Just what do you like about him?
-Yes, I like him. So what?

803
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,400
Am I not allowed to like a guy?

804
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,940
I don't even expect him to like me back.

805
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,520
I just want to see him and like him.
Can't I even do that?

806
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,520
I'm sorry that I ended up
falling for your brother.

807
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,360
So what do you think?

808
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,110
Bok-ju likes your friend, doesn't she?

809
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,150
I'm not too sure. I can't really tell.

810
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,440
-What are you saying exactly?
-I wonder, too.

811
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,360
I can be a little wishy-washy.

812
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,570
I'm just realising that we don't
even know each other's names...

813
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,520
even though we've met many times.

814
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,020
I'm Cho Tae-kwon from the swimming team.

815
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,770
I'm Jeong Nan-hee
from the weightlifting team.

816
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,900
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Seon-ok.

817
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,730
Nice you meet you both.

818
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,520
I'm so happy to know
cool girls like you. First off,

819
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,900
I must apologise to you for the mishap
caused by my foolish friend.

820
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,860
I'm happy we've become friends.

821
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,650
Don't you worry. We don't have any
hard feelings towards you, Tae-kwon.

822
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,360
Your friend is the problem.

823
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,110
I think he's toying
with Bok-ju's feelings.

824
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,610
It looks like he's leading her on.

825
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,980
Right. He can be like that.

826
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:58,020
He's a little full of himself
and plays games with people's emotions.

827
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:01,270
I told him numerous times
he'd get punished for his deeds,

828
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,480
but he never listens to any of my advice.

829
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,690
Anyway,

830
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,610
I'll guide him to the best of my
ability so that there's no problem.

831
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:11,360
You should.

832
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,110
I'm glad that we're on the same page.

833
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,110
This is a little awkward, though.
Can we just talk casually?

834
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,320
Of course! By all means.

835
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,520
Talk to me however you want.
I don't mind.

836
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,860
Okay, Tae-kwon.

837
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,860
-Great stuff, Nan-ok.
-What?

838
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,980
I'm Nan-hee.

839
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,320
-Her name is Seon-ok.
-Let's go.

840
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,360
Okay, Seon-ok.

841
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,940
Did he reject her?

842
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:32,730
-My gosh!
-Hey, Bok-ju!

843
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:36,730
Hey.

844
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,270
My goodness.

845
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:39,860
I was so nervous.

846
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,020
Why are they so scary?
And what took you so long?

847
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,940
Gosh, my legs are wobbly.

848
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,020
Drink up.

849
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:56,770
Drink away and forget everything.

850
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,400
Yes. Dating a handsome guy
would be too nerve-racking.

851
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,070
Enough! I told you
that's not what's going on.

852
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,150
Right. There's no point in talking
about what's already done.

853
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,860
Just forget about him!

854
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,230
Fine, think whatever you want.

855
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,150
It doesn't even matter.

856
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,730
Hey, I'll hook you up with guys.
I know many guys.

857
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,980
What do you think of him? He's in rowing.

858
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,360
I have my eyes on him,
but I'll introduce you to him...

859
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,520
if he's your type.

860
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,570
Or what about that Tae-kwon guy?
What do you think of him?

861
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,070
He seems like a much easier
target than Joon-hyung.

862
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,360
Bok-ju has standards, too.
Don't be so ridiculous.

863
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,320
What do you mean?

864
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,190
I think he's cute.
He'll be easy to deal with.

865
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,270
He's also pretty stylish and sweet.

866
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,020
Sure. You like all guys.
Go ahead and date everyone.

867
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,230
I miss him so much.

868
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Hey, Bok-ju.

869
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,820
I feel so bad for her.

870
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,360
I miss him so much.

871
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,520
I miss him.

872
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:04,900
I really do.

873
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,650
I really miss him.

874
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,520
Listen.

875
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,020
Can I ask you something?

876
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,860
Sure. What is it?

877
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,520
Why did you...

878
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,690
lift the rice bags
for Joon-hyung yesterday?

879
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,400
Oh, that?

880
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,270
I just...

881
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,820
had a reason. That's all I can say.

882
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,230
It's a personal matter. I'm sorry.

883
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,270
Is that so?

884
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,730
I see you can be quite secretive, too.

885
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,650
I gave a ticket to Jae-yi as well.
He'll sit next to you.

886
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,320
Act surprised. It's my gift.

887
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,690
Symphony Orchestra

888
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,610
Bok-ju, why aren't you more excited?
You like this.

889
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,820
I made you a good one. Here. Eat this.

890
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,190
It's so delicious.

891
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,820
It's good.

892
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,020
It was so fun.

893
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,110
Don't you think
the lounge looks like a marketplace?

894
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:00,480
They're sitting there like
a bunch of old ladies.

895
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:03,270
-Gosh, I know.
-Look at their posture.

896
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,440
Mind your own business.

897
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,440
We can eat or do whatever we want.
It doesn't concern you.

898
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,360
Have pity on them.

899
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:12,150
Appetite is
one of the three human desires,

900
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,110
but they can't help it.

901
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,690
Fine. I'm sure there are things
you can't help, too.

902
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,070
Let's say we're even.

903
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,690
-Am I right, nuns?
-They've never dated men.

904
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,940
-How faithful.
-How dare you.

905
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,650
-Gosh, she startled me.
-Fine. We'll go.

906
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,070
Goodness, what's wrong with her?

907
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,440
Words don't work on them.
Only force does.

908
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,730
Should I go? Or not?

909
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,320
Should I just go?

910
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,690
He'll think it's strange
if I sit next to him.

911
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,730
I don't have an outfit to wear
for an orchestra.

912
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:50,820
Gosh, let's just forget about it.

913
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,230
Joon-hyung, Tae-kwon.

914
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,440
You're not wiping hard enough.

915
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,110
What? Does it hurt your pride that
you're cleaning with the freshmen?

916
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,230
-Do you want to do it alone?
-No!

917
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,820
We'll work harder!

918
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,730
All right. Work harder.

919
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,940
Okay.

920
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:24,360
Gosh, my arms hurt.
Still, it was better than I expected.

921
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,320
If we hadn't won,
it would've been much worse.

922
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:29,860
We owe it to your friend.

923
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,020
-Are you happy?
-Of course I am.

924
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,230
By the way, does she really like you?

925
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,190
Her friends seem to think that way.

926
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,820
They're mistaken.
She pines for someone else.

927
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,980
-Really?
-Yes.

928
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,400
Speak of the devil and there they are.

929
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,190
Wait, I don't see your friend.

930
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:58,190
I'm sure she's busy
acting graceful right now.

931
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,400
Oh my, Dr Jeong.

932
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,730
Ms Bok-ju.

933
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,820
Are you here for the orchestra, too?

934
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,820
Yes. This is so unexpected.

935
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,020
Joon-hyung gave me a ticket.

936
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:28,320
I've been wanting
to hear this orchestra play.

937
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Even my seat is next to yours.
This almost looks like a set-up.

938
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,400
I know.

939
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:36,610
By the way, you look like
a whole different person.

940
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,900
I almost didn't recognise you.

941
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,520
I feel a little uncomfortable,

942
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,980
but you should dress
in accordance to the occasion.

943
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,610
-Please sit.
-Okay.

944
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,270
-Would you like to read this pamphlet?
-Thank you.

945
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,940
Do you play like that?

946
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,400
What did you think, Ms Bok-ju?
It was much better than I expected.

947
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,110
The ensemble of the string
instruments were outstanding.

948
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,480
You major in cello.
It must've been great.

949
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,190
That's right. They were very skillful.

950
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,400
Let me give you a ride home.

951
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,270
You don't have to.

952
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:49,570
Wait. That would actually be helpful.
The bust stop is quite far from here.

953
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,610
Coach Choi

954
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,110
It's taking longer than I thought.

955
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,980
I'm sorry.

956
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,150
Don't be. I love it...

957
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,940
I mean, I'm fine.

958
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,940
It's raining.

959
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,820
Come to think of it,

960
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,940
it always rains when I'm with you.

961
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,860
That's true.

962
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,230
Maybe the dark clouds follow me around.

963
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,940
No. It's the opposite.

964
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,520
The sunlight follows you around instead.

965
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,480
No, it doesn't.

966
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,190
Dr Jeong.

967
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,190
Please speak to me casually.
You're much older than me.

968
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,270
I shouldn't. You're my patient.

969
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,110
I should be professional.

970
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,070
I see.

971
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,980
I'm your patient.

972
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,940
Not that kind of patient.

973
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,730
Please don't misunderstand.

974
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,270
You're cute sometimes.

975
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,400
I'm sorry. That was rude.

976
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,980
No. That's good to hear.

977
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,150
No one has ever told me that I'm cute.

978
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,070
I'm glad.

979
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,020
I'm glad that
I passed along that street...

980
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:38,980
on the day I carried the dressing table.

981
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,320
I'm glad that it was raining
and I didn't take an umbrella.

982
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,320
I'm glad that...

983
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,110
I didn't give up running towards him.

984
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,820
I'm so glad that...

985
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,770
I was born as a girl.

986

00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:14,270
My brother hates
the feminine type of girls.

988
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,190
Guys don't like female weightlifters.

989
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:18,480
What's wrong with them?
I think they're great.

990
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:21,230
-Say hello. This is my dad.
-What's going on with you two?

991
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,730
-What? My weight class?
-Eat some more.

992
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,820
Instead, we did two things today.

993
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,480
Watch out, Bok-ju!
Are you captivated by it?

994
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,770
-I totally am.
-Bok-ju.

995
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,980
Why are you going to a weight clinic?
