1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,330
   

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,810
   

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,740
   

4
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:22,367
   

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:32,030


6
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:01,133
 You and I are meant to be together? 

7
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,400
 Sure. 

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,633
 You can't think about destiny 

9
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,967
 until you've had a free mind. 

10
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,200
 You two look lovely together. 

11
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,133
 You're meant to be. 

12
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:20,833
He didn't work today?

13
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,967
Why?

14
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:25,367
Who knows. He said he had something to do at home.

15
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,167
You're here again?

16
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,467
I knew it.

17
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:39,233
No easier way to make money than this, huh?

18
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:43,100
It's like gambling, and you'll never quit.

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,400
You could make a couple of hundred million won a day just for running some errands.

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,367
You could make a couple of hundred million won a day just for running some errands.

21
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,300
By the way,

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,300
be careful.

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,733
If things go wrong,

24
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:56,433
you'll be dead meat.

25
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,033
Let's go.

26
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:21,733
   

27
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,333
He said he was working part-time every day.

28
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,667
How do I reach out to him when I don't have his number?

29
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,800
- Nope. 
 - Check out the socks there.

30
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:43,167
Hey.

31
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,700
What are you doing there?

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,467
Mind your own business.

33
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,767
Don't you dare. You're still wet behind the ears.

34
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:52,500
You are seriously a downer

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,300
For your information, I've got a 4th-degree in taekwondo.

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,500
- Let's just go. 
 - Let's go.

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,600
Don't be cheeky.

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,767
Hey, sir.

39
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:15,933
Are you okay?

40
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,800
Where am I?

41
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:27,733
Where do you live?

42
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,800
South Korea.

43
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Thank you.

44
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:47,567
   

45
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,233
We'll get started as soon as we get the cards.

46
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,167
Yeah, here are the cards.

47
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,433
Stop it.

48
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,800
Are you playing dumb with me?

49
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,900
- I'm sorry. 
 - Who bought the cards?

50
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,900
You did, right? Come with me, you brat.

51
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Do you live here?

52
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:44,733
It must be so hard to go upstairs alone.

53
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,733
It's okay. I can go up alone.

54
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:51,067
Don't mention it. You can lean on me.

55
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,167
I'm strong.

56
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:00,033
Maybe you could drink less next time.

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,500
This is my place.

58
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,300
Take care.

59
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,167
Cha Se Young?

60
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,367
Go Gun?

61
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,767
What are you doing here?

62
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,400
I'm going to check on my dad.

63
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:47,433
   

64
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,900
   

65
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,467
What are you doing?

66
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,767
No, nothing.

67
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,333
Is your dad okay?

68
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,833
He's asleep.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,500
What's wrong with your face?

70
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,967
Nothing. Don't have to worry about it.

71
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,667
Have you got a household medicine box?

72
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,433
I thought you were fearless,

73
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,300
but you really are.

74
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,900
Me? Why?

75
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,667
You followed a blind-drunk person

76
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,067
with no fear like this?

77
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,633
You shouldn't just laugh it off.

78
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,967
Hey, can I ask you something?

79
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,833
Nope.

80
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,433
I'm still going to ask, though.

81
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,933
I'm still not going to answer, though.

82
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:04,367
How did you get to know Tae Ha?

83
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,467
I just know him.

84
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:09,400
Just know him?

85
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,367
What about you?

86
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,200
I just know him.

87
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,900
Just know him?

88
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,633
He's just a son of my mom's friend.

89
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:20,333
We've lived in the same neighborhood.

90
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,100
Just the same neighborhood, literally.

91
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,500
That's it. Just a neighborhood friend.

92
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,000
I didn't ask you, though.

93
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,400
Does your dad play Hold'em?

94
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,400
   

95
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,333
Not now.

96
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,133
I see.

97
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,167
What about you? Are you good at it?

98
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,967
Like it.

99
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,400
What?

100
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:02,100
Not you.

101
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,433
I said I liked Hold'em.

102
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,367
Hold'em.

103
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,600
You can go home.

104
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,233
Can I ask you what with the bruises on your face are?

105
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,933
Nope.

106
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:27,533
Then, I'm off now.

107
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,433
Thank you.

108
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,767
Could you...

109
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:20,633
let me take care of your bruises, please?

110
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:24,033
Then I'll just go home without saying anything.

111
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,700
Oh, my god! It must really hurt.

112
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,567
Are you laughing now? What are you laughing about?

113
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,500
It's just, you know, funny.

114
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
I don't find it funny at all.

115
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,867
Do you realize

116
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:55,900
coincidences happened to us three times?

117
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,700
If three coincidences happen in a row—

118
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,733
It's destiny. Right?

119
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:06,133
You also think it's a little interesting. Right?

120
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,367
Someone said silence means yes.

121
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:12,867
Who said that?

122
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,633
I did.

123
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,367
Hang in there.

124
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:37,200
What now?

125
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,500
No, nothing.

126
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,000
I guess I've gone bananas.

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,400
I've gotta go.

128
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:09,120
♫  Even memories that have been meaningless for a long time  ♫

129
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:17,150
♫  no longer have any reason  ♫

130
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,800
♫  No matter how much I think about it  ♫

131
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,167
What should we do?

132
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,470
You want me to stop?

133
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,200
♫  There is no reason for everything to me  ♫

134
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,520
Go ahead, please.

135
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,000
♫  I'm by your side  ♫

136
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,190
♫  I guess I'm looking for you in my dreams too  ♫

137
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,980
♫  You know me, you see me shaking now  ♫

138
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:56,630
♫  Between you and me, there's no reason  ♫

139
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,840
♫  It wouldn't have been of any use if I didn't know you back then  ♫

140
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,000
♫  There is no reason for everything to me  ♫

141
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,567
Let me take you home.

142
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,100
Okay.

143
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,900
It's crazy.

144
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,400
Oh, my god, no way!

145
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,833
Are you going to school?

146
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,300
You scared me!

147
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,600
You scared me.

148
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,967
Gun.

149
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
What's wrong with your face?

150
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,100
Sorry.

151
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,700
I got injured on the construction site.

152
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,433
Gun.

153
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,967
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,133
I'm sorry to have to put you through this.

155
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,433
I'm so ashamed and can't face you.

156
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,367
Jun Hee and I are just a burden to you.

157
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,000
Dad.

158
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,667
Dad.

159
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,567
Look at me.

160
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm okay.

161
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm okay, seriously.

162
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,367
Let's stay strong.

163
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm sure good days will come again.

164
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,833
And you're sick. Get some rest.

165
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,867
I know you're working without telling me all the time.

166
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,933
I'm late, Dad. I'm going to school now.

167
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,067
Okay.

168
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,133
- I'm leaving. 
 - Take care.

169
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,000
Sure.

170
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,833
Who are you waiting for?

171
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,367
Go Gun, in school! Joo Tae Ha, out of school.

172
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,033
What a life.

173
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,900
Then, you're a two-timer. Right?

174
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,333
No, I'm not!

175
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,933
What's this short fuse about?

176
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,267
The more you deny it,

177
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,100
the more it's true.

178
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,433
No, it's not.

179
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,467
Admit it.

180
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,200
We look attractive, girls.

181
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,067
That could happen to us.

182
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,567
Cha Se Young,

183
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,900
you've told us nothing.

184
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,800
About what?

185
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,633
The relationship between Joo Tae Ha and you.

186
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,167
I have nothing to say.

187
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,467
Hello.

188
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,100
Yeah.

189
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,167
Let's begin our class.

190
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,167
Are you all ready?

191
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,400
Don't get distracted and focus on the class.

192
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:28,167
I haven't got distracted.

193
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,333
Then never mind.

194
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,333
I'm going to sleep now.

195
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:47,767
- Enjoy your lunch. 
 - Yes.

196
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,100
Let's grab lunch.

197
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,767
- You can go ahead. 
 - Got it.

198
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:04,600
How could you be so good-looking?

199
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,367
So attractive.

200
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,333
You awake?

201
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,367
What time is it now?

202
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
I've gotta go.

203
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,667
I'm going with you! Gun!

204
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,433
What makes you walk so fast?

205
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,433
Wait.

206
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:40,033
What now?

207
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,700
Well…

208
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,900
Going to do it again?

209
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,600
No, I'm not.

210
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,233
You know what?

211
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,867
Did I do the kissing alone?

212
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,633
Then what?

213
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,233
What is this for?

214
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,067
I thought you wouldn't grab a meal

215
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,700
and I wanted you to eat it.

216
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,033
You should eat something while working.

217
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,167
I told you, that Koreans live off the strength of rice.

218
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,967
Didn't you say you lived in the US?

219
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:22,933
I lived in the US,

220
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,333
but I'm still Korean.

221
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,300
That makes sense.

222
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,633
Am I right?

223
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,467
Just stop talking.

224
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,833
Hey.

225
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,333
What?

226
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,933
Can you please give a second thought

227
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,100
to what I said yesterday?

228
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,767
What?

229
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,000
I mean,

230
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:54,033
I went to your place yesterday.

231
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:57,067
And we kissed as well.

232
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,433
Cha Se Young.

233
00:17:58,433 --> 00:17:59,867
Yeah?

234
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,267
Why are you looking at me that way?

235
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:06,333
Kiss.

236
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,133
What?

237
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,400
It wasn't just a peck yesterday.

238
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,290
We kissed.

239
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,033
What?

240
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,433
I liked it too.

241
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,667
Okay, you did.

242
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,200
Are you being shy?

243
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,967
Don't make fun of me.

244
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,133
- It hurts. 
 - Does it?

245
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:40,100
Sorry.

246
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,300
I didn't know I was that strong.

247
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,700
Se Young.

248
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,400
Huh?

249
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,033
Nothing. I'll get going.

250
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,733
Can I go with you?

251
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,267
Why? Stop making a fuss.

252
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,200
Do you really think I can stop making a fuss?

253
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,367
You brought your girlfriend

254
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,033
all the way here?

255
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,533
No big deal. She's just…

256
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,567
A friend in the same class.

257
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,700
No big deal? It's totally a big deal.

258
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,200
So what's your status?

259
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,333
Just a friend in the same class.

260
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,733
Stop lying, you brat!

261
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,533
Then she followed you here at this hour?

262
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,667
What about school?

263
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,500
Seriously. She's not a girlfriend.

264
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,667
- Yet. 
 - What? Yet?

265
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:36,667
Yet?!

266
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,300
A friend in the same class?

267
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,200
Gun!

268
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,367
I'm his friend, Jeong Ji Chul.

269
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,033
I'm the owner of this Hold'em pub.

270
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:49,300
Hi! I'm Cha Se Young.

271
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,000
How long have you been with him?

272
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,833
Please!

273
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,567
He hasn't asked me out so I'm going to do it.

274
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,700
You're a boss!

275
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,833
It doesn't matter who asks first,

276
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,967
but can't you just do it?

277
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,733
She's so feisty. I like it.

278
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,600
So you're not dating me?

279
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:14,267
Gun. Two glasses of whiskey, please.

280
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,767
Sure.

281
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,233
He looks so bright in here.

282
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:25,033
Why is he a zombie at school?

283
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:27,367
- You like him? 
 - Oh, God.

284
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,700
What is this?

285
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,133
   

286
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:34,867
Could you give this to Gun?

287
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,267
Is he that good at Hold'em?

288
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:38,700
He's been playing cards

289
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,133
and nothing else since he was a kid.

290
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,767
He doesn't want to play in the competition?

291
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:47,867
He hates playing cards for money more than death.

292
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:51,167
- Why? 
 - It's a family issue…

293
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,000
Nothing.

294
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,900
Family issue?

295
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,933
Maybe you should talk to him about the ticket.

296
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,867
   

297
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:03,633
Two glasses of whiskey.

298
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,700
Thank you.

299
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,800
What about a game today?

300
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,033
I've practiced a lot!

301
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,467
Maybe I should work.

302
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,700
How are you so good at poker?

303
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,800
'Cuz you're just smart?

304
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,100
I have told you that you could get the answer

305
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,733
by calculating the probability.

306
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:24,100
I mean, how is that possible?

307
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,500
He's got that kind of look on his face.

308
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,300
He always looks dark at school. Right?

309
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,833
Yeah, he's sleeping all the time there.

310
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,267
As for me,

311
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,267
this is the only way for him.

312
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:42,400
So I need you to convince him.

313
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
   

314
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,900


315
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,500
 Don't go out of your way 

316
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,267
 for me. 

317
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:57,100
 Jun Hee. 

318
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,767
 Don't toy with Cha Se Young anymore. 

319
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:01,200
 Since you say so, 

320
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,633
 you make me want to have her even more. 

321
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,767
 You are under arrest today 

322
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:11,533
 for illegal private gambling. 

323
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,400
 What's up with you? 

324
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
   

325
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,433
 I don't need it. 

326
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:18,633
 Then you should throw it away yourself. 

327
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,633
 You're playing at the illegal gambling house for your sister's medical bill. 

328
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,933
 Cha Se Young. 

329
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:27,600
