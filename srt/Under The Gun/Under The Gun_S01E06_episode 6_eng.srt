1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,350
   

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,580
   

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,570
   

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,867
   

5
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:26,267
    
 Let's start the long-awaited

6
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:28,533
2022 KPL Championship!

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,980


8
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,133
   
   

9
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,193
   

10
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:16,433
   

11
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:20,200
   
   

12
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,767
Cha Se Young.

13
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:32,000
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:36,267
I came here because I missed you.

15
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,633
Is this okay?

16
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,333
Yes.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,633
Why are you looking at me like that?

18
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,067
You're pretty.

19
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,833
What are you doing now?

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Let's sleep now.

21
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,100
Sleep?

22
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,700
As it is now?

23
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
Cha Se Young.

24
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,567
You're so fearless, huh?

25
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,600
I came here without fear.

26
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,767
Why are you acting like that?

27
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,567
What?

28
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,900
Hey!

29
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,233
Gun.

30
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,967
Go Gun.

31
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,600
Let's sleep now.

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,067
Sleep?

33
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,730
There's a final tomorrow.

34
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,030
Hey!

35
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:31,567
Are you going to sleep like this?

36
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,600
Still going to sleep?

37
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,367
If I lose tomorrow,

38
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,833
will you take responsibility?

39
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,967
I can at least provide for you.

40
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:50,033
I don't like that.

41
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,033
What does that mean?

42
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:55,867
I want to at least provide for you.

43
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,300
So...

44
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
So?

45
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,000
You've got to listen to me.

46
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,800
Good night, Gun.

47
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,200
You too.

48
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:33,833
   

49
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,167
Day 3 of the 2022 KPL Championship

50
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:40,067
with a prize pool of 1 billion won has just begun.

51
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,867
After yesterday, today's excitement is even higher.

52
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:47,067
We will continue this atmosphere until the final.

53
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,067
Now, the KPL final game.

54
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:07,467
The final 10 players are finally on the final stage.

55
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,700
The only person who will receive the honor

56
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,067
of winning the final championship will be decided at this table.

57
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,767
   

58
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,100
 The last three remained at the poker table 

59
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,233
 and, of course, Joo Tae Ha was included. 

60
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,600
Fold.

61
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,200
 Definitely, he has an unusual poker face. 

62
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,533
All-in.

63
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:15,133
 I have no idea if he has a good hand or is bluffing. 

64
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:33,267
 It feels like Joo Tae Ha will win. 

65
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,833
Call!

66
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,600
Showdown, please show your cards.

67
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,367
   

68
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,567
 Thus, in the final… 

69
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,400
 Only Joo Tae Ha and I are left. 

70
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,910
   

71
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,133
Go Gun, who came out of nowhere,

72
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:31,900
and the winner of last year's tournament and a Hold'em idol,

73
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,433
the star of the Hold'em, Joo Tae Ha.

74
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,567
Who will be the winner

75
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,700
of the 2022 KPL Championship?

76
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,233
I'm really curious now.

77
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,900
- Are you ready? 
 - Of course.

78
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,433
 Actually, at this moment, 

79
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,533
 I'm more nervous than anyone else. 

80
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,400
 Clover Queen, Clover King. 

81
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,233
 It's not a bad hand, but… 

82
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,333
Action.

83
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,900
Ten million.

84
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,400
 I can't read Joo Tae Ha's card at all. 

85
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,133
Raise.

86
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,633
Call.

87
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:30,567
 Heart Ace, Clover J, Clover 9. 

88
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,100
 That's a hand in my favor. 

89
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,300
All-in.

90
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,167
All-in, call?

91
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,200
All-in.

92
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,000
Showdown, please show your cards.

93
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,900
That's a bad hand for him.

94
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
   

95
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,900
    
 For a straight flush, I need a Clover 10.

96
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,133
    
 The probability is 0.0014%.

97
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,567
Well done so far.

98
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,567
No.

99
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:55,033
That's practically impossible.

100
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,567
It's not over...

101
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,300
until the river card is opened.

102
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,533
Ten.

103
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:08,667
Unless Clover 10 is coming out.

104
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,500
 I want to place a bet 

105
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,000
 even if the odds are low. 

106
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,100
 No, I have to. 

107
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:23,867
 For my dad, for Jun Hee, 

108
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:26,167
 and most importantly, 

109
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,167
 for me. 

110
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,667
   

111
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,033
   

112
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,933
Well done.

113
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,367
Go Gun, you made it.

114
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,100
Congratulations.

115
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,033
The winner of the 2022 KPL Championship

116
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,300
is Go Gun.

117
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,933
Congratulations.

118
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,433
I'll beat you next time.

119
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,367
I look forward to it.

120
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,733
 Is it Go Gun? 

121
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,300
Isn't it just the same name?

122
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,567
Oh, jeez.

123
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:05,567
Hey, Cha Se Young.

124
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,212
Did you already know it?

125
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:09,024
   

126
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:10,867
Of course.

127
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,767
- Wow. 
 - That's awesome.

128
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,200
That's a great photo of him.

129
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
This much prize money?

130
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,300
So, what is the title of poet Yun Dong Joo's poem?

131
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,767
- "A Night of Counting the Stars." 
 - Right.

132
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:28,967
If he's not going to text,

133
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:31,400
why is he carrying a cell phone?

134
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,067
- Cha Se Young. 
 - He should at least contact me.

135
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,333
It's really too much.

136
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,733
You're too much, you.

137
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:39,933
Sir.

138
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,733
Why aren't you paying attention?

139
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,800
You're a sophomore, what about college?

140
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,833
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,867
Love won't put food on the table.

142
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,800
That's right,

143
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,267
but I'm full even without eating.

144
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,767
Goosebumps.

145
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:58,700
It's just nice to look at him.

146
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,600
I'd like to apologize on behalf of Gun

147
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,900
for being absent from school without permission.

148
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,367
Go Gun.

149
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,367
You'll do well in school from now on. Right?

150
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,867
Without getting into trouble.

151
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:16,300
Ma'am,

152
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,700
have I ever gotten into trouble?

153
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,900
I didn't study hard enough

154
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,667
and slept in class.

155
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,333
I didn't get into trouble.

156
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:30,233
A closed mouth gathers no feet.

157
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:34,133
Looks like you're doing well as before.

158
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,600
I'll do my best from now on.

159
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,667
Yeah, please study hard.

160
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,667
Your grades are terrible.

161
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,700
Hold'em isn't everything.

162
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,200
Ma'am,

163
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,433
but studying and playing Hold'em...

164
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,533
are a bit different.

165
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,100
That's right.

166
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:00,000
You always try to beat me.

167
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,100
 Go Gun. 

168
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,867
I heard you won.

169
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:05,833
Congratulations.

170
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,233
Thank you!

171
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,933
Aside from winning the contest,

172
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:11,767
shouldn't you get going?

173
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,867
To where?

174
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,800
To your girlfriend.

175
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,733
She has been waiting for you all day.

176
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,233
Go ahead. I'll go home first.

177
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll really get going?

178
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,667
Go.

179
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,400
Don't tell her.

180
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,433
Go ahead.

181
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,700
I'll get going, bye.

182
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,433
Hey.

183
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:49,800
Gun.

184
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,467
Why are you standing up? Keep playing.

185
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,600
It's so good to see you at school.

186
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,833
Is it that good?

187
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,433
Yes, it's so good.

188
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,267
Come here.

189
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:10,933
Keep playing. I want to listen to it.

190
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:15,367
Can't I just stay like this with you?

191
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:18,533
I've heard it's unattractive when a woman is so aggressive.

192
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:19,967
What?

193
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,533
I'm just joking.

194
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,833
Did you see this?

195
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:33,033
Is it okay to post it without permission?

196
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:36,867
So what? The photo came out really good.

197
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,367
Gun, I thought about it.

198
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,933
Why are you always thinking about something?

199
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:50,333
"Under the Gun" is the most unfavorable position in Hold'em.

200
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,867
You even know that?

201
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,833
It is the most unfavorable position.

202
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,400
But if you think of it differently,

203
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,133
it's "Under the Gun."

204
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,000
It means that everyone is under "Gun."

205
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,533
Why are you trying to sound like a native of the US?

206
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:07,167
Isn't it all fate

207
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,367
that you won this tournament?

208
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:13,733
Anyway, you really like that fate.

209
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,567
If it is true as your name indicates,

210
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,467
things will get better from now on.

211
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,700
Just believe me.

212
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,100
You always come up with something to say.

213
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,267
I'm talking to you seriously.

214
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:30,167
Okay, just play it for me.

215
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,833
You're pretty when playing the piano.

216
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm not pretty any other time?

217
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,800
You are.

218
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,067
Okay, then.

219
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,400
I'll play it for you.

220
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,667
 It is an undeniable fact that "Under the Gun" 

221
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,167
 is the most disadvantageous in Hold'em. 

222
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:19,000
 But to play through that pressure, to make the play, 

223
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,967
 and to win the game, 

224
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,633
 what could be more exhilarating? 

225
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,967
 Life is said to be a series of gambles. 

226
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:41,067
 If that's really true… 

227
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,267
I'll bet on you

228
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,390
Cha Se Young.

229
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,000
Hmm?

230
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,900
What?

231
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,933
No, just keep playing the piano.

232
00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:01,030
🃏 Thanks to our Channel Manager 🃏

kakashiandme (CE) and joysprite (GE) for the great work   

235

🃏 Special thanks to all the volunteers who made this project possible. 🃏

236
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,433
Daddy.

237
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,133
Brother.

238
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,233
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

239
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,600
Are you all right?

240
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,933
I had a dream.

241
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,733
What dream?

242
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,000
Mom appeared in my dream.

243
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:51,667
She told me...

244
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,600
that there's nothing to worry about anymore,

245
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,100
to not come to her,

246
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,567
and I should stay with you guys

247
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:05,133
because I'm the only one

248
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,700
who can take care of you.

249
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,667
I want to go out.

250
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:22,950
🃏 Thank all those who watched this drama and supported all the volunteers who made this project possible🃏 

251
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:36,940


252
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,767
I have something to ask.

253
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,767
What is it?

254
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,400
Why do you like me?

255
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:52,867
There's no reason.

256
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:55,500
I like you because it's you.

257
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:59,067
Is that so?

258
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,133
If there is a reason for liking you,

259
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,100
and it disappears,

260
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,000
my feelings for you will disappear as well.

261
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,700
I don't like that.

262
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,833
I just like you...

263
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:19,867
so much for no reason.

264
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,600
Actually, this is all a lie.

265
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,733
It's because you're good-looking.

266
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,200
What?

267
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,167
Gun.

268
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,180
Please stay with me forever.

269
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,780


270
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,467
That's exactly

271
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,810
what I wanted to say.
