1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,440
   

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,530
   

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,720
   

4
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:22,350
   

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000


6
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,067
Looks like

7
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,567
you're in a bad mood.

8
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,833
It's nothing.

9
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,367
What happened to you?

10
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,367
I feel kind of disappointed.

11
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:06,833
I've been your best supporter

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,667
since you were born.

13
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,333
Mom.

14
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:17,033
I've got a crush on a boy.

15
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,767
But...

16
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:23,300
I don't like the way he thinks.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,967
I didn't mean anything else.

18
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:31,567
All I did was just for him.

19
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,467
That's why I did that.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,500
But it looks like...

21
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:49,333
he got hurt by me.

22
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,833
That makes me feel so upset.

23
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:01,300
If he likes you,

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,233
he'll understand what you meant without saying anything.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,033
Because sometimes you fall out of balance in love,

26
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:20,167
but you can find greater balance in love.

27
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:24,200
That's what life and growth is all about.

28
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:31,933
It may seem like love is supposed to be all good,

29
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:35,567
but even love in pain is still love.

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,867
That's how you truly love

31
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,600
and care about someone.

32
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,033
I don't know who he is,

33
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:56,233
but he's lucky to have so much of your love.

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,333
   

35
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,100
   

36
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,400
Defendant Go Gun. Step forward, please.

37
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:23,967
   

38
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:28,300
The defendant is accused of gambling illegally

39
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,733
by moving in and out of an illegal gambling house

40
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,800
    
 on multiple occasions as an underage person,

41
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,433
as well as working in the illegal gambling house.

42
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:39,033
This is a violation of the Game Industry Promotion Act,

43
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,800
which is a violation of Article 246, Paragraph 1,

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,567
Subparagraph 247, etc. of the Criminal Code.

45
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,667
Defendant,

46
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,533
if you have any last words for the panel, please go ahead.

47
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,333
Your Honor,

48
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,167
my name is Go Gun.

49
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,033
I'm here as the accused for illegal gambling.

50
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:13,533
I was arrested for illegal gambling

51
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:14,933
at an apartment in Injigo

52
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,600
around 10:00 p.m. on August 21, 2022.

53
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,433
I truly regret what I've done...

54
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,600
and I promise I won't let this happen again.

55
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,967
I don't think this one note...

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,267
can capture my heartfelt feelings.

57
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,567
As for the gambling,

58
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,833
I didn't do any gambling.

59
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,200
Your Honor,

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,133
if the same situation happened to me again,

61
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,467
I would do the exact same thing.

62
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,633
I worked to make money for my sister's surgery

63
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:09,100
by doing cigarette errands and getting beaten up.

64
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,133
There was no other way to make that much money.

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I knew it was wrong,

66
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,967
but I couldn't help it.

67
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,167
Still,

68
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,400
I truly regret what I've done.

69
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
I promise I won't let this happen again.

70
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,033
   

71
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:53,500
We've got quite a few petitions from your school.

72
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,133
Student Go Gun,

73
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,333
we need to live honestly,

74
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,567
even if what you've done is not shameful.

75
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,067
I'm truly sorry to hear about your sister,

76
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,033
but please keep in mind

77
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:13,800
one bad choice can ruin

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,433
the rest of your life.

79
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,067
It is clear...

80
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,667
that the accused violated the Gaming Industry Promotion Act,

81
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,933
but given the first offense, the fact that he is still a minor,

82
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:31,100
and other factors,

83
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,033
we sentence him to 100 hours of community service.

84
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,833
Thank you, sir.

85
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,667
Thank you very much, sir.

86
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,400
Gun.

87
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,633
It's crazy.

88
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:52,933
This is Go Gun. Right?

89
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:53,933
He's still in high school. Does it make sense?

90
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,900
I don't know. How do I know?

91
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,367
It's insane.

92
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,200
    
 A high school student is gambling illegally?

93
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,333
He's got a lot of guts.

94
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,967
What is it?

95
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,033
Why are you acting weird as soon as I walked in?

96
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,133
No, nothing.

97
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,200
What is that?

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,310
   

99
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,130
   

100
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,200
He's still in high school. Does it make sense?

101
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,167
I don't know. How is that possible?

102
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,767
Oh, my god, he'll be in trouble.

103
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:35,233
Can't you all just shut up?

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
You guys are

105
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,333
only interested in gossip.

106
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,533
Have you ever worried about your classmate?

107
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,167
You should at least ask if things are okay when something like this happens.

108
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,433
Are you still true friends?

109
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,233
Anyone who says something weird

110
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,167
or makes up a rumor in the future,

111
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,300
I'm not going to let them get away with it.

112
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
I'm going to crush

113
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,567
anyone who hurts him.

114
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,300
Let's go.

115
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,700
To where?

116
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,900
Let's get out of here.

117
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,867
I'm hungry.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,267
You left me as if you wouldn't see me again.

119
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:30,033
Because you were so frustrated yesterday,

120
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:32,533
and I kind of hated you.

121
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:35,400
But today…

122
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,133
Today?

123
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,700
Today,

124
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,433
I'm feeling pretty good today.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,333
What the heck are you?

126
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,667
What is what?

127
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,533
Eat something.

128
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,067
It'll give you energy.

129
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,967
You.

130
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,633
Why are you doing this to me?

131
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,267
You don't know why I'm doing this? Seriously?

132
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,300
Because I like you.

133
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,333
My mom said

134
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,100
sometimes you fall out of balance in love,

135
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,433
but you can find greater balance in love.

136
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
That's even harder to understand.

137
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:35,500
You fool.

138
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,000
Because you're messing with the balance of my world right now.

139
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,000
Still,

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,333
you're helping me find a greater balance.

141
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,167
Where are you going?

142
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,700
I've got somewhere to go.

143
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,700
The Hold'em pub?

144
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,933
Se Young.

145
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:05,333
What?

146
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,700
I've told you...

147
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,667
destiny is like

148
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,933
taekwondo or piano.

149
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:24,867
You can just take it or leave it.

150
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,100
You said...

151
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,833
you couldn't go through life with all that.

152
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,900
You know...

153
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,633
I can't afford that at all.

154
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:43,500
I'll go my way.

155
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,267
You'll go your way.

156
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,000
Gun!

157
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,967
I just realized...

158
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,800
I shouldn't be so greedy.

159
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Greedy?

160
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
You and I are...

161
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,833
starting from different places.

162
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,467
What are you talking about, Gun?

163
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,200
Cha Se Young.

164
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,767
Thank you for everything.

165
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,867
I'll get going now.

166
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,667
   

167
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,067
 Why did you only say what you wanted to say? 

168
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:37,967
Why did you only say what you wanted to say all the time?

169
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:43,300
They say destiny comes to those who bear the weight of life.

170
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,967
I'll be the destiny...

171
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,967
that finds you when you can't afford it.

172
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm coming to you.

173
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,167
- So— 
 - Se Young.

174
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,333
Just...

175
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,333
do nothing...

176
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,733
and like me, please.

177
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,500
Cha Se Young.

178
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,067
I like you, Gun.

179
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:43,733
What are you doing here at this hour, Gun?

180
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,833
I skipped class to see you here.

181
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,233
You skipped class because you didn't want to study. Right?

182
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,133
You got me.

183
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,067
How are you doing now?

184
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,333
As you might see.

185
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,400
So tough.

186
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,367
My doctor said I didn't look like a leukemia patient.

187
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,867
He said I had a lot of energy and a strong spirit.

188
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:09,200
Yeah. That's Go Jun Hee.

189
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:10,867
Brother,

190
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:12,833
Dad was here this morning.

191
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,533
He told me an interesting story.

192
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,200
What story?

193
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,900
He said you would go to play in the KPL.

194
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,733
What?

195
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,367
He laughed saying he played a round of Hold'em with you last night,

196
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,800
and he couldn't beat you.

197
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
I haven't seen him smile

198
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,800
like that in a long time.

199
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:39,133
It's time for you to do something for yourself.

200
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,233
If you keep dithering like that,

201
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,700
you'll miss everything.

202
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,800
You've got an old soul.

203
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,533
You can see things when you're sick.

204
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:50,100
I wish I wasn't in the hospital.

205
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,167
There are so many things I wish I could do.

206
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,600
At least you're not sick.

207
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,633
You can do more than me.

208
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,400
Are you crying?

209
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,433
No, I'm not.

210
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:13,333
Don't cry. You're as big as a bear.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,467
Don't keep tying yourself down because of us.

212
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,567
   

213
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:48,833
 Then you should throw it away yourself. 

214
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,100
   

215
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,667
Don't keep tying yourself down because of us.

216
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,367
Have you been waiting long?

217
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:14,067
Did you visit your sister?

218
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,500
Yeah.

219
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,433
How is she?

220
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:20,133
She's fine.

221
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,167
That's good.

222
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,633
I've decided to play...

223
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:33,167
in the tournament this time.

224
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,733
What?

225
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,567
I'm sorry for being so stubborn...

226
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,000
and pushing you away.

227
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,567
When I look at you,

228
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,067
I feel like I'm so ugly.

229
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,067
I think that's why I wanted to keep pushing you away.

230
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,167
Why not? I'll give it a crack.

231
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,300
That sounds really good.

232
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,440
Not Hold'em.

233
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,560
♫  Here I stay  ♫

234
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,930
You.

235
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,360
♫  It's a far from start to shine  ♫

236
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,333
I like you too,

237
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,200
Se Young.

238
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,260
♫  Here I Stay (Here I Stay, Be by your side)  ♫ 
♫  Here I Stay (Here I Stay)  ♫

239
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,700
I'll be the first to say it this time.

240
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,260
♫  At the end of the day, at the beginning of autumn on a faded night  ♫

241
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,390
Would you go out with me?

242
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,350
♫  This isn't a dream, I hope I'm in your arms  ♫

243
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,800
♫  There's just one word between us  ♫

244
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,867
What's wrong?

245
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:54,133
Nothing.

246
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,333
What do you want me to do now?

247
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:00,067
Can you tell me again that you like me?

248
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,100
What?

249
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,230
I want to hear it again.

250
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,860
♫  Here I stay  ♫

251
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,033
I like you. I like you.

252
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,267
I like you. I love you.

253
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:14,000
- I like you. 
 - What is that?

254
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,267
You're not going to college

255
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,233
if you keep chasing me around

256
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,900
like this.

257
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,267
Who knows. It's all because of you.

258
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:26,467
It's all you.

259
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:27,500
   

260
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,100
   

261
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,533
Gun,

262
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,700
have a great game. Go for it.

263
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,333
I will.

264
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,767
For you and Jun Hee.

265
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:50,967
No.

266
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,967
Have a great game for yourself so you don't regret it.

267
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:55,033
Okay, I get it.

268
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,767
So.

269
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:02,967
- Go ahead. 
 - I will.

270
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:04,933
Gun.

271
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,460
Hello.

272
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,160
Here.

273
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,133
- What's this? 
 - This is for you.

274
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,567
- For me? 
 - Yeah, man.

275
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:12,933
It's too far from this hotel to your place.

276
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,667
It's too hard to travel back and forth.

277
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,367
So I rented a room.

278
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17,533
Hold'em is also a game of stamina.

279
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:18,633
- Don't you think? 
 - Ji Chul.

280
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:22,133
It's not for free. You have to win to pay me back twice.

281
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,867
It's kind of like an investment.

282
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,233
Thank you, Ji Chul.

283
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,600
If you win, the prize goes 7 to 3?

284
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,133
- You're such an asshole. 
 - What?

285
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,367
You're lucky it's 6 to 4.

286
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:34,967
Not 7 to 3, it's 6 to 4.

287
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,667
- Get yourself together. 
 - Gun!

288
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,300
Hello.

289
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,533
I told you to come to the final.

290
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,233
I wanted to give you this.

291
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,300
What's this?

292
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,767
It's my lucky charm.

293
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:48,933
Charm?

294
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:51,100
It granted me all my wishes,

295
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,800
like my English test, TOEIC,

296
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:59,867
and to go out with you.

297
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,200
It will protect you for me.

298
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,433
So, have a great game.

299
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,867
You guys look very good together.

300
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,833
It's sad to be an old bachelor.

301
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,167
Get in there. Otherwise, the tournament is over.

302
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,933
I'll get going.

303
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,833
Hey, don't skip your meal,

304
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,167
and you should text me back.

305
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,300
Meanwhile, I'll be studying hard.

306
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Oh, boy.

307
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,633
Someone would think you guys would live apart.

308
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,233
Hello.

309
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,567
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

310
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,633
Adorable.

311
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:52,300
   

312
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,400
   

313
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:58,600
   

314
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm going to play fair.

315
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,533
How are you feeling today?

316
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,000
What is this?

317
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:29,200
My girlfriend gave it to me.

318
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,367
Girlfriend?

319
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,367
Let's play...

320
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,133
fair,

321
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,000
putting the past behind us.

322
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's get started

323
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,367
on the 2022 KPL Championship!

324
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,867
   
   

325
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:52,997
   

326
00:21:52,997 --> 00:21:55,067
   

327
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,367
   
   

328
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:06,300


329
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,267
Cha Se Young.

330
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,367
What are you doing here?

331
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,733
I came here because I missed you.

332
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,500
 Day 3 of the KPL Championship 

333
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,667
 with a prize pool of 1 billion won has just begun. 

334
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,400
 The final 10 players 

335
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,633
 are finally on the final stage. 

336
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,700
 I want to place a bet 

337
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,133
 even if the odds are low. 

338
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,400
 No, I have to. 

339
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:37,800
 Definitely, he has an unusual poker face. 

340
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,933
