1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,600
   

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,560
   

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,740
   

4
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:22,912
   

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:31,000


6
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,733
- Here's the beer you ordered. 
 - Thank you.

7
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,133
Why don't you play a game, Mr. Jeong?

8
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:39,433
I'm working now.

9
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,400
Come on. Just one game will be fine.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,567
I don't have a good hand these days.

11
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:47,700
By the way, I heard Mr. Ryu got gutted last time by a part-timer here.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,833
- Did he? 
 - I bet he can't beat this guy.

13
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,133
He's won many amateur events.

14
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,333
So who's that part-timer?

15
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,800
Well...

16
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,533
Speak of the devil, there he is.

17
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:13,567
 Hey, Gun. 

18
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:14,600
 Nope. 

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,533
 Just one round. 

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,300
 I don't want to. 

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,867
 Please. Just a single round. 

22
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:24,667
 Stop it. You know better than that. 

23
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,867
 - They're buying two bottles! 
 - No, thanks. 

24
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,100
 Extra pay! 

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,567
 I'll take care of you generously. 

26
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,000
 Table from earlier, huh? 

27
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:39,233
 You ruthless brat. 

28
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,967
 Have a seat. 

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,600
 Let's give it a crack. 

30
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,800
 Let me see what you got. 

31
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,300
 You must have a great hand. 

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,167
 Oh, really? 

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,000
 - 50k. 
 - Call. 

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,933
 They're all betting 50k in preflop. 

35
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,633
 Guess everyone has a good hand. 

36
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:29,433
 He's keeping a poker face. The corners of his mouth keep turning up. 

37
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,633
 He keeps fiddling with his hand. 

38
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:33,533
 I guess it's not a great one. 

39
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:38,000
 Looks like he just wants to play a game. 

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,033
 Raise. 

41
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,133
 Guess you have a great hand. 

42
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,167
 Maybe. 

43
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,590
 50k, call. 

44
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,100
 Call. 

45
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:52,967
 - Check. 
 - Check. 

46
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,700
 Guess you all like to play safe. 

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,633
 Raise, 30k. 

48
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:00,400
 - Fold. 
 - Fold. 

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,200
 30k, Call. 

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,400
 Obviously, this guy has a good hand. 

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,200
 Fold. 

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,400
 Check. 

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,500
 Raise. 

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,367
 120k. 

55
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,467
 That's a bluff, isn't it? 

56
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:18,533
    
 It is.

57
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,767
    
 It is.

58
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,700
 He's not all-in fiddling with his chips. 

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,233
   
 Maybe he doesn't have an airline. 

60
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,333
 Fold. 

61
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,100
 What was your card? 

62
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,333
 A heart, three clover. 

63
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:39,900
 Can you show me the river first? 

64
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,167
 Just show him. It costs nothing. 

65
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:45,867
 Triple five. 

66
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,467
 It was a hand I would win somehow. 

67
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:50,000
 What are you laughing at? 

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,500
 You're bluffing, aren't you? 

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,733
 I don't know. 

70
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,667
 Wait! Can you show me your card? I want to know. 

71
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:59,100
 Then you'll have to pay. 

72
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,600
 Come on! 

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 I'll pay. There you go. 

74
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:11,267
 Well, hope you all enjoyed the game. 

75
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,544
   

76
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,267
Selfie time.

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,833
Such a lovely shot.

78
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,167
Hi.

79
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,633
Tae Ha!

80
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,667
Did you miss me?

81
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,267
Why would I miss you when there are so many good-looking guys in LA?

82
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:55,667
Why would I miss you when there are so many good-looking guys in LA?

83
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,767
I'm so disappointed.

84
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,700
I shouldn't have got it.

85
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,500
What is it?

86
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,433
You've gotten so sweet in the meantime.

87
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,767
I've always been sweet to you.

88
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,200
I like this car, though.

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,800
How much does it cost?

90
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,900
A tournament or two would be enough.

91
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
You suck.

92
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,267
While you're at it, what about marrying me?

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,333
I should call the police.

94
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,367
You shouldn't do this. I'm underage.

95
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:28,933
If you keep ignoring me like this,

96
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:31,200
some other girl will get me. You'll regret it.

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Whatever you say.

98
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:53,633
Welcome home.

99
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,233
My daughter.

100
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,567
I've missed you so much.

101
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:01,267
You've gotten lovelier in the meantime.

102
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,933
You're not getting old, Mommy.

103
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:07,167
Everyone would think you were my sister.

104
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:12,833
Thank you for driving her home.

105
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,767
No worries. Always welcome.

106
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,200
Bye, Tae Ha.

107
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,700
You're making him feel sad.

108
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,567
Grab a meal since you're here, Tae Ha.

109
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,267
I'll call your mom to let her know.

110
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:24,000
- Can I? 
 - Sure.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,633
You're not like anyone else, Tae Ha.

112
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:29,000
Someone would think he was your son.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,467
The saying goes a mother-in-law is always

114
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,733
The saying goes a mother-in-law is always

115
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,400
on the side of her son-in-law.

116
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,500
What are you talking about?

117
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,367
Don't get in the way of my married life.

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,833
Let's go.

119
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,667
I was going to give you the extra, son.

120
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,933
You should've given it to me before I brought it up.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,167
Here you go.

122
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,267
Just 100,000 won?

123
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm afraid my boss is

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,867
getting old and stingy.

125
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,767
You ruthless brat.

126
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:26,233
Thank you, sir. I'll work harder.

127
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,133
Are you going home today?

128
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,700
Working at a corner store.

129
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,400
Do you get enough sleep?

130
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,300
I'll take care of it.

131
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,167
I'm off now.

132
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,733
Thank you.

133
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,100
I'm home.

134
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,633
Such a beautiful uniform.

135
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:43,133
It didn't feel like I was in school 'cuz they don't wear any uniforms in the US.

136
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,567
How is it to be back in Korea?

137
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,067
Isn't it so good to see me?

138
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,233
It is, totally.

139
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,100
This is a present for you, Mommy.

140
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,567
What is it?

141
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,967
I didn't use your credit card.

142
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,633
I saved my pocket money for this.

143
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,467
My daughter is the best.

144
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,600
Thank you so much. So happy to have it.

145
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,233
By the way, Se Young.

146
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,267
You don't like Tae Ha?

147
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,467
I'm in the hot seat whenever I meet Tae Ha's mom, you know?

148
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:14,867
What year is it now?

149
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:18,167
Is she trying to get him married already?

150
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,267
You can just go on a date.

151
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,167
I'm not saying you get married right away.

152
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,733
Tae Ha is good enough.

153
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,267
He comes from a fine family and is competent.

154
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:27,767
And good-looking.

155
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,667
Well, he doesn't attract me.

156
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,967
Oh, boy. Then you'll end up like me.

157
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,800
What is wrong with Daddy?

158
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,633
Mom,

159
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,267
I heard somewhere that

160
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,800
we all have someone who's meant to be.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,933
But Tae Ha and I have known each other for 10 years

162
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,767
and I've never felt that way.

163
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,700
Not even once.

164
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,900
He's going to be sad to hear that.

165
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,567
There's nothing I can do about it.

166
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,600
Because it's true.

167
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,167
Such a lovely uniform.

168
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,400
I'm anxious to go to school.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,733
Silence. We've got a new student.

170
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,533
She studied abroad in LA.

171
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:26,033
So everybody, be nice to her.

172
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:28,700
Hi, guys. Great to meet you.

173
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,900
I'm Cha Se Young.

174
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,933
There's an empty seat...

175
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:39,933
next to Gun over there.

176
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,933
Have a seat there.

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,800
Sure.

178
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,000
Hi.

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,733
I'm Cha Se Young.

180
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,300
Good to meet you.

181
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,500
You're good-looking though.

182
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,633
You seeing anybody?

183
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,333
Is it rude to ask this?

184
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,933
I've lived in the US since middle school

185
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,333
so I don't have many friends in Korea.

186
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,933
Of course, I'm not seeing anybody.

187
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,567
Yeah?

188
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,900
Did I ever ask you?

189
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,233
Sorry.

190
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,767
But can't we be friends?

191
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,700
- I want to be friends… 
 - Sorry,

192
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,400
but can you be quiet?

193
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,733
Heading home already?

194
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,567
Hi. I'm Shin Yu Na.

195
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,933
I'm Lee Ji Min.

196
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,133
Are you from the US?

197
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,867
Yes, LA.

198
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,000
USA.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,300
I studied language abroad, too.

200
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,267
In New York, Manhattan.

201
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:23,733
That was just like three weeks of summer camp.

202
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,867
I've been there anyway.

203
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:30,300
I was very popular there.

204
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,000
Anyway, where did you get your nose done?

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,867
Looks so natural.

206
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,333
I never had a nose job.

207
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,033
- Really? 
 - Okay, then you've passed.

208
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:44,567
You want to join us in our princess play?

209
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:48,700
I think you deserve to join our princess group.

210
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,167
You can ask me any questions.

211
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,600
I'll tell you everything.

212
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,400
I know everything about this school.

213
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,100
Well.

214
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,367
You know about him?

215
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,533
He's nicknamed "GZ".

216
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,600
Handsome zombie.

217
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,433
He was popular in the first year,

218
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:09,400
but as soon as he got to second year he changed 180 degrees.

219
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,600
He just sleeps in class.

220
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,500
The atmosphere around him is always dark.

221
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,367
He doesn't eat school meals.

222
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,433
His family's so broke that he can't even pay for it.

223
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,167
Heard he's working at an escort club.

224
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,833
What's the handsome face for?

225
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,667
What else could he possibly need?

226
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,933
Anyhow, he's friendzoning us so much.

227
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,767
It's like, you want to reach him but you can't.

228
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:30,400
Feels like you can catch him, but you can't.

229
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,667
His good looks are all that matters.

230
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,167
Gun.

231
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,800
- Nice work today. 
 - Thank you.

232
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,700
You're a good boy, though.

233
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,733
In today's world, it's hard to not go down the wrong path...

234
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,633
Your parents are so lucky.

235
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,367
I know.

236
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,300
I wish my parents were lucky.

237
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,400
How much did you pay for the game?

238
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,133
3 million won on my mom's card.

239
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,767
You're cracked. What if you get caught?

240
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:02,167
- Will be okay if I win money. 
 - You're nuts.

241
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:07,567
Let's go. My hand is AA.

242
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:08,867
Darn it.

243
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:10,733
You can get 20 million won.

244
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,133
Go all-in. What are you waiting for?

245
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,733
I wouldn't do that.

246
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
What did you say?

247
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,233
Don't blow your house away

248
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,433
by gambling.

249
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:25,667
He's nuts.

250
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,967
- Oh, come on. 
 - What happened?

251
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,433
- I'm screwed up. 
 - Let me see.

252
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,633
You got taken?

253
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,133
What shall I say to my mom?

254
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,233
You made me lose all my money.

255
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,833
What are you, backseat driver?

256
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,467
You want to die?

257
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,200
If you hit me now,

258
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,667
you'll lose more than what you lost earlier.

259
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,033
Are you okay with that?

260
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:51,333
You're pretending to be cool. You want to die?

261
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,733
I'm just worrying about you.

262
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,867
Oh, shoot.

263
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,667
What are you?

264
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,433
Me?

265
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,433
I'm Cha Se Young.

266
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,300
You two are being so nosy.

267
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,233
No, I'm not. Just worrying about you.

268
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:09,300
Your parents worked so hard to earn that and you blew it all.

269
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,033
Wouldn't it be better to go to them and say sorry?

270
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,367
Are you insane?

271
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:22,367
I've got a 4th-degree in Taekwondo.

272
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,967
Are you sorry or not?

273
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,367
Okay, I get it.

274
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,367
"I get it"?

275
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,933
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,800
You're free to go.

277
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,100
I told you to be careful.

278
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
Why are you following me?

279
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:17,033
I'm going home this way, too.

280
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,404
Your home?

281
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:21,600
Yeah. What?

282
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,233
Do you work there?

283
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,733
Yes.

284
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,200
Every day?

285
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,100
Yes.

286
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,967
Until this hour every day?

287
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,433
What about you?

288
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,233
I'm going to...

289
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,800
drink this.

290
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,067
At this hour?

291
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:47,867
I'm still jet-lagged.

292
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:50,967
That's not important anyway.

293
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:53,833
Did you have dinner?

294
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,067
Dinner?

295
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,267
Yes, dinner.

296
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,467
Why do you want to know that?

297
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,508
 He doesn't eat school meals. 

298
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:04,776
 His family's so broke that he can't even pay for it. 

299
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,600
Right.

300
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,633
Why would I want to know that?

301
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,800
Just want to know.

302
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,900
Can I not be curious?

303
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,233
Don't you think I'm pretty?

304
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,067
Here's a pretty girl

305
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:45,633
walking home alone

306
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,367
at this late hour.

307
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,700
You should've at least said "I'll take you home".

308
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,600
You got a 4th-degree in Taekwondo.

309
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,267
But, still.

310
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:59,300
Walking in the dark may be dangerous.

311
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,500
I thought...

312
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,600
someone running into you would be more dangerous.

313
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,033
Hey, I was trying to save you back then…

314
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,760
♫  You seep deep into a corner of my heart  ♫

315
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,500
♫  And before I know it  ♫

316
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,600
You can go home now.

317
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,110
♫  I have changed a lot compared to before  ♫

318
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
See you tomorrow at school.

319
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,680
Thank you.

320
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,860
♫  Take all of my heart  ♫

321
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,900
That's all for this class.

322
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,000
Your attitude in class till today will be reflected in your grade.

323
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:53,467
Don't say "ah".

324
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,300
Enjoy your lunch.

325
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,267
 Yes. 

326
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,900
Princess Se Young, want to go to the canteen?

327
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,433
You can go. I don't think I can...

328
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,733
She's acting

329
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,333
a bit weird today, isn't she?

330
00:19:57,033 --> 00:20:01,967
 Now, let's begin the awards ceremony 

331
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:06,733
 for the 2017 Junior Elegance Piano Competition. 

332
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:11,633
 First, second, and third place have been awarded. 

333
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:13,533
 And the participation award goes to 

334
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:16,800
 Cha Se Young. Congratulations. 

335
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:09,428
   

336
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,800
 Se Young. 

337
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,900
 I didn't see you there, Mom. 

338
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,067
 I'm sure... I can get the first place this time. 

339
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:24,233
 Why don't you stop playing the piano 

340
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,033
 and concentrate on your schoolwork? 

341
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,367
You play well.

342
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:08,000


343
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,133
 I love Hold'em more than anyone 

344
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,900
 and the reason I've become so disgusted with it is 

345
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,733
 because of the people who try to label 

346
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,167
 this brain sport as 'gambling.' 

347
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,000
 I figure you and I are meant to be together. 

348
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,767
 If a coincidence keeps repeating 

349
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:23,767
 it's destiny they said. 

350
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:24,933
 Tae Ha? 

351
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,100
 I just asked how he was. 

352
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,700
 Why are you that mad? 

353
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,067
 You bastard. 

354
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,233
 You like me all yourself. 

355
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,500
 Don't make me a freak. 

356
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,600
 Is it all about Gun? 

357
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,533
 Oh, my god. 

358
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,267
 If three coincidences happen in a row— 

359
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:42,100
 It's destiny, right? 

360
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,600
