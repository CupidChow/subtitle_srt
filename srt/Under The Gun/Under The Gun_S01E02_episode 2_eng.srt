1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,580
   

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,570
   

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,540
   

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,667
   

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:32,020


6
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:51,200
You play well.

7
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,000
Wait!

8
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,700
Do you enjoy chasing people?

9
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,100
No, well…

10
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:17,767
I'm not that kind of a person who chases after anyone.

11
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,967
Unless there's more to say, I'm off.

12
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,733
Hey.

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,567
My bad. So…

14
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,900
Why do you not have lunch?

15
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,833
Lunch was great today.

16
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,733
Talking about lunch again?

17
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:39,700
Koreans live off the strength of rice.

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,867
You can grow well when you eat well.

19
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:46,100
It's time to eat well. You need to grow up.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,967
Do I need to grow up more?

21
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:08,067
I think I'm at least 20 centimeters taller than you.

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,667
Huh?

23
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,633
You should be eating well first.

24
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,367
Yeah, I guess so.

25
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,800
Hello.

26
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,567
Gun.

27
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, I'm worried.

28
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:47,033
   

29
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,600
Why is Jun Hee still in the room?

30
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,433
Go Jun Hee.

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,633
Go Jun Hee.

32
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,700
Jun Hee. Jun Hee!

33
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,920
Go Jun Hee. Dad.

34
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,400
 The cause of acute leukemia 

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,133
 is unclear, so it's important 

36
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,570
 to start with hospitalization… 

37
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,200
♫  I am determined to forget you  ♫

38
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,380
♫  Take even the scattered pieces  ♫

39
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,880
♫  I can't complete your memories, however  ♫

40
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,700
   

41
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,600
Gun.

42
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,967
Sir.

43
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,233
How is Jun Hee, sir?

44
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:05,200
She'll need a bone marrow transplant.

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,733
She needs chemotherapy and surgery.

46
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,567
But the cost is…

47
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:17,733
   

48
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,933
 I thought I'd never come back here. 

49
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,067
I'm here now.

50
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:48,067
What number was it?

51
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,233
 A man who has lost the last thread of conscience 

52
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,167
 gives up being human. 

53
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,333
 I love Hold'em more than anyone 

54
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,533
 but I've come to hate it. 

55
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:25,067
 That's because of the people 

56
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,733
 who make this brain using sport look like "gambling". 

57
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,367
Cigarettes.

58
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,800
Are you deaf, ashtray kid?

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,033
I told you to get them.

60
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,750
♫  When the sky turns gray and black  ♫

61
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,280
Sure, I'll be right back.

62
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,590
♫  Close your eyes in the thick darkness  ♫

63
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,780
♫  Walk into the darkness  ♫

64
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:05,760
♫  Hide me and make me forgotten  ♫

65
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,400
You're back.

66
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,340
Yeah.

67
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,267
You should stop drinking.

68
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:28,867
I'm worried about your leg.

69
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:32,333
I can't handle it without drinking.

70
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,833
Get some rest.

71
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,733
You have to go to school tomorrow.

72
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,533
Okay.

73
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,600
Dad.

74
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,167
Nothing.

75
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,400
Good night.

76
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,820
 We're now on page 38. 

77
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,320
Most of the large structures in space,

78
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,910
like telescopes or satellites,

79
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,950
are huge, ranging in size

80
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,780
from a few meters to tens of meters.

81
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,620
To solve this issue...

82
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,567
There's such a face like this.

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,500
Princess Se Young! Why don't we…

84
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,133
What?

85
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:07,333
What? I want to go eat tteokbokki.

86
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,733
I'll catch up soon.

87
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,500
We'll go there first waiting for you.

88
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,967
- Come over there. 
 - Okay, I'll be right there.

89
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,767
You're up?

90
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,967
Class is over.

91
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,600
I put this on you so you wouldn't catch cold.

92
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,433
You can give that to me later.

93
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,100
You…

94
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,700
Me?

95
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,133
Why are you doing this to me?

96
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,333
Because it's meant to be?

97
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,767
- What? 
 - Think about it.

98
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:01,700
Isn't it amazing how we met at the corner store

99
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,000
and in the same class?

100
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:08,333
If a coincidence keeps repeating,

101
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,233
it's destiny they said.

102
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,733
So what?

103
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:15,567
So I figure

104
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,433
you and I are meant to be together.

105
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,633
What are you laughing at?

106
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,567
Cha Se Young.

107
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,967
You remember my name?

108
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:32,100
   

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,533
You and I are meant to be together?

110
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,600
Sure.

111
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,400
You can't think about destiny

112
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,367
until you've had a free mind.

113
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,367
Destiny is like

114
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,633
taekwondo or piano.

115
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,067
It's good to have,

116
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,300
but it's still good enough without it.

117
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,100
You can think about destiny only when you don't have

118
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,433
a psychological deficiency.

119
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,100
I don't have that free mind right now, so…

120
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,000
You can't go through life with all that thought.

121
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,433
You may not understand,

122
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,333
but I need to think about how to live my life.

123
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,533
I'm off.

124
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,567
Loving while worrying about things like leisure,

125
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,000
it's really not love.

126
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,780
Cha Se Young.

127
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,520
 Se Young! 

128
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,533
You okay?

129
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, I'm okay.

130
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,933
Why did you follow me?

131
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,900
I didn't follow you for no reason this time.

132
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,500
I wanted to give you this.

133
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,367
And I want to hear "thank you" first.

134
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,767
I've never asked you to do that.

135
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,667
What?

136
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,600
Thank you.

137
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,900
Okay.

138
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,800
Se Young.

139
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:36,733
Tae Ha?

140
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,967
Joo Tae Ha?

141
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,233
Go Gun?

142
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,567
It's been a while.

143
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,600
How have you been?

144
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,733
 Thank you for losing money on me today as well. 

145
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:52,567
 Let's get to the game. 

146
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:55,033
 We'll get punished if we get caught. 

147
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,800
 I was so scared about a penalty. 

148
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,100
 Go to hell, you chicken. 

149
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,433
 Who's Go Gun? 

150
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,200
 I'll be the dealer. 

151
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,200
 How about the loser buys 

152
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,000
 everybody here a meal? 

153
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,767
 - Agreed. 
 - Are you as good as your dad? 

154
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:22,133
 You'll see about that. 

155
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,167
 Three. 

156
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,633
 100k. 

157
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,600
 Call, 100k. 

158
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,467
 All-in. 

159
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,333
 He's all in. 

160
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,600
 A chicken needs to go to hell. 

161
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,000
 All-in. 

162
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,033
 All-in if you're a man. 

163
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,100
   

164
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,167
 It's not over 

165
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,533
 until the river is laid. 

166
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,967
 Let me open the river. 

167
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:28,000
 Thank you for your all-in, sir. 

168
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:32,733
 - Anyone want to go to the canteen? 
 - Me, me. 

169
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,200
How do you know each other?

170
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,100
It was a long time ago.

171
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,067
Maybe a year?

172
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,700
I'm busy right now.

173
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,067
So I'll be on my way.

174
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,867
Mind your own business.

175
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,533
How is your dad?

176
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,267
Don't you dare

177
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,667
bring up my dad.

178
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,833
I just asked how he was.

179
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,833
Why are you that mad?

180
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:07,900
Stop it, Tae Ha.

181
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,300
What did I do? I just asked how his dad was.

182
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,533
Why are you being so sensitive?

183
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,567
Tae Ha.

184
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:19,033
Sorry, Gun. You go ahead.

185
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,667
You two look lovely together.

186
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,700
You're meant to be.

187
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,867
Thanks for the ride. Take care.

188
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,600
Se Young.

189
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,467
I like you. Seriously.

190
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,767
The answer is the same as always.

191
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:05,400
I've never been in love with you.

192
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,300
You've been doing a one-man show all this time, so don't make me a weird person for no reason.

193
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,267
Is it all about Go Gun?

194
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,800
Why are you bringing him up here?

195
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,667
So it's not him?

196
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,467
He has nothing to do...

197
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,733
with our relationship.

198
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,600
That's a good thing.

199
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,233
Se Young.

200
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,733
I've been all in on you all along.

201
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,267
So could you just

202
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:31,600
give me a chance, please?

203
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:41,100
Sorry, Tae Ha.

204
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,400
I'll get going.

205
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:49,867
If you keep blocking my way,

206
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,400
I'll have to get rid of you.

207
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,600
You're here early.

208
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,700
You know how long we've been waiting?

209
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,910
I'll shuffle the deck fairly.

210
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,000
Let's get started.

211
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:44,033
Hang on. You have to wait for the last hand.

212
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,333
Thank you so much.

213
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,133
   

214
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,600
 Se Young. 

215
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,500
 Tae Ha? 

216
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,633
Why would I care for her?

217
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,867
A bottle of beer, Gun.

218
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,367
Sure.

219
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,867
Thank you.

220
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:11,833
Is Mr. Go playing in this tournament?

221
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,167
Tournament?

222
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:19,044
   

223
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:21,933
How's your dad?

224
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,667
You don't need to ask about his dad.

225
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,600
Want to play a game?

226
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,633
You want to play with them, Mr. Go?

227
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,000
What's wrong, Mr. Jeong? We're just asking how his dad is.

228
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,900
My dad is…

229
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,533
He's doing fine.

230
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,700
A lot of people

231
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,733
are asking how my dad is these days.

232
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,467
He should get back on the game.

233
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:45,467
Of course. He's a legendary player.

234
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,233
That's a bummer.

235
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,300
Since he's a recognized world-ranked player.

236
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,800
He's not feeling well.

237
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,467
You want to play a game?

238
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,967
With us? Sounds great.

239
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,800
Great.

240
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,500
I got surprised earlier.

241
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,900
About what?

242
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,400
You've never asked customers

243
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
to play a game before.

244
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,633
I didn't want to talk about my dad.

245
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:18,600
Don't you think it's too much for you to do that?

246
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,633
It just happened.

247
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,300
What's up with you?

248
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Nothing.

249
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,100
Why? What's wrong with you?

250
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,900
It's just...

251
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,000
about Jun Hee.

252
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,967
How is she? Is she that bad?

253
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,933
She needs to be treated.

254
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:48,900
Well.

255
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,933
The cost might be high.

256
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,500
How high is it?

257
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,633
Very high.

258
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,033
Gun, you should play a tournament.

259
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,333
I won't.

260
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,167
There's no surefire way to make money like winning a tournament.

261
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:10,133
Any other way to get that much at your age?

262
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,733
Think about it.

263
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,167
You're so bull-headed.

264
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,800
Your dad went in and out

265
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,433
of illegal gambling houses. That's all about it.

266
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:22,200
Hold'em didn't make him like that.

267
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,600
Gambling is the problem.

268
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,367
It's not about Hold'em.

269
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,772
   

270
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,067
I'll be right there.

271
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,500
- I'll get going. 
 - The corner store job?

272
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,960
Yeah, well.

273
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,910


274
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,367
 Is he that good at Hold'em? 

275
00:21:58,367 --> 00:21:59,800
 He's been playing cards 

276
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,200
   
 and nothing else since he was a kid. 

277
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,800
 I like you. 

278
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 Could you give this to Gun? 

279
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,000
 What is this? 

280
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,667
 Can I ask you why you're working so hard? 

281
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,767
 My sister has been ill. 

282
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,600
 She has leukemia. 

283
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:21,800
 Get home safe. 

284
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:30,067
