1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,370
   

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,530
   

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,660
   

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,940


5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,367
   

6
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,767
Give me your phone.

7
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,600
   

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,167
Don't get rid of the heart.

9
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,233
Let's go. I'll take you home.

10
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,400
Nope.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,500
I'll take you home today.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,300
No way.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,433
Why?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,733
Then let's part ways here. It's fair.

15
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,500
I don't want to. Then I'm going with you.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,767
I need to go to work.

17
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:06,433
I promise I won't bother you!

18
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,567
I could do something to help.

19
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,333
You remember I saved you last time from the boys playing illegal games. Right?

20
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:14,200
You remember I saved you last time from the boys playing illegal games. Right?

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I know where the corner store is, though.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,400
I'll go there even if you tell me not to.

23
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,900
You know.

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,700
Can I ask you why you're working that hard?

26
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:37,933
To make money.

27
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:45,133
My little sister's sick in bed.

28
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,767
She is sixteen...

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
and has leukemia.

30
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:59,400
Sorry. I didn't know what.

31
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,833
Let's go.

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,400
Is she your girlfriend?

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,367
Yeah, true.

34
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:18,233
You're sitting right next to him and studying.

35
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,633
You're so cute.

36
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:22,233
Thank you!

37
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,433
Keep up the good work.

38
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,500
- Sure. 
 - Take it easy.

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,233
Thank you.

40
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,267
What are you doing now?

41
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:36,867
It doesn't matter where I study anyway.

42
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,033
I can study next to you here like this.

43
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,500
Huh?

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,567
They say good students study well in any environment.

45
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,833
But you don't like a good student, obviously.

46
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,733
What did you say?

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,333
Let me give you a hand.

48
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,800
It's all right. You can keep studying.

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,900
I just want to give you a hand.

50
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,400
Why are you looking at me that way?

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,600
What about your parents when you're still out at this hour?

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,667
I had lived in the US for a long time.

53
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,667
I'm kind of an independent and free spirit.

54
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,633
My parents don't restrict me.

55
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,500
Okay.

56
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:29,900
Is it okay if I put this here?

57
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:36,467
What are you so freaked out about?

58
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,167
Well, just…

59
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,433
We've done more than that. Don't make a big deal out of touching a hand.

60
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,433
Hey!

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,367
This is my place.

62
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,033
Take care.

63
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:01,267
Get home safe.

64
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:08,767
Don't look back. It's embarrassing.

65
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,667
You're embarrassed about everything.

66
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,067
See you tomorrow!

67
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:37,633
   

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,767
I'm going to put what we learned today on the test

69
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:45,100
for all of you who are still dozing off today.

70
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't say "ah".

71
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,700
Enjoy your lunch today as well.

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,667
Yep.

73
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:57,967
Se Young.

74
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,800
Why so down?

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,600
Nothing.

76
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,767
It's not nothing.

77
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,000
Because Go Gun is not here, right?

78
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,733
You're sick totally.

79
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:15,767
You're totally…

80
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,133
- Lovesick. 
 - Lovesick.

81
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:40,667
   

82
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,367
What's wrong with him?

83
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,867
Sir.

84
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,333
What do we do now?

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,433
    
 Imatinib treatment

86
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,667
    
 may extend patients' lives

87
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,167
and improve their quality of life

88
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,200
more than previously known treatments.

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,633
But the cost is not low.

90
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,867
How much does it cost?

91
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:16,000
This is not covered by insurance.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,033
Just let me know the cost.

93
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,233
I'm here.

94
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:32,333
Dad. Brother.

95
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,133
You don't have to worry about it.

96
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,767
You're going to be fine. He said you were getting better.

97
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,800
You look so skinny.

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,767
Are you worried about me?

99
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
- Dad. 
 - Yeah.

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,300
Can you buy me some juice?

101
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,000
- Juice? 
 - Yeah.

102
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,560
Brother.

103
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,160
Hmm?

104
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,767
What?

105
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,133
Don't go out of your way

106
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,367
for me.

107
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,200
Jun Hee.

108
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,700
You don't have to push yourself too hard.

109
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm okay.

110
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,033
Go Jun Hee!

111
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:27,700
I don't want to be a burden to you, so…

112
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,267
Why do you think you're a burden to me?

113
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,067
Don't say that again.

114
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,300
I know

115
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,567
how much the cost is.

116
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,400
Jun Hee.

117
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,400
I won't make you suffer anymore.

118
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,633
You're not making me suffer.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,100
No, you're not.

120
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,700
No.

121
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,000
Can't catch a break.

122
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,333
Hello?

123
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:48,980
Oh, hey.

124
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,967
What's going on?

125
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:53,400
He's been waiting for you.

126
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,733
I'll fold this time.

127
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,233
You want to make a bet with me?

128
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,400
Not interested.

129
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,767
You'll get interested.

130
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,233
Let's play a game.

131
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:20,667
If you win, I won't show up in front of you.

132
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,233
If I win,

133
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,000
don't toy with Cha Se Young anymore.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,533
Who toys with whom?

135
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,267
I've never toyed with her.

136
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,433
- She's toyed with me a lot. 
 - You brat.

137
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,767
I haven't toyed with her.

138
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,833
Since you say so,

139
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,167
you make me want to have her even more.

140
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,333
You're the one who toys with me.

141
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,233
Don't do it. If you keep doing it,

142
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,267
I don't know what I will do.

143
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,100
   

144
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,933
   

145
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh yeah.

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
Don't call me on such dirty things in the future.

147
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,433
   

148
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,033
You are under arrest today

149
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,567
for illegal private gambling.

150
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,440
- Take them. 
 - Yes, sir.

151
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,510
Shut up!

152
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,440
♫  Tonight, again I'm wasted  ♫ 
 ♫  You need to come and save me  ♫

153
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,190
   

154
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,230
♫  You need to come and save me  ♫

155
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,700
♫  You're right tonight, I'm all right  ♫

156
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,220
 (You son of a bitch!!) 

157
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,610
♫  Your scent still reminds me of you  ♫

158
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,980
♫  You're right, tonight I'm all right  ♫

159
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,900
You jerk.

160
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,033
What? He didn't work today?

161
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,567
 Please leave a message after the beep… 

162
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:21,467
Why aren't you answering my calls?

163
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:27,233
 I wanted to show you 

164
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:31,167
 that I've gotten better since I met you. 

165
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:36,000
 At least, I didn't want to become an embarrassment. 

166
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't have an umbrella.

167
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,933
   

168
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,667
Student Go Gun.

169
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,433
Come out.

170
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,233
Student,

171
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:59,167
I'm busy. I can't wait anymore.

172
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,833
Tell me your guardian's phone number.

173
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,867
I don't have a guardian.

174
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:08,433
Do you think that makes sense?

175
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,533
I said I don't have any.

176
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't bullshit me. Just say it.

177
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,333
I don't have one.

178
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,267
Don't make a big deal out of it. Tell me your guardian's phone number.

179
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:34,133
I should have used Chinese salt.

180
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,400
Expensive sea salt made a mess on the floor.

181
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,967
Sir!

182
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,733
What brought you here, Se Young?

183
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:45,400
Gun didn't show up for school and didn't answer my calls.

184
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,467
He must be working at the corner store.

185
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:52,167
I've been there too but didn't see him. That's why I'm here.

186
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,767
Are you in touch with him?

187
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,433
 - Please leave a message after the beep…  
 - He doesn't answer?

188
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:05,733
I left earlier for my part-time job. That's weird.

189
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,500
We had an asshole come in for Gun earlier.

190
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,033
An asshole?

191
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:13,367
Joo Tae Ha? A Hold'em idol or something?

192
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,533
Joo Tae Ha?

193
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,633
Hello?

194
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,167
Yes.

195
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,000
Police station?

196
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,967
   

197
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,900
Gun! Gun!

198
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,167
Gun.

199
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,567
What's going on here?

200
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,400
Are you his guardian?

201
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,067
I am.

202
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,900
You are finally here.

203
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,967
You can come with me this way.

204
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,733
What happens to him then?

205
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,033
Even if he's underage,

206
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:14,000
it's a serious offense to be involved

207
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,867
in illegal private gambling and to operate it.

208
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:20,633
Maybe after some investigation in our division,

209
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:23,167
the case will go to juvenile court.

210
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,467
Sir.

211
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,733
He's a really pathetic kid.

212
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:28,967
He didn't really mean to go there.

213
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,967
He had a reason for that.

214
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,233
Sir.

215
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:36,933
Everybody has their own reason.

216
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,433
You can take him home today.

217
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,333
I'll let you know when he'll be attending court.

218
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,133
- Take care. 
 - Sir, but...

219
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,667
You had a really hard time.

220
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,433
Sorry, Hyung.

221
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,700
It's all my fault.

222
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,833
You freak!

223
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:13,133
Forget it. I'll save the nagging for later.

224
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,433
What about the Hold'em pub?

225
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,967
Someone messed up and I closed it.

226
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,233
I'm going to go make some money now.

227
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,667
I want to go there with you.

228
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,800
You can get some rest.

229
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,700
Thank you for today, Se Young.

230
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,067
No worries. Don't mention it.

231
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,667
It's late and you should take her home.

232
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm off now.

233
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,733
Hyung!

234
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,600
What now?

235
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,400
Thank you.

236
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,033
See you tomorrow.

237
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,533
Are you okay?

238
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,033
No.

239
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,533
Did you really have to go that far?

240
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,900
Why are you working for an illegal gambling house

241
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,600
but not playing at official competitions?

242
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,967
I didn't play a game there.

243
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,400
You don't believe me, either?

244
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,033
I do.

245
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,200
Official competitions are legal.

246
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,800
There are no underage restrictions on participation.

247
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,633
You can win fair and square and get a prize.

248
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,200
Is it because the prize is from gambling?

249
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,367
My dad...

250
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:47,000
gambled away our house.

251
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,833
What's the difference between

252
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,167
winning a prize in a tournament and gambling?

253
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,600
What about

254
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,700
working in the illegal gambling house?

255
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,267
Is it okay because you're not gambling?

256
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:03,133
What kind of logic is that?

257
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,267
   

258
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:10,300
I don't need it.

259
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,200
Then you should throw it away yourself.

260
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,967
You don't have any other options right now.

261
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,767
You're playing at the illegal gambling house for your sister's medical bill.

262
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:23,767
Cha Se Young.

263
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:27,233
You know what I'm most angry about right now?

264
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,133
I like...

265
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,067
your situation and your scars.

266
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,567
You're...

267
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,867
making yourself look pathetic.

268
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,933
I feel so bad about that, Gun.

269
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:56,667
Be rational about what's important to you.

270
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,633
I'll get going now.

271
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:10,067
   

272
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,033
Dad?

273
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,733
What's wrong with you?

274
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,467
Have a seat.

275
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,367
Let's make a bet.

276
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,367
Just one game.

277
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,833
You promised...

278
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,800
you'd never play Hold'em again.

279
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,167
I heard about it from Ji Cheol.

280
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,167
KPL Entry Ticket.

281
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:03,033
He said you might have it.

282
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,767
It's a single-round match.

283
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:13,100
You win, you play in the competition.

284
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,833
I win, I play in the competition.

285
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,267
What about it, son?

286
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:23,933
Showdown for the first time in a long time, call?

287
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,390
Let's play.

288
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:52,190


289
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,900
 I'll go on my way. 

290
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,500
 Gun. 

291
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,667
 Thank you for everything. 

292
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,333
 Now it's time for you 

293
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,567
 to do something for yourself. 

294
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,170
   

295
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,330
♫  Stay by my side, yeah  ♫

296
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,470
Why not? I'll give it a crack.

297
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:16,460
♫  Here I stay. Fill the dark night with you, yeah  ♫

298
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,200
 Why don't we... 

299
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,167
 play fair? 

300
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:26,567
