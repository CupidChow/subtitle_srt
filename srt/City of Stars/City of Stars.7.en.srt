1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,650
I love you, Krom.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,010
I’d never imagine

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,420
that you’re dating with Fueng!

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,980
I miss my darling.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,390
Please don't break up with my friend!

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,350
I won't.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,800
If I could sing like before

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,560
Madam Aoi will force me to sing at every event.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,960
Were you a good singer earlier?

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,690
I liked to sing before.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,580
Don’t let me see you

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,620
do this nonsense again.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,310
His face always showed up when I sang.

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,910
If you can forgive him

15
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,440
you’ll come back to sing as well as before.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,410
You’re another part of my life.

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,700
You’re always beside me.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,340
You can finally do it.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,830
I could find my way to sing,

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,550
all because of you.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,850
Thank you.

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,650
Navy.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,940
My darling.

24
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,860
I’m proud of you, baby.

25
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,400
What was the most unexpected experience

26
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,410
you ever had

27
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,650
in your life?

28
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,540
For my parent is, having me.

29
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,460
It’d been years that they tried so hard to have a kid.

30
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,950
How was it, baby?

31
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,390
Honey!

32
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,270
Honey!

33
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,430
Honey!

34
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,030
How is it?

35
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
How is it?

36
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,530
Look! It’s positive!

37
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,180
One. Six. Nine. Five. Three. Zero.

38
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,470
Kung. She won the first prize of the lottery tickets.

39
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,510
Six million! The first prize!

40
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
It’s the first prize of 3 million!

41
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,770
Call me Madam Kung!

42
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,900
Madam Kung! Madam Kung! Madam Kung!

43
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,660
But turned out that

44
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,060
it was the fake ticket.

45
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Calm down, Madam Kung.

46
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,760
Don’t call me Madam!

47
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,210
Okay, Kung.

48
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,290
For Thoo.

49
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,890
He couldn’t pass the boyband’s audition.

50
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,900
Hello. My name’s Thoo.

51
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
My performance is dancing.

52
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,650
I don’t think it was unexpected, though.

53
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,390
For Yayee. It is the date between Fuang and me.

54
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,320
Hey. Fueang and I already had….

55
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,370
When? When was it?

56
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,660
I know. You guys would think that

57
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,900
waking up

58
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,470
with a villain actor beside me

59
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,750
was my most unexpected experience.

60
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,420
Good morning.

61
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,430
Good morning.

62
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,760
Why did you wake up so early?

63
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,090
I’ve been chatting with my co-workers.

64
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,740
Here they are.

65
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,520
They are Tom and Jane Jira.

66
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,240
You guys seem so close.

67
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,970
Yes. We were often drunk together there.

68
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,280
Well… I…

69
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,330
I heard about that scandal. And I…

70
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,130
I want to…

71
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,230
I always wanted to kill myself.

72
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,080
Why couldn't I pull off

73
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,560
a good excuse at that time?

74
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,000
Umm. Smells so good.

75
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,920
Fueang!

76
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,170
Fueang!

77
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,570
Wake up!

78
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,150
Although I’m uncomfortable with this situation,

79
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,840
but this wasn’t

80
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,040
my most unexpected moment.

81
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,390
You were so noisy.

82
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,070
Fueang.

83
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,670
You just had sex, didn’t you?

84
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,160
Hey. Hey. Hey.

85
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,130
You'll embarrass him.

86
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,210
Oh… Is it that kid?

87
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,060
I only have him.

88
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,420
Fueang!

89
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,710
You never let me bring my women here.

90
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,710
How could you bring yours?

91
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,000
Hey. This is my house,

92
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,490
and I paid for it.

93
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,250
I can do anything I want.

94
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,290
A housemate like you

95
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,340
doesn’t have any rights.

96
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,140
Hey.

97
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,030
You’ve been talking to Namsom behind me all this time.

98
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,790
How dare you talk to me like this!

99
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,710
You idiot!

100
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,120
You knew about Namsom.

101
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Of course.

102
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,490
Don’t worry.

103
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,860
I’m a good guy.

104
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,460
And I won’t be mad at you at all.

105
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,390
Do you know why?

106
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,010
It’s because Namsom and I are already back together.

107
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,250
What? Wait.

108
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,380
What did you do?

109
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,110
Vinegar.

110
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,110
Hello.

111
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,040
Hello?

112
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,920
I’ll block your call if you don’t speak.

113
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,580
How did you know

114
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,020
where she works?

115
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,670
Ah… I have my connections.

116
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,240
And I could tell that she was at the pub

117
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,040
from her surroundings sound.

118
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,890
As a professional clubber,

119
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,170
I called and asked my friends, those pub owners.

120
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,370
Okay. I'm going.

121
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,460
You.

122
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,030
Namsom.

123
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,630
Namsom!

124
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,880
Aw, Kor.

125
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,960
I thought you would miss her.

126
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,890
Where is she rushing to?

127
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,090
Her mom is sick.

128
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,690
So, she had to leave early.

129
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,470
Hey, can you ride me to Sinthorn Village?

130
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,830
Sorry. I need to go to refill the gas.

131
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,400
- Sorry. I need to go to refill the gas.
- You cannot go?

132
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,620
Namsom. Namsom.

133
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,260
Come with me.

134
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,990
I’ll ride you there.

135
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,550
Come on. Aren’t you in a hurry?

136
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,760
Get in.

137
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,080
Alright.

138
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,270
Mom!

139
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,630
Mom!

140
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,870
Mom!

141
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,800
Mom!

142
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,920
She's fainted.

143
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,760
Mom!

144
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,760
Namsom.

145
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,600
Aw.

146
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,000
You’re still here.

147
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,850
How is your mom?

148
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,740
The doctor said she had a hypotension.

149
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,460
She’s okay now.

150
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,270
Just need to stay a night here.

151
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,119
Are you going home now?

152
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,530
Yes. They don’t allow me to stay with her.

153
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,450
Let me give you a ride.

154
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,819
It’s alright.

155
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,140
I’ve already disturbed you too much.

156
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,550
I have to go now.

157
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,220
I’ll call you when I get home.

158
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,070
Okay.

159
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,510
Be careful.

160
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,300
Ah. What happened next?

161
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,740
You know what?

162
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,310
I'll never forget

163
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,400
how I felt while waiting for that call.

164
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,420
Namsom.

165
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,030
Hello?

166
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,080
Hey. I call you only tonight.

167
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,530
Alright.

168
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,170
But…

169
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,050
Can we talk till morning?

170
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,140
I promise that I’ll let you go once the sun rises.

171
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,470
Till the sunrise?

172
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,710
Well.

173
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,360
You only give me one chance.

174
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,610
Well, will your boyfriend be mad about this?

175
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,900
I don’t have one.

176
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,420
Why?

177
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,240
I don’t want to ruin anyone’s life again.

178
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,680
You…

179
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,450
That’s what you’ve been thinking?

180
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,820
Come on. Don’t blame yourself.

181
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,860
You never hurt me

182
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,830
while we were together.

183
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,120
It was only once when you broke up with me.

184
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,450
Are you crying?

185
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,330
Please don’t.

186
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,100
You said you must be strong

187
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,710
to be a family leader.

188
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,670
Please smile.

189
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,560
You’re smiling now.

190
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Good.

191
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,290
Well.

192
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,220
I already had a Sex Reassignment Surgery.

193
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,660
I paid for it with the money you gave me.

194
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,350
Really?

195
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,430
Was it hurt?

196
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,320
Yes. A lot.

197
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,360
Although I prepared for it

198
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,290
it still really hurt.

199
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,860
Such a pity.

200
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,620
I should be there to take care of you.

201
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,670
Well.

202
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,510
If you allow me

203
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,640
I can drive there to take care of you now.

204
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,320
Isn't it good?

205
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,130
It's morning.

206
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,830
Should I let you go now?

207
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,510
Yes.

208
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,760
Would it be possible

209
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,810
if I call you again tonight?

210
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,770
Um.

211
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,220
Alright.

212
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,830
Have a nice day.

213
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,510
You too.

214
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,590
Okay.

215
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,800
I'll call you later.

216
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,640
Thanks again for last night.

217
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,780
We talked till morning.

218
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,140
Morning!

219
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,400
That’s wonderful.

220
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,360
You’d better be good this time.

221
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,120
I know that.

222
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,130
No more

223
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,650
Saladang brothel.

224
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,670
Aw! Krom!

225
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,560
Why’re you standing there? Come here.

226
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,330
Come on.

227
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,420
How was it?

228
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,420
Having Fueang as your wife.

229
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,420
You jerk!

230
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,030
Hmm? Why?

231
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,200
I’m curious

232
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,840
if FuangNakhon is as good

233
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,730
as they wrote in his fan fiction.

234
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,690
So, what will you say?

235
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,060
Ah. No answer.

236
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,870
Fine.

237
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,430
I’d better go now.

238
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,470
Hey. Hold on.

239
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,670
Where're you going?

240
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,880
Aw. What am I supposed to do here?

241
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,970
I don’t want to be a third wheel between two Lovebirds

242
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,290
who want to spend all day and all night together.

243
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,970
Stop! That’s from the fan.

244
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,060
No need to be harsh. I’m going.

245
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,630
Oh, Krom.

246
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,230
Enjoy yourself.

247
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,640
But please spare that couch. It’s my favorite.

248
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,400
Don’t let it dirty.

249
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,090
Ah! We have neighbors,

250
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,050
so don’t be too loud.

251
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:02,730
Oops!

252
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,370
I forgot. It’s his own house.

253
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,420
So that’d be alright.

254
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,860
Just don’t let his parents hear it.

255
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,310
Hmm!

256
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,280
Wait for my turn!

257
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,890
What do you want to eat? I’ll make it for you.

258
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,100
You have two options.

259
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,540
A fried egg or an omelet?

260
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,110
Omelet. Please fry it with butter.

261
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,560
Okay.

262
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,550
Here you go.

263
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,430
It looks nice.

264
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,640
Aw. How about yours?

265
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,410
This is my regular breakfast.

266
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,730
It’s a whey protein.

267
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,260
Okay.

268
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,800
Er. Fuang.

269
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,610
About that clip.

270
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,690
Could you catch the man who hid the camera?

271
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,220
No, we couldn’t.

272
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,460
The hotel wasn’t responsible for anything, either.

273
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,230
Since that day,

274
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,920
Kor and I

275
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,400
always carry the camera detector anywhere we go.

276
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,250
It’s still haunted me till now.

277
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,700
That must be horrible.

278
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,590
I got a trauma back then.

279
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,840
Anywhere I went,

280
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,930
people kept looking at me weird

281
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,370
I was too lost to react.

282
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,030
Honestly, there was nothing in that clip.

283
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,710
They were too exaggerated.

284
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,480
Ditto. I have the same thought.

285
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,440
My friend said your clip was extreme.

286
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,290
But when I watched it…

287
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,770
There was nothing as he said.

288
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,680
Are you telling me that

289
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,210
you always wanted to see my body?

290
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,380
Fueang. I’m eating.

291
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,630
Continue it.

292
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,500
Okay. Okay. I’m full now.

293
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,450
What do you want me to do?

294
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,820
Do you want to be a top?

295
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,880
Do you like that?

296
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,170
No. I don’t think so.

297
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,930
Come on. Tell me.

298
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,100
Between you and me.

299
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,230
You are more like a top.

300
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,870
Just be frank. I’m okay.

301
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,140
Honestly, I can be anything.

302
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,130
For you.

303
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:37,940
Well. I’d love to be your bottom.

304
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,590
It’s the best.

305
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,900
So , about that clip.

306
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,030
Fuang confirm he's not mad at me

307
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,130
He said that I've seen more of his stuff than in the clips.

308
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,620
but this is not the most unexpected thing in my life.

309
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,810
go to my room.

310
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,940
But the condoms are all gone.

311
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,510
But Kor never locks his door.

312
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,130
Thank you.

313
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,030
How is your mom?

314
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,600
She’s better. They allow her to go home tomorrow.

315
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
Did you have some sleep?

316
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,450
No.

317
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,050
Poor girl.

318
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,660
Thank you.

319
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,300
Hi. I'm here.

320
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,990
Okay.

321
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,870
Are you Namsom?

322
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,950
Yes.

323
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,180
Don’t forget to get rest.

324
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,560
Sand. You can start spreading the news

325
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,640
to those big brands.

326
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,680
Fueang just got a big new project.

327
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,410
They might be interested in getting him as their presenter.

328
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,180
What’s going on?

329
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,900
Should we ask him first

330
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,510
if he wants this job?

331
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,350
Everyone wants this job.

332
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,950
Why doesn’t he? Hmm?

333
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,920
Fueang. Kor.

334
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,600
Go say hi to Mr. Lee.

335
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,440
Okay.

336
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,440
No.

337
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,890
Ah! You want Fueang to be your presenter.

338
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,530
How about Kor?

339
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,820
That's right. Hen Hao.

340
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,270
Mr. Lee said Fueang is friendly,

341
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,310
Of course.

342
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,070
affectionate,

343
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,870
You're right.

344
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,920
and sincere.

345
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,320
That's him.

346
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,370
Mr. Lee wants to support him

347
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,690
to be as famous as Korean stars.

348
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,620
Hah!

349
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,260
That would be an honor!

350
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,980
This is unexpected!

351
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,510
With under one condition.

352
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,590
Okay.

353
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,270
Fueang must stay single.

354
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
I think you should talk to him first.

355
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,090
What’s wrong with you? Speak!

356
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,290
Fueang is on dating.

357
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,980
That’s all! Not a big deal!

358
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,300
Huh!!

359
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,540
He's dating!

360
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,520
I’ll never leave you.

361
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,930
I’ll love you forever.

362
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,010
Me too.

363
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,880
Cut! Okay! Very good!

364
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,290
Alright.

365
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,370
You can go home, Cheesecake.

366
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:21,650
Thank you.

367
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:26,179
- Good job. See you.
- Thanks. See you.

368
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,400
Wait, Krom!

369
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,170
Why are you running away?

370
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,570
I’m going to the restroom.

371
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,020
Restroom?

372
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,500
I’ll wait for you here.

373
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,159
Do you want to talk to me?

374
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,090
I always saw you with Fueang.

375
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,930
You guys must be so close.

376
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,180
Okay.

377
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,540
Is he dating someone?

378
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,820
Hmm?

379
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,510
Why do you want to know?

380
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,710
It’s not what you think!

381
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,920
I have to shoot many love scenes

382
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,680
with him.

383
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,610
I don’t want to upset his lover.

384
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,180
Don’t worry.

385
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,580
His lover will understand.

386
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,270
Pardon me?

387
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,910
Is he dating someone now?

388
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,510
Uh…

389
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,920
Who is that?

390
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,560
Is that person here?

391
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,360
Yes.

392
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,010
Hah! Really?

393
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,490
Where is that person?

394
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,130
Well… I…

395
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,540
FueangNakhon isn't dating anyone.

396
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,230
Don’t tease her, Krom.

397
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,150
We don’t want to disturb you with this nonsense.

398
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,360
So you can concentrate on your acting.

399
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,640
But, indeed, he's still single

400
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,690
and he doesn’t want to have someone now.

401
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,130
Got it?

402
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,740
Yes. Okay.

403
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,820
That's good.

404
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,190
That was close!

405
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,550
You looking for trouble!

406
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,840
What did I do?

407
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,720
You silly!

408
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,880
Sand!

409
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,730
What are you going to do with me?

410
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,650
Where are we going?!

411
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,940
Madam Aoi? Sand?

412
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,380
Stand right here.

413
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,500
What’s going on?

414
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,910
There’s nothing.

415
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,190
Well,

416
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,550
we just want to ask you something.

417
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,680
Do you plan to go back to America soon?

418
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,560
Why?

419
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,730
Well.

420
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,290
We’re scheming

421
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,730
to fine a new person to replace your position.

422
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,020
Someone must take care of Fuang

423
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,260
after you go.

424
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,980
So, when is it?

425
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,540
Oh.

426
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,350
In a month.

427
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,510
A month…

428
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,710
And when will you come back?

429
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,120
Uh... I don’t know yet.

430
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
You don’t know!

431
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,170
Aw! What about your relationship with Fueang?

432
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:05,970
Hmm?

433
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,540
I beg you pardon?

434
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,540
Yes.

435
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,180
We already knew about you guys.

436
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,470
About what?

437
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,390
About your dating with Fueang.

438
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,560
No need to be surprised.

439
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,360
Does anyone else know about this?

440
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,530
Uh… Well.

441
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,650
My friends.

442
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,490
How many of them?

443
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,580
Uh… Three.

444
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,300
Three!

445
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,230
Three persons?!

446
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,550
What’s wrong with it?

447
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,560
Ah. Let me tell you straight.

448
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,490
There is a prominent international investor who's interested in Fueang

449
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,850
and he wants to support him

450
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,980
to be the new prince of Asia

451
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,460
Like Gong Yoo.

452
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,700
Really?

453
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,500
Yes!

454
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,470
But!

455
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,710
Hmm?

456
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,830
But?

457
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,520
He cannot date anyone.

458
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,080
This rule is stringent

459
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,000
for all of the idols in his company.

460
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,570
Unfortunately, I told him that

461
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,730
Fueang is single

462
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,410
and hasn’t interested in having someone yet

463
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,740
since he wants

464
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,260
to focus on his job.

465
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,870
I was so shocked when Sand told me about you guys.

466
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,070
You must understand that

467
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,830
I can't change my words with them.

468
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,720
It's the business things.

469
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,240
Our credits will be ruined, too.

470
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,570
It’s his lifetime opportunity

471
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,260
to become the Prince of Asia.

472
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,590
Now you know why

473
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,350
Madam Aoi doesn’t want anyone to know

474
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,070
about your relationship with Fueang.

475
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,640
I didn’t think

476
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,880
it was a big deal.

477
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,130
We just started our relationship.

478
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,370
He couldn't be that serious.

479
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,700
But it seems that I was wrong.

480
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,320
Why are we here?

481
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Are you hungry?

482
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,450
Little bit.

483
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,450
There.

484
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,460
That’s my mother.

485
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,460
Your mother!

486
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,070
You should've told me

487
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,310
that your mother came to.

488
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,920
I wanted to surprise you.

489
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,280
Why?

490
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,490
Hello

491
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,390
Mom. This is Krom.

492
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,710
He is my boyfriend.

493
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,510
Krom.

494
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,680
Hello.

495
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,930
Mom.

496
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,010
Did you talk to Roen

497
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,060
about…

498
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,100
about his divorce?

499
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,390
Fueang! We’ll talk about it later.

500
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,510
Why?

501
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,480
He is my lover.

502
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,760
He has a right to know.

503
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,600
I’d better go.

504
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,370
Hold on.

505
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,290
You don’t have to be that rush.

506
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,460
Uh… Fueang.

507
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,430
I need to go to the restroom.

508
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,370
What you did was wrong.

509
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,050
What do you mean?

510
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,020
You shouldn’t talk about family issues

511
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,900
while we have an outsider.

512
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,790
What would you do

513
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,990
if he exposed your brother's secret

514
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,390
when you broke up with him?

515
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,310
I won’t break up with him

516
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,600
or even if it happened,

517
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,200
I’m sure

518
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,210
he wouldn’t do that.

519
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,810
How long have you known him?

520
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,420
You can't be that sure.

521
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,390
Your relationship with him

522
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,600
is uncertain.

523
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,680
I don’t have any problems if it's just a fun.

524
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,530
But don’t get him involved in your personal life.

525
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,660
He'll be a problem after splitting up.

526
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,300
You'll regret it

527
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,300
if you don't trust me.

528
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,070
I’ll show you

529
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,510
how serious I am

530
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
with our relationship.

531
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,700
He’s more serious than I thought.

532
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,860
Do I feel good?

533
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,020
Yes, I do.

534
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,990
But I’d be better

535
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,790
if we were not

536
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,760
in this situation.

537
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,850
Imported sausage from German.

538
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,450
Free tasting.

539
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,790
Please try.

540
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,790
Imported sausage from German.

541
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,040
She’s Namsom who had a rumor with Kor.

542
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,240
Right. She’s beautiful.

543
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,410
Please try.

544
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,620
Can I try yours instead?

545
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,540
Did she cut it?

546
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,670
Why’re you smiling?

547
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,560
Sorry. My bad.

548
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,170
So soft.

549
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,690
Let’s go.

550
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,260
Kor.

551
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,750
Kor!

552
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,280
- She was so soft.
- Was that so?

553
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,480
I want to touch her too.

554
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,600
Stop!

555
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,410
Namsom. Let me go!

556
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,450
But you’ll get in trouble.

557
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,620
Let it be! I don’t care!

558
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,700
But I care.

559
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,460
I don’t want to be the one

560
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,830
who ruins your reputation anymore!

561
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,030
But they bullied you.

562
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,670
I can’t let them get away with it!

563
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,240
There are other ways.

564
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,280
No!

565
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,240
Those scumbags

566
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,890
must deal with a guy like me!

567
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,290
I told you to stop!

568
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,330
The most I can get is retiring from this business!

569
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,700
That sounds good. So, I can do whatever want!

570
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,100
Just go away!

571
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,790
I’m done with you.

572
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,810
Are you okay?

573
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,970
You’re so quite.

574
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,700
Are you still thinking about my mom?

575
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,270
You shouldn’t bring me to your mom.

576
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,550
But I should.

577
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,560
It was because I care for you.

578
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,730
I want you to know

579
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,180
that you're important to me.

580
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,900
So, when you return to America,

581
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,510
you won’t be mean

582
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,190
by breaking up with me.

583
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,360
Don’t be worried, okay?

584
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:14,690
Okay.

585
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,420
Hello

586
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,750
Have you talked to Kor today?

587
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,710
Not yet. Are there any problems?

588
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,760
He has a shooting today.

589
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,680
But I couldn’t contact him until now.

590
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,120
He hasn’t answered my calls too.

591
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,050
The team is so furious.

592
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:36,370
He said

593
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,930
he'd go back to his condo.

594
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,660
I’m nearby him.

595
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,300
Let me check for you.

596
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,240
Here is his place.

597
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,640
Okay.

598
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,370
Kor.

599
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,050
Kor!

600
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,420
Hey!

601
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:06,870
Kor!

602
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,530
Is this the Saladang brothel?

603
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,730
The place that his fans talked about.

604
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,060
Kor!

605
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,830
Fueang.

606
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,870
You must help me.

607
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,680
I can’t stand anymore.

608
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,810
Please help me.

609
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,490
What happened?

610
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:41,780
Bring me that liquor.

611
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:42,980
It’s finished.

612
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,000
Where is Krom?

613
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,960
He left.

614
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,400
I’ll stay with you tonight.

615
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,770
Sand made an excuse for you

616
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,010
that you were sick.

617
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,900
We also need to pay them for the penalty.

618
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,870
Madam Aoi is going to scold me again.

619
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:09,910
You deserve it.

620
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,320
You said Namsom and you are back together.

621
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,250
How come you broke down like this?

622
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,060
She won't talk to me anymore.

623
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,300
Wait.

624
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,710
What happened exactly?

625
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,680
Just go away!

626
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,960
Why are you banishing me?

627
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,930
You have a bright future awaiting.

628
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,420
I don’t want to ruin your life like this.

629
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,140
Namsom.

630
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,030
Namsom!

631
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,030
I’m sorry. Don’t go.

632
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,110
Let go of me.

633
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,360
I beg you.

634
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,600
Give me another chance.

635
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,610
Please Namsom.

636
00:46:59,130 --> 00:46:59,890
Namsom.

637
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:01,410
Namsom!

638
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,300
Gosh!

639
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,870
You should be more patient.

640
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,960
At least, just have a thought of Madam Aoi.

641
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,090
People will drag her into your problems.

642
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,450
You should pity her.

643
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,580
Say it to yourself.

644
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,980
I want to know if you still pity her

645
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,790
if you know about this.

646
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,230
What is it?

647
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,390
She’s trying to find a way

648
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,200
to split you and Krom.

649
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,360
What?

650
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,120
So.

651
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,010
Do you still pity her?

652
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:43,780
Madam Aoi.

653
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,620
This is such an important matter.

654
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,900
Why didn’t you talk to me first?

655
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,990
I didn’t tell you

656
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,510
because I want to know their condition

657
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,190
and review if it’s okay.

658
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,360
I don’t want you disappointed

659
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,760
if it doesn’t turn out as expected.

660
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,530
They don't allow me to date, do they?

661
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,180
It isn’t that serious.

662
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,980
I told them that

663
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,070
you only focus on work.

664
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,110
They’re so crazy about you.

665
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,360
Luckily,

666
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,280
that you and Krom are just dating.

667
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,450
You guys won’t be serious that much.

668
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,490
But I am!

669
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,850
I didn’t date with him for fun.

670
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,260
But he told me that it hasn’t that serious.

671
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,350
Wait. Is that what he said?

672
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,600
It’s his lifetime opportunity

673
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,160
to become the Prince of Asia.

674
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,410
I’ll manage it for you.

675
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,250
Yes.

676
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:55,440
Yes.

677
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,240
I told her that.

678
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,130
I’ll tell Madam Aoi to refuse this project

679
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:08,500
if they still insist to put this condition in the contract.

680
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,870
I’m already happy with my career at this point.

681
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:17,240
No. This is your lifetime opportunity.

682
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,760
Imagine what your fans will say.

683
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,490
They must be proud of you.

684
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,130
And Angun.

685
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,540
She must be so happy.

686
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,180
You must do as your promise.

687
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:42,930
How about you?

688
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,380
Fueang.

689
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,580
I’m going back to America soon.

690
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,590
You can find someone else

691
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:55,630
once you finish the contract.

692
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,320
No.

693
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,560
I want only you.

694
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,800
Fueang.

695
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,580
What? Wait.

696
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,820
Why do we have to fight about it?

697
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,670
I thought you had the same mind as me.

698
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,480
But we just met.

699
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:36,950
Here’s the thing.

700
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,440
You should sleep on it

701
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,810
if you really love me.

702
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,660
Once you figure it out

703
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,300
we’ll find the solution together.

704
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,760
But if you ensure that

705
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,130
you don’t want me.

706
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,740
I’ll let you go.

707
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,430
I'd never been in this kind of relationship before.

708
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,830
How can I know

709
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,080
that my feelings for him is love?

710
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,930
Do I really want to be with him?

711
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,590
Cheers!

712
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,910
Let’s drunk together.

713
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,240
Are you working in America?

714
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,640
Um. Yes.

715
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,920
Do they welcome Asian people like us?

716
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,010
I don’t see any problems?

717
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,770
We have many Asian officers there.

718
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,060
That’s good. I want to work there too.

719
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,710
Are you running away from your girl again?

720
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,790
This guy!

721
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,200
Thoo. Don’t sleep here.

722
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,640
I can’t carry you to the car.

723
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,530
It’s alright, Krom. He can sleep here.

724
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,330
Can you go home alone?

725
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,940
Yes.

726
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,780
You’re FueangNakhon’s manager.

727
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,990
Do you have to escort him everywhere?

728
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,550
Unlikely.

729
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,270
I had to go with him only when I was in need.

730
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,040
By the way.

731
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,890
My friend who met him before said

732
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,410
he was arrogant.

733
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,330
He refused to take any photos.

734
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:51,980
Are you sure?

735
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,380
I heard that he’s always friendly with his fans.

736
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,180
Those actors.

737
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,950
They’re all fake.

738
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,470
They’re also acting in real life

739
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,470
Right.

740
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,440
Those FuangNakhon’s fans.

741
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,640
They’re too crazy.

742
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,090
They’re over-exaggerate in whatever he did.

743
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:07,490
Right.

744
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,210
Talk about that clip.

745
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,530
Was he really a victim?

746
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:11,450
Oh.

747
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:12,940
He was surely not.

748
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,420
He must record it himself.

749
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,630
No. He really was a victim.

750
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,510
Let’s watch it again.

751
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:20,630
Hey, stop.

752
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,630
Send me too.

753
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,120
That’s the perfect angle.

754
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:29,730
He set it up!

755
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,130
Indeed!

756
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,380
He was an unknow actor

757
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,980
until this clip was leaked.

758
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,940
Boom!

759
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,630
He’ll upload more clips for sure

760
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,510
once his rating drops.

761
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,960
He doesn’t seem to have the positive thought, as he said.

762
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,360
So, what positives he has?

763
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,570
It must be…

764
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:49,970
His blood’s result!

765
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,330
Hey! Have you done talking?!

766
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,590
Did you know him enough

767
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,070
to criticize him?

768
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,640
It’s the people like you

769
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,330
who make social media full of disgusted comments!

770
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,170
Listen to me well.

771
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,610
If you think he's that bad,

772
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,780
you guys are even more evil!

773
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,940
You don’t have any rights

774
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,990
to judge someone that you don’t know!

775
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,310
Easy man.

776
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,360
and about go to other country

777
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,560
please no

778
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,690
they'll misunderstand

779
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,370
all Thais are the same

780
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,260
stupid like you all.

781
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:40,870
Thoo.

782
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,280
You don't have to invite me to meet bad friend anymore.

783
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,200
wasting my life.

784
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,760
Gosh!

785
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,790
Why did they have to frame him like that?

786
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,350
Did they get paid

787
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,480
from abusing someone?

788
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,560
All they did was post their own negative attitudes

789
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,280
toward others.

790
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,850
They didn’t even try to get to know him.

791
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,920
I’m not surprised that he faded himself

792
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,560
from social media.

793
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,570
Even if I wasn’t him, I still feel so terrible.

794
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,460
I can’t imagine

795
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,980
how much pain he suffered.

796
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,310
You poor man.

797
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:43,870
I want to hug him.

798
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,640
Hi Krom.

799
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,640
I miss you.

800
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,330
What an odd? Why’re you so sweet?

801
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:56,180
That’s not odd. I’m your boyfriend.

802
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,580
Wow. You make me feel refreshed.

803
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,900
Can you be this sweet forever?

804
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,950
Okay.

805
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:06,480
I’ll always be beside you.

806
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,600
Pour you with sweet words.

807
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,010
Fueang.

808
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,500
Yes, baby.

809
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,340
I love you.

810
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:28,200
Say it to me again in thirty minutes.

811
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,010
See you soon.

812
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,100
Well. Do you have something to tell me?

813
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,360
The most unexpected thing in my life is

814
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,650
The fact that I love him so much,

815
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:18,090
although we've spent a short time together.

816
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,420
You must accept that project.

817
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,070
I want to see my loved one go as far as he can.

818
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,400
How about us?

819
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,530
I made a decision.

820
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,700
We'll keep it secret.

821
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,530
I love you.

822
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,780
I love you too.

823
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:32,990
Good news. All of my events today were canceled.

824
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,640
I’ll stay with you all day.

825
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,000
Let’s buy all.

826
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,290
What’re you doing?

827
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:42,210
Nothing. See you later.

828
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,740
Like I said. They are now talking about Fueang and Krom.

829
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,420
They’re his fans.

830
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,710
There’s nothing to worry about.

831
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:50,590
Next scene.

832
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,870
You have to shoot with Cheesecake.

833
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:53,070
They want a real kiss.

834
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,720
I’m afraid that you might be upset

835
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,320
after you know the news.

836
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,200
So?

837
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,370
So, I decided

838
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,850
to play that that scene with you first.
