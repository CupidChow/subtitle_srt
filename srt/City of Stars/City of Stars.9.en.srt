1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,680
I still work in Thailand.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,800
But it may be less than before

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,400
as I have to work abroad, too

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,920
There’s a rumor about you and him.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,760
Are you guys dating?

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,320
It’s just a rumor.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,920
They’re not dating.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,880
Krom is cute. I want to know him.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,640
He has taken already.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,880
I want one night with him.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,600
I’ll give him a ride.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,480
Are you all right? You're so drunk

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,840
Don’t worry. I’ll take him home.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,120
Didn’t they say

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,000
FueangNakhon is a good guy

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
who doesn’t like clubbing?

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,000
He came to pick up his partner.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,320
Partner?

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,240
After I challenged myself with those strong drinks,

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,000
I was knocked for a full day.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,120
By the time my consciousness returned,

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,080
it was the afternoon of the next day.

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,200
Who is that?

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,160
My phone must run out of battery long ago.

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,120
Out of battery.

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,600
I have no idea what happened

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,320
with him during this time.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,920
What were you doing?

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,720
Why didn’t you accept my calls or answer the chat?

30
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,080
I was showering.

31
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,160
Is there something wrong?

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,000
Fueang needs your support.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,360
He needs my support… What happened?

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,160
Aw. Where are you going?

35
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:28,560
You should know better that it was a risk!

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,120
It’d cause you problems.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,640
What made you do that?

38
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,320
Why?!

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,160
But he was so drunk!

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,160
You could send someone else there.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,040
Anyone but you!

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
You have many people

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,840
who could help you whenever you want.

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,720
Did I cause him trouble?

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,840
Aw. You didn’t know anything?

46
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,760
About what?

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,960
A good villain actor has gone bad.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,160
He ran off the set for the man

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,640
who fakes to be his manager.

50
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
Hey!

51
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,000
I never ran off the set, as they said.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,960
I knew you didn’t.

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,760
That’s more like Kor.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,240
Aw! Hey!

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,840
I didn’t do anything.

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,520
Why do you drag me to this?

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
Hello.

58
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,640
Hello.

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,040
He seems to need some support.

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
I’m sorry for causing this trouble.

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
It’s alright. Don’t worry.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,280
It was not your fault.

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,960
It was his!

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,520
He made a mistake even if he knew what’d happen!

65
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,240
This is unexpected!

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,840
I can't imagine Fueang getting scolded, too.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
He just came to pick me up.

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,000
Does it have to be that issue?

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,320
Yes, it is!

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,440
He wasn’t a guy who liked clubbing.

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,720
And he never went out to see someone late at night!

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,680
They said someone in our business was there too.

73
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,920
Didn’t they say

74
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,680
FueangNakhon is a good guy

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,920
who doesn’t like clubbing?

76
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,240
He came to pick up

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,920
his partner.

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,480
It must be them who split about this!

79
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,440
Fueang.

80
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,440
Is it going to cause you problems?

81
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
No. I’ll manage it like the others.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
The FueangxNavy hashtag is now number 1 on-trend.

83
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,280
FueangxNavy?

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,960
Interesting.

85
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,320
What are they saying?

86
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,159
It’s a Fifty-fifty of likes and dislikes.

87
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,840
Most of the worst comments are from the Dream Fan Page.

88
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,440
Dream Fan Page? Who are they?

89
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,360
They posted a photo of Krom wiping Kor’s face earlier.

90
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,000
These people are KorFueang’s fans

91
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,920
who are always anti if their idol dated someone.

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,560
Like Namsom.

93
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,760
They attacked Krom with many hate comments

94
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,560
They’re also digging up about him as well.

95
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,400
Wait! Did they really do that?

96
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,840
Yes. This problem is bigger than you think.

97
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,080
Krom.

98
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,159
I’m warning you.

99
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,760
Don’t read those comments or you'll regret it.

100
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Is it that serious?

101
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,200
It can't be that bad.

102
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,680
Now I know.

103
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
Kor

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
wasn't exaggerating.

105
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,480
Hey! It is started!

106
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,080
- Really?
- Yes!

107
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,000
#BrokenDream

108
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
Are you Fueang’s fan?

109
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,200
You too?

110
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Here they are! Fueang is their presenter!

111
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,800
He's so cute!

112
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
I’ll take this cushion.

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
I want this one.

114
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,160
Take them before they’re finished!

115
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,920
This one too!

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Which fandom are you from?

117
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,400
KorFueang.

118
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,840
Good. Me too!

119
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,800
You came here…

120
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,320
to spy about Fueang and Krom, didn’t you?

121
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,080
Do you know anything?

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,200
You can tell us.

123
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,480
It’s the inside information.

124
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,440
I can’t wait to hear it!

125
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,920
Well, Fueang and Krom…

126
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,640
They're not dating.

127
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Because Krom has dated someone else.

128
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,640
Who is that?

129
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,760
Right.

130
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,520
Hello, Kung.

131
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,720
Hello.

132
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,880
Speaking of the devil!

133
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,480
Here he is—Krom’s lover, Thoo.

134
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,080
Hold on… He didn’t allow you to take pictures.

135
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,600
Don't you know PDPA?

136
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,440
It’ll be against the Law of Privacy Violation.

137
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,120
You can share this information with others.

138
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
Okay?

139
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,200
Okay.

140
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,360
Great!

141
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,360
I did well, right?

142
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
I fixed it for you.

143
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,920
Fixed what?

144
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,000
Aw. Don’t be too shy!

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,720
I know it hurts

146
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,800
when your man has a rumor with someone else!

147
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,560
who is flawless in every way, like Fueang.

148
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
What are you talking about? Who is my man?

149
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,880
This boy! Come on!

150
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I already knew it. Stop pretending!

151
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,440
I saw Krom…

152
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,160
took those… condoms

153
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,600
to use with someone here!

154
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,320
Hey!

155
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,360
Do you think that Krom and I are dating?

156
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,120
Aw.

157
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,840
That’s crazy! Krom is dating Fueang!

158
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,680
Aoy! No way! That’s impossible!

159
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,280
It is.

160
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
It isn’t!

161
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,760
It is!

162
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,440
It…

163
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,720
Tell me who.

164
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
I want to meet that person.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
I’m dating a guy you knew.

166
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,760
I want to talk to you about tomorrow’s scene.

167
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
Wait! That day…

168
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,920
Thoo! Hide!

169
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,120
Kromatha is dating this man. Confirmed by the insider.

170
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,520
He was at Krom's parent’s store. They must know about their relationship.

171
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,160
His parents must prefer him to date Fueang so their store would become famous.

172
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,440
This is crazy!

173
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,240
I know.

174
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,520
How are you, darling?

175
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,000
I’m okay. How about you?

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,480
How's your work?

177
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,200
They kept asking me about us.

178
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,760
What did you do?

179
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,080
Madam Aoi prohibits me from saying anything.

180
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,680
Just avoid them.

181
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,880
Are you worried

182
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,640
about those nasty comments about you?

183
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
I’m not.

184
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
Really? Are you trying to comfort me?

185
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,800
Yes. But I’m alright.

186
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,480
You can talk to me about anything.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,800
I know.

188
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,320
Okay.

189
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,000
Goodnight.

190
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,680
Goodnight.

191
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,400
I answered him that.

192
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,560
But I still have a nightmare about it.

193
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,680
It could be caused by stress

194
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,960
I got from those negative comments about my parents.

195
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,400
This is for your son!

196
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,560
Shut down your store!

197
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,440
Go away!

198
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,160
Krom.

199
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
You’re late. Wake up!

200
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,200
Krom.

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,800
Krom.

202
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,920
Honey. Why did you wake up so late?

203
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,480
I just slept a few hours ago.

204
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,200
What took you to sleep that late?

205
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,160
Was it about Fueang?

206
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,120
How do you know?

207
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,520
Kung told us.

208
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,840
You should avoid using social media

209
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,680
if it’s toxic to your mental health.

210
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,280
I know.

211
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,640
I took a break from it.

212
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,640
But they keep sticking in my head.

213
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,440
I’m going to work at Minimart.

214
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,920
I need some distractions.

215
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,240
Don’t worry too much.

216
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,080
We always support you no matter what.

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,600
Cheer up!

218
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,080
Okay.

219
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,560
Go take a shower

220
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,080
and come down to eat.

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,400
I made boiled rice and your favorite Chinese sausage for you.

222
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,880
Okay.

223
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,720
Come on.

224
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,320
Let’s go.

225
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,040
We'll wait for you downstairs.

226
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,720
You said Fueang is single.

227
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,960
Then what is this? We’re so disappointed!

228
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,880
But he really is.

229
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,480
This is just a rumor.

230
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,600
I don’t buy it.

231
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,120
You can rip up this contract

232
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,640
if you can’t clear this issue!

233
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,200
Ah..

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Alright.

235
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,040
Madam Aoi. He’s here.

236
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,400
What do you want to talk to me?

237
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,960
You must clear yourself in the interview tomorrow.

238
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,400
So chaotics!

239
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,240
I thought

240
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,359
Fueang wanted to join the military.

241
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,319
I was so stunned.

242
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,800
Military… Why?

243
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, people on social media kept talking about the Navy.

244
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,440
So, I mistook it that he wanted to be a Navy officer.

245
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,120
Krom.

246
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,400
Are you mad at me

247
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,880
for making people misunderstand

248
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,760
that Thoo and you are dating?

249
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,280
No. I’m not mad at you.

251
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,760
Don’t worry. I’ll get over it.

252
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,960
Let me keep this stuff.

253
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,800
Well. This minimart belongs to the parent of FueangNakhon’s lover.

254
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,160
I saw comments in #BrokenDream that said

255
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,160
his parents

256
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
like to discriminate against others.

257
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,720
Then why did you bring me here?

258
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,040
I want to know if this place is worth to come.

259
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,400
Well, now we know that it’s not.

260
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,960
I think so.

261
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Their son is so arrogant.

262
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,120
His parents can't be different.

263
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,920
Are you finding something?

264
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Is it mouthwash? You seem to need it.

265
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,080
No. We already had one.

266
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
You should use it though.

267
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,680
Where is he?

268
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,400
Kung.

269
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,960
Krom.

270
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,320
#N/A

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
Why did they have to insult my parents?

272
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,600
It’s okay if they blamed me alone.

273
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,320
But is it my fault that I’m dating Fueang?

274
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,960
No.

275
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,080
It’s not your fault.

276
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,960
Listen.

277
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Not everyone has such a bad attitude.

278
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,960
Here.

279
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,960
Fueang’s fan just visited our store recently.

280
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,400
She wanted to give this to you.

281
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,280
There are many good ones out there. Open it.

282
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,120
Please be strong. Cheer up!

283
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
From FuangNakhon's fans.

284
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,360
See?

285
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,640
Please be strong. Cheer up!

286
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,040
Kung!

287
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,240
I’m sorry!

288
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,760
Kung!

289
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,600
Krom.

290
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,240
Where are they?

291
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,520
Right.

292
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,400
Aw. Fueang.

293
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
Do you come to see Krom?

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
Yes, I do.

295
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,120
But.

296
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
I want to talk to you too.

297
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,440
Do you want to talk to us?

298
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,040
Yes.

299
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,760
I want to say sorry

300
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,760
that I brought the issues to you.

301
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,320
It’s alright.

302
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,880
People will forget it soon

303
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,560
when they have a new drama.

304
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,160
There is something else.

305
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
My agent told me

306
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,160
to refuse about my relationship with Krom.

307
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
I think it’s the best way

308
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,560
that I can do for him.

309
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,600
He’s so pitiful.

310
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,560
But if you think

311
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
it'll make him feel I don't respect him.

312
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,440
I won't do it.

313
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,760
What do you think?

314
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,680
We don’t have any problems with that.

315
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,680
I hope you're aware that

316
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,120
you must lie to people.

317
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,800
What would you do

318
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,760
if they knew the truth?

319
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,120
You had to retire from your career.

320
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,680
But you can join our family’s business!

321
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,120
That sounds good.

322
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,880
Ahh! Right!

323
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,280
Krom would love to work here in Thailand.

324
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,960
I’ll change the name of our store to be…

325
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
To be what?

326
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,560
FueangxNavy Minimart!

327
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,040
What kind of name is that?

328
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,600
It’s too long, honey.

329
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,600
FN for FueangNakhon

330
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,400
and K for Krom.

331
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,160
How about FNK Minimart?

332
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,160
Great!

333
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,960
Thank you for your understanding.

334
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,480
Anyway, this doesn’t mean

335
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,920
that we support you to lie.

336
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,840
But our world

337
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,360
isn’t always black and white.

338
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
If lying is the best way out and won’t hurt anyone,

339
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,240
then it's okay to lie.

340
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,840
But you can’t lie to me.

341
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,960
I won’t.

342
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,160
Aw.

343
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,280
Fueang.

344
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,320
What’s going on?

345
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,960
What did you talk to them?

346
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,400
I asked for their advice

347
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,280
about tomorrow's interview.

348
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,520
Which I decided to refuse about our relationship.

349
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,400
You knew that I never wanted to do that.

350
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Yes. I know.

351
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,000
Don’t worry about me. I’m okay with it.

352
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,640
Kung gave this to me. It was from our fans.

353
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,280
Please be strong. Cheer up.

354
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,800
Please be strong. Cheer up.

355
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,320
Very cute.

356
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,000
Right. They’re so lovely.

357
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,520
You must try to do that.

358
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,720
Be strong.

359
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,000
Everything will be alright.

360
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,400
I promise.

361
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,960
You don’t need to promise me.

362
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,880
I know you can do it.

363
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,720
Let’s have dinner together.

364
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,600
I’ll make something nice for you.

365
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,720
Wait. I remember that

366
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,160
your mom said you can’t cook.

367
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,760
Hey! I’ve spent time in America alone for a while.

368
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,720
Shouldn’t I be good at one or two now?

369
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
So, what do you want to eat?

370
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,440
How about steak? Can you make it?

371
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,120
Sure.

372
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,400
I’ll do my best!

373
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,040
I don’t know what else you will encounter tomorrow.

374
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
Let me cheer you up with this.

375
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,800
Go take a shower

376
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,080
and wait for a nice meal.

377
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Okay.

378
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,640
See you soon.

379
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,360
Krom.

380
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,280
Oh. Fueang.

381
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,120
How is it?

382
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,280
Wow.

383
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,600
Are they nice?

384
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,600
Very much.

385
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,600
Have a seat.

386
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,760
Here.

387
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,240
I’d ask you to cook for me

388
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,600
if you told me earlier.

389
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,800
Try it.

390
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,280
Medium rare.

391
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,760
This is perfect!

392
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,560
If I didn’t know that you cook it

393
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,240
I’d think that your mom made this.

394
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,760
Krom.

395
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,040
Oh.

396
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,720
What do you think?

397
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,120
It’s a little overcooked.

398
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,640
Hmm?

399
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,840
Come here.

400
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Let me help you on this.

401
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,720
Come on.

402
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,200
Isn’t it okay?

403
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,040
You can serve him.

404
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,200
Thank you.

405
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,360
I’ll bring it to him.

406
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,880
What’s wrong?

407
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,000
Are you okay?

408
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,040
I’m okay. It’s alright.

409
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,640
Alright.

410
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,680
It’ll be tastier when you eat with sauce.

411
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Let see.

412
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Go on.

413
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,240
Hmm! Perfect! So delicious!

414
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
It tastes

415
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,760
exactly like your mother made it.

416
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,080
Good job!

417
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,480
This is splendid!

418
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,680
Right…?

419
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,560
Like mother, like son.

420
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,920
I can feel the smell of…

421
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,440
Of…

422
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,560
Olive oil. So intense.

423
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,520
How do you know that I like it?

424
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,240
I asked my mother.

425
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,840
Your mother.

426
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,720
Um.

427
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,880
But I never told her before.

428
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,960
How did she know?

429
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,680
She has a good guess.

430
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,560
Good guess?

431
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,400
Yes!

432
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,640
But I’m allergic to it.

433
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,920
Are you allergic to Olive oil?

434
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,440
Alright. I give up!

435
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,760
The truth is…

436
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,000
I wasn’t the one who made these.

437
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,640
It was my mother.

438
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,600
Krom.

439
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,760
Don’t be that serious.

440
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,200
I can eat anything

441
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
that you cook for me.

442
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,880
Are you sure?

443
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,960
Of course.

444
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,840
It’ll give me more energy for tomorrow.

445
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,680
What is it?

446
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,000
I need to take a break

447
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,640
for the dessert.

448
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,080
We never know what will happen tomorrow.

449
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,800
Please be strong.

450
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,240
I’m right here to support you.

451
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Thank you.

452
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,000
Krom.

453
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,800
Hold on.

454
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,840
Hey. Stop.

455
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,920
Boosting kisses.

456
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,080
Enough.

457
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,360
Don’t you like it?

458
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,080
I do.

459
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,360
Koradit. The set is ready.

460
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,440
Is it starting?

461
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,800
It’s almost time.

462
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,400
Can you give me ten minutes?

463
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I need to do something.

464
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,800
It won’t be long.

465
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,160
Let me see.

466
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,000
Hey. There he comes!

467
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,960
Over here, Fueang.

468
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,040
Please stand here.

469
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,760
Hello Fueang.

470
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,679
Hello.

471
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,199
Hi Fueang.

472
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,040
How was your event today?

473
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,080
First of all, I want to thank you, Bravo BKK,

474
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,480
for inviting me to join Lucky Dragon 2024.

475
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,960
I want to ask you.

476
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,920
Is it true

477
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,000
that you hung out with your manager late at night?

478
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,560
I know.

479
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,960
It’s true.

480
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
He was so drunk that day.

481
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,760
I was afraid he might be at risk

482
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,199
If I let him go home alone.

483
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh.

484
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,400
Is he just your manager?

485
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,040
As I said before.

486
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,639
He is a friend

487
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,320
of mine and Kor’s.

488
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,199
I asked him to help me

489
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,840
while Sand

490
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,800
was preoccupied.

491
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,800
Why did you choose him?

492
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,200
We heard that

493
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,080
it’s difficult for you to trust someone.

494
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Yes. You are right.

495
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
But I trust him.

496
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,960
You’ve just known him recently.

497
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,640
You posted about him not long ago.

498
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,400
Isn’t it too soon to trust someone?

499
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,640
That’s right.

500
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,600
Right.

501
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,400
Please answer.

502
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,680
Is he just a friend?

503
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,680
Am I trusting him too soon?

504
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,240
I think.

505
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,120
No one can define that

506
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,360
except ourselves.

507
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,800
Yes! Beat them!

508
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,440
By the way,

509
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,000
can you confirm

510
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,880
that you

511
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,720
aren’t dating him?

512
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,160
- Yes.
- Right.

513
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,680
Your fans are waiting for the answer.

514
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,880
Please tell us.

515
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,040
What will you say?

516
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,520
I know.

517
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,840
No.

518
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,440
I’m not dating him.

519
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,040
They’re gossiping that Cheesecake is crushing on you.

520
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,400
Many people are matching both of you now.

521
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,960
She’s just my lovely sister.

522
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,320
Hmm? Do you think of her that way?

523
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,920
They want you to date her, though.

524
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,040
Is there any possibility to enhance your relationship with her?

525
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,920
- Right.
- Will you?

526
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,160
It is good for us

527
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
to maintain this status.

528
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,920
You don’t want to give her a chance

529
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,000
because you don’t date women, do you?

530
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,520
Is it true?

531
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,040
I know this reporter.

532
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
She works with Cee.

533
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,720
Cee? Is he the owner of that page

534
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,280
who is attacking Fueang and Krom right now?

535
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,080
Indeed!

536
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,000
Shit!

537
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,360
Excuse me, guys.

538
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,200
We need to end this interview now.

539
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,040
We want the answer.

540
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,920
Do you like men or women?

541
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,560
Your fans want to know it too.

542
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,000
My fans love me

543
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,200
because of my performance.

544
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,360
They don’t mind

545
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,000
about this stuff.

546
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,480
The rumor between Kromatha and you

547
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,800
makes Cheesecake’s and your fans curious

548
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,640
if you prefer

549
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,240
to date men.

550
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,960
They need a more concrete answer.

551
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,840
- Please answer.
- We need the answer.

552
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,400
Say something, please.

553
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
Excuse me.

554
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,760
We really have to go.

555
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,720
He is too tired.

556
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:18,880
Let’s go.

557
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,760
You don’t want to answer it

558
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,320
because you’re afraid to lose your fanbase,

559
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,200
and it’ll affect your big project.

560
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,240
Yes.

561
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,440
He likes women.

562
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,680
Okay?

563
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,480
Come on.

564
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,960
Excuse us. He needs to rest.

565
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,080
Do you know a guy named Sarut?

566
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,320
- Which Sarut?
- Who’s that?

567
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,560
Mr. Sarut said.

568
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,600
He was sorry

569
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,480
to make you fail your admission test.

570
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,160
Is he your friend?

571
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,360
Who is he?

572
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,320
Why don't you answer it?

573
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,920
We have to go.

574
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Excuse us.

575
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,800
They're trying to paint him!

576
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,640
Who is Sarut?

577
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,800
I don’t know.

578
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,800
How is it? Did you talk to Fueang?

579
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,080
Not yet.

580
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,440
Call him.

581
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,280
Are you alright?

582
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,920
Let’s get inside.

583
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,680
Is everything okay?

584
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,800
Tell me. Who is Sarut?

585
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Kor is coming.

586
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,680
Can we wait for him first?

587
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,320
But…

588
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,080
Please. I want to say it all at once.

589
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,680
I'm so headache!

590
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
Well.

591
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,320
I’m sorry that I answered that question for you.

592
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,800
That’s alright.

593
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
They wouldn’t stop asking about it,

594
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,240
no matter what.

595
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,560
Don’t blame yourself.

596
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,280
Madam Aoi.

597
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,360
I want to talk to Krom privately

598
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,400
while waiting for Kor.

599
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,680
Um. Okay. Sure.

600
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,280
Do you want to know who is Sarut?

601
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,000
Yes.

602
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,600
He was my ex.

603
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,600
Fueang.

604
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,760
What are you doing here?

605
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,720
I’m studying.

606
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,320
Let’s play football together.

607
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,600
Let’s go.

608
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,680
Our exam is coming. You’d prepare for it.

609
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,280
Come on. I’ll lend you my guitar.

610
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,360
You said it.

611
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,440
Yes.

612
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,880
You suck!

613
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,800
Dude!

614
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Let’s go study after this.

615
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,560
You must teach me.

616
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,600
That reporter.

617
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,840
She probably talked to my high school friends

618
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,600
and they might suggest she talk to Sarut.

619
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,000
We were so close

620
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,720
He was my lover.

621
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,760
No one knows about it.

622
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,640
We’ve kept this

623
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,920
between us.

624
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,440
You know what?

625
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,600
I’m not even telling Kor

626
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,360
during all this time.

627
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,760
He betrays me.

628
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,920
Fueang.

629
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,560
Why would he do that?

630
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,720
I have no idea.

631
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,120
They might pay him well

632
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,760
or he probably hates me.

633
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,720
It’s alright.

634
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,920
I’m here with you.

635
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,280
Don’t worry.

636
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,720
We’ll go through it together.

637
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,720
He used to be his lover.

638
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,680
I could feel his pain when he talked about him.

639
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,360
How could he betray him

640
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,240
for money?

641
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,840
He wasn’t worth Fueang at all.

642
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,360
Fueang.

643
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,400
Who the hell is he?

644
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,160
He was my high school friend.

645
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,760
We were dating secretly.

646
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,960
No one knows about it.

647
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,320
It must be him who disclosed it.

648
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,120
They must pay him for that!

649
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,200
Kor.

650
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,040
Calm down.

651
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,200
He’s trying to ruin Fueang’s life!

652
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,640
How can I calm myself down?

653
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,720
What about the admission test?

654
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,720
I always did well in my studies

655
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,000
to enter the university that I desired.

656
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,080
But…

657
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,960
He broke up with me during my test.

658
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,400
Why?

659
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,400
He said he was bored.

660
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,600
He wanted to get back to date women.

661
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,920
I’m sorry.

662
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,600
For what?

663
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,440
We should just be friends.

664
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,960
Are you sure about this?

665
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yes.

666
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,200
I’m so sorry.

667
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,200
See you.

668
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,880
I was lost at that time.

669
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,760
He made me know about my sexuality

670
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,600
and then he left me.

671
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,760
He said he didn’t enjoy me anymore.

672
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,480
I couldn’t get myself together,

673
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,480
and it caused me to fail the test.

674
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,080
My mom has always been curious

675
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,560
about why I couldn’t enter that University.

676
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,840
Did you have sex with him?

677
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,400
I didn’t want to intrude.

678
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,880
But he must tell that reporter, too.

679
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,160
We must prepare for every circumstance.

680
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,680
So…

681
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,440
Krom.

682
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,120
Close your ears.

683
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,080
You shouldn’t listen to this.

684
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,520
Shut your ears. The adults are talking.

685
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,640
So?

686
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,000
You can tell us now.

687
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,840
Well…

688
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,560
We were at the first step.

689
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,440
First step!

690
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,840
Wait.

691
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,080
We didn’t reach that step yet.

692
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,960
Was there something else?

693
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,680
As I remember…

694
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,200
We recorded it.

695
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,520
- Huh! There’s a clip!
- Huh! There’s a clip!

696
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,720
What are you doing?

697
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,480
I want to record our moment.

698
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,120
Is that alright?

699
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,840
Yes. We can watch it together.

700
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,720
You brought me another headache!

701
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,520
What the hell did you do?

702
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,000
Come on. He wouldn’t do that

703
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,520
if he knew he'd became famous.

704
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,200
What should we do?

705
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,440
There's a clip!

706
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,880
It can be the evidence.

707
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,200
What do you want me to do?

708
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,640
Don’t you see how hopeless I am?

709
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
Just calm down.

710
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,000
Don’t panic, guys.

711
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,640
It’s been over ten years already.

712
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,960
He might not have it now.

713
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,560
I transferred you the balance.

714
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,120
Thanks.

715
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,800
How about that clip?

716
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,640
It’s in my old broekn phone.

717
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,960
I didn’t use it for a while.

718
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,600
Just give me some time.

719
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,680
Don’t forget it.

720
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,160
Okay.

721
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,920
See you later.

722
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,840
Who is Sarut?

723
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,440
The Sarut hash is number one in the trend since last night.

724
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,040
I don't want to say anything.

725
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,400
Let's hear it from him.

726
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,440
Fueang will have a press conference soon.

727
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,720
You'll be screwed if you confess that you like men.

728
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,960
Come on. Let's support our FueangNakhon.

729
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,360
I feel so guilt.

730
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,960
Everything happened because

731
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,480
I drunk that day.

732
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,240
Please don't blame yourself.

733
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,680
Okay.

734
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,360
Alright.

735
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,000
I won't do that.

736
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,680
I'll always be beside you

737
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,560
to support you

738
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,680
as much as I can.
