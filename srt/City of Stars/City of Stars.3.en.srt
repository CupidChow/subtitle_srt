1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,080
Sand. What happened to your face?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,640
Come in.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,960
So we can talk about today’s schedule.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,240
I better wait outside.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
She told me

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,200
that he’ll come with you.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,840
Please take care of Fueang, sir.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,960
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,120
The bomb!

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,360
You didn’t need to call an ambulance.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,960
I’m so worried about you.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,680
What kind of person do you like?

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,440
Can I be that one?

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,680
Why do you ask me?

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,120
You don’t know?

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,800
Fueang.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,440
Please let me know anytime you want a companion.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,800
I’ll go with you.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,440
So you really like my world now.

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,800
Um. I like it. It's fun.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,360
Your fans are lovely too.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,120
That what I want you to see

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,280
with you own eyes

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,920
that my world is not that scary.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,760
I’m not scare. I kinda like it.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,600
What about what you said to me earlier?

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,920
Something that I don’t know

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,160
and what my type is.

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,120
What did you want to say?

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
Can I ask you something?

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,760
What is it?

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,880
If you like my world

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,800
do you like me too?

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,800
You’re shaking.

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,640
Aw! Why’re you quiet?

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll tell you what you want, but you must answer me first.

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,800
Do you like me?

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,320
What I mean,

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,760
if you like me as a celebrity

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,440
I'll bring you to other events as my companion.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,680
Yes,

42
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,480
I like a hardworking man like you.

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,040
About the one you like,

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,960
once I see someone who meets your type,

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,040
I will recommend you.

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I don’t have a type.

47
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,880
But I'll know if I find one.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,520
As I said, I admire how he handles his work professionally.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,680
If I must be someone’s fan,

50
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,680
I’ll choose to be FueangNakhon’s fan.

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,079
Thank you so much for today.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,120
Yes,

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,080
Good night.

54
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,320
Good night.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,280
I couldn’t believe that only a few days after this

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,560
my feelings

57
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
for the man who names FueangNakhon

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,640
would be changed

59
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,640
Get well soon.

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Do you wake up?

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Not yet.

62
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,240
Am I disturbing you?

63
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,800
I have a lot more time to sleep.

64
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Do you know where I can get soymilk?

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
Last night, I watched the clip of how it was made.

66
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,360
Wanna eat it badly.

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,920
I do.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,320
Come to my house.

69
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,800
I have the best one.

70
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,360
Hurry.

71
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,680
Where is my best soymilk?

72
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,680
Krom. Come here.

73
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,520
Oops! Sorry for intruding.

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,760
I thought you were alone.

75
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Don't worry. They’re my people.

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,760
Come on.

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
So sorry.

78
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,560
Dam it! That A.N.E company still hasn’t paid us yet!

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,960
Was it my job?

80
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,480
Yes!

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,080
Didn’t I keep warning you

82
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880
to read the contract carefully?

83
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,600
What are you going to do now?

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,680
I sent them a notice

85
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,800
that we will sue them if they don’t pay us

86
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,640
within 30 days.

87
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,680
Tomorrow is the due date.

88
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,520
Sand.

89
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,000
You don’t have to do that.

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,680
It’s not an enormous amount.

91
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,440
We have to! You didn’t work for free.

92
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,920
Don’t let them cheat us.

93
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,120
If they can do this with a superstar like you,

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,200
they will do it to others, either.

95
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,920
Those bloodsuckers must confront people like us!

96
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Well,

97
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,920
I heard their CEO will leave the country today.

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,080
Sand!

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,280
You go to their company.

100
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,280
Let them pay you today, or we’ll sue them!

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,640
Got it!

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,720
But… Eh!

103
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,480
Then who’s going to take care of you?

104
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,760
I have a tight schedule today.

105
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,920
I’m not available, too.

106
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,800
There’s a meeting with Mr. Nishino tomorrow.

107
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,040
We have to discuss Kor’s contract.

108
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,880
Krom can go with him.

109
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,800
Oh! You're right.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We shouldn't. It’s too harsh.

111
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,760
Right. They’re chaos.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
There is so much work to deal with.

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,680
Unlike that day before.

114
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,360
I can go with him!

115
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,840
Excellent, Krom!

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,280
You must prove to them

117
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
that Fueang chose the right one.

118
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,000
I mean, for being his temporary manager.

119
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes, sir!

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,640
Of course.

121
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,200
So, now we’ve all agreed that Krom will go with me.

122
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,600
Let me get my stuff.

123
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
We're going to the fitness.

124
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,960
Kor, you’d better get ready.

125
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,840
I don’t want to get a call that you’re late again.

126
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,360
Yes, sir!

127
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
- You're always late.
- You’re such a nagging mom!

128
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
What's wrong with people in this house?

129
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,920
Including me?

130
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,040
Yes!

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,400
But my house is over there…

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
Are you sure that you want to go with Fueang?

133
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,960
Yes,

134
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
Then, let me ask you.

135
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,600
If his first job hasn’t been done yet

136
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,920
but he needs to leave for the next one,

137
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,800
what will you do?

138
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,880
If it’s already over the agreed time,

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,680
I have the right to get him out.

140
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,320
It’s normal in Thai society that they’ll expect a more flexible schedule.

141
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,520
Um… But that is not an excuse if it causes damage to other people.

142
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,960
Let’s stop being too much compromise

143
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,919
I think it's time for Thai society

144
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,840
to stop being used to that word

145
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
and be more respectful of others.

146
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,000
Great answer, You're pass!

147
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,080
His schedule today will begin at 11 a.m. to noon.

148
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,560
It's a showcase at the Ministry.

149
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,440
From 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

150
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,960
He’ll need to attend Dripping & Chitchat with Juju

151
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,520
That's all? Not much as you said.

152
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,520
I didn’t talk about quantity, but it’s about time management.

153
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,840
From our experience,

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,040
all the government’s events need a high flexibility

155
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,440
which can damage other schedules.

156
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,880
I’ll never let my boy,

157
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,960
your Fueang

158
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,600
be late on Juju’s show.

159
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,560
Not even a second.

160
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,400
Why?

161
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,160
This talk show is such a well-known programme

162
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,320
on how they nag their attendances

163
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,040
and they are so savage.

164
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,200
You may be surprised why it looks dark today.

165
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,800
since you couldn’t make it in time as we planned.

166
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,000
Didn’t you have a clock at home?

167
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
and what is that outfit?

168
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Jeez!

169
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
So overdressed!

170
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,560
Oh My God.

171
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,440
What I hate the most

172
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,280
are fake people.

173
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,440
They’ll act like an angel with the fans

174
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,640
but gossip about them behind.

175
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,120
Oops! I didn't mean you at all.

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
I’m just telling you what I hate.

177
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,920
Well… From what I heard

178
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,640
they said that you are…

179
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,440
a disciplined actor.

180
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,320
Wasn’t it a bullshit?

181
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,560
If it wasn’t because

182
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,920
he gave me a chance in this industry in the past 20 years ago

183
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,640
I’ll never ever allow my baby

184
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,280
to attend his show.

185
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,600
Do you know why?

186
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,720
Someone told me that

187
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,280
he’s targeting my baby Fueang.

188
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,160
And it’s not by a good reason.

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,080
So.

190
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
It is your vital duty today

191
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,040
Don't let him be late. Not even a second

192
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
or you’ll be eaten up alive.

193
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,080
Yes,

194
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,800
Are you going to work?

195
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,120
How about Madam Aoi and Sand?

196
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,560
They are gone.

197
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,720
It's going to be tough today.

198
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,880
If he does something that irritates you

199
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,400
just be endure.

200
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,280
What is he talking about?

201
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,440
FueangNakhon Phakdeetrairat

202
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,480
Villian on screen and a hero off-screen.

203
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
We shall see if you are a real

204
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,040
or fake one.

205
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,120
The most handsome guy is coming to our studio

206
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,440
I'm dressed up for you… Kiss Kiss.

207
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,840
Krom. You can do it.

208
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,960
Let’s go!

209
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,760
Fueang. I think we should go now.

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,160
It’s running late.

211
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,800
Hold on. I’m not finished yet.

212
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,080
I already checked. It’s only ten minutes from here.

213
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,520
Let me go to Minimart first.

214
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,640
I want to get you some food.

215
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,120
What happens?

216
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,240
It must be that soymilk.

217
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,080
Let me go to the restroom.

218
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,480
Yes,

219
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,880
Fueang!

220
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,000
It’s really you!

221
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,440
Can we take pictures?

222
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,920
Picture…. Sure.

223
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,520
Of course.

224
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,800
Okay.

225
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,120
- Thank you.
- Hold on! It’s not a good one. Can we take more pictures?

226
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Just a second.

227
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Krom. Help me hold these.

228
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,240
Yes,

229
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,040
Okay.

230
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,800
You guys keep posting.

231
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,520
- Let me do a capture.
- Okay.

232
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,680
Ready?

233
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,800
That should be okay now.

234
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,120
I took many shots.

235
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
Choose the ones you like.

236
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,200
You guys look pretty to me in every photo

237
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,160
if you ask me.

238
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,440
Goodbye.

239
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,640
Ayyy!

240
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,880
He said I'm pretty.

241
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm blushing!

242
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,600
Whoa!

243
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,840
Add them to my bill, please. I’ll pay it later.

244
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,840
That's a sure thing.

245
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,200
Hold on. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

246
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,080
Why do you buy a lot?

247
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,800
This is normal.

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
No, it's far from normal.

249
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,560
Who are you buying for?

250
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,640
Well. These are for Thoo.

251
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,360
Thoo again. So, lame.

252
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,000
How come?

253
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,920
Are you sure these are for Thoo?

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Um.

255
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,520
Alright. He’s cute, too.

256
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,840
Cute?

257
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,280
Um.

258
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,560
Today is my birthday.

259
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
Aw. Happy Birthday.

260
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,760
Stop. There’s no need to give me a surprise gift.

261
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,720
The only thing I want. Bring me Fueang.

262
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,200
Can you set me up with him?

263
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,200
Only once.

264
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,440
Fueang?

265
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes!

266
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,640
Please. Just a dinner.

267
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,680
Hey! What happened to your neck?

268
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,080
Oh. Nothing.

269
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,080
I just got a cut.

270
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,960
A cut!

271
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,600
Ayyy!

272
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
It’s just a tiny. Nothing to worry about.

273
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,080
Excuse me. Can you book the concert tickets for us?

274
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,920
No, I can't.

275
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,400
No!

276
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,880
What should we do? That store's system is down

277
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,560
and I’ve never done it myself before.

278
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,840
I made an effort to get money from Mom.

279
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,560
Right! I do not even know when he will come back to Thailand again.

280
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,080
You’ll never know!

281
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,080
…if he’ll get back. You must get the tickets!

282
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,720
Come on, girls. I know how you feel.

283
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,320
Let me help you. I hope my internet is fast enough.

284
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
Which concert do you want to buy? One by one, please.

285
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
I want to go to Mi Jung concert.

286
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,080
Oops! VVIP.

287
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,720
Yes.

288
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,200
I like rich kids.

289
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,320
Thai Ticket Minor.

290
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,840
Confirmed!

291
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,720
Yeah!

292
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,400
You next!

293
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,280
Which floor is it?

294
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,400
Madam Aoi said the 3rd floor.

295
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,000
3rd floor…

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,760
I got some snacks for you.

297
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,480
They're nice ones.

298
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,720
Good. I’m still hungry.

299
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,440
Krom.

300
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,600
Aw! Thoo!

301
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,080
This is Thoo. He’s my best friend.

302
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,440
Hi, Thoo.

303
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Hi.

304
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
What are you doing here?

305
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,080
I’m working as his manager for today.

306
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,480
I see.

307
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,319
How about you?

308
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,000
My boss told me to attend the event for him here.

309
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,240
I heard his wife is giving birth.

310
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,400
But I don't know anything about this event at all.

311
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,280
They paid me for it.

312
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,599
That’s why I’m here.

313
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,520
Otherwise, I wouldn’t come.

314
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,319
Wow. What a nice story!

315
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
You give me more spirit to speak.

316
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
What?

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,200
He’s a guest for today’s event.

318
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,280
A guest?

319
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,440
Um.

320
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,280
I’ll park my bike. See you inside.

321
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,360
See you.

322
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,080
Be careful. Bye.

323
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,640
Let’s go.

324
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,320
Okay.

325
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
Don’t mind him.

326
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,720
Have a seat.

327
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,440
Please wait here.

328
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,440
Here’s the agenda

329
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,560
and your script for your speech.

330
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
Sand already gave it to me last night.

331
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,160
Here.

332
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,560
Is it this one?

333
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,720
Yes.

334
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,040
I have to get on the stage at 11 a.m., right?

335
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,520
It might be a little bit late.

336
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,320
Her secretary said she was still on her way.

337
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,600
Please take your time.

338
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,680
Who is she talking about?

339
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,680
The senior officer from the Ministry.

340
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,880
Are you hungry?

341
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,680
Yes.

342
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,720
Here, I prepare these for you.

343
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,520
Great.

344
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,000
Your water.

345
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,960
It’s 20 minutes to noon.

346
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,480
This is almost an hour late.

347
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,240
Why isn’t she here yet?

348
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,160
Krom. Calm down.

349
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,720
How can I? She’s a senior and their boss.

350
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,800
She was supposed to be here on time.

351
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
She must have a reason.

352
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,240
Fueang. We need to leave here not over 12.30 p.m.,

353
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,360
or we won’t make it in time for the next program.

354
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,800
She has arrived.

355
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,920
She’s here?

356
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,040
Yes.

357
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,720
We need to leave not over 12.30 p.m.

358
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
No problem.

359
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,840
Her speech is concise and you are next to her.

360
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,280
Thank you.

361
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,800
Come on. Let me help you with the suit.

362
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,240
-

363
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Do I have to put this button?

364
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,760
Um.

365
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,400
While waiting for her to finish, do you want to rehearse your script with me?

366
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,520
Good.

367
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,880
Alright.

368
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
The drug prevention seminar 2023.  Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health.

369
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,560
Without further ado,

370
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,440
I would like to invite the president

371
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,480
to give a speech at the opening of the drug prevention seminar 2023.

372
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,920
Please have a big applause.

373
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,280
Good afternoon.

374
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,400
I would like to mention the dangers of hallucinogenic drugs briefly.

375
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,840
These include LSD, TNT, and dung mushrooms.

376
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,560
Party drugs…

377
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
It’s noon!

378
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,040
it may stimulate or you can be hallucinated at the same time

379
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,240
such as Marijuana.

380
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,800
Madam Aoi.

381
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,160
it can be divided into 9 types.

382
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,640
Have you left the ministry yet?

383
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,080
They are just starting.

384
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,120
It’s already pass twelve!

385
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,960
How long will it take?

386
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,400
Which are…

387
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,800
The president was late.

388
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,200
Okay. I’ll call you later.

389
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,920
Please give applause to the president.

390
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,800
Thank you.

391
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,640
Next, please welcome our rising star

392
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,920
who is the most popular right now.

393
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's give applause to

394
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,760
Mr. FuangNakhon Phakdeetrairat

395
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,480
Juju!

396
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,320
Hello, Juju.

397
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,000
Where if he now, Aoi?

398
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,960
He is on the way to your studio.

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,800
I hope he won’t disappoint me.

400
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,400
He won't.

401
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,120
How long will it take?

402
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,240
As you may know,

403
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,160
my father died of the lung cancer

404
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,600
even though, he was a health-conscious person

405
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,840
who regularly worked out.

406
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,040
The doctor assumed that

407
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,080
it might be affected by my grandfather.

408
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,240
He'd been heavy smoking since my father was a small child.

409
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
Athough,

410
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,160
my father had never stayed close to him while he smoked

411
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,680
but the effects of cigarettes and addictive substances

412
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,920
are far more dangerous than we think.

413
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,000
I consider myself lucky.

414
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,080
Ever since I can remember until now,

415
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,400
I never have a memory of seeing my father smoking.

416
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,520
So, today…

417
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,360
We now have the opportunity to raise awareness

418
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,320
of these addictive substances to people who are close to us

419
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,520
and the young generation.

420
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,920
I hope this event

421
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,560
will bring Thailand to be the country that is free from all types of drugs.

422
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,760
Thank you.

423
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,080
Let's give applause to

424
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,560
to Mr. FueangNakhon Phakdeetrairat.

425
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
Wasn't that a good speech?

426
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,960
Lastly, I'd like ask you all to join in the group pictures

427
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,240
as a promise that …

428
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,320
Madam Aoi.

429
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,360
Let our honored guest in front.

430
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,240
together, we will make Thailand to be a drug-free country.

431
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,880
Let our honored guest in front.

432
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
Yes. We will make it in time.

433
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,320
Yes,

434
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,200
Before we start capturing, everyone please say

435
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Thailand is free from drugs and then Hey.

436
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,280
Ready.

437
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
One. Two. Three.

438
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,000
Thailand is far from drugs. Hey!

439
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,320
I’m leaving, Krom.

440
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,120
Um.

441
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,440
Wait, thoo. How many helmets do you have?

442
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,960
Two. Why?

443
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,600
Let me borrow your bike.

444
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,000
What!

445
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,400
Hurry!

446
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
How will I go home then?

447
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,200
Come on. Get your bike. Trust me.

448
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,400
I have a way out.

449
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,280
- Go!

450
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,040
- Okay.
- Hurry.

451
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,040
Thank you to all of the honorary guests

452
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,760
who join in our photo session.

453
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,040
Yes sir. We are leaving.

454
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Okay. Talk to you later.

455
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,600
Thoo. I sent you the location.

456
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,280
You drive his car there.

457
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,720
Okay.

458
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,960
Give me your key, Fueang.

459
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,000
What is this, Krom?

460
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,160
I already checked.

461
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,960
We won’t make it in time if you drive your car.

462
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,240
Give me, please.

463
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
We count on you.

464
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,520
Okay.

465
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,200
Here, put on the helmet.

466
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,800
Wait. Hold this.

467
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,360
You sure about this?

468
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,280
Of course.

469
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,560
Drive follows us.

470
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,520
Okay.

471
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,880
Let’s go.

472
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,600
Go fast! Hurry!

473
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,160
I beg to all the sacred things.

474
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,320
Please help Fueang to be there in time.

475
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,560
Please.

476
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,560
And if he couldn’t make it

477
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,920
I won’t provide you the food anymore.

478
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,480
Oops. Sorry.

479
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,800
Go.

480
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,960
You must hurry. It’s almost time.

481
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,000
Run.

482
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,000
I’ll come back. Please wait.

483
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,360
Sorry guys.

484
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,720
We are at the studio now.

485
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Thank God!

486
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,000
They can make it! Great!

487
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,160
Huh. Such a relief.

488
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
Ahem!

489
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,400
Can we start our discussion now?

490
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Ohayou Konnichiwa.

491
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,480
Juju, Fueang is here.

492
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,160
Hmm? Right on time.

493
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,280
12.58 p.m.

494
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,120
What else should I suppose to attack him then?

495
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,160
What about…

496
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,240
That’s good.

497
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,880
Great.

498
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,840
You guys ready?

499
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,360
Remove his shawl.

500
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,280
Right. Gets ready.

501
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,640
Five. Four. Three. Two.

502
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,720
Okay.

503
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,040
Hello guys. Welcome to my show.

504
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,960
Dripping & Chitchat with Juju!

505
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,680
I bring you guys today with a young famous actor

506
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,840
who is ranking No. 1 hottest right now.

507
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,720
Mr. Fueang, FueangNakhon Pakdeetrairat.

508
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,000
Hi.

509
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,600
Hi.

510
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,800
I heard that

511
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,680
you don’t like to talk about your family.

512
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,800
It makes me curious…

513
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,960
if there any reasons behind.

514
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,760
Actually… There is no particular reason.

515
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,440
I just want to keep their privacy.

516
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,600
Well.

517
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,840
Well. Well. Well.

518
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,240
If you want to keep their privacy

519
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,240
then you’d better not get into this industry.

520
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
Well.. I understand.

521
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,280
But my family,

522
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,760
they aren’t in this industry as me.

523
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,400
Instead, I would be glad

524
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,640
to answers any questions about myself.

525
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,760
Really?

526
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,840
Indeed.

527
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,240
Let’s get to the point

528
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,800
about yourself.

529
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,120
Yes,

530
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,640
What is the relationship

531
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,320
between you and that idol?

532
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,080
You said he works for Zendaya.

533
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,000
But someone saw he worked as your manager,

534
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,080
at the premiere day of your new movie.

535
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,640
There’s nothing complicated.

536
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,160
My manager, Sand,

537
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,160
he has been occupied currently.

538
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,520
So, we needed someone to do his job.

539
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,600
It's such a right time that Krom

540
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,280
who's my friend coming back to Thailand for his vacation.

541
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,800
So, I asked him to accept this job.

542
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,440
He didn’t get paid, by the way.

543
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,160
We’ve been using his service for free all along.

544
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,280
That’s savage, right?

545
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
But he’s so nice.

546
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,080
He's the kind of person

547
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,040
who is glad to help his friends in any way he can.

548
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,840
That seems to be more than friend to me.

549
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,840
Whatever.

550
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,960
That is what you have to consider by yourself.

551
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,680
I don't know if it’s because of his experience or what.

552
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,600
But he always has the best answers to everything.

553
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,280
You always played the villain characters.

554
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,440
Was there anyone thinking about you as a bad guy?

555
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,520
Sometimes.

556
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,920
But I like that.

557
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,920
It means that I played them well

558
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,000
and made people believe in those characters

559
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,240
Do I always stare at people like this

560
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,280
or talk to them with this voice?

561
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,680
No.

562
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,480
I'm just act normal like others.

563
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,920
Talking to you today

564
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,240
makes me want to

565
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,520
change my show’s name to

566
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,360
“Dripping and flattering”.

567
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,720
You are my first guest

568
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,160
that I can’t find any flaws.

569
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,200
Thank you.

570
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
Here.

571
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,520
Okay.

572
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,400
I parked your car there.

573
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,600
Thanks a lot.

574
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
I would be dead without you.

575
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,720
Tell me what you want to eat.

576
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,600
It’s on me.

577
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
You said it.

578
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,720
Bring it on!

579
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,480
Unlimited budget, right?

580
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,280
Um.

581
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,480
But… don’t expect too much.

582
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,720
I may not have enough.

583
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,480
Not over 199 baht sounds good.

584
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,400
Prepare your money.

585
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,640
I'm leaving.

586
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,640
Thank you again. Bye.

587
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,880
Fueang. Are you finished?

588
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,040
Yes.

589
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,120
Here. Thoo brought me a key.

590
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,760
Are you hungry?

591
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,120
Not yet.

592
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,440
Let’s go find something to eat at home.

593
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,200
He parks the car there.

594
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,880
Let’s go.

595
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,040
Fueang.

596
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Are those your fans?

597
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,960
No.

598
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,199
They are Kor’s.

599
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,480
Fueang.

600
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,760
Fueang. Where is Kor?

601
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,159
Right.

602
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,360
He didn’t come.

603
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,199
I was the only guest today.

604
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,000
Don’t worry. Just give me his gifts.

605
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,239
I’ll give every piece to him on your behalf. You can count on me.

606
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,199
I’ll also tell him to post his photo with these gifts, too. Is it good?

607
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,239
Yes.

608
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,120
Show me. What are they?

609
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,920
Let me help you.

610
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,400
Okay.

611
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,560
Wow, Taokaenoi! He must love this one.

612
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,840
Nice bouquet.

613
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,880
What about this?

614
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
Oh. This is from my friend.

615
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,680
She loves you so much.

616
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,560
She made this gift for Kor on behalf of your name.

617
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,520
She must be so happy once she knows that you are here.

618
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,760
Where is she now?

619
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,160
Angun.

620
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,600
Angun.

621
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,560
Angun. There’s someone who wants to see you.

622
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,400
Who?

623
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,000
Hi.

624
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,640
Fueang.

625
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,400
You remember my voice?

626
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,040
It’s really you, Fueang!

627
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,960
Can I sit with you?

628
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,760
Yes.

629
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,200
Kor didn’t come as we expected.

630
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,480
It is Fueang who was the guest on Juju’s show today.

631
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,640
You’re so lucky that he’s here.

632
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,400
We are Kor’s fans.

633
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,440
She’s the only one among us who is your fan.

634
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,240
Wow. I’m very impress.

635
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,760
You’re bold to show that you have different preferences.

636
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,080
Your gift is also lovely too.

637
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,800
Would you mind if I wanted to have pictures with you?

638
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,600
Of course not.

639
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,440
Can you take pictures for me?

640
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,000
Okay.

641
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,280
One. Two. Three.

642
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,400
One. Two. Three. Lovely!

643
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,320
Wow, nice ones.

644
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,320
Thank you.

645
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,160
I was angry at myself before that I’d never have the happiness

646
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,400
from seeing someone I love like others.

647
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,880
But after I heard one of your interviewing about

648
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,360
happiness doesn't have to be seen with our eyes,

649
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,920
but we can feel it with our hearts.

650
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,840
Although your father left this world

651
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,320
and you’ll never see each other again

652
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,000
but your love for him will never change.

653
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,000
So am I.

654
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,880
Even if I can’t see you.

655
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,760
But I can feel

656
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,840
the positive energy that you delivered.

657
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,200
I can live a happy life each day because of you.

658
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,320
Thank you. You’re my Idol.

659
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,560
I want to thank you as well.

660
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,360
Please remember one thing.

661
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,680
Even if you don’t have me

662
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
you can still create positive energy for your own

663
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,400
it will also bring the same happiness to you.

664
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,760
You got it?

665
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,920
Always support you.

666
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,720
I wish your dream comes true.

667
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,320
She asked me to write it.

668
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,200
With this gift,

669
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,240
I promise that I’ll make my dream come true.

670
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,000
I know you can do it.

671
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,240
Thank you.

672
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,080
Okay. Let fulfill this bottle with these stars.

673
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,080
Good.

674
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,000
Another bottle?

675
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,040
Teach me how to fold, please.

676
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,840
Can you teach me, too?

677
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Okay.

678
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,400
How should I start?

679
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,640
Is this correct?

680
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,880
Ah. I see.

681
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,680
I can’t believe

682
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,640
that I could fold such a lot of these stars.

683
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,320
I must thank Angun for them.

684
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,440
Yes, it was because of her.

685
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,360
Well…

686
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,200
Are you tired today?

687
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,400
Yes, a little bit.

688
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,600
But it's better after talking with Angun.

689
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,600
I’m just one of those actors

690
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
who they don’t know if I’m good or bad.

691
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,000
But still, my fans trust that I can bring them positive energy.

692
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,200
This reason inspires me to work hard each day

693
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,000
to bring them the happiness.

694
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
to bring them the happiness.

695
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,560
Especially those teenage fans,

696
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,200
they are easy to get lost.

697
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,840
They count on me so much.

698
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,240
So, I discipline myself

699
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
to be a good Idol for them

700
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,040
in return for their love for me.

701
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,200
I do believe

702
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,200
that you’ll make your dream come true

703
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,760
as Angun said.

704
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,200
Thank you.

705
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,600
You can do it.

706
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,360
I made some of these. Do you want one?

707
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,040
I want both.

708
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,520
They are mine now.

709
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,080
Alright. You can have them if you like.

710
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,800
I believe that you’ll become a real star.

711
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,120
I want both of them, then.

712
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,280
I used to ask myself before

713
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,600
why does he have to endure

714
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,080
living with such a complicated life.

715
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,480
Now I know the reason

716
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,760
he chooses to be him this day.

717
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,040
Hi. How was spending an entire day with him?

718
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,080
Are you running out of patience?

719
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,600
Never.

720
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,600
Even if I have to stay with him more days

721
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,440
months or years,

722
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,840
I’m still feeling fine.

723
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,200
Okay. I just want to check.

724
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,560
Okay. Bye.

725
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,840
Fueang.

726
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,280
Let’s go home.

727
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,960
No one came to see me on my birthdayat all.

728
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,240
Happy birthday Kung.

729
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,000
Kung? Are you in shock?

730
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,480
Fueang!

731
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,440
It’s me. FuangNakhon.

732
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,440
Is he… Is he real?

733
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,320
Of course, he is.

734
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,880
It's your cake.

735
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,200
Happy birthday to you.

736
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,560
Happy birthday to you.

737
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,440
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

738
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,000
Happy birthday to you.

739
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,960
As I said before.

740
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,280
I admire a celebrity who is nice

741
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,360
and disciplined like FueangNakhon.

742
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,720
But my feelings for him have changed after this day.

743
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,400
I do not only admire him as a celebrity

744
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,160
but also…

745
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,640
You want to eat Fueang!?

746
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,400
Shh!

747
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,440
I said I wanted to bring him to eat at this restaurant.

748
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,320
Because...

749
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,400
Because?

750
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,520
I like him!

751
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,600
That's too loud!

752
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,400
Are you…

753
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,720
Are you going to tell Feu… him that you like him?

754
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,720
No. There's no point to do.

755
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,720
He doesn’t like me that way.

756
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,960
Aw! But you told me that

757
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,960
he was acting weird recently like flirting you.

758
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,160
He might like you too.

759
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,840
No way. I had a second though.

760
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,320
He didn’t try to flirt me at all.

761
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,960
He’s always friendly with everyone.

762
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
I am just…

763
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,280
a son of the person who cooks his favorite dishes.

764
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,240
That’s why he treats me so well

765
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,120
and makes me imagine things myself

766
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,520
You’re funny.

767
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,280
How?

768
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,880
You’ll be fine.

769
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,560
Thoo… Are you consoling me?

770
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,000
You said you'll treat me a meal.

771
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,240
Come on.

772
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,200
Jeez! You’re such a greedy!

773
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,440
You should pity your friend.

774
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,280
All right! Let’s go then!

775
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,960
I just want you to forget about it.

776
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,400
Huh!

777
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,280
Excuse me. Can we get a bill, please?

778
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,920
You must eat all this up!

779
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,440
Why are you mad?

780
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,200
Stop talking!

781
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,520
Finish it! Such a waste!

782
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,200
Yes, mom.

783
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,800
I am at home now

784
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,880
Eating with friends

785
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,680
Honey, I made some snacks for Fueang.

786
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,920
Don't forget to give him.

787
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,120
Yes, mom.

788
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,880
Sure.

789
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,080
Bye.

790
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,720
Fueang.

791
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,920
I saw your light on.

792
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,400
Are you at home now?

793
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,000
Yes. What are you doing?

794
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,960
I’m reading my new script.

795
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,360
My mom made snacks for you.

796
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,480
Should I see you there or will you come here?

797
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,680
That jackass Thoo! Why was it must be hot pot!

798
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,080
I’ll come to you.

799
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,440
Let’s spray a bit.

800
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,560
I’m here.

801
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,800
Fueang.

802
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,600
Fueang.

803
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,480
Fueang.

804
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,000
Are you sleeping?

805
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,640
The babyface bodyguard.

806
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,320
What is his character?

807
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,320
- Let me say something, Sand.
- Kor!

808
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,640
What should I do?

809
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,840
I’m not okay with it!

810
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,400
Not here!

811
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,120
Oh, sure you do! You’re a superstar now!

812
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,200
What’re you talking about?

813
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,400
You should take better good care of me.

814
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,400
How would I supposed to know if they're too bossy?

815
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,000
I don’t like it.

816
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,480
What’s wrong? Do you want a new manager?

817
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,360
He’s sleeping.

818
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,560
Aw! Why is he here?

819
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,560
Fueang never sleeps in front of anybody.

820
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,400
He’s not anybody.

821
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,880
He likes him.

822
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,240
Really?

823
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:39,920
Yes.

824
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,720
You know he’s such an introverted person.

825
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,000
But didn’t you notice that he always takes this boy around?

826
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,120
You right.

827
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,720
When did they fall in love?

828
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,760
If you want to know…

829
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,520
then follow me.

830
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,600
I'll tell you everything.

831
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,440
there might be someone…

832
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,840
overheard us here.

833
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,200
Wait for me!

834
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,760
That silly!

835
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,560
He didn’t sleep! He heard everything,

836
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,200
and he didn’t refuse!

837
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,200
He moves!

838
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,200
Is that he walking this way?

839
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,000
Easy! Don’t let him know that I heard it.

840
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,040
I know that you didn’t sleep.

841
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,360
Fueang.

842
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,080
What are you doing?

843
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,200
You heard what he said

844
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,480
about my feelings, right?

845
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,880
Well… I…

846
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,240
Yes. I like you.

847
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,120
How about you? Do you like me, too?

848
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,240
You’re quiet.

849
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,600
Are you waiting for me to do something?

850
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,560
All right.

851
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,080
I’ll do it.

852
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,080
Krom!

853
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,400
Ah.. It was a dream.

854
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,600
What dream?

855
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Oh! I mean…

856
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,400
Your house is so comfy. I slept very deep.

857
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,480
I dreamt about many things.

858
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,880
If you didn’t wake me up,

859
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,640
I’d continue sleeping.

860
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,240
So, you didn’t hear anything?

861
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,240
Kor?

862
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,440
Was he here?

863
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,960
Yes. He came with Sand.

864
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,040
Are you sure?

865
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,800
Uh… I should go back to my house.

866
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,320
This is yours.

867
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,160
Krom!

868
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,240
Yes?

869
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,200
Thank you for that day.

870
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,800
You're welcome.

871
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,080
He likes me.

872
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,400
You should have told me

873
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,640
that you had to take care of Kor.

874
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,160
Hmm? When did I become yours?

875
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,960
You can go home first.

876
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,080
Do you know that he likes you so much.
