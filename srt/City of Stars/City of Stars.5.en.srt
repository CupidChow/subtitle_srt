1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,400
What! Fueang likes you?

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,200
I overheard it from his friend.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,680
He likes him.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,440
Really?

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,040
Um.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,560
His friend might imagine it himself.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,200
If he didn’t think about me that way,

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,360
so why did he do that?

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,320
He might be a Casanova.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
You can go home.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,280
I have to work.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,360
He has changed.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,080
He kept hiding from me.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,360
What had he done to you

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,320
to make you hide from him?

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
I didn’t hind from him.

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,000
Don’t forget to explain it to Sand.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,320
Explain?

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,440
Krom has a lover!

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,000
What!

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,200
Why do you have to be crazy if I had a lover?

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,520
Because I like you.

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,960
Since the first time I saw your photo.

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,320
Please keep pretending you didn’t know it.

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,680
Please do the same.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Does this mean you like me too?

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
I told you.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,400
Please keep pretending too.

29
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,240
They were watching us.

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
I’m afraid there’ll be rumors.

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Isn’t it good to have rumors with me?

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,560
It’s not like that.

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,920
I’m very new in this business

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,400
and I prefer people to focus on my work.

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,200
So…

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,280
I’m thinking, why don’t we…

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,240
find somewhere more private.

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,759
What do you want to do?

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,800
Whatever you want.

40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Stop!

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,200
Sand!

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,840
Why did you hit us?

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,920
What’s wrong with you?

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Stop it!

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,480
- Go!
- Why?

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,800
Well… wait for me here.

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,560
Where are you going?

48
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,840
I want to talk to some jerk. See you later.

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,400
Thank you for letting me know, Fueang.

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Otherwise, he would get her already.

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,360
Eh! Or she would get him?

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,880
Fueang!

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Did you tell her?

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,600
Don’t think that I don’t know

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
that you tried to manipulate Sand

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,480
about Krom’s lover.

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,440
That’s it. I’m going to bed.

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,680
Have fun.

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,720
Alright, Fueang!

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
You started it!

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
Wait for my turn.

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,040
Do you want to know Fueang’s secret?

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,240
Fueang’s secret?

64
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,520
You’re betraying me again.

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,760
I did it

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
because I love you.

67
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,440
If you love me as you said, tell them the truth

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,200
that we are dating.

69
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Alright.

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,800
Kor makes Fueang’s body burn

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,160
like a vocano that is ready to erupt.

72
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,680
He won’t stop giving a sweet revenge

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,200
to his beloved wife

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,640
to pay back for the guilt he had committed

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
and suddenly,

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,720
he brings his dearest wife

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,560
to their heaven,

78
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,680
where no others exist.

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
So overwhelming!

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,280
Right. Next episode?

81
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,640
- Yes!
- Good! Good!

82
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,400
- Here you go.
- Hey!

83
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,000
If I had to listen another word,

84
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
I’d rather go.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Bye.

86
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:52,320
Hah! Don’t you hold me up?

87
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,640
The next episode is fire. Look!

88
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Such a masterpiece!

89
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
Sorry for my late.

90
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,440
Fueang posted a picture on the Zendaya.

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
It was super chaotic.

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,320
Why are you standing? Sit down.

93
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,600
We’d better go somewhere else.

94
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,240
They’ve been crazy for those guys since.

95
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,800
What’s going on?

96
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,840
It’s FuengKor’s fans.

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,360
They edited your photo with Kor and put in their fiction.

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
You’re also in it.

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
Do you want more?

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,560
Yeah, good.

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,080
Look.

102
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,680
Hey! Who shot this?

103
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,080
Aw! How am I supposed to know?

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,640
#TheFirstWifeFace

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
Look at Fueng’s face. So jealous.

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,440
Kor must be punished badly.

107
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,720
Didn’t those fans aware that there’s nothing between these two?

108
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,080
They know.

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,360
But they’re still happy even in their dream

110
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,240
or their imagination.

111
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,160
Imagination?

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,960
Really?

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Well, let me see.

114
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,880
Hmm. What else do you have?

115
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,920
Which kind of fictions?

116
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,680
Drama, Erotic, or Period?

117
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,720
Huh? They have a Period fiction?

118
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Anything can happen in a fiction’s world.

119
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,720
Oh! Oh! Oh! There is one.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
You’re portrayed as a convent student.

121
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,840
Fueang and Kor,

122
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,880
they came to sing at the school as K-pop artists.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,640
Then, they took you to Saladaeng brothel.

124
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,880
Saladaeng brothel?

125
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,360
Where is that?

126
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
Kor’s condo.

127
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,400
It locates at Saladaeng.

128
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,040
He always took his girls there.

129
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,600
That’s why they call Saladaeng brothel.

130
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,240
You knew that Kor is such a wolf.

131
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,200
What makes you guys imagine things with him and Fueang?

132
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,960
Those girls are just his flavor of the week.

133
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,320
His real love is only for Fueang.

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
That’s right!

135
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,440
Eat the chickens.

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
Hold on. Show me those fictions.

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
Come on.

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,200
They are so good!

139
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,840
Well, you read them for me.

140
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,800
Are you going home?

141
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,280
Yes. How about you?

142
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,040
Me too.

143
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,520
Do you want a ride?

144
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,960
Super!

145
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,760
See you later.

146
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,360
- Bye Bye. See you.
- Goodbye.

147
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,560
Drive safe.

148
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,720
- Thanks.
- Be careful.

149
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,960
Well, Krom.

150
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,280
I have a thought to write a story about you and Fueang.

151
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,960
Isn’t it good?

152
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,520
Well.

153
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,039
What is the plot?

154
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,240
I imagine you

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
as a young hermit

156
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,640
Hmm?

157
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,120
who assumes that the prince has a crush on him.

158
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,640
So, he confessed his love to the prince.

159
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,400
The prince is so furious.

160
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
He hits your head very hard.

161
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,960
What do you think?

162
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,920
I’m afraid

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,200
that your plot

164
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
is out-dated.

165
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,160
out-dated?

166
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,520
The prince already confessed that he loves the young hermit.

167
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,280
Is it true?

168
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,760
Um.

169
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,480
What did he say to you?

170
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,120
Did you guys have sex?

171
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,000
Is that the only thing you have in your head?

172
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,200
Why?

173
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,040
But Kor said to me that

174
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,360
he has Fueng’s secret to tell me.

175
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,960
And this secret

176
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,400
will make me stop loving him.

177
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Secret?

178
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,400
What secret?

179
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,480
I have no idea.

180
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,240
Start your day with a good meal

181
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
before seeing your special one.

182
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,640
Please do the same.

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,320
Hey! Wait!

184
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,840
Does this mean you like me too?

185
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,920
I didn’t know that you can cook.

186
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,880
I can cook, but never have time doing it.

187
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,480
So, I had to rely on others.

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,840
How about the sauce?

189
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,680
What does it taste like?

190
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,000
Any comments?

191
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,200
Aw! You haven't ate it yet?

192
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,000
I brought one for me and one for you.

193
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,360
But you...

194
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,720
Aw! You should've told me.

195
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,240
I already ate all of them.

196
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,760
That’s alright. Seeing you smiled while eating

197
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,800
made me already full of happiness.

198
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,000
Now I know what the sauce tastes like.

199
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,280
Did I startle you?

200
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,400
You attacked me again.

201
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,200
Get used to it.

202
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,000
I’ll wash this dish.

203
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,640
Hey, stop. Let me do it.

204
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,080
There’s no water.

205
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,360
The tab is broken.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,240
My father wants to fix it but hasn’t done it yet.

207
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,640
Do you have some tools? I’ll fix it.

208
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
Can you do that?

209
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,400
Yes. When I was with my parent,

210
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,200
I was a regular technician at the house.

211
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,600
Go get the tools.

212
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,760
Alright.

213
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,280
He can cook.

214
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,920
He's romantic.

215
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
He's good at fixing things.

216
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,600
Why is he so perfect?

217
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,680
It won’t take long.

218
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,400
Alright.

219
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,520
Get ready. I’ll pick you up.

220
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Where are we going?

221
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,360
To see Fueang’s secret.

222
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
He is with me.

223
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,320
What is he doing?

224
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,760
Fixing the tab.

225
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,200
Ask him about his today’s job.

226
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
He won’t allow you to go with him.

227
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,200
It works now.

228
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,920
Are you tired? You’re sweating.

229
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,560
This?

230
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,960
The water was splashing me.

231
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,920
Good job. I’ll ask my mother to cook you a nice meal.

232
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,560
There’s no need. I got my reward.

233
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,040
Uh. Are you going to work today?

234
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Yes. It’s almost time to go.

235
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Can I go with you?

236
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,800
Well.. I…

237
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,040
I really need a high concentration on this job

238
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,840
and I would be so worried about you if you came.

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,720
What kind of job that needs such a high concentration?

240
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,960
Well, it’s a showcase. The general one.

241
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
There’s a ton of client data

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,320
that I need to memorize.

243
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,080
How was it? Did you ask him?

244
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
I asked him.

245
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,800
He doesn’t want me to go with him.

246
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
You must prepare yourself.

247
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,960
He's not likely a good person.

248
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,200
Is that so?

249
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,680
Um. Go see it yourself.

250
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,920
Are you alright?

251
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,800
Well, can’t I just be happy?

252
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,480
Look at that good weather.

253
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,320
Wait here. Let me get change.

254
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,680
Namtarn.

255
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,560
When will you finish your class?

256
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,480
Ah.. You didn’t forget about our date, right?

257
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,800
Good. At 4 p.m.

258
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,600
Don’t miss it.

259
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,280
Okay. See you.

260
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,360
I have another date with Amp at that time.

261
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Amp. It's me.

262
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,760
About our appointment at 4 p.m.

263
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,120
I’m afraid that I have an acting class at that time.

264
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,280
It’s because of Madam Aoi. She says I need an urgent class.

265
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,040
Can we...

266
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,119
Can we shift it to 8 p.m. instead?

267
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,440
Okay, right?

268
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,839
Good.

269
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,720
I’ll take you to a good restaurant.

270
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,839
I don’t understand.

271
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,560
Why are his fans so crazy about him?

272
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,880
If a guy like him said,

273
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,880
I wouldn’t be able to handle Fueang’s secret.

274
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,760
Could it be possible that it is worse than Kor’s bad habits?

275
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:26,960
Let’s go.

276
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,160
What happens?

277
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,200
Whose car is this?

278
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
I don’t know.

279
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,280
Whose car is this?!

280
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,520
Is this yours?

281
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,680
Huh? How could someone parked a car like this?

282
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,960
Are they blind?

283
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
Is this yours?

284
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,000
How about you? Huh!

285
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,720
You dipshit! How did they get the license?

286
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,240
How am I going to get in? Like this?

287
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,240
Who's going to responsible for it?

288
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,520
Ah.

289
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Please don’t. It’s not good.

290
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,320
I beg you, Sand.

291
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,160
You don’t want me to become crazy, do you?

292
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,320
Hello, guys. How’s it going?

293
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,440
I heard some of you have been here

294
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,720
since before the store opened.

295
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,640
Now, the waiting is over.

296
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,720
Our FuangNakhon has arrived.

297
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,800
Is there anyone here who wants to see him?

298
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,160
Where are you taking me to?

299
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,440
You’ll see it.

300
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
- Give me louder please.
- Hurry! It's almost time.

301
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Oh Ho! He must be very impressed.

302
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,080
Please welcome, FueangNakhon!

303
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,920
Hi, Fueang.

304
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,520
Hi.

305
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,040
You look so smart.

306
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,120
Our Handsome guy.

307
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,240
What are those shoes?

308
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Well, he always wears these shoes

309
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
whenever he lacks of confidence.

310
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,720
He said people will put their focus on them instead of him.

311
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,200
Sand doesn’t like him to wear them

312
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,160
because of the color.

313
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,160
Right. So outstanding.

314
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
How do you feel

315
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,680
as a new presenter

316
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,960
of Moomee?

317
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,360
I’m very glad.

318
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,720
It is such an honor

319
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,080
to receive this opportunity.

320
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,040
As you guys may know.

321
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,560
Before I accepted to be the presenter,

322
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,640
I always ensure that those products

323
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,080
must be good as they claimed.

324
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,320
Did you hear that?

325
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,280
Beside of the new product’s opening,

326
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,960
he also prepares his special show

327
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
to surprise all of you.

328
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Am I right, Fueang?

329
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Am I right?

330
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,240
Yes.

331
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
Oops. He’s very considerate of his fans.

332
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,400
Get ready.

333
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,120
Ready?

334
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,840
Ready for what?

335
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
This is FueangNakhon’s secret.

336
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,600
Four.

337
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,280
Three.

338
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,880
Two.

339
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,400
One.

340
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,000
Let’s watch the performance from FueangNakhon.

341
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,040
And this secret

342
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
will make me stop loving him.

343
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,880
I really need a high concentration on this job

344
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,720
And…

345
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
I would be so worried about you if you came.

346
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,320
You must prepare yourself.

347
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
He's not likely a good person.

348
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,400
I beg you.

349
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,240
or I would go crazy.

350
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,800
There was no one for me.

351
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,360
Where were you?

352
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,440
There was no place for me.

353
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
My mind is drifting far and far away.

354
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,760
And at the end,

355
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
I found you.

356
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,320
I don’t care about any others.

357
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,080
Don’t off the beat.

358
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,600
One. Two. Three. Four.

359
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,960
Is it the Power of Love

360
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,280
that brings us together.

361
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,960
- มหัศจรรย์ ฉันได้รักเธอ
- คนอะไร ร้องเพลงเหมือนไม่เคยรู้จักดนตรีมาก่อน

362
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,040
wherever it leads me to

363
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,200
you’ll always be my destiny.

364
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,840
As they say,

365
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,080
nothing is perfect in this world.

366
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
The people I respect the most

367
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,160
are these fans.

368
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,920
They knew that he had a desperate singing skill

369
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,640
but they still tried their best to sing along.

370
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,640
Please remember one thing. I love you.

371
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,040
I beg everybody here.

372
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,000
Please don’t hire me to sing again

373
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,480
I feel sorry for my audiences.

374
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,640
That’s alright.

375
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,160
- That’s alright.
- You’re awesome.

376
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,600
You’re Amazing, Fueang!

377
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,760
That’s Kor!

378
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,280
He came to support his wife.

379
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,800
You!

380
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,320
You didn’t tell me you’d come.

381
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,960
Wait until tonight. I’ll beat you hard.

382
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,120
Big scream to FueangNakhon!

383
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,080
Again please.

384
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,440
Oh ho! Such a massive screaming!

385
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,880
It must be because of his angelic voice.

386
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,560
Before we go,

387
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
do you have anything to say?

388
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,720
Yes.

389
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,120
Well.

390
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,400
Please support Moomee Cushion.

391
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,760
The green cartridge Cushion.

392
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,160
Compatible with every generation. Cover every scratch.

393
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,520
Wow! Don’t forget to get one, everybody.

394
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,000
I guarantee its best quality.

395
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,200
Now.

396
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
I’ll let Fueang go rest.

397
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
Thank you very much.

398
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,520
Please cheer for him.

399
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,960
I thought he had a scarier secret.

400
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,960
I was frightened.

401
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,080
He started this war.

402
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,480
Fueang.

403
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,680
He told Sand about me and Mim.

404
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,400
In fairness,

405
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,200
that was my payback time.

406
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,760
After this event,

407
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,320
he knew his anti-fans

408
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,120
would spread many nasty comments on social media.

409
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,800
That won’t concern him.

410
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,360
But you,

411
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,360
the guy who he likes would make him embarrassed.

412
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,840
You said anti-fans.

413
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,920
Um. Look. Check the social media.

414
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,320
Is that called singing?

415
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,040
His pretty face helps him.

416
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,840
Your singing is like a signal to evacuate.

417
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,640
You sing like a goat trying to imitate Mariah Carey.

418
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,680
He’d be serving a life sentence for his singing.

419
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,120
I didn’t know the cat could sing.

420
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,640
- He’s just having a bad singing,
- Your singing sounds like a GPS lost in a tunnel.

421
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,960
- not committing a crime.
- Your singing sounds like a GPS lost in a tunnel.

422
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,320
That’s why he only uses Zendaya.

423
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,800
How could you guys stand it?

424
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,400
What else can we do?

425
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,880
We don’t have time to reply to all of those hated comments.

426
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,000
No one does that.

427
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,680
I can’t believe

428
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,480
I could hear it from the guy

429
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,160
who likes to scold the press.

430
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,520
At least I still got a scene on the media for scolding the press,

431
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,520
but replying to those toxic fans

432
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,680
is wasted of time.

433
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,960
I prefer to spend my quality time

434
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,440
with something good or things that make me happy.

435
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,120
Especially, having our own brothel. It’s very good.

436
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,880
It is undeniable things

437
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,200
that come together with our career.

438
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,760
Imagine if you were a doctor.

439
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,120
You wouldn’t want your patients to die while you're on duty.

440
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,120
But that is inevitable.

441
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,760
You still need to face it.

442
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,200
It is the same as being an actor.

443
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,240
Keeping our personal issues private

444
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,720
or avoiding negative comments

445
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,920
is almost impossible.

446
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,240
It comes as a package with our career.

447
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,920
Eventually… we only have to live with it.

448
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,760
Right.

449
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,680
What’s going on?

450
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,480
Free tasting.

451
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,840
Please take it.

452
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,680
You can take it.

453
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,440
Aw!

454
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
Where are you going?

455
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,680
Hey.

456
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Kor.

457
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,040
It’s Kor.

458
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,800
Namsom, I…

459
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,560
Please stop, Namsom.

460
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,080
You always ran away from me.

461
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,800
Well…

462
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Please talk to me.

463
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,280
Don’t go.

464
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,680
Please.

465
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,520
I beg you.

466
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,760
Enough.

467
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,480
Please don’t ruin my life again.

468
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,840
Okay.

469
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,040
I’ll leave you now.

470
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,840
Namsom?

471
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,600
So familiar.

472
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,520
Rumor! A new rising star actor is dating Namsom, the famous transgender model.

473
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,400
Transgender woman.

474
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,960
Very pretty.

475
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,920
Where is Kor?

476
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,280
Okay.

477
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,680
I’ll wait you here.

478
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,800
Alright.

479
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,360
Are you meeting someone?

480
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,360
Hello, Fueang.

481
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,560
How are you doing?

482
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
I told you. You can’t run away from him.

483
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,080
You found each other again eventually.

484
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,200
Uh. This is Krom.

485
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,280
The one I told you about.

486
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,760
She is Namsom.

487
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,440
Nice to meet you.

488
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,240
Nice to meet you too.

489
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,000
When the hashtag to ban your idol was on viral

490
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,320
I just knew that

491
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,440
he wouldn’t be only an ordinary staff.

492
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,920
Are you done here?

493
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,600
Let’s find somewhere to sit.

494
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,160
I’d rather not. Someone will notice us.

495
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,760
I don’t want to cause you and Kor more trouble.

496
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,800
I better go.

497
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,320
Wouldn’t kor be mad if he knew about this?

498
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,680
Fueang.

499
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,360
Hmm?

500
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,080
You’ve been contacting with her all these times, haven’t you?

501
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,880
So that I can ask about her living

502
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,120
If she needs anything.

503
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,880
Didn’t you afraid he’d notice when you called her?

504
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,960
I recorded her as this name.

505
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,160
Vinegar.

506
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,360
Yes. A guy like Kor

507
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,600
won’t care about things like this.

508
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,680
Fueang.

509
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Hmm?

510
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,640
He’s always been loving her, hasn’t he?

511
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,720
Did you notice it?

512
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,120
Well.

513
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,240
His actions clearly showed when he was with her.

514
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,600
Yes. He has.

515
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,000
I think she’s the only one

516
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,400
that he truly loves.

517
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,800
No matter what gender she is, he still loves her.

518
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Alright.

519
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,400
The famous actor “K” was found, taking the new actress to his condo.

520
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,880
Excuse me. One Blue Hawaii, please.

521
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,520
Hello.

522
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,880
Yes. I’m Namsom.

523
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,600
Hello. What's up, Namsom?

524
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,000
Please help me say thank you to Krom.

525
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,360
Was it that he suggested you work with his friend?

526
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,120
I knew it since when he asked for your number from me.

527
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,320
He wasn’t only suggesting,

528
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,440
but also guaranteed me to his friend.

529
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,880
Really? How was it?

530
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,080
Yayee admitted that she didn’t like me as first

531
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,400
because she’s Kor’s fan.

532
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,440
But, Krom reassured her that

533
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,320
he would pay for my wage

534
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,280
if I disappointed her.

535
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,760
Without his help,

536
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,480
I definitely wouldn't have gotten this job.

537
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,160
You must take good care of him.

538
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,320
Alright.

539
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,280
Passionate between his beloved wife

540
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,800
and the young Japanese man

541
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,360
increases the heat which is confined

542
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,639
and never be released,

543
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,480
like a waterlogging waits to be drained.

544
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,000
His suffering eventually turned him

545
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,840
into a zombie. Eating people alive.

546
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,560
In the end, he was caught and killed.

547
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,320
His body was then displayed in the hospital

548
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,080
at the center of Bangkok.

549
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,040
Young hermit’s fiction is out of the world.

550
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,679
What’s the writer’s name?

551
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,360
Young hermit.

552
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,320
Young hermit!

553
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,760
Thoo! Is it you?

554
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,760
I always know that I have a gift.

555
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,040
Whatever!

556
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,520
Yayee. How does Namsom work?

557
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,560
Um. Good.

558
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,840
She’s beautiful, talented, patient, hardworking and never complains.

559
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,920
Unlike the rumors.

560
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,280
What rumors?

561
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,640
It was a few years ago.

562
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,560
They said she dated with Kor.

563
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,840
The transgender community

564
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,720
were not accepted by society at that time.

565
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,800
People assumed that

566
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,320
She was a gold digger who wanted to be famous

567
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,640
from dating Kor.

568
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,480
Someone created news that Namsom had problems at work.

569
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,080
No responsibility. So, no one dared to hire her.

570
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,320
She’s worked hard to support her mother since her dad died.

571
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,800
As well as pay for her tuition fees.

572
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Those people who created those fake news

573
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,880
without knowing anything about her

574
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,640
They should know that they ruined a person's life

575
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,000
She is pitiful.

576
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yes. She really is.

577
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,320
But, wait.

578
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,440
How did you know her?

579
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,240
I knew her through my friend.

580
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,360
Gee! As someone who just got back,

581
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,240
you’re so good at making friends.

582
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,640
Ouch! That’s hurt!

583
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,920
Hey. Hey. What are you two hiding from me?

584
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,240
Nothing! Why will we do that?

585
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,960
There is no secret among us.

586
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,560
Right?

587
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,200
Yeah. Nothing at all.

588
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,920
Don't let me find out.

589
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,920
Krom, what about your promise?

590
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,760
You said you’d give me something in return

591
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,000
if I gave her a job.

592
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,920
Oh. I won’t forget.

593
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,440
Very good.

594
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,760
We're all here. Such a pity that you can't come.

595
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,920
Please take care Fueang for me.

596
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,600
Jong, these are my fans.

597
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,200
Take it.

598
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,520
I'm counting on you.

599
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,920
Cheers.

600
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,360
Whoa, Jay!

601
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,640
What are you wearing?

602
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,440
Oh. I followed your advice.

603
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,360
Just be casual.

604
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,640
Can you teach me how to take good pictures?

605
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,040
Look at you.

606
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,800
Is it good?

607
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,360
It's too casual.

608
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,240
Fueang. Here’s the Dry fish with watermelon from mom.

609
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,640
Wow. Look so good.

610
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,600
I wanted to eat it.

611
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,040
Let me feed you.

612
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,120
You look strange today.

613
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,320
Um Hmm. Yummy!

614
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,560
It’s good, right?

615
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
Very fresh.

616
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,800
Are you tired today?

617
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,600
Not likely. Is something wrong?

618
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,960
Can I take your video?

619
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,160
video?

620
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,760
What video?

621
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,960
Just a general one.

622
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,120
It is for yayee.

623
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,200
Oh, Yayee. I remember her.

624
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,760
She’s crazy about you.

625
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,120
Would you help me, please?

626
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,680
Now?

627
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,360
With this dress?

628
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,120
She still likes you badly no matter what you wear.

629
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,120
Well, alright.

630
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,160
Okay.

631
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,040
Are you ready?

632
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,040
Yes.

633
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,360
Okay.

634
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,080
Cut!

635
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,760
Hello, Yayee.

636
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,880
Thank you for your support.

637
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,520
I hope your product will be the best-selling.

638
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,240
If I didn't get a face cream contract

639
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,800
I’d do the product review for you.

640
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,000
How about

641
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,600
if I take you to a nice restaurant instead?

642
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,800
Let me know when. See you.

643
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,280
Bye bye.

644
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,040
She’d be all screaming after watching this clip.

645
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,680
Krom.

646
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,560
Can I have another take?

647
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,560
This’s already good.

648
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Come on. Let do one more.

649
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,560
Alright.

650
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,240
Okay.

651
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,960
Ready?

652
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,360
This clip is not for Yayee.

653
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,560
It is for you, Krom.

654
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,080
Don’t stop recording it.

655
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,440
I want you to keep it as a record.

656
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,640
If there’s a day that we fight each other

657
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,440
or if I did something terrible to you,

658
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,640
please uses this clip to warn me.

659
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,160
Namsom asked me to say thank you to you.

660
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,640
What you did, assures me that

661
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,360
I did the right thing

662
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,800
by letting my heart rule my head.

663
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,640
From now on, I’ll give you my everything.

664
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,080
I’ll take care of you

665
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,680
and I could be anything you want me to be.

666
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,800
I love you.

667
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,280
Now… I’m going to kiss you.

668
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,200
You can continue recording or stop it.

669
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,600
Whatever you like.

670
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,600
I’d better stop. It might be leaked.

671
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,960
So what? I don’t care.

672
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,280
I kissed my darling.

673
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,560
Wait.

674
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,480
When did I become yours?

675
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,360
Since… now.

676
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,800
Are you okay?

677
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,080
Okay.

678
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,560
Are you…

679
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,160
sure about this?

680
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,360
I always want this since the day I met you.

681
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,400
So…

682
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,640
Okay.

683
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,440
You're shaking.

684
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,160
I miss my baby.

685
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,400
Can you boost me with a kiss?

686
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,120
If I could sing like before,

687
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,760
Madam Aoi will force me to sing in every event.

688
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,480
Have you ever sung better than this?

689
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,120
You may not know.

690
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
I was my school singing champion.

691
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,120
He’s cute.

692
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,200
I liked you before but now I love you.
