1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,720
He just came to pick me up.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,440
Does it have to be that issue?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,520
his parents like to discriminate against others.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,200
It’s okay if they blamed me alone.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,360
Why did they have to insult my parents?

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,760
My agent told me

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,160
to refuse about my relationship with Krom.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,360
He likes women.Okay?

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,720
Do you know a guy named Sarut?

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,400
I transferred you the balance.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,200
How about that clip?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,560
The situation intensified

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,840
after he confessed about the clip

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,480
between him and his ex.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,120
We’re trying to figure the way out.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,080
Should we start gaslighting a new scandal?

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,880
How about a divorce of that couple?

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,920
Don’t bring up other’s crises.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,000
Let’s hold it for now.

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,920
We should focus on the matter at hand.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Let’s kidnap that bastard.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Take him into the forest

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,319
and let him live with monkeys.

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,080
Huh? Er…

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,800
Do I get involved in this, too?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,160
Of course!

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,320
Well… So…

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,640
Let's have some eating.

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,039
We might get some ideas after that.

30
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,280
Fueang. How about you?

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,720
Some of you

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,240
may guess his answer about what he'll do

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,320
as he always uses it to solve problems.

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,039
Right. He chooses to tell the truth.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Are you crazy? You can’t do that.

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,960
They’ll not accept it.

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,000
Even if they ship you with Kor.

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,520
But we always keep your image

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,160
as a straight guy!

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,120
Say goodbye to your career

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,920
If you confess that you are homosexual!

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
If we lie to them,

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,040
they’d never stop cursing us

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,560
once it is exposed.

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,600
We better say the truth.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,400
So, this issue will come to an end.

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,960
I agree.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,960
Sand. Contact every press and media company.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,320
Whether online or offline.

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,079
I can help with finances if needed.

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,320
You have all my support.

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,800
Come on. We can do it!

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,600
Yes. The issue comes to an end.

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,240
Something else as well...

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,640
Why the hell do you guys like to meddle with my business?!

56
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,040
One day before the press conference.

57
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,440
What are you doing?

58
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,760
Well, Kung said

59
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,640
we should set a support corner for Fueang.

60
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,440
Hey, listen.

61
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,080
Since you had a scandal with Fueang,

62
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,000
many fans have come to support him here.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,240
So, we should add more hubs to communicate with them.

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,400
Here, I’m proud to present.

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Encouragement book. I made it.

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
So cute.

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,640
I think we should have some snacks, too.

68
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,640
Good! I support you!

69
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,040
You can deduct it from my wage.

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,840
Hmm! That’s no need!

71
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,840
I can pay for my son-in-law.

72
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,240
I wait for you to say that…

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
I changed my mind.

74
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,360
You can pay half.

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
I’ll cut it from your wage now.

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,160
Let me see how much they are.

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,880
No. You’re joking!

78
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,840
She won’t do it.

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,560
I want to talk to you.

80
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,240
Who is Sarut?

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
You should follow her.

82
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,560
No rush.

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,200
#WhoisSaru?

84
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,159
has been number one in the trend since last night.

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,040
I need to know it.

86
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,240
You look suspicious.

87
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,159
I know you hide something when you smile like this.

88
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,240
Well, if it's that hard.

89
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,280
You can say it in code.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Code?

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,200
Um.

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,120
What is it?

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,440
How can you not know?

94
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,600
Example! Fueang Fis Fine.

95
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,600
What is it?

96
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
I must pick up this call.

97
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,640
This boy!

98
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
You’re hiding something for sure!

99
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,040
Hello, Yayee.

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,840
Hello. I sent you a clip.

101
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,760
Why didn’t you check it?

102
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,920
I’m at my mother’s store to get some snacks for Fueang.

103
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,840
Why did you wake up early?

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,720
I haven’t slept yet.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,400
Aw! Why?

106
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,760
I’m doing my duty as Fueang’s fan.

107
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,400
By trolling those hate comments.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
There's one comment said

109
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,760
Sarut was the victim of Fueang’s bullying since high school.

110
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,960
They dug about him

111
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,600
and found his photo with the black eye long ago.

112
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
So, they claimed that Fueang did it.

113
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Such nonsense!

114
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,400
Aren’t you afraid that they’ll attack you for doing that?

115
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,280
Don’t worry. I have many fake accounts.

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,640
By the way, do you want to see Sarut’s photo?

117
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,680
I’ll send it to you.

118
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,840
No. I don’t want it.

119
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
Jealous?

120
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,200
Don’t be.

121
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,760
You’re way cuter!

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,440
What clip did you send to me?

123
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,640
It was Kor’s interview this morning.

124
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
He’s so cool!

125
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,800
Let me watch.

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,520
How about Fueang?

127
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,760
Can you tell us more about his issue?

128
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,560
Did he lie about liking women?

129
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,200
Who is Sarut?

130
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,680
I can’t answer you on his behalf.

131
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
Let's hear it from him.

132
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
Fueang will have a press conference soon.

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,680
Does it mean that you know everything?

134
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,760
Yes, I do.

135
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
I know everything about him.

136
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
He knows everything about me, too.

137
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,920
I have only one thing to say.

138
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
I love Fueang.

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,800
At the time, I lost my father

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,720
and the woman I love the most,

141
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,440
he was the only one beside me.

142
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,760
No matter what will happen

143
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,440
I’ll always protect him.

144
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,840
I won’t let anyone

145
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
who wants to mess with him get away!

146
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,440
That would be all.

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,480
Everyone is trying to support Fueang.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,600
What am I doing for him?

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,120
Fueang. Why are you sitting alone here?

150
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,360
Tada! I made you the Watermelon with dry fish.

151
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
I cut the watermelon

152
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,960
and flavored the seasoning myself.

153
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,240
Learned it from Mom.

154
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
You know what?

155
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,360
You’re so adorable for making it for me.

156
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,560
I separate the seasoning for you.

157
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,600
So, you can put it as you like.

158
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,680
This?

159
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,120
Yes.

160
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,480
Isn’t that too much?

161
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,560
Oh. Don’t worry.

162
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,200
I’ll burn it out later.

163
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
What is this?

164
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
It’s a watermelon smoothy.

165
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,680
My mom made it from the leftovers.

166
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,240
Do you want it?

167
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,640
I’ll ask her to make another one.

168
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,640
No.

169
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,160
I can drink with you.

170
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,600
This one is too sweet for you.

171
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,760
You’re stressed, aren’t you?

172
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,520
You’re always strict

173
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,800
on the amount of sugar taken.

174
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,080
You must be very stressed.

175
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Well…

176
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,040
A little bit.

177
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,600
You can postpone it.

178
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,480
Just call Madam Aoi.

179
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,000
Actually,

180
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,360
it isn’t about the press conference.

181
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,880
I just don’t know

182
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,000
how to tell my mom.

183
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,880
Your mom…

184
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,480
I’m going to meet her tomorrow

185
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,240
to tell her about the situation.

186
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,240
What do you think she will say?

187
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,400
Your relationship with him is uncertain.

188
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,640
I don’t have any problems if it's just fun.

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,280
But don’t get him involved in your personal life.

190
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
He'll be a problem after splitting up.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
You'll regret it

192
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
if you don't trust me.

193
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,080
I’ll show you

194
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,720
how serious I am with our relationship.

195
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
I can’t imagine what my mom would say

196
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
if I told her about my plan

197
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,400
to tell the world that I’m gay.

198
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,920
I still wonder if it's better

199
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,160
to let her know later.

200
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,800
Fueang. She’ll eventually understand you.

201
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,960
Although he always has positive energy.

202
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,840
But with his mom.

203
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,720
He must’ve felt discouraged

204
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,040
sometimes.

205
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
Now I know

206
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,560
what I can do for him.

207
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,000
Alright. Don’t forget to drink more water

208
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,440
and take medicine on time.

209
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,520
Thank you.

210
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:53,920
You’re welcome.

211
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,040
Hello.

212
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,160
Hello.

213
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,200
So, what did she say to you?

214
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,400
Let’s talk later.

215
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Okay.

216
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,600
Where is Jong?

217
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,640
Where were you going?

218
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
Nowhere!

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,800
Suspicious.

220
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,640
Did you get the clip?

221
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,200
Yes.

222
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,520
What clip?

223
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,960
It’s my paper clipped.

224
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,960
I just found out that I lost it.

225
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,200
You got it, right?

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,240
Yes!

227
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,920
Good!

228
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
Let’s go home.

229
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,640
- Right.
- There was nothing. Come on.

230
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,200
I’ll tell her

231
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,760
about my promotion as a dean.

232
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,080
It’ll boost her mood.

233
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,040
Then you can tell her your story.

234
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,120
Hello.

235
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,200
Hello.

236
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,080
Why didn't you bring your kids?

237
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,320
They are traveling with their mom.

238
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,080
Oh.

239
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,920
Please eat.

240
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,160
I have a press conference tomorrow.

241
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,480
Aw.

242
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,960
I don’t want to ruin your good news with my matter.

243
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,480
It’s not fair to you.

244
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,120
Mom.

245
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,720
I’m having problems,

246
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,320
and I don’t want to lie to people.

247
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,880
It’ll make things more complicated.

248
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,960
I believe that telling the truth

249
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,720
is the best way out.

250
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,200
Tomorrow’s event,

251
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,080
I’ll confess to them that

252
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,120
I’m gay.

253
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,360
I think he’s right.

254
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,200
Lying won’t get any better.

255
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,240
Right. I agree with you.

256
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,200
What did you just say?

257
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,240
Mom.

258
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,040
Fueang wants to talk to you

259
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,760
about his press conference tomorrow.

260
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,599
He…

261
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,119
He’ll confess about his sexual preference.

262
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,680
Is it such a national problem

263
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,160
that he has to make a statement?

264
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,160
Right! I think the same as you!

265
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,560
People keep prying on his sexuality

266
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,600
as if it will

267
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,680
improve economic growth

268
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,400
or make the world better.

269
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,160
What do you want?

270
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,040
Fueang said to me once.

271
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,760
He could survive in this kind of society

272
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,160
because of the positive energy.

273
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,680
But it is now running out.

274
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,560
The only person

275
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
who can bring it back

276
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,040
is…

277
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,960
you.

278
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,640
You are the person he cares about the most.

279
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,240
If you stay beside

280
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,120
and support him.

281
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,040
I believe that

282
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,320
he’ll gain energy as much as he had before.

283
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,080
What’re you waiting for? Eat it.

284
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,720
What happened to her?

285
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,160
Well, Fueang. Bring your boyfriend next time.

286
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Sure!

287
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,760
I’ll ask him after this.

288
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,520
Let’s eat.

289
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,720
Here, Mom.

290
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,080
Give that to her.

291
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,560
That’s alright.

292
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,640
Are you appeasing me?

293
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,280
Hey! Hey! Hey!

294
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,880
Can you stop walking around for seconds?

295
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,560
We’re dizzy watching you!

296
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,040
Why don’t you go home?

297
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,160
No one drags you guys here!

298
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,840
Whoa! We’re concerned about you.

299
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,880
Don’t you know?

300
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Fueang.

301
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,000
How was it?

302
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,680
It was incredible!

303
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,040
She totally understood me easily.

304
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,200
Really?

305
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
That’s nice!

306
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,760
You aren’t stressed anymore, are you?

307
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,080
Um. I’m good now.

308
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,560
She also asked me

309
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,320
to bring you next time.

310
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,400
Roen and I were so shocked.

311
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,440
We were curious

312
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,560
about what changed her.

313
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,240
It was Krom!

314
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,320
He had a conversation with your mom earlier.

315
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,000
We recorded it

316
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
as a viedo clip to show you!

317
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
You must speak it out when you did good, my friend!

318
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,640
Tell the world!

319
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,360
Tell him!

320
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,040
So, he’ll love you more.

321
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,160
Here.

322
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,280
Hello.

323
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,920
Mom.

324
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,040
Fueang will talk to you about tomorrow’s event.

325
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,400
Fueang. I didn’t want to hide it from you.

326
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,440
Krom. We need to talk.

327
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,560
Excuse us.

328
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,680
Is he gonna be alright?

329
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,800
He’s doomed.

330
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
Fueang.

331
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,640
Are you angry at me?

332
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,520
You know how I feel now?

333
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Yes.

334
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,720
Why did you talk to her?

335
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,720
I’m feeling guilty.

336
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,800
Guilty? About what?

337
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,880
Everything happened

338
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,680
Because I was drunk that day.

339
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,720
Listen to me.

340
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,160
All of the things that happened

341
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,120
were caused by many factors.

342
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,360
Your incident was just a tiny part of them.

343
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,880
Very tiny.

344
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,680
If you were there alone,

345
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,160
nothing would happen.

346
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,200
The problem was me who picked you up.

347
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,240
Don’t you see I’m the real guilty one?

348
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,520
There were those reporters

349
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,160
who made a profit from me.

350
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,160
Those anti-fans

351
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,720
who made things get worse.

352
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,520
And Sarut, who betrayed me.

353
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
See?

354
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
It was caused by many things combined.

355
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,840
So, stop feeling bad

356
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,560
and blaming yourself.

357
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,160
Got it?

358
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,640
Okay.Fine.

359
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,720
I will do that.

360
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,880
I'll always be beside you

361
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,400
and support you

362
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,360
as much as I can.

363
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,520
Good. You’re such a lovely boy!

364
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,280
Well. Let me reward you.

365
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,520
Do you want to apologize for your lying

366
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,240
that you’re not gay?

367
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,400
Do I have to?

368
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,240
People who think that gays are weird,

369
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,120
and need to apologize for what they are.

370
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,480
They need to get more education.

371
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,240
Our society should be able to move past this point.

372
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,080
Stop!

373
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,520
I’m not finished!

374
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,000
Aren’t you guys here to listen to me?

375
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,280
Then listen to me well.

376
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,120
Why the hell do you guys

377
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,440
like to meddle with my life?!

378
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,280
Hey! How could you say that?

379
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,320
Is this who he is?

380
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,800
Fueang.

381
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,080
Are you alright?

382
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,840
I must have read Kor’s script too much

383
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,560
until I dreamt about it.

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,040
He said if I was ready to retire from my career,

385
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,080
I should smash them

386
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,800
as hard as they deserved.

387
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,440
Oh, baby.

388
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,760
It’s all right.

389
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,680
Wait.

390
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800
You made me lost

391
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,880
when you called me that.

392
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,680
It must be tough this evening.

393
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,720
I wanted to soothe you.

394
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,000
Good!

395
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,200
You are right.

396
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,440
Can I use this opportunity to ask you something?

397
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
What is it?

398
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,720
Once you return to America

399
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
you must get back to me soon.

400
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,600
Don't go too long. Got it?

401
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,800
No need to ask. You knew my answer.

402
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,720
You should get ready.

403
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,640
Be strong.

404
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Thank you.

405
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
Come on, guys.

406
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,480
Let’s support our FueangNakhon.

407
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,000
Come on, girls!

408
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,920
Right here!

409
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,120
He really needs our support at this moment.

410
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,360
Hey! How is it?

411
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,760
Almost done.

412
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,480
- Hurry.
- All right.

413
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,920
Hello, Cee.

414
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,800
How is it going?

415
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,000
Please hold on.

416
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,160
My friend just came from the airport.

417
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,200
It won't take long.

418
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,640
Nice to meet all of you.

419
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,280
I’m ready for the questions.

420
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,240
Is it true?

421
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,440
Do you know that guy?

422
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,480
Is he your ex?

423
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,560
I’ll answer you straight.

424
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,480
Everything is true.

425
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,760
I like men.

426
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,720
Awesome!

427
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,960
I dated my high school friend before.

428
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,880
But I didn’t lie

429
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,320
about my manager.

430
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,280
He was willingly being my assistant,

431
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,120
and yes, we are dating.

432
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,760
Please don’t get him involved.

433
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,040
He’s not a public figure.

434
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,680
What made you decide to tell the truth?

435
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,920
It’s pointless to refuse.

436
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,080
Everyone already believed about the news

437
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,160
and people won’t stop digging up my past

438
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,840
until they find the evidence.

439
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,960
I chose to tell the truth myself

440
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,920
and I hope my answers

441
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,800
satisfy all of you.

442
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,240
I told you everything

443
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,160
and I won’t ask you much.

444
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,000
Just leave my boyfriend

445
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,040
and my family alone

446
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,680
That’s all.

447
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,160
The point is that you want to apologize, isn’t it?

448
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,520
I want to apologize on behalf

449
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,800
of my team and myself

450
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,160
that we lied to you earlier.

451
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,880
I want to say sorry to my fans

452
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,600
who have protected me.

453
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,360
I’m sorry that I embarrassed you.

454
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,520
But I won't apologize that I’m gay.

455
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Why not?

456
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,720
Have you ever apologized

457
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,800
for being straight?

458
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
Got it!

459
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Who is the guy’s name, Sarut?

460
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,360
He was my high school friend

461
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,600
and my first love.

462
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,560
I hope he’s watching this interview.

463
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,800
I want to say thank you to him.

464
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,880
I was so confused when I was young.

465
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,320
All those studying things, family issues,

466
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,800
and my awaiting future.

467
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,480
He was the one who helped me

468
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,200
go through them.

469
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,520
Let’s play football.

470
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,880
I don’t know what he is doing now.

471
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,760
But I really want to tell him.

472
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,800
Thank you.

473
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,920
Thank you so much.

474
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,159
Why did he talk about the admission test?

475
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,080
We broke up during

476
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,719
the test’s preparation.

477
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,719
It was my fault

478
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,400
that I couldn’t control myself to study.

479
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,840
Aren’t you mad at him

480
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,040
for exposing your secret

481
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,480
to the public?

482
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,639
Right.

483
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,679
I believe that he must have his reason.

484
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,199
I’m not mad at him.

485
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,600
Did you get it?

486
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,960
It’s gone. I’m sorry.

487
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,960
But you promise that you'll get it!

488
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,080
Hello, Rut!

489
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,480
Thank you for your time today.

490
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,560
Hello.

491
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,760
- Hold on.
- Please wait.

492
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,280
Fueang!

493
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,320
He’s gone!

494
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,520
We lost the chance!

495
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,040
Cee.

496
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,040
Do you know the actual age

497
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,560
of your new boy?

498
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,320
I heard that

499
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,160
he’s still underage.

500
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,880
I know

501
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,440
it’s not my business.

502
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,640
I won’t say it.

503
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,200
Because…you can go to jail if I do!

504
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,000
People will call you…

505
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,040
a child abductor!

506
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,080
She won’t say, but I will.

507
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,800
Call him!

508
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,800
Hello! Tell me the truth! How old are you?

509
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,000
Nineteen.

510
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,360
Huh! You’ll be Nineteen in a few months!

511
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,360
Why did you lie to me?

512
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,040
Kor. How is Fueang’s situation?

513
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,800
It’s better than we expected.

514
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,000
Many fans came to support him today.

515
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
However, some can’t accept it

516
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,080
and curse at him.

517
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,360
How about his work?

518
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,120
Madam Aoi sent a message to our group chat

519
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,640
that he was removed from the series.

520
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,600
They don’t want people to look at their villain's image as a gay.

521
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,520
Some brands rejected him from their presenter, too.

522
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,760
That are many.

523
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,720
It’s normal.

524
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,600
Most Thai people can’t separate

525
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,280
the idol’s personal life from his work.

526
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,360
They'll look at him as gay in whatever character he portrays.

527
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,360
They can’t imagine him with their favorite actress anymore.

528
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,320
Aw. Fueang!

529
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,040
I hope you don’t mind

530
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,120
that I talked about Sarut.

531
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,360
I don’t.

532
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,320
I have something to show you.

533
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,920
Do you remember Angun?

534
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,200
Yes.

535
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,480
I want to tell everyone that

536
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,880
I met Fueang before.

537
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,600
He was very kind to me.

538
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,040
We spent time folding stars together.

539
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,720
Fueang, please know that

540
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,160
I’ll always love you

541
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,760
no matter who you are.

542
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,080
Please stay strong.

543
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,680
I’m here to support you. Cheer up!

544
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,280
Love you.

545
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,440
I’ll always support you.

546
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,000
Don’t stop following your dreams.

547
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,960
I’ll stay beside you

548
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,160
even if you can’t make it.

549
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,720
10 o’clock?

550
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,280
Shit! It’s late!

551
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,400
There’s no work anymore.

552
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,240
Ten unread messages from Namsom.

553
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,360
Namsom.

554
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,400
Here.

555
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,240
Shake them before hanging.

556
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,880
Okay.

557
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Good.

558
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
Namsom.

559
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,880
Fueang.

560
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,320
Hello.

561
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,880
Hello.

562
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,400
Sorry for the delay.

563
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,440
I just noticed your texts.

564
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,160
I’ve got many messages lately,

565
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,000
and they put your notification at the bottom.

566
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,800
No problems.

567
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,640
How are you?

568
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,760
I have a few scenes left to shoot

569
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,120
before a long break.

570
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,360
Er. We should go for a trip together.

571
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:36,360
I… I need to check my schedule first.

572
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,960
You don’t want to meet Kor, do you?

573
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,640
I came here today

574
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,040
to tell you something.

575
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,080
Do you know

576
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,240
how I can get through those issues?

577
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,240
How?

578
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,040
I have a good partner beside me.

579
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,520
Imagine If you have someone who loves you,

580
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,000
fight alongside and protect you

581
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,880
with goodwill.

582
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,800
The one you can trust

583
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,200
to keep your secret.

584
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,560
Not easy to find one, right?

585
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,200
But I found that person.

586
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,920
And you already found yours, too.

587
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,840
You should keep him close.

588
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,880
Take care of him as I’ll do to Krom.

589
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,720
Forever.

590
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,880
I love Fueang.

591
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,080
At the time, I lost my father

592
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,280
and the woman I love the most,

593
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,280
he was the only one beside me.

594
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,360
What’s up?

595
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,840
We’re here. Hurry.

596
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,600
You came so fast.

597
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,160
Okay. I’m coming.

598
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,360
Let me wash a dish.

599
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,040
Hang on.

600
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,440
Hi.

601
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,440
What is he doing?

602
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,080
Right.

603
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,120
Go get him.

604
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,480
No. He said he’s coming.

605
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,600
There he is.

606
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,760
Come on! I don’t want to miss the teasers.

607
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,320
Yes.

608
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,600
Guys.

609
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,960
I can’t go with you now.

610
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,440
Molly, she’s the wife

611
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
of Zendaya’s owner, Simon.

612
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,000
She went on a pilgrimage

613
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,200
to Tibet earlier

614
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,280
and left Simon working alone.

615
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,880
So what?

616
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,840
He allowed people in other countries

617
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,840
to post their language in Zendaya,

618
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,880
like Fueang

619
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,360
and his fans used Thai.

620
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,760
Then?

621
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,720
Molly wasn’t happy when she knew it.

622
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,080
Because?

623
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,840
She’s researching an AI system

624
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,800
that helps filter the meaning of foreign languages

625
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,920
which my team needs to work on.

626
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,240
However, they’ve been busy

627
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,360
reviewing and deleting

628
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,400
those foreign comments.

629
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,800
It affects their time on this project.

630
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,320
So, she’s planning to cancel all foreign languages.

631
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,240
Do you understand now?

632
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,680
Nah.

633
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,400
Nah.

634
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,880
Whatever! The thing is.

635
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,280
I need to end my vacation

636
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,200
I need to go back to work.

637
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,800
Do you have to go immediately?

638
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,200
Good!

639
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,400
Hi. He came to choose the ring as arranged, right?

640
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,680
You must tell him now.

641
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,120
Faster is better for him.

642
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,600
I need to return to America tomorrow.

643
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,200
You have to be far away from your lover.

644
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,560
Don’t you feel lonely?

645
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,960
Why? We can chat

646
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,760
or make a video call.

647
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,520
But it wouldn’t be the same as when you’re together.

648
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,200
Especially when you’ve just started a relationship,

649
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,120
You’re gonna miss him badly!

650
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,160
Fueang.
