1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,240
Fueang. . .

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,600
I’ll miss you.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,440
Go live your life.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,240
Work your best.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,320
Don’t worry about anything here.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,360
I’ll love you.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,360
Be faithful to you.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,480
I’m always yours.

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,039
Hi guys.

10
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,000
We won’t make any cups of drip coffee today

11
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,479
because I don't want to waste

12
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,200
any seconds.

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,440
We have the hottest imagined couple

14
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,560
with us now.

15
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,200
Some may call them KorFueang or FueangKor.

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
Whatever.

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,320
Please welcome Koradit and FueangNakhon.

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,240
Hello.

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,240
Hello.

20
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,200
Should I call you KorFueang or FueangKor?

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
You can call any.

22
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,920
It's a pointless argument

23
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,400
about whose names

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,280
should be put in front

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
or back.

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,800
Right?

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Yes.

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,880
Um.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They said you seem to be softer when you’re not single.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,280
Not at all.

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,920
I don’t feel any different.

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
You guys were right!

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,720
I can guarantee that..

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,120
he has been

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
well-behaved

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,320
since he got back together

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,880
with Namsom.

38
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,480
You must be pretty respectful of her.

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,080
So. . .

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
How was the feedback about your dating?

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,640
It was quite positive.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,960
Which camera is on?

43
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,600
I want to say thank you

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,240
for all your love and support

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,320
for Namsom and me.

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,480
I can say that.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,840
If stars fell every time I would think of you,

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,880
the sky would soon be empty. . .

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,520
Jeez! What was into you?!

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,600
Importantly, I want to thank those

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,320
who surrounded me with their tenderness.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,079
Especially you.

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,480
You’re really changed.

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Let me ask you, Fueang?

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
How was it going?

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,760
Are you still fond of servicing your fans?

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,080
Oh! I can affirm that he’s still the same.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,120
He can be very tolerant

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,800
of anything

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,520
for his fans.

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,399
Yes.

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,920
Even if you aren’t as famous as before?

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,960
You must value them very much.

64
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,080
In fact,

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,440
they can bring me

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
both love and fear.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,480
Oops, interesting..

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,400
Can you explain that?

69
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,800
I’ve tried hard to pull off everything

70
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:42,040
throughout my career.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,040
I’ve kept myself disciplined

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,240
so as not to fail

73
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,520
their expectations.

74
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,600
But another part of me

75
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,880
still fears

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,120
that they’d hate and be angry at me

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,680
that I wasn’t good enough.

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,280
These feelings kept tearing me apart.

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,440
As most of you ever experienced.

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,960
People can easily hate

81
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,480
and get angry these days.

82
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,200
Right. I agree.

83
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
Go on.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,560
We live in a high-expectation society

85
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,720
where they frame people

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,440
like me, Kor,

87
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
and you,

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,000
that we must keep being perfect and nice

89
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,160
while they can treat us

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,960
as cruelly as they want.

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,360
Some of you took only a few minutes to criticize us

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,320
with the most evil words

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,760
that were soon to be dismissed

94
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,120
from your mind,

95
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,080
But it was we who suffered from your accusations

96
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,320
that may haunt us for our whole lives.

97
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
That was the reason I tried so hard since the beginning,

98
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,760
to avoid making those people

99
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,320
angry.

100
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,320
You found positive energies from Krom’s App,

101
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,240
didn’t you?

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

103
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,720
Fueang

104
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,760
That was the best interview

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,440
I ever heard from you.

106
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,960
What? I always put my effort into every interview.

107
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,200
Hm. It wasn’t about the effort.

108
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,360
You didn’t have to pretend

109
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,320
to be an angel.

110
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,920
It was about that you were being you.

111
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,320
What’s wrong?

112
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,080
I miss Krom.

113
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,800
I've been pulling myself so hard

114
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
not to think about him.

115
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,440
Getting tired of being an angel.

116
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,960
Hmm.. Why don't you just. . . give up?

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,640
Oops!

118
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,560
You're such a wicked!

119
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,680
Just try to change your mind.

120
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
No!

121
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
There’ll never be that day!

122
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,680
Understood?

123
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,080
Just think about it. Let me know when you give up.

124
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
I have a brothel for renting.

125
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,280
Huh?

126
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,880
Are you interested, huh?

127
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,920
Hey! I saw Krom!

128
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,920
Hah? You must be mistaken.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,200
I’m not.

130
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,520
Hold on, Fueang!

131
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,280
Fueang!

132
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,160
Krom. Krom!

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,720
Fueang! Hey!

134
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,000
What’s going on?

135
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Auntie.

136
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,720
He’s gone crazy!

137
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,200
He said he saw Krom. . . here.

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,640
Er… You must miss him too much.

139
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,559
He’s in America now.

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,360
But I really saw him.

141
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,240
He hung around the house.

142
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,360
Aw. What’s happening?

143
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,920
Oh, well.

144
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
Fueang.

145
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,400
He said he saw Krom here.

146
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,760
Oh, recently?

147
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,520
Yes.

148
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,400
That’s impossible.

149
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,240
You must mistake me for him.

150
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,000
You were confused.

151
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
You do look like him.

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Oh, I just noticed

153
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,560
how similar you and him are!

154
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,360
We’re handsome, aren’t we?

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
Yes!

156
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
Since you’re already here.

157
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,520
Please join us for dinner.

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,000
I’ll bring you plates.

159
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,680
Let me help you.

160
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,960
Okay.

161
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
That was close.

162
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
We almost got caught.

163
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,680
How was I?

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,360
Your acting was on point.

165
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,960
How was it going?

166
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,720
Kor! How come you’re here?

167
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,880
Did Krom make a surprise?

168
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,360
Oops!

169
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
Finally!

170
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,440
Did you know how long Krom plans to make a sur. . .

171
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,080
Sur. . . . .

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,720
Sur. . . . .

173
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,000
Fueang. . .

174
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,600
Krom has back, hasn’t he?

175
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,680
He’s up here.

176
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,880
Don’t rush, honey.

177
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,920
Krom.

178
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,840
Why didn’t you tell me that you were back?

179
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,760
Did you see me through the window?

180
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,560
You’d never imagine how much I missed you.

181
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,840
Sorry, pal.

182
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,360
I didn’t know he was in the house.

183
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,840
So. . . my bad.

184
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
You silly!

185
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,240
Sorry.

186
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,720
It’s alright.

187
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,160
He was the one who broke it.

188
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,840
I’m happy that you guys finally got back together.

189
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,040
I heard there’s a new restaurant

190
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,320
just opened close by.

191
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,600
I’ll give these kids a treat.

192
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,560
Isn’t it a good day to celebrate?

193
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,520
Let’s go.

194
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,440
- Yeah.
- All right.

195
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,960
No. I want to eat his mom’s cooking.

196
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,640
Whoa! You can come back later.

197
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,440
I want to try a new restaurant now. Let’s go.

198
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,360
I don't want to go!

199
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,640
Thoo! Have you ever been knocked off your feet?

200
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,080
Jeez!

201
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,800
Don’t forget to lock the door.

202
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,480
Come on.

203
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,280
Hurry.

204
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,160
Close the door.

205
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
How long will you stay?

206
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,960
This time. I don’t have to go back.

207
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,720
What? Are you serious?

208
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,400
Um.

209
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,720
I need to tell you.

210
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,720
You’re not gonna have a vacation.

211
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
Why?

212
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,480
What happened?

213
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,760
We’re opening an office in Thailand,

214
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,920
and I want you to work there

215
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,480
and continue as the manager.

216
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,680
Okay?

217
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,520
Really?

218
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,480
Yes.

219
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,840
Congratulations!

220
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,400
Thank you so much! I’ll try my best!

221
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,160
Thank you!

222
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,920
Huh! You become a manager!

223
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,720
My baby is the best!

224
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,120
But I’ll get a handful of jobs after this.

225
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,400
I might not have much time with you.

226
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,200
Don’t worry. I’ll make time for you.

227
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,280
Was it the power of love that brought us together?

228
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,120
You can do it!

229
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,120
Your coffee.

230
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,280
Here you go.

231
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,800
Spoon.

232
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
Keep up the good work, darling.

233
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,240
What’s this?

234
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,520
You’re working so hard, Navy.

235
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,400
This pot of flowers

236
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,560
will brighten you up

237
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,600
like my smiles.

238
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,119
Wow! Wonderful!

239
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,319
Right?

240
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,640
Ouch! I’m having shoulder pain.

241
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Your shoulder?

242
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,119
- Um.
- Let me massage you.

243
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,359
Just tell me where. Better?

244
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,520
Yes.

245
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,960
Oh, Fuang.

246
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,880
My waist is hurt.

247
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,560
Oh.

248
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,440
Um.

249
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,680
What did you do?

250
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,120
Oh, my legs, too!

251
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,200
Legs?

252
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,000
Um.

253
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,200
Where?

254
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,960
Here?

255
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,440
Higher.

256
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
Higher?

257
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,240
Here?

258
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,680
A little more.

259
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,640
Actually, I can give you a better treat.

260
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
But. . . we have to get inside.

261
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,080
You said it.

262
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,520
Done!

263
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,640
Aw. Did I wake you up?

264
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,880
No. Come here.

265
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,160
How are you? You’ve worked all day. Tired?

266
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,280
Pretty much.

267
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,120
Krom.

268
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,040
I’m free tomorrow. What do you want to eat?

269
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,400
I’ll get it for you.

270
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,240
Um. . . I want to eat Thai spicy sausages from Mae Kawao.

271
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
They have good reviews.

272
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,800
Mae Kawao? Why is it so familiar?

273
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,320
Where is it?

274
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,640
It is located at Mae Rim, Chaing Mai.

275
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,600
Let’s have a trip when I’m free.

276
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,400
But tonight, you can eat me instead.

277
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,520
Can I?

278
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,280
Of course.

279
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,240
Fueang.

280
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,880
Where is he going?

281
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,360
Krom.

282
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,120
Oh, Fueang.

283
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,080
Have you been up a while?

284
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,040
I just got up.

285
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,800
Where were you?

286
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,720
You said you wanted to eat Thai spicy sausages.

287
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,320
So I got them from Chiang Mai for you.

288
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,160
Oh. Chiang Mai.

289
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,880
Huh! Chiang Mai!

290
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,080
Chiang Mai is so far!

291
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,160
To please you, Mae Rim is just around the corner for me.

292
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
You really went there!

293
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,640
There’re more here.

294
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,840
Thank you. But please don’t bother next time.

295
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
I’ll bring you a plate.

296
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
He’s kept flattering me

297
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,760
since I was back in Thailand.

298
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,600
Chiang Mai. . .

299
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,080
Even though some things seemed unreasonable,

300
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,440
The fact that we can live so close together

301
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,560
allows us to recharge our power of love

302
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,920
more and more each day.

303
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Hmm. They’re so tasty!

304
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,000
That’s why he’s so addicted.

305
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,520
You must love my food so much

306
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,240
that it also made you fall in love with my boy. Right, honey?

307
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,600
Dad! Mom! Continue your eating!

308
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,320
Were we upset you?

309
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,400
Come on!

310
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,520
Are you shy?

311
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,600
Doctor.

312
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,120
How did you raise your son

313
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,720
to make him such a wonderful person?

314
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,280
He's so contrast with our son.

315
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
Were I adopted?

316
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,600
Nonsense, baby!

317
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,240
But your dad was right.

318
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,200
We’d be so blessed

319
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
If we had a son like you. Right?

320
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,440
Yes.

321
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
It’s all right.

322
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,240
We’d love to have you

323
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,120
to be our son-in-law.

324
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,480
I better go back to America.

325
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,920
Oh, we’re kidding, darling.

326
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,520
Honestly,

327
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,360
I didn’t have much influence on him back then.

328
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
He crafted all his grace himself.

329
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,520
Fueang.Let me know if his parent

330
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,840
wants to come for a checkup at the hospital.

331
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,720
I'll arrange an appointment for them.

332
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,840
Hmm. Their blood sugar result must be high, I suppose.

333
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,800
Don’t tease us!

334
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,320
You can probably take them

335
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,760
to the hospital yourself if you’re free.

336
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,880
Isn’t it good?

337
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,760
Okay.

338
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,480
Are you sure you want him to go to your workplace?

339
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,280
Of course. My colleagues and those junior nurses

340
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,200
have been waiting to see you for a long time.

341
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,600
Find some time to come over and meet them.

342
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,080
Okay?

343
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,600
Okay. All right, Mom.

344
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,160
Please come with him, Krom.

345
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,360
They want to meet you, too.

346
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,800
That’s good. You haven’t had a checkup

347
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,400
since you’ve been back.

348
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,240
I’d have a high blood sugar, too.

349
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,200
Maybe. You've eaten too many watermelons lately.

350
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,840
Here's your sour soup.

351
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,360
Thank you.

352
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,600
It’s the best.

353
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,760
Let’s eat more

354
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,120
and make less fun of me.

355
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,240
Why’re you smiling?

356
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,840
I imagine what you will look like

357
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,800
when you’re older.

358
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,000
Which doctor should I bring you to if you get a diabate?

359
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,560
All right. I’ll stop eating sweets

360
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,680
so I won’t be your burden.

361
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,360
Come on. Don’t mistake me.

362
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,160
I was thinking about how it would be

363
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,280
if we stayed together like this

364
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,920
until we grew old.

365
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,160
Um. . . We just live our ordinary life.

366
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,600
We're both working

367
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,720
and having those endless chores to do when we’re at home.

368
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,920
Live our ordinary life.

369
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,280
Would it sound so boring to you

370
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
with this ordinary life?

371
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,760
I’ll stay with you until you get tired of me.

372
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,000
It must be a long. . .

373
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,840
while then.

374
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,560
Do you have work tomorrow?

375
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,840
Tomorrow.

376
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,120
Yes, I have a fashion shoot.

377
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:46,920
You need to do more exercise.

378
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,080
It’ll make you look more fresh.

379
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,000
But if I were too exhausted,

380
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,400
I’d tell them that it’s your fault.

381
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,000
You can’t be too exhausted by just sitting.

382
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,560
I’ll never get bored of you.

383
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,520
Hold on. It’s Simon.

384
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,080
I’ll wait for you upstairs.

385
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,960
Um.

386
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,640
Hello.

387
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,760
What’s going on?

388
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,440
Huh?

389
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Huh? They might revoke their project in Thailand!

390
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,160
How could they change their mind that easily?

391
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,760
Simon said

392
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,760
most of Zendaya’s partners

393
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,400
can’t see any benefits from the Thai market.

394
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,400
Thai people are so obsessed with dramas

395
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,560
rather than valuing positive matter.

396
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,160
We’re on hold now.

397
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,000
Does it mean you have to go back there?

398
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,560
Um.

399
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,080
What did Fueang say?

400
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,880
I don’t know how to tell him yet.

401
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,800
Poor man.

402
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,840
I still remember

403
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,920
when he cried on you that day.

404
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,960
He loves you so much.

405
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,840
Is it true?

406
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,880
Wow, Roen!

407
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
It'd be very convenient if we could have an office there.

408
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,360
Yes. Good.

409
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,200
Okay.

410
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,280
All right. Thank you.

411
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,560
Krom.

412
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,960
Roen suggested many attractive rental offices.

413
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,400
My event will start tomorrow afternoon.

414
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,000
But. . .

415
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,240
We can go for a tour during the day.

416
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,720
You look so worried.

417
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,920
Is something wrong?

418
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,920
They suspend the project in Thailand.

419
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,680
Huh?

420
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,680
Well. . .

421
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,960
They're afraid that

422
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,560
they can't succeed in their business here.

423
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,840
They told me to hold it

424
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,760
and I must return to America.

425
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,240
Fueang. . .

426
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,360
Are you okay?

427
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,360
I’m not.

428
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,920
But. . .I'll be okay. I guess.

429
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,240
It's so sudden

430
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,040
that we have to be separated again.

431
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,800
Fueang. . .

432
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,480
He wants to be as famous as Kor.

433
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:44,960
He set up the camera himself.

434
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,800
I agree. Such a histrionic.

435
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,960
A new porn star is born.

436
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,280
He was poorly acting.

437
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,960
How could they hire him?

438
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,240
Indeed that he used the connections.

439
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,560
#BanFueang’sIdol.

440
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,560
What the hell!

441
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,520
A bright future awaits you with prominence.

442
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,480
I don’t want to ruin your life again.

443
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,080
Why are you chasing me away?

444
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
I’m a transgender woman

445
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,080
It won’t work,

446
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,360
no matter how hard you try.

447
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,520
They created fake news

448
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,639
about her lousy work.

449
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,920
No responsibility.

450
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,480
No one dared to hire her.

451
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Those people who created that fake news

452
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,960
without knowing anything about her

453
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,600
They should know that they’ve ruined a people’s life.

454
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,280
A good villain has gone bad. He ran off the set for his lover.

455
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,159
Would you confess that you’re gay?

456
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,320
Why did they have to insult my parents?

457
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,679
It’s okay if they blamed me alone.

458
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,679
But is it my fault

459
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,120
that I’m dating Fueang?

460
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,960
What’s going on?

461
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,400
I’m thinking. . .

462
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,400
to own their business.

463
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,000
Hah? What did you say?

464
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,720
I’ll get a deal to open Zendaya in Thailand.

465
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,360
Not only that we can be together,

466
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,160
but we also have an excellent app to use here.

467
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,360
Most Thai people are obsessed with dramas,

468
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,920
and many suffer

469
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
from them.

470
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,120
I want to use this platform

471
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,920
to give them strength

472
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,280
and positive energy.

473
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,360
I see. But. . .

474
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,040
It’ll need a lot of money.

475
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,520
I can afford it, but. . .

476
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,760
Even if I couldn’t,

477
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,840
I’m sure I can find partners.

478
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,920
Moreover,

479
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,200
I’ve been burnt out on my career for a while.

480
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,760
It’d be nice to find new challenges.

481
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,440
Like…being a trainee of Mr. Kromatha,

482
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,440
a manager of Zendaya in Thailand.

483
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,920
All right. If you made a decision,

484
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,480
then count me in.

485
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,160
Together,

486
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,640
we can bring Zendaya to Thailand,

487
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,880
Navy.

488
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,840
Deal!

489
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,520
Deal!

490
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,080
Hi, Simon.

491
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,760
My boyfriend is interested to invest in the Zendaya.

492
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,080
Since that day,

493
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,800
I’ve been coordinating with America's office

494
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,760
and Fueang is looking for partners for a joint venture.

495
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,720
Are you finding partners?

496
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,920
Yes.

497
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,600
You have many friends as a businessman,

498
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,120
don’t you?

499
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,480
Krom and I are trying to get a deal

500
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,800
to bring Zendaya to Thailand.

501
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,240
Finally,

502
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,600
it’s a day to meet with Zendaya's management team.

503
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,120
Here he is, guys.

504
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,680
Hello, Simon.

505
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,200
Hello, how was your day?

506
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,560
We’re gonna discuss about

507
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,440
Zendaya, Thailand branch.

508
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,040
First of all, I have to introduce

509
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,240
my big brother.

510
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,480
This is Mr. Koradit.

511
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,280
Hi.

512
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,800
And this is Namsom.

513
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,000
Hey.

514
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,360
Are they your partners?

515
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,320
No, they are not my partners.

516
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,400
But these two are examples of Thai people

517
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,080
who struggled with problems

518
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,360
and overcame them because of positive energy.

519
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,280
Let them tell you

520
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,080
what their stories are all about.

521
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,600
Namsom, please tell Simon.

522
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,560
Hi, Simon.

523
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,800
I have been through this situation

524
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,360
when nobody accepted me

525
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,800
when they heard I dated Mr. Koradit

526
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,720
because I am a transgender woman.

527
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,160
They attacked me with scandals

528
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,800
that I craved the spotlight from dating him.

529
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,240
People followed and shouted at me

530
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,080
whenever I went to work

531
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,480
until nobody dared to hire me.

532
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,280
I lost my job.

533
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,840
It was so difficult

534
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,240
at that time.

535
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,680
Yeah, Simon. As you can see,

536
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,880
we’ve been through the negative energy all the time.

537
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,360
So, I think

538
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,800
Zendaya in Thailand

539
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,480
will help a lot of people.

540
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,560
I would like you to consider it.

541
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,280
We’re proudly presenting

542
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,200
our new Zendaya office in Thailand.

543
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,880
Yes. We made it.

544
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
Simon acknowledged our strongest desire.

545
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,320
So he assisted us in negotiating with the Headquarters.

546
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,360
You can register

547
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,080
on the Zendaya, Thailand application now.

548
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,320
And your account will be activated the next day.

549
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,000
Now, please welcome Mr. FueangNakhon,

550
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,360
our chief executive for his statement.

551
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,760
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

552
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,080
First of all,

553
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,400
I would like to thank those

554
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,040
who were devoted to making this happen.

555
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,520
Especially, Kromatha.

556
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,160
My boyfriend.

557
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,720
Since we announced

558
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,600
to the public about Zendaya, Thailand,

559
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,400
many questions have been sent to us.

560
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,120
Why this app?

561
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,160
The thing is.

562
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,920
I can be who I am now

563
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,400
because of all the positive energy

564
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,760
I got from Zendaya.

565
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,040
Nowadays,

566
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,160
people can easily access social media.

567
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,600
we may post all our thoughts

568
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,800
without considering

569
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,440
if those words could transmit negative energy

570
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,000
that hurt others.

571
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,080
I want to use this platform

572
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,880
to express that

573
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,160
there’s still a safe place of mind for everyone

574
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,320
who wants to escape cruel criticism

575
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,680
that shattered your soul.

576
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,320
I hope our little space

577
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,520
can convey positive energy

578
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,160
to fade your bad days.

579
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,200
As my boyfriend said.

580
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,000
Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.

581
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,480
Just smile before you run out of teeth.

582
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,640
We call this space. . .

583
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,200
Zendaya.

584
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,560
My cutie boy, Krom! I’ve seen you since you were small.

585
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,840
Now, a big fan like me can rest in peace.

586
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,080
Oh, I’ve gotta get an account first.

587
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,800
Name?

588
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,840
How about KungThung?

589
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,640
Oops, no.

590
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,320
Let’s try KungNakhon.

591
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,960
Who took my name?

592
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,800
All right.

593
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,320
Since today is the launch day

594
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,480
of the Positive Energy application,

595
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,760
I want to convey good energy

596
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,560
to my loved one as well.

597
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,160
I'm more excited than I was on the first day on set.

598
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,320
Ridiculous!

599
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,280
It won't steal your spotlight on the app's launch day, right?

600
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,680
Come on.

601
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,080
The proposal is a positive matter.

602
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,800
Isn’t that our core concept?

603
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,280
Right.

604
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,760
Hey, dude!

605
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,480
You can’t keep it there.

606
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,840
Krom will notice it

607
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,840
when you hug him.

608
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,800
Don’t worry.

609
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,000
I’ll be careful.

610
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,960
Very good.

611
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,280
Let’s go. I need to get ready.

612
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
You'd better go to your seat.

613
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,800
Hey, he’s there. Hurry.

614
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,720
Congratulations!

615
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,840
You’re awesome!

616
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,480
Fueang will propose to me.

617
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,880
Propose!

618
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
I heard him talking.

619
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,120
Are you okay with that?

620
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,920
Of course.

621
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,280
I’ve actually been waiting for this day.

622
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,000
My friend got a husband!

623
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,120
Married! Married! Married!

624
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,200
Calm down.

625
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,960
Stage is yours, Kor.

626
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,760
Thank you that you’ve always been beside

627
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,840
and protecting me.

628
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,280
Today is my important day,

629
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,640
and I hope you can also mark it as yours.

630
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,920
Thanks.

631
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,040
Your imagination

632
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,720
never ever fails me.

633
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,520
Boo!

634
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,840
Namsom.

635
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,080
Will you marry me?

636
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:08,080
Yes! Yes! Yes!

637
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,800
Yes.

638
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Drive safe.

639
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,640
Hey, soon-to-be groom.

640
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,040
Hey, congratulations once again.

641
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,240
I’m happy with you, Mr. CEO.

642
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,520
Well, I’ll apply to be your employee

643
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,480
if they stop hiring me.

644
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,760
Who said I’ll accept you?

645
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,640
Um. Hmm. Douchebag!

646
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,640
Thank you.

647
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,400
For what.

648
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,320
For everything.

649
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,080
Just keep it short.

650
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,080
I don’t want

651
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,920
to make any boy cry

652
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,280
that he might bury his face into my chest.

653
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,680
You know what I mean.

654
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,160
Whoa. Stop talking nonsense.

655
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,920
Just say it.

656
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,680
Thank you.

657
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,440
Thank you for always being beside me

658
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,200
and keeping me on track.

659
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,480
I know I’m not a good person.

660
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,120
But you never aggravate me.

661
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,800
You've supported me in any way you could

662
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,880
You're my forever best friend.

663
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,000
Love you, man.

664
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,920
Are you trying to make a scene?

665
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,400
You want to bring back our vibe, don’t you?

666
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,320
Jeez! You’re such a boring!

667
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,720
I’m just kidding!

668
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,960
Where’s your sense of humor?

669
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,120
Kor.

670
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,920
Hmm?

671
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,240
I love you, too, bro.

672
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,360
What?

673
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,640
Are you serious?

674
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,720
What? Stop acting!

675
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,720
You silly!

676
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,880
What is this?

677
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,480
It’s our party.

678
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,920
What party?

679
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,440
Aw. We should celebrate

680
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,480
our achievement of bringing Zendaya to Thailand.

681
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,480
Does it have to be this big?

682
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,000
I have your favorite here.

683
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,360
Watermelon with dry fish! Where did you get it?

684
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,760
It’s from my fans.

685
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,560
Try the top one.

686
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,560
Okay.

687
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,400
What’s wrong?

688
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,520
It’s Madam Aoi. She sent me a new script.

689
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,440
Do you remember Oh?

690
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,320
The organizer whom I'm close with.

691
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,680
He wants me to play a cameo in his new series.

692
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,120
Can you help me with rehearsal?

693
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,240
Sure.

694
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,160
Why did you bring me here?

695
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,600
Because,

696
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,680
I want to tell you

697
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,960
how important you are to me.

698
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,440
Enough. Our relationship was over.

699
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,280
It has never been over.

700
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,160
We just start it.

701
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,840
Will you marry me?

702
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,160
Well. . .

703
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,720
There is no script here.

704
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,520
It wasn’t script.

705
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,200
That question is from me.

706
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,680
Ah! You must hide the ring here.

707
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,960
I knew it.

708
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,000
Where is it?

709
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,480
Isn’t it in here?

710
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,840
Baby.

711
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,480
It must’ve been dirty

712
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,040
if I had hidden it there.

713
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,280
The ring is here.

714
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,200
So.

715
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,160
Will you marry me?

716
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,440
Yes.

717
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,320
This ring.

718
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,680
It is beautiful.

719
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,720
I thought you forgot it.

720
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,880
I’ll never forget any thing

721
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,160
about you.

722
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,360
Let’s be together like this

723
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,280
forever.

724
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,600
Okay.

725
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,400
Mom! Look at this!

726
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,960
Wow! The ring!

727
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,200
Don’t tell me that. . .

728
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,080
Honey! You must see this!

729
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,200
What?

730
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,560
What the hell!

731
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,160
Check your phone!

732
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,120
Let's spread positive energies together.
