1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,120
Are you going to work today?

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,480
Yes. It’s almost time to go.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,600
Can I go with you?

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,000
I would be so worried about you if you came.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,920
I beg.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,080
You don’t want me to become crazy, do you?

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,160
This is FueangNakhon’s secret.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
Was it the Power of Love

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,040
that brings us together.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,880
He’s just having a bad singing,

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,160
why they hate him like he commits a crime.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,280
Free tasting.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,200
Please take it.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,600
Please stop, Namsom.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Enough.

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,320
Please don’t ruin my life again.

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,000
Are you done here?

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,160
Let’s find somewhere to talk.

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,160
How does Namsom work?

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,640
Good. She’s beautiful, talented, patient.

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
What's up, Namsom?

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,560
Please help me say thank you to Krom.

23
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,320
Was it about him suggesting you work with his friend?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,440
You must take good care of him.

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,640
Sure.

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,320
Here’s the Dry fish with watermelon from mom.

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,840
This clip is not for Yayee.

28
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,560
It is for you, Krom.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,160
I love you.

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,720
Now… I’m going to kiss you.

31
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,000
I kissed my darling.

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,400
Wait. When did I become yours?

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,240
Since… now.

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,920
“Beauty lies in lover’s eyes.”

35
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,479
I realized its meaning

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,360
just now.

37
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,800
Love makes the world brighter.

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,160
My every minute is worth more than ever.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
The air that I breathe

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,840
doesn't feel the same.

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,360
Everything seems to be different

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,199
because of him.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,640
Hello, what’s up?

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
Hello. Where’s my clip?

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,079
I’m busy. I’ll send you later.

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,400
Not later! Send it now!

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Did I tell Namsom to wait

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,480
when she needed help?

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
All right! You're annoying.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,640
Now!

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,680
Got it!

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Let me see.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,840
This clip isn’t for Yayee.

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,000
It is for you, Krom.

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,800
Don’t stop recording.

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,840
I want you to keep it as a reminder.

57
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,280
If there’s a day that we fight each other

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,120
or if I did something terrible to you,

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,800
please use this clip to warn me.

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,880
Namsom asked me to thank you

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,800
for what you did to her.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,960
The more I stayed with you, the more it ensured me that

63
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,320
I did it right by letting my heart

64
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,200
rules my head.

65
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,600
From now on, I’ll give you my everything.

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
I’ll take care of you

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,280
and I could be anything you want me to be.

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,400
I love you.

69
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,480
Now… I’m going to kiss you.

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
You can continue recording or stop it.

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,880
I don't mind.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,080
Krom! Get your ass here!

73
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Krom!

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,560
Krom!

75
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I’m coming.

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,880
What the heck!

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,320
You should tell me first!

78
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,920
I called you hundreds of times, and you didn’t answer my chat!

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,400
I’ve been working!

80
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,120
I love you, Krom.

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Where did you get this?

82
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,720
Didn’t you tell me to tell no one?

83
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,440
Who spilled the beans now?

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,400
I knew you guys kept something from me.

85
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,720
But I’d never imagine that you’re dating with Fueng!

86
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,720
Are you going to tell the world?

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Spit it out. Tell me everything.

88
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,840
Come on! Hurry!

89
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,520
You haven’t told her yet?

90
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,040
No. You should explain her yourself.

91
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,440
I don’t know if I should tell her all.

92
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,800
Whoa! Just tell me everything!

93
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,200
Aren’t we friend?

94
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,840
Alright. Get in to my house.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Can you open the door?

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,840
Of course!

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
Sit!

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,400
Did he crush on you since before you were back?

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,040
So, he got a Zendaya account because of you.

100
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,480
No. He’s already had his account

101
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,920
since before he knew me.

102
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
So romantic.

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,960
Well, then…

104
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,760
Did you guys make it out?

105
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,800
See? Everyone is keen to know

106
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,720
how yummy he is.

107
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
You’re brats!

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
So what? Did you?

109
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,120
Not yet.

110
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,800
What are you waiting for?

111
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,240
Waiting for him to start, okay?

112
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,160
What about that kiss in the clip?

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
Did he kiss you?

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,800
No.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,480
No kiss?

116
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,280
No way we didn’t kiss!

117
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,520
I wish I were you, Krom!

118
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,960
Krom. Hey, Krom.

119
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,560
Who’s that? He sounds likes Fueang.

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,080
It’s Fueang. He’s my neighbor.

121
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,440
Your neighbor! Since when?

122
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,640
It’s been a while.

123
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
Oy! You jerk!

124
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,680
What else are you hiding?

125
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,320
Krom. Where’re you?

126
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,480
Hey, Thoo. Go hide!

127
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,040
Just act normal.

128
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,000
Don’t tell him that we’re here.

129
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,720
I want to see him when he’s crazy in love.

130
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,320
No way. You’ll record us.

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,920
No, I won’t do that.

132
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,320
There! Behind the bar.

133
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,920
- My bag!
- Behind the bar.

134
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
Whoa! Hurry!

135
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
Aw, Fueang.

136
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I miss you, darling.

137
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,760
He said no record.

138
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,920
He's so cute.

139
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,160
I need a kiss to charge my battery.

140
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,640
Please don't break up with my friend!

141
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,680
I promise.

142
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
Ay!! He's so handsome! Look!

143
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
Let’s go out for dinner at 7 p.m.

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
I’ll take you to a good place.

145
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,400
Everyone is keen to know

146
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,400
how yummy he is.

147
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,040
Calm down, Krom. That's ridiculous.

148
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,480
Should I go with him?

149
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Or shouldn't I?

150
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,400
Let's do it.

151
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,000
Hey! Where are my pants?

152
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Aw, Fueang.

153
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Why are you dressing like this?

154
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,280
You said you’ll take me for dinner.

155
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,960
I thought you’d drive your car there.

156
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,040
I wanted to take you

157
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,960
where they have delicious food.

158
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,800
Snacking and strolling.

159
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,000
We’d got stuck in traffic with the car.

160
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,720
I see.

161
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,960
It's alright. There's no need to change it.

162
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,400
Come here.

163
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,080
Okay.

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,760
Here. Let me help you.

165
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,840
Stay still.

166
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,480
Is it too tight?

167
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,360
No.

168
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,080
Let’s go.

169
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,440
Are you hungry?

170
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,120
Yes.

171
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,840
I know many secret places with excellent food.

172
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,240
Okay.

173
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,040
Don’t get full so soon. Okay?

174
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,280
Um.

175
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,360
Let’s go.

176
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
You should tell me that you’re coming.

177
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
It was lucky that this space was empty.

178
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,080
Would you close this Zone for me, please?

179
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,560
Sure. Take your time.

180
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,240
This is our signature dish.

181
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,320
Have a wonderful meal.

182
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,760
Thank you.

183
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,040
I hope you’re not too full.

184
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,120
Their soybean curd is the best.

185
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,960
I don’t want you to miss it.

186
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,480
I won't.

187
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,280
Hmm! So tasty!

188
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,080
Very nice view.

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,640
The owner is Madam Aoi's friend.

190
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,080
She likes to take us here late at night.

191
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,280
It’s private.

192
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,920
Wait. Why do you laugh?

193
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,520
Is my humming that terrible?

194
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,200
No.

195
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
It's just your singing in that event

196
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,360
still stuck in my head.

197
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,640
Was it the Power of Love

198
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,120
that brings us together.

199
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,920
It’s amazing that I can love you.

200
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
Hey. Are you teasing me?

201
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
If you don’t like to sing,

202
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,280
why didn’t you refuse it?

203
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,800
It’s because of Madam Aoi and Sand.

204
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,880
They always accepted the singing events.

205
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,560
They said

206
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,840
I don’t need to sing well,

207
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,960
My fans will still understand me.

208
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Even that, it was still embarrassing though.

209
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,560
I sang out of tune in every key.

210
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,680
Don’t you have the freedom to choose your job?

211
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,440
Honestly, not much.

212
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,000
But I must admit that

213
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,000
Madam Aoi always got me good ones.

214
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,120
Every job she chose either paid well

215
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,280
or was helpful in terms of connections.

216
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,640
Unsafe Cosmetics,

217
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,000
Dangerous face cream,

218
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,000
or diet pills,

219
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,720
they’ll never get close to me.

220
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,000
Very well care about consumers.

221
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,200
No.

222
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,040
All she concerns about is my image.

223
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,880
She said those products

224
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,000
will ruin my reputation.

225
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
She’ll choose only jobs that enhance my image.

226
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,760
But I wonder why she likes to accept singing jobs.

227
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,720
If I could sing like before,

228
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,640
Madam Aoi will force me to sing every month.

229
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,760
Were you a good singer earlier?

230
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,280
I’m not bragging.

231
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,800
You may not know that

232
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,920
I was my school's singing champion before.

233
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,720
Then what happened?

234
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Fueang.

235
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,840
You can talk to me anything.

236
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,200
Listen.

237
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,600
I want to be the one that you can tell everything.

238
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,640
I actually liked to sing before.

239
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,560
Fueang.

240
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,920
Dad.

241
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,640
What’re you doing? Why didn’t you go home?

242
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,560
I’ve done my homework and reading.

243
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,640
Don’t let me see you do this nonsense again.

244
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,320
Give me that guitar.

245
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,760
Let go of it.

246
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,760
Don’t let me see you do this nonsense again.

247
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,200
Since that day

248
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,760
I’ve never had any confidence to sing again.

249
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,600
His face and the voice of my friend’s laughing

250
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,000
always showed up in my head.

251
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,000
Fueang.

252
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,640
Are you consoling me?

253
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,920
So cute.

254
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,840
Well… I’m really fine now.

255
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,000
If you were fine, as you said

256
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,600
you wouldn’t lack of confidence when you sang.

257
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,480
Fueang. You must forgive your dad.

258
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Forgive but not forget.

259
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,040
I know it is hard.

260
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,160
But, you must understand that

261
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,440
he meant well to you even if his actions hurt you.

262
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,440
Sometimes he might forget that

263
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,200
you also has your own life.

264
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,920
Once you're ready to forgive your dad,

265
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
the knot in your heart would be untied, too.

266
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,720
Those negative thoughts that are in your mind will disappear

267
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,600
and you’ll come back to sing as well as before.

268
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,480
I didn’t just say it.

269
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,520
Simon often sent me and my colleagues

270
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,640
to train with psychologist.

271
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,680
He said if you want to create positive energies,

272
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,640
you must have positive thinking, too.

273
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,360
Otherwise, it’d be fake.

274
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,000
I will try.

275
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,480
You can do it.

276
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,920
Well, let’s continue eating. Here.

277
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,200
Hmm.

278
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,560
My Turn.

279
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,680
Lin Lan.

280
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,520
Fei Lin.

281
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,080
Lin Lan.

282
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,840
Fei Lin.

283
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,160
Cut!

284
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,280
Okay. Change the scene.

285
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,120
Fueang. Kor.

286
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,920
Go say hi to Mr. Lee.

287
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,880
Okay.

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,560
No.

289
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,720
What?

290
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,520
You should take care of me

291
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,960
not bring me issues.

292
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,200
Do you want a punch?

293
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,760
Just do what I said.

294
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,760
It’s Madam Aoi’s order.

295
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Nope.

296
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,320
I’m already tired from that fighting scene.

297
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,320
I don’t even know that guy at all.

298
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,680
Uh! Is he sitting next to Madam Aoi?

299
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,040
Yes. Mr. Lee.

300
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,080
He’s the owner of many products.

301
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,000
I can’t remember the brand.

302
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,320
However,

303
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,240
he’s the main sponsor of this movie.

304
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,840
That’s why she wants you guys to greet him.

305
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
If you get chances to be his brand’s presenter,

306
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,920
it’ll top up your career path.

307
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,560
Sand.

308
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,440
Very good.

309
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,000
Such a fast move.

310
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,760
Press there.

311
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,240
He’s very good at it.

312
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,640
Well, let’s go.

313
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,640
You can change your costume, Fueang.

314
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,800
Please wait here, Kor.

315
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,040
I’ll call the make-up artist for you.

316
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,920
Vinegar.

317
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,560
Fueang.

318
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,640
Hmm?

319
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,200
Do you still use the same passcode for this phone?

320
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,600
The same one.

321
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,880
Why?

322
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,280
Oh. It’s about the trainer, Golf.

323
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,800
Someone I know wants to have his contact.

324
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,880
- I transferred you the amount I borrowed you yesterday.
- So, he wants to train with Golf?

325
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,720
My mom is fine.

326
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,560
Can I check from your phone?

327
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,240
Yes. His number should be there.

328
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,040
How was it? Did you find it?

329
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,600
Hello.

330
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
Hello.

331
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,240
Hello?

332
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,280
Here is your favorite.

333
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,240
Chinese sausage. Eat a lot.

334
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,880
I burnt it a bit for you.

335
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,320
You burnt it?

336
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,400
Yes. Eat more.

337
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,160
But it’s not healthy. Too burnt.

338
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,520
But it'll be tastier.

339
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,160
Did Fueang busy recently?

340
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,720
It’s been a while since his last coming.

341
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,560
Sure.

342
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,680
He’s been shooting the night scenes.

343
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,000
Don’t you have to go take care of him anymore?

344
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,240
I don’t have to.

345
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,600
He’s afraid that I’d be too exhausted.

346
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,480
Um Hmm. That’s lovely.

347
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
He really concerns about my son.

348
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
Aw. Are you full?

349
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,400
Um.

350
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,560
Baby, please wash your dish, too.

351
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,960
What’s wrong with him?

352
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,920
He still needs more time to think about you and Fueang.

353
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,240
Think?

354
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,640
Think about what?

355
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,480
Well. Need I say more?

356
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,280
Hmm.

357
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
You already knew it!

358
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,080
Oh ho! It is so obvious.

359
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,040
I also knew that, previously,

360
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
he often came by our house

361
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,760
just to listen to your story.

362
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,880
I told your dad before.

363
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,840
But he said I imagined it myself.

364
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,760
Until you came back

365
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,120
and your dad saw you both were so close.

366
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,800
Not to mention that Fueang's eyes always show he's crazy in love with you.

367
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,720
Your dad now admits that I’m right.

368
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,600
Okay.

369
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,880
Just give him sometimes.

370
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,240
He’ll get over it.

371
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Alright.

372
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,160
But if he doesn’t,

373
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,120
I’ll deal with him for you.

374
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,960
You’re all grew up.

375
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,760
You can take care of yourself.

376
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,040
You never cause us any problems.

377
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,800
That’s more than we ask for.

378
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,760
I love you so much.

379
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,640
I knew.

380
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,880
But are you sure

381
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,760
that he doesn’t have someone else?

382
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,280
You just said he’s crazy in love with me.

383
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,000
It doesn’t mean that

384
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,920
he can’t feel the same way with others.

385
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,360
He’s very lovely and he’s also an actor.

386
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,600
Everyone wants to get close to him.

387
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,160
How can you be so sure that he’s faithful?

388
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,960
I must ask you this

389
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,400
because I don’t want you to feel sorry about it later.

390
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,280
Hmm?

391
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,800
Um. I’m confident about him.

392
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,400
There is no one else.

393
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,520
Fueang.

394
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,440
It’s alright.

395
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,920
Fueang.

396
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,360
Fueang. Did you wake up?

397
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,360
Is he still sleeping?

398
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,800
Fueang.

399
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,040
Fueang.

400
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Didn’t you ask me to go to the gym?

401
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,880
Fueang.

402
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
Are you coming for Fueang?

403
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
Who’s that?

404
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,480
Aw, Krom!

405
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,920
I didn’t know that you had a guest.

406
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,440
Ah… I…

407
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,080
Excuse me.

408
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,720
Krom.

409
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,800
Mom!

410
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,520
Honey.

411
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,120
Krom.

412
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,560
Fueang…

413
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,320
He really has someone else.

414
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,400
Oh, honey.

415
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
I should trust you.

416
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,360
It’s alright, honey. Don't cry.

417
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,200
Krom.

418
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,640
Are you alright?

419
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,840
I’m alright.

420
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,280
This is Roen.

421
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,280
Charoenkrung. My brother.

422
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,680
Your brother.

423
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,240
Your brother.

424
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,560
Oh. You’re Kromtha.

425
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,880
I’m his brother. We’re siblings.

426
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,040
Ah! Siblings.

427
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
You guys look so similar.

428
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,240
Uh. I’ll wait for you outside.

429
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,000
Sorry for interrupting.

430
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,000
His brother.

431
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,920
Krom, you fool!

432
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,920
Thanks for the ride.

433
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,480
I'm leaving.

434
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,440
He’s pretty cute though.

435
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
He really is.

436
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,280
Are you serious about this one?

437
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,760
Of course.

438
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
At first, it was only like, but now I love him.

439
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,280
but now I love him.

440
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
I’m happy with you.

441
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,680
Fight for your love.

442
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,520
I wish you luck!

443
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,520
Thanks.

444
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,120
What were you arguing with Mom last night?

445
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,840
Do you want me to talk to her?

446
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,080
It’s alright.

447
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,440
I only hope she’ll understand that

448
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,680
May asked me to divorce

449
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,640
because she’s having someone else,

450
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,520
not because I’m gay.

451
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,560
That’s what I need.

452
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Well. You’d better go.

453
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,360
Bye. See you later.

454
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,560
She came so fast.

455
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,480
Because you were waiting for me.

456
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,200
I drove here at my full speed.

457
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,080
Didn’t I tell you don’t drive too fast?

458
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,920
I'm kidding.

459
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,120
Roen had an urgent,

460
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,720
so I had to rush him home.

461
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,400
What’s going on?

462
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,000
You look worried.

463
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,880
When I first saw Roen in your room,

464
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,920
my heart fell to the ground.

465
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,360
Now I am so sure

466
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,760
that I really like you so much.

467
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,120
That’s all good.

468
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,040
Then why do you look sad?

469
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
My mom.

470
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,320
She worried that you might have someone else.

471
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,400
Wait. Did she know about us?

472
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,320
Um.

473
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,480
She knew.

474
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,880
She also knew you came to my house

475
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,360
to seek my stories.

476
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,840
Really?

477
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,400
She kept acting all along.

478
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,040
Isn’t she good?

479
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,600
Yes. She’s an outstanding actress.

480
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,560
I should suggest her to Madam Aoi.

481
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,840
Only my mom?

482
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,640
Both of you!

483
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Don’t worry.

484
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,320
I won’t have anyone else but Navy.

485
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,680
Navy?

486
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,200
Aw! I heard your colleagues call you that.

487
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,240
I want to call you Navy, too.

488
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
It’s cute.

489
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,080
But I don’t want you to call me that.

490
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,800
Aw. What do you want me to call you?

491
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,160
I prefer you to call me

492
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,639
“Darling.”

493
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,239
Alright.

494
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,000
Navy?

495
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,199
My darling.

496
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,360
Don't be paranoid.

497
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,080
One more?

498
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
Hello.

499
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,280
Hello.

500
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,040
Hello?

501
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,360
I’ll block you if you don’t speak.

502
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,720
Namsom, I…

503
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,680
It's you!

504
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,320
Someone is calling you, Krom.

505
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,960
What’s up, Fueang?

506
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
Can you come to see me?

507
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,440
Krom?

508
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,440
Okay.

509
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,800
Who’s that?

510
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,640
I’m leaving, Kung.

511
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,080
I asked who’s that?

512
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,000
My friend.

513
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm going.

514
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,160
Good luck.

515
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,200
Please put away my shirt.

516
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,320
Bye Bye.

517
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,840
You look weird.

518
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,920
Fueang.

519
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,160
Fueang?

520
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,760
Fuang.

521
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,600
Fuang.

522
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,720
What are you doing?

523
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,040
I want you to know that,

524
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,440
from now on, I can’t live without you.

525
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,240
I don’t know why, but your smile

526
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,920
hypnotized me into a trance.

527
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,320
That was my feelings when we first met.

528
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:19,000
Whenever I feel sad, I look into your eyes.

529
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,200
You console me and boost me up.

530
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,720
I can feel that and it’s so warm.

531
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:34,120
Maybe it was destiny

532
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:40,280
that put us together.

533
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,120
You’re another part of my life.

534
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,120
You’re always beside me.

535
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,080
I won’t ask anything for me.

536
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,760
Just holding our hearts together.

537
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,840
It’s paradise. Our moments are beautiful.

538
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,640
We belong to each other.

539
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,800
Because all my life is you.

540
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,640
Finally, you can do it.

541
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,880
I could find my way to sing,

542
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,680
all because of ...

543
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,840
...you.

544
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,000
Thank you.

545
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Navy?

546
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,400
You’re another part of my life.

547
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,040
You’re always beside me.

548
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,560
I won’t ask anything for me.

549
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,920
Just holding our hearts together.

550
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,480
It’s paradise. Our moments are beautiful.

551
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,040
We belong to each other.

552
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,600
Because all my life is you.

553
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm proud of you, darling.

554
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,840
You’re another part of my life.

555
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,480
You’re always beside me.

556
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,000
I won’t ask anything for me.

557
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,360
Just holding our hearts together.

558
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:01,920
It’s paradise. Our moments are beautiful.

559
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,480
We belong to each other.

560
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,040
Because all my life is you.

561
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,880
is you.

562
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,840
is you.

563
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,800
How is it?

564
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
Having Fueang as your wife.

565
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:55,800
You jerk!

566
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,560
Does he have a lover?

567
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,400
Hmm?

568
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,840
I have to shoot many love scenes with him.

569
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,600
I don’t want to make his lover get angry.

570
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,000
Don’t worry. His lover will understand.

571
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,600
Fueang. I love you.
