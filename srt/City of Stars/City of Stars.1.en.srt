1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
- What happened?
- Is it true?

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,720
- It wasn't Fung’s fault!
- I can't believe it!

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,320
- Did you guys catch up?
- We need an explanation!!!

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,840
- This is a bomb!
- Was it really Fueang?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,120
- His ex exposed all the secrets.
- I’m on the right side.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,600
His career will end!

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,880
So worried for him.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,600
Dark side of the villain.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,440
When is the press conference?

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,120
Calm down everyone.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Guys! His agency has now confirmed that

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
they'll arrange a press conference today

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
about the hottest topic of Fueang Nakhon's scandal.

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,800
Someone posted a bomb

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,800
about his mysterious leaked photo with FueangNakhon.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,680
Who claims to be FueangNakhon's ex.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,960
His ex! For anyone who was out of town.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,280
It's now time for you to like and subscribe to my channel.

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,800
I guarantee to serve you some spices! Ouch!

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,920
My name's FueangNakhon,

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,760
a well-known villain celebrity.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,360
- Can we have your time for a bit?

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,360
Would you give us explanation?

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,200
Please excuse me, everyone.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,440
This is not my first time

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
and I've been always gone through them with my positive attitudes.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,040
But what I want to say today will change everything.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,880
I know you guys can't wait to hear it. Here the stories.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,680
Let me start with my favorite part.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,120
Everyone calls it  Zendaya .

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,680
3 months ago.

32
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,600
ZENDAYA, Silicon Valley San Francisco Bay Area

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,200
Do you know  Zendaya  app?

34
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,440
ZENDAYA has the same functions as Facebook,

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,480
X, or Instagram as you already used to.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,560
But every message or image in ZENDAYA

37
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
must contains positive contents.

38
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,560
Any post that conflicts with this condition will be immediately deleted.

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,480
Everything had seemed smooth until one Thai actor showed up.

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,640
Let's spread positive energies together.

41
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,320
- Oh my God! He finally has an account!
- My husband!

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,920
- I'll follow you everywhere!
- Let's get Zendaya account!

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,400
- CI
- I want to hear you call me dear.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,079
- He makes me want to be single!
- Get back home now honey.

45
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,880
- I'm ready for you here baby.
- Give me once and I won't ask for more!

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,240
Since that time, we never found our peaceful.

47
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,680
Especially me, Kromatha. The one and only Thai developer here.

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,240
Ah… Mr. Navy.

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,440
Yes?

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,320
Ah… this word.

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
What does it mean chip?

52
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,920
Cheep?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
Chip. Chip.

54
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh… Ship. Pass!

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,959
Navy.

56
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,399
Hmm?

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,200
Sedute.

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,200
Sedute.

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,240
Sedute.

60
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,120
Sedute?

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,440
Ah… Seduce!

62
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,640
Delete it!

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,240
Navy. Navy.

64
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,280
What?

65
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,880
place.

66
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,960
place.

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
place.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
place.

69
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,840
praise!

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,360
Pass.

71
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,760
Navy.

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,000
carm.

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Huh?

74
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,720
carm.

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,520
Caam? Curm? Culm?

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,720
Oh… Cum!

77
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,880
Delete!

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,880
Navy.

79
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,320
Yes?

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,640
- Navy!
- Navy!

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,800
Navy. You need to take care of this

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,680
while you on vacation in Thailand. Okay?

83
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,000
Hmm? My vacation?

84
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,040
Um.

85
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,200
If you ask me, how do I feel about FueangNakhon.

86
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,120
I would say I don't like him much.

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,960
He made me say goodbye to my peaceful vacation.

88
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,280
SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT Bangkok, Thailand

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,320
Mom. I'm outside.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Hmm? You're not arrive?

91
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,400
That's fine. I'll find a seat.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
I arrived now.

93
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,240
How long will you stay?

94
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,640
Three months. Hello my long vacation!

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Well. Did you guys know about this news?

96
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
What is it?

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,440
They're actively in search of the serial killer who had multiple stabbed a debtor before slipping away.

98
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,200
Dang! That's scary!

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,120
You'd better watch out, Krom. Strolling around alone is not safe.

100
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,200
Don't worry.

101
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,440
I won't be that lucky since the first day of returning.

102
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,200
Excuse me. Can I sit here?

103
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,360
Hmm?

104
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
Can I sit with you?

105
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,000
I think… This's the only seat available.

106
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,880
Ah... Sure.

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,720
Oh… please sit.

108
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,160
Hello? Did you find Jack?

109
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,600
What? How come?!

110
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
I stabbed him several times last night.

111
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,000
He had no escape!

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,840
Do I need to tell you everything?!

113
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Go to his parent's house. Let them pay his debt!

114
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
and if they won't give you…

115
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,360
Blow them away!

116
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,240
Make it clean. Don't let things bother me.

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,520
Shit! I'm sitting with a man who said…

118
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,360
The guy who sat next to me last night

119
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,320
I know he heard my conversation with Jack.

120
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,520
Go get him before he splits about it.

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,840
Are you asking me how?!

122
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,080
Just find a way to kill him!

123
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,560
Mister…

124
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,080
Hey… Did I scare you?

125
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,080
I'm sorry. It was a rehearsal for my play.

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,640
Rehearsal?

127
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,400
Eh… You are?

128
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,320
I'm FueangNakhon.

129
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,280
FueangNakhon!

130
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,400
Fueang! It's him!

131
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
I like you so much!

132
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,560
Can I take a picture with you?

133
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,600
Yes.

134
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
I have been following you for a long time

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,560
Can I take a picture too?

136
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,960
I'll call my mom and dad.

137
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,240
Hello Krom.

138
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
Where are you?

139
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,840
Krom!

140
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,520
Turn around.

141
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:27,840
Behind you.

142
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
Just turn around. I'm here!

143
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
My son!

144
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,680
Dad. Mom.

145
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,520
You're big! My lovely boy! I miss you so much!

146
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,440
Me too.

147
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,160
I always think of you.

148
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,000
You look more beautiful.

149
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,560
Oops! You're so sweet. Do you like it?

150
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,840
Finally.

151
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040
Home sweet home.

152
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,960
Wish I could stay here for a year.

153
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
- His guitar is so long…
- Do I really have to work on my vacation?

154
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,120
Gosh! I should be able to relax by now

155
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,920
Why do I have to waste my time for that villain?

156
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,320
I’ll act like I didn't see it.

157
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,440
No, I can't!

158
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,680
This is for Zendaya! Come on!

159
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,320
Not a big deal.

160
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,880
You can do it!

161
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Eat more honey.

162
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,000
Here you go.

163
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
Wow. Looks good dad.

164
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,160
Let's eat.

165
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,880
Oh! It's fantastic!

166
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,160
There's no one can cook like you mom.

167
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,120
Really? Why don't you stay in Thailand for good then?

168
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,120
I'll cook for you every day.

169
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,400
Oh, mom. I'm still having fun there.

170
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,280
Huh!

171
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,240
Um.

172
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,040
Krom. You’ve been living in America for a while now.

173
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,240
You mother is now having a new favorite son.

174
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,480
New son?

175
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,880
Um.

176
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,640
Well… We got a new neighbor.

177
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,480
He just moved in two months ago.

178
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,040
Your mom was so excited. She already called him son.

179
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,960
Why haven't you told me that there's a celebrity live next to us?

180
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,760
He wants to keep it secretly.

181
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,120
He moved here because of the great security.

182
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,600
Our village is magnificent.

183
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,080
He needs a high privacy.

184
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,120
There're a lot of his fans out there.

185
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,360
Is he that famous?

186
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,440
Indeed! He's so famous!

187
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,600
By the way.

188
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,680
I made dry fish with watermelons for you.

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,080
It's your favorite. I'll bring for you.

190
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
Don't worry, mom. I'll get it myself.

191
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,400
Okay.

192
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,120
The watermelons are in the fridge.

193
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
okay.

194
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,680
Don't forget to put sugar and dry fish. They're on the table.

195
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,960
Let's eat.

196
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,920
Hmm! So fresh!

197
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,080
Mom! Do you have more dry fish?

198
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,280
It's so good.

199
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,320
Do you like it?

200
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,360
Is it your favorite?

201
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,240
Let me help.

202
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,000
Here.

203
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,840
Eat more.

204
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
Do you want some? It's yummy.

205
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm good.

206
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,880
Fueang. This is my son whom I told you about.

207
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,120
Krom. He's the celebrity who recently moved in next door.

208
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,040
He’s Fueang.

209
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,960
Nice to see you.

210
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
Please eat, Fueang.

211
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,600
Thanks mom.

212
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,720
What a coincidence!

213
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,320
My flight from Japan was shifted to today too.

214
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,720
That's why you look so familiar when I met you at the airport.

215
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,960
Your parent told me that you're working at Zendaya.

216
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,760
I’m so excited.

217
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I truly admire your application's concept of making a better society.

218
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,320
I believe that this application will become much more popular soon.

219
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,960
If I take a picture with you and post it?

220
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,040
Would it be alright?

221
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Is it confidential?

222
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,080
Can I take a picture with you?

223
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,800
Hey, honey! Let's check the barbecues!

224
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,520
Oh, yes.

225
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,760
Are they burnt?

226
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,720
Alright.

227
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,640
Thanks.

228
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,200
Smile.

229
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,080
One. Two.

230
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,320
Dad. Mom. Do you need a hand?

231
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,240
Oh. Good.

232
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,560
Take what you like, Fueang.

233
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,840
They look so nice.

234
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
You made all of these?

235
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,560
You don't need to walk me home.

236
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,320
I come to lock the door.

237
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,760
Eh!

238
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,600
How could you enter my house?

239
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,760
Your mom copied me a key.

240
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,000
I can enter your house anytime.

241
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,800
Can you do that?

242
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,119
Of course.

243
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,640
I can come and check if your mom needs my help.

244
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,200
Well… What if you enter late at night?

245
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,480
and I think you're a thief or…

246
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,160
what if I'm naked!

247
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,160
That must be terrible!

248
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Then... When I'm about to unlock this door,

249
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,360
I'll send you a secret signal before I enter your house.

250
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,160
Good.

251
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,440
Nice to officially meet you.

252
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
Alright! Nice to meet you, too.

253
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,520
Don't forget to check my post in Zendaya after this.

254
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,320
Are you okay?

255
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,560
I'm okay.

256
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,360
You!

257
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,280
Well. See you later.

258
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,120
Hey! You drove too fast!

259
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,360
Whoa! You're so annoying!

260
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,520
Are you an old lady?

261
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,520
Jeez! You make me think about that person.

262
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
I don't know what's wrong with him.

263
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,640
He kept rushing me here. Said there's urgent.

264
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,160
I was in a party.

265
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,400
Ouch! You stink of alcohol!

266
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,320
You'd better get rid of it

267
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,080
before he notices and punishes you.

268
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,400
Is it smelling?

269
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,160
I only took two glasses.

270
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,160
What're you waiting for?! Take a shower and spray some perfume!

271
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,880
Why are you so bossy?

272
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
I know what to do!

273
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,160
Who’s that?

274
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,120
He is their son.

275
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,840
Mr. Kromatha.

276
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,960
Hmm… Krommatha.

277
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
So familiar.

278
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,160
I see. That's why you were so mad.

279
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,920
Hurry!

280
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,520
okay.

281
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
Don't forget to spray. It smells ever strong.

282
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,600
There's a wonderful thing happened to me today.

283
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,520
I had a chance to meet with a Thai guy who works at Zendaya.

284
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Mr. Krommatha… It's been so good to see you.

285
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,840
You're my Idol.

286
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
I don't know why you're so worried.

287
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,320
I'd peek at him all day if I were you.

288
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,600
Your mom and dad just have a celebrity crush.

289
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,960
They're too crazy on him!

290
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,280
Fueang is doing that. Fueang is doing this.

291
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,800
Duh! I'm sick!

292
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,760
Oh... Baby Kromatha is afraid that his dad and mom won't love him the same.

293
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
You'll never understand me, Thoo.

294
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
By the way.

295
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Is he as handsome in real life?

296
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,800
Umm. I don't know.

297
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,560
Never saw him in TV before.

298
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,080
Never saw him in TV before.

299
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,000
Hmm? Were you aware you just complimented him?

300
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,480
Watch out…

301
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,360
Jeez! What nonsense are you saying, Thoo?

302
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,600
That's it. See you later.

303
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,640
Oh. You must keep it secret.

304
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,440
Don't split anything about him with Jong and Yayee.

305
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,600
My mom will kill me if it's exposed.

306
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,720
Bye. I'm running late.

307
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,840
Mister.

308
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,480
Where are you going?

309
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,160
I'm meeting a friend at Siam.

310
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,360
How fortunate. That's my way. I can give you a ride.

311
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,440
I'm alright. You can go.

312
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,000
It's not easy to get a car here. Get in.

313
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,200
Come on.

314
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,600
Okay. Please drop me at the train station.

315
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,440
Deal.

316
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,600
Thanks.

317
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,920
Get in.

318
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,040
Fasten your seatbelt, please.

319
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Or I'll help you.

320
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Let’s close the sunroof. Your skin would be damaged from harsh sun.

321
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,640
I'm already late.

322
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,320
Right.

323
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,040
It's been a while since I left, but traffic in Thailand is still terrible.

324
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,880
It's normal to me now.

325
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,120
Do you feel strange?

326
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,520
Strange?

327
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,320
Um.

328
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,120
About what?

329
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,040
When you leave the house and encountering your own pictures all over the street.

330
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,320
It was excited at first.

331
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But I already used to it.

332
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,840
Today it's me,

333
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,440
but sooner there'll be a new face.

334
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,680
That's how the world is.

335
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,840
How about you? Do you feel strange

336
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,600
Sitting next to someone with numerous pictures like this?

337
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Hi.

338
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,080
Ah. Sand sent me the script since last night.

339
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,320
It's all in my head now.

340
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, you should know your boy is smart.

341
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,840
I'm kidding. I spent all night rehearsed it.

342
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,000
Of course.

343
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,360
Hi.

344
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
Sorry, my agency…

345
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,920
Mister.

346
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,160
Mister.

347
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:57,880
Mister!

348
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,720
Where are we now?

349
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,120
Siam.

350
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,120
Siam!

351
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,760
You fell asleep. It must be a Jet Lag.

352
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,760
I didn't want to wake you up, so, I drove you here.

353
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,080
Thank you.

354
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,280
Aw! He's so handsome!

355
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,080
Right!

356
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,680
He looks like the guy in the picture that was posted by Fueang last night.

357
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,760
Where is that place?

358
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,800
It's him!

359
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,440
Support FueangNakhon.

360
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,600
They aren't here yet?

361
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,280
Him again.

362
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,080
Where are you guys now?

363
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,080
The traffic is so terrible! I'll reach there in an hour.

364
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,600
I'm almost there.

365
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,560
I'm having an emergency case. See you next time.

366
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,480
Ah... May I have a Milk tea with bubbles, please?

367
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,720
Hundred sweet.

368
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,480
Moderate sweet?

369
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,360
No, not moderate. I mean super-duper sweet.

370
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,040
okay.

371
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,680
You're addicted to sugar. It's not healthy.

372
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,280
Mister!

373
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,240
Did you follow me?

374
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
Not sneakily.

375
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,800
I just follow you.

376
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,200
For what?

377
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,480
Well, you’ve left Thailand for a while.

378
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,520
I'm afraid you might get lost.

379
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,520
Just make sure that you can find your friends.

380
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,680
Where are they?

381
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,240
They're coming.

382
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,040
Hundred sweet.

383
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,160
Here you go. Thanks.

384
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,280
Listen, I'm not a child.

385
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,880
Aw! Where are you going?

386
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,760
Be careful! You're about to fall again.

387
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,880
Ayyy! Fueang!

388
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,600
Fueang!

389
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,560
Can I take a picture too?

390
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,240
Hey!

391
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,480
Wait!

392
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,920
Move!

393
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,800
You're so gorgeous!

394
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,840
#Fueangcomingtotown

395
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,920
Ayyyyyyy! Fueang!

396
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,840
He ranks number one on trend just to show up in town?

397
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,360
Of course.

398
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,000
Wow.

399
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,520
Eh! It's the milk tea shop that we planned to go earlier.

400
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,280
Krom! Why did you have to change the place?

401
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,680
Let's go. Before he leaves. Hurry!

402
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,360
You were late for an hour. He should've gone.

403
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,720
By the way… Are you also FueangNakhon fan?

404
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,400
Of course.

405
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,840
He's a dream guy of the entire Thai women

406
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,800
and LGBTQ!

407
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,480
Don't you know that she’s been working so hard

408
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,800
for money to support KorFueang Fanclub.

409
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,840
KorFueang Fanclub?

410
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,480
FueangNakhon and Koradit.

411
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,760
Here, look at this.

412
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,280
Are they cute?

413
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,800
Nah.

414
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,520
Nah.

415
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,040
They're cute. Period!

416
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,920
But isn't it too coincident?

417
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,280
He shut himself from social media many years.

418
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,400
Then he gets back with the Zendaya’s account

419
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,880
and it made your app a phenomenon by overnight.

420
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,440
But! But! But! What I want to know is.

421
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,880
How come you had a picture with him?

422
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,600
Ah… Well…

423
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,080
We met at our temporary office.

424
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,480
You have office here?

425
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,040
Yes.

426
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,400
Is he cute in real life?

427
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,600
I know! He's super cute and so nice!

428
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,600
If he was nice as you said

429
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,320
he wouldn't get involve with Kor.

430
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
You're ruining my happiness.

431
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,240
Aw! It's true.

432
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,880
Why? Is Koradit that bad?

433
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,800
Indeed!

434
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,640
He has no discipline and he's a real Casanova.

435
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,560
Only thing he has is being born with good face.

436
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,920
If he won't change.

437
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,920
Mark my words, his career is going to be ended soon.

438
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,560
Both of them.

439
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,240
Even if your whatever FueangNakhon

440
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,440
tried to post that kind of clip again.

441
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,920
There’s still no chance for him.

442
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,040
What clip?

443
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,120
Where on earth were you?

444
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,200
How didn't you know about his nasty clip?

445
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,160
I can show you. Hold on.

446
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Hey, stop it, Jong! You're so mean!

447
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,880
There's nothing, Krom. You didn't miss anything.

448
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,560
Um. I don't want to see it too.

449
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,160
But if you change your mind…

450
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,080
I said no!

451
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,000
FueangNakhon's leaked clip.

452
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
Hottest!

453
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,000
This clip made him be our national husband!

454
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,480
I love him! And even more after watching it!

455
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
It's not clear. I had to zoom in.

456
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,120
I wanna see Kor's too.

457
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,480
Wowwwww!

458
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,600
Can I download it?

459
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,520
So hot!

460
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,680
I wanna be his gf!

461
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
Look at those muscles.

462
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,520
I need a medic.

463
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,240
How much?

464
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,040
I'm ready to pay.

465
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,720
My eyes lit up.

466
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,640
I can watch all day.

467
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,000
Fueang!!

468
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,680
- I like when he digs it in!
- Dig!

469
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
Was it show that much?!

470
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,800
Is that all! There is nothing!

471
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,720
Raging! The hot-headed actor scolds the reporter regarding FueangNakhon's leaked clip.

472
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,800
What do you think about FueangNakhon's leaked clip?

473
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,920
No comment.

474
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,320
Did you watch it?

475
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,520
I think we should end it here.

476
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,200
What about…?

477
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,360
This is enough!

478
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,200
If you’re keen to know that much. Good! Fueang is the prey.

479
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,840
You should sympathize with him and stop tarnishing him.

480
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,240
Or you guys satisfy when you see someone fall?

481
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,320
He was right. Those journalists are living on people's trauma.

482
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,560
Awful!

483
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes.

484
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,560
Is there anything?

485
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,040
Your grandma is sick, and she wants to eat porridge from Yaowarat.

486
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,320
Oh. Can you give this to my client?

487
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,520
Sure.

488
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,600
I must hurry. That porridge is sold out very fast.

489
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,440
Mom. Whose is this?

490
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,560
It's Fueang's.

491
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Oh. Fueang.

492
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,679
Huh! Fueang!

493
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,280
Mom!

494
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,880
Please wait a moment. I go get something.

495
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,120
I have some supplements for your mom. She's been working hard recently.

496
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,320
Thanks.

497
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,240
Here your order.

498
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,760
Oh. They should be all.

499
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,360
I normally buy them at the store, but I don't have time, so I ordered from her.

500
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,800
okay.

501
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,880
Well. How much is it?

502
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,200
Five Hundred.

503
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,240
Would you help?

504
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,920
What are you doing?

505
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm trying to dig...

506
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,560
Dig!

507
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,360
You can transfer it later. Goodbye.

508
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,080
What? I just dig into my pocket.

509
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,120
Watch your steps.

510
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,920
Where is your medicine.

511
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,720
It’s finished.

512
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,280
Hmm?

513
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,720
It’s finished.

514
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,560
What! Why don't you be prepared?

515
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,600
Stop grumble at me!

516
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,440
Mister.

517
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,680
What's wrong?

518
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,240
You might remember my friend. He run out of asthma medicine.

519
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,760
He has relapse. I need to go buy medicine for him.

520
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,320
You can't leave him alone.

521
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,520
I'm okay. Just hurry.

522
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,520
okay. I won't go long.

523
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,640
Wait,

524
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,120
I don’t think you can make it. People will recognize you.

525
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,360
I'll go with you.

526
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,280
Let's get him inside.

527
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,440
Careful.

528
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Stop right there.

529
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,800
Your fans will keep stalling you. I'll buy it for you.

530
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,760
Alright. Here it is. Please get the exact same thing.

531
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,400
Hmm? What's wrong?

532
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,960
Wait for me here. I'll get it.

533
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,880
Get in the car!

534
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,440
Aw! How about this? You didn't bring it!

535
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,680
- Can I have a picture?
- Let me help.

536
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,040
Gosh! I told him to wait in the car!

537
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,080
Excuse me.

538
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,240
Excuse me.

539
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,520
Excuse me.

540
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,360
Hey! Move!

541
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,920
Excuse me!

542
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,520
Please move!

543
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,080
I'm here! Hurry! Take it!

544
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,400
Breath in! Good!

545
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,520
Thank you so much. He'd have been worse if you weren't here.

546
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,840
The medicine that you showed me is for protecting.

547
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,920
If he's having exacerbation, you must use this.

548
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,120
Next time, you'd better check your friend's carefully first.

549
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,880
Sure.

550
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,920
And you.

551
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,560
You cannot let your medicine run out again. It's dangerous.

552
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Do you understand?!

553
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,600
Whoa!

554
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,880
Yea… yes.

555
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,840
Fueang. This guy is extraordinary.

556
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,840
How is it? Should you learn something today?

557
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Please eat. My fans gave them to me. They're tasty.

558
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,920
Madam Aoi and Sand don't allow me to eat much. They're worried that I’ll lose my sixpack.

559
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,360
It's alright.

560
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,440
Please take.

561
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,600
I want to repay you for today.

562
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,080
Well, just a piece then.

563
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,560
Hmm. It's really good.

564
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,080
Your fans. Do they know that you're living together?

565
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,840
No one knows about it.

566
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,480
And no one knows that he has asthma.

567
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,560
There's nothing wrong for having asthma.

568
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,360
He said, it’ll ruin his image.

569
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
He’ll look desperate.

570
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,080
But it would be better if they know, so, they can watch over him.

571
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,040
Uh… How long have you been together?

572
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,120
Um… Since I bought this house. About two months.

573
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,280
Madam Aoi wants him to stay here so I can take care of him.

574
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,400
But this guy! He likes to run away to his condo.

575
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,560
I don't know what he is doing there!

576
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,440
Aw! Someone here won’t allow me to bring girls.

577
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,400
So, I take them to my condo!

578
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,640
Hey! Shouldn't you feel a bit regret?

579
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,320
Go to bed. You don't want to hear Madam Aoi and Sand complain when they get back.

580
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,440
I better go.

581
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,280
Hey, let me send you home.

582
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,600
I'm fine. You should take care of him.

583
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,960
You won't eat them, right?

584
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:24,920
No.

585
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,000
May I?

586
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,640
Oh… Okay.

587
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,480
Goodbye.

588
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Hey.

589
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,160
If you like him, why don't you tell him.

590
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,800
I just want to be sure.

591
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,920
He helped you this much. You still can't be sure?

592
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,880
Hmm?

593
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,920
Madam Aoi, I'm already at the airport.

594
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,720
Call me when you arrive.

595
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,920
That's fine. I'll find a seat.

596
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,120
I'm already outside.

597
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,000
Drive safe.

598
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,360
Hold on. I think I can go home myself.

599
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,800
Yes.

600
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,800
Excuse me. Can I sit here?

601
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,320
Sand. What happened to your face?

602
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,360
Tomorrow, Sand won’t be able to accompany you.

603
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,840
Are you free these days?

604
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,880
In case you’re bored and want to find something to do by being manager.

605
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,600
Get in. So, we can talk about today's schedule.

606
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,280
You never have any lover before, right?

607
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,080
I still haven’t found the right one.

608
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,520
What kind of person do you like?

609
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Can I be that one?
