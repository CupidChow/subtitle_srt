2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,400
Our neighbor

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,720
who moved in a few months ago

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,520
is a celebrity.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,240
FueangNakhon!

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,880
This is him, Kromatha.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,080
He’s my son whom I told you about.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,760
Nice to officially meet you.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,480
That's my way. I can give you a ride.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,480
If you like him, why don't you tell him.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,440
What! Why do you run out of medicine?

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,240
I’ll go with you.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Excuse me. Excuse me.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,400
-

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,600
Excuse me!

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,360
Please move!

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,400
Since I've graduated and started to work in Zendaya

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,200
I never had a long vacation.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,280
Three years ago.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
First day in Zendaya,

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
I like to work. It's my relaxing time.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,680
Hello everyone.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,800
My name's Navy

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,960
Hey! Navy.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,760
Happy that you're here.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,280
Good to have you here. Welcome.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,960
Thank you.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,480
Hi.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,000
Nice to meet you.

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,800
But in the end. I burnt out.

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,760
In this vacation.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,320
I meant to come back and recharge myself.

33
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,200
But having a hot celebrity at my next door

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,080
It made my vacation go completely unplanned.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,200
Where should I go?

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,280
Krom!! What did you do?!

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,720
I didn't do anything. What happened?

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,759
Check your social media.

39
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,000
#BanFueang'sIdol

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,000
What the hell!

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,440
Hey!

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,840
Here.

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
I made you soft-boiled rice.

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,640
Eat some.

45
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,600
You'll get better.

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,880
Hmm. Thank you.

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,600
Here. Let me try.

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,000
Well. Have you checked social media?

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
Hey!

50
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,840
Aw. Are you good?

51
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Um.

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,600
How about him? Is he okay?

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,360
Even though I have worked in the industry for many years.

54
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,160
He must be the one who set the camera.

55
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,680
Faced with all kinds of comments and criticisms.

56
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,800
Did you see Fueang's leaked clip?

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,200
Here.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But sometimes

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,200
I still can't hold it.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,600
I agree. He wants to go viral.

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
He wants to be famous like Kor.

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,520
Say hello to a new AV actor.

63
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Deactivate or delete

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
Continue.

65
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,920
No talent. No chance to be a star.

66
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,880
How did the director choose him?

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,840
He might have a connection.

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,920
How will someone who has never lived with criticism like I do

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,080
be able to handle it?

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,600
Hello. What's up?

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,480
Tell me. How could you be with Fueang?

72
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,840
His friend was sick, and we went out together for medicine.

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,600
He was surrounded by fans, so I dragged him out.

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
Then we brought his friend's medicines.

75
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Was that friend Kor?

76
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,960
I don't know.

77
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,280
So, it means that his fans are misunderstood.

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,680
that you were being too protective.

79
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,800
Let me explain them.

80
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,400
Stop it.

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,080
You don't have any evidence, and it'll get worse.

82
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,240
Just let it be.

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,000
There'll be new scandals

84
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,200
and they'll forget me soon.

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,159
Aren't you mad?

86
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,680
Not at all.

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,200
They don't know me. Why would I get angry and hurt my mental health?

88
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,320
He handled it better than I thought.

89
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,840
Listen to me well.

90
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,800
Life is short, so smile before you run out of teeth.

92
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,520
I’ll go now. Let me know if you need anything.

93
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,320
Well, I'm curious about one thing.

94
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,520
There's a comment that said I'm not a good Spicy Pork Stew.

95
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,960
What does it mean?

96
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Or is it because

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,480
they know it's my favorite?

98
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
But how?

99
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,159
What the heck, Fueang?

100
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,840
Hello, everyone.

101
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
Today I'm free so I decided to live.

102
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,640
Who said I'm a lone wolf

103
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,600
who doesn't like to use social media?

104
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm here now. Please give me a lot of likes.

105
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
Where is Fueang? We need his explanation.

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Ah… Fueang?

107
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,600
He's tidying up for me.

108
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,520
How are you? Please have more rest.

109
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm good.

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,800
You're the key witness.

111
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,920
You must tell them the truth

112
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,960
or I'll tell Madam Aoi

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,800
that you took her new girl

114
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,200
to a brothel.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
Hmm. Fueang!

116
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,000
Ah. And how about

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,280
that you sneaked into a secret bar?

118
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,600
Stop threatening me.

119
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,960
I won't be afraid at all.

120
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,280
Do you hear me? I won't.

121
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Madam. I have something to tell you.

122
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,720
It sounds like Fueang shouting. Is he angry at someone?

123
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Nothing.

124
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,800
He just called me to

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,960
take a shower.

126
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,920
Hurry! Get to the point.

127
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Ayy! My God!

128
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,000
his baby calls him to take a shower.

129
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,880
- You can live while you're showering.
- Well, as everyone knows

130
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,840
about that drama.

131
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
Actually…

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm…

133
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,480
having asthma attacks.

134
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,960
very seriously.

135
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,840
Kromatha and FueangNakhon were worried.

136
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,200
- They had to get a medicine for me.
- I'm so worried about you. ToT

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,000
Kromatha was afraid that he wouldn't be able to make it in time

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,520
that was why he dragged FueangNakhon away.

139
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,799
As you already saw in the clip.

140
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,679
(Good)

141
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,320
You can rewatch.

142
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,440
Here. He held this box.

143
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
My medicine.

144
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,160
Fueang. Were you telling me something?

145
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,160
Oh. It was nothing.

146
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,880
I just want to eat spicy pork stew.

147
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,240
Would you order for me?

148
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Spicy pork stew?

149
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
Wait. Wait. Wait. I change my mind.

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,200
Thai dressed salad, please.

151
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,440
You want to eat it?

152
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,080
Can you make it for me?

153
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,520
I can't. I have a lot of work.

154
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
There are a lot of food delivery apps.

155
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,520
This is a famous restaurant.

156
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,720
Do you know the owner?

157
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,480
Of course.

158
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you guys close?

159
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,600
Um.

160
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,240
Wow.

161
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,200
Kromatha was afraid that he wouldn't be able to make it in time

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,640
that was why he dragged FueangNakhon away.

163
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,120
As you already saw in the clip.

164
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,040
Aw. We were misunderstood about him.

165
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,400
You guys need to apologize to him for a lot of hate.

166
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,320
He's the idol of Fueang and also Kor's hero.

167
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,760
Super!

168
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,400
Well, I'm sorry.

169
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,200
I'll give you a secret signal

170
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,840
before I enter your house.

171
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,040
Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.

172
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,600
Life is short; smile before you run out of teeth

173
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,360
and have difficulty to chew on long bones

174
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,280
Hey. Stop there

175
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
How's it, sir?

176
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,520
You're alright, Fueang.

177
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
Just a tiny flaw.

178
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,520
Okay.

179
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,080
But you, Kor.

180
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,120
You need to put more energy

181
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,320
in every move.

182
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Give it all!

183
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,320
Like this!

184
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,600
Push it!

185
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,800
Try again. Didn't you know Tony Jaa?

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Watch out. He'll knock you out on the set.

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
It's just a practice.

188
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,000
That won't be necessary.

189
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,520
Hey. Don't say like that.

190
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,160
How about

191
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,760
we do a few more rounds

192
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,400
and focus on the energy later.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No. Only one round is enough.

194
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm tired already.

195
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,960
Ah. Again. Do your best.

196
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,560
- Come on.
- Let's do it.

197
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,480
Okay. Action.

198
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,480
Good. Action.

199
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
Do more.

200
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,360
Do it harder. Nice!

201
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Thank you.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,720
What for?

203
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,600
For telling them the truth.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,160
You threatened me.

205
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,440
That's not true. No threat can force you

206
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,800
if you don't want to help.

207
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,640
I know you helped Krom

208
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,800
because you don't want him to be attacked like Namsom.

209
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,680
I love you, Namsom.

210
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,400
I love you too.

211
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,800
Namsom. Don't leave me.

212
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
I have no one

213
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,840
if you leave me.

214
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,960
Let me go. I can't stand anymore.

215
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,040
Namsom!

216
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,200
Good!

217
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,840
Do it!

218
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,080
Krom. Please help Kung watch the store today.

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,720
A hundred and ninety in total.

220
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,040
Thank you.

221
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,760
Kung, do you have something to talk to me?

222
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Is it about FueangNakhon?

223
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,520
How did you figure it out?

224
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,000
If I didn't, I rather be blind.

225
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,920
This is just a small portion. Huh! And I thought.. You noticed my tattoo.

226
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,000
(FueangNakhon)

227
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,760
What!? Your tattoo!

228
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
Did you really have to go this far?

229
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,680
Cause, I love FueangNakhon.

230
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,280
So much!

231
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
Let's go back to work.

232
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,560
How did you know him?

233
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,880
By accident.

234
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,680
- Tell me the truth.
- It is.

235
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,200
Go back to work.

236
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,840
You might not see it clear.

237
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,320
You should pay attention to your work as you do with him.

238
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,480
Of course.

239
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,200
You checked that shelf already!

240
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,000
#KorFueang

241
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,120
Sorry. I just finished the action practicing with Kor.

242
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,360
Is there anything?

243
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,960
Look at your manager.

244
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,320
Sand. What happened to your face?

245
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,600
&*%#@%$%%#*(#@%(@#

246
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,360
What?

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,800
&*%#@%$%%#*(#@%(@#

248
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,440
Huh!?

249
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,600
Stop!

250
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
Let me tell him.

251
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,160
Well, Sand.

252
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,040
She met a hot biker

253
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,400
and sat on his back seat

254
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,480
then she fell backward. Such a pathetic!

255
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,280
Her face is a mess now.

256
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,600
Tomorrow, Sand won’t be able to accompany you.

257
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,560
That's all right. I can take care myself.

258
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,600
Oh! Oh! Oh! No! You can't.

259
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,960
They are all important events tomorrow.

260
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,080
Both the press release and your first set.

261
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,000
I want to scream in your face!

262
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,840
How could you put these big events on the same day?

263
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,880
Importantly,

264
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,960
we've never worked with this team before.

265
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,400
I can't imagine how it's going to be.

266
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,920
Fueang.

267
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,720
Yes.

268
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,040
Who do you want to accompany with?

269
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,480
I'll manage it.

270
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,880
Which one?

271
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,920
Let me do this job myself.

272
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,960
who?

273
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,840
I can't tell you.

274
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,960
Again!

275
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,400
It's a secret.

276
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,080
Secret!?

277
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,840
&*%#@%$%%#*(#@%(@#

278
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,760
If you can't talk. Then don't.

279
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,520
These kids always bring me a headache. Really.

280
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,680
(I can go)

281
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,040
I don't think so.

282
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,480
Come on.

283
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,480
You can't beat me.

284
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,200
Hey.

285
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,640
Can you come down? See you there.

286
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,400
Was that a secret code as you said?

287
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,440
Yes. I'm pretty good at it.

288
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,280
Aren't your parent at home?

289
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,520
Are you scared of living alone?

290
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,440
Do you want to come to my house?

291
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
Do you always invite people into your home like this?

292
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,119
No. You are the first.

293
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,319
Are you free these days?

294
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,200
Why?

295
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
In case you’re bored

296
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,240
and want to find something to do by being a manager.

297
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,000
Huh!? Your manager?

298
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,960
My manager, Samd. She's having some issues.

299
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
There's no one available to accompany me tomorrow.

300
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,600
Are you interested in going with me?

301
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
I don't think so.

302
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,720
I have to fix some bugs in Zendaya's app.

303
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,960
My parents are here. Goodbye.

304
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
Should we buy more? Are they enough?

305
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,080
Let check. Maybe we..

306
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,720
What are those stuffs?

307
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,040
They are yours.

308
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,640
We think that you might get bored being alone.

309
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
So, we're planning to take you to see your elder relatives.

310
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,080
Isn't it good?

311
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,800
What!? Elder relatives?

312
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,240
Yes. Go try them.

313
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,120
Choose one. Come on.

314
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,960
Wow! You are so gently cute!

315
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh! My lovely angel.

316
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,000
Wow! You look good!

317
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,080
But I feel that something is missing.

318
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,640
Gosh! Cutie

319
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,320
Look. You need some accessories. See.

320
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Dad.

321
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,360
Oh! Golden, the color of the greatest.

322
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,760
I don’t think your sister will like it.

323
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,840
Oh! She’s going to love this.

324
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,880
You’re so handsome.

325
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,520
Very nice.

326
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,480
Turn them.

327
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,600
- Good. That’s it.
- Yes.

328
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,640
You look so good. Turn around.

329
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,840
Let me see you.

330
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,800
Oh! You also need this

331
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,080
a doll.

332
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,040
Do I?

333
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,400
Of course. Best matching.

334
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,680
This is really good.

335
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,920
Right.

336
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,480
Is this for auntie?

337
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,440
No. It’s for Lin.

338
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,840
Mill owner’s daughter who lives next to your auntie’s.

339
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,400
Krom!

340
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,400
I miss you so much. It’s been a while.

341
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,800
I have a lot of homework.

342
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Would you help me?

343
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,720
Please! Please! I have so many things to do, including the exam tomorrow.

344
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,200
Please. I know that you are pretty good at them.

345
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,000
I want to spend time with you.

346
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,920
Don’t you remember her?

347
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,680
I do remember.

348
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,960
She’s all grown up now as a fine lady.

349
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,200
Hello.

350
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,840
Yes.

351
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,840
I still can’t find anyone to accompany me tomorrow.

352
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,400
Do you have any recommendations?

353
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,520
But it’s okay if you don’t.

354
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,800
I’ll figure it out.

355
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,080
Hold on. I’ll call you back.

356
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
What….?

357
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,400
I’ll do it with you.

358
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,560
Do what?

359
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,400
I’ll take a star

360
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,800
What do you mean, star?

361
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,360
Okay. One last time. Go!

362
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,880
I

363
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,280
will

364
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,000
make hair

365
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,560
of you.

366
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,720
Oh, stop!

367
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,160
Wait for me there.

368
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,760
See you outside.

369
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
I’ll take care of you.

370
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,600
My parent will take me to my cousin’s house.

371
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,280
But I think going with you is more fun.

372
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,120
Really?

373
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,080
What do I need to do for being your manager, sir?

374
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,760
First, stop being too formal with me.

375
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,440
Just talk to me casually.

376
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,600
It won’t look suspicious

377
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,960
when they see us together.

378
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,840
Okay.

379
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,000
Let exchange our contact.

380
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,360
Here.

381
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,800
My number.

382
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,480
Please come to wake me up tomorrow’s morning.

383
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,880
We have a job to do.

384
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,880
Okay.

385
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,120
It’s seven. Does he wake up yet?

386
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,400
Why doesn’t he pick up a call?

387
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,000
It’s running late. Where is he now?

388
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
What! It’s locked.

389
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,680
He told me his password before.

390
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,320
Nope.

391
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,760
Maybe this.

392
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,320
Not again.

393
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,200
One last time, and I’ll go home.

394
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,160
Got it. Good job, Krom.

395
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,960
Allow me, please.

396
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,160
Fueang.

397
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,480
Fueang.

398
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,840
Hello, Fueang.

399
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,800
It’s time to go to work.

400
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,000
Fueang.

401
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Not yet wake up?

402
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,040
Where’s his room?

403
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,960
My room…

404
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,400
is over there.

405
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
He talked to me from that window.

406
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,800
So, his room…

407
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,400
might be here.

408
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,360
Aw. Krom.

409
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,120
Fueang!

410
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,920
Sorry.

411
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
I was showering.

412
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,040
Come in.

413
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,360
So we can talk about today’s schedule.

414
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,840
It’s alright.

415
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,400
I better wait outside.

416
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Hey.

417
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,000
Rule No.2.

418
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,360
You cannot refuse…

419
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
anytime I ask you to do something.

420
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,760
Get inside.

421
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,200
Relax.

422
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,680
Sit anywhere you like.

423
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,440
Don’t lie down.

424
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
You’ll make me want to sleep, too.

425
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,560
I stayed up all night. Still sleepy.

426
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,680
Rule No.3. You must help me decide

427
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
on what to wear.

428
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,200
Between this

429
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,960
and this one.

430
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,160
Which one?

431
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,240
You can touch it.

432
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,600
So, you can feel their fabrics.

433
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,720
This one! This?

434
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,360
We have the same mind.

435
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,800
What time should we arrive?

436
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,920
What do I have to do?

437
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,040
Please request the breakdown from the team

438
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,200
and check about the foods

439
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
that they prepare for us

440
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,000
I have some food allergies.

441
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,400
Got it.

442
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,680
I’ll also need to check Kor

443
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,200
He’s always late.

444
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,080
Rule No.4. You must always

445
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,560
sit beside me.

446
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,480
Importantly,

447
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,080
safety first.

448
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,240
Fueang.

449
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,920
Let me help.

450
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
Don’t worry. Carrying things

451
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,840
are not in your job qualifications.

452
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,040
Hurry.

453
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,720
Hello.

454
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200
Hi.

455
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,440
Finish.

456
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Oh. You’re here, Fueang.

457
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,920
Hi.

458
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,000
Hi.

459
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,520
You look fierce today.

460
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,160
She told me

461
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,760
that he’ll come with you.

462
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,800
but I thought it was a joke

463
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,520
By the way..Just do your best.

464
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,440
Yes.

465
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,880
He surely is.

466
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,680
will

467
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,000
Let’s get outside.

468
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,520
Follow me.

469
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,120
Where are you taking me?

470
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,480
I’m taking you to the paradise.

471
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,880
Paradise.

472
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,800
Yes.

473
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,040
What are you doing?

474
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,880
I won’t tell you.

475
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,640
Can you walk?

476
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,560
Yew, I can.

477
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,680
Why do you have to close my eyes?

478
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,320
It’s here.

479
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,560
What?

480
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,720
Ready? One. Two. Three. Tada!

481
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,960
Whoa! Are they all your fans?

482
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,040
Some are mine and some are Kor’s.

483
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Are they complete?

484
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,960
Ayyy! Fueang!

485
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,360
Hi.

486
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Krom. We have a gift for you.

487
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,720
Hey. What is this for?

488
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,400
We want to apologize

489
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,880
for misunderstanding you earlier.

490
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,040
Thank you. I am appreciated.

491
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,560
I was too harsh on you, too.

492
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,880
I am sorry.

493
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,800
Oops! That’s totally fine.

494
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,840
Let’s take photos together.

495
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,640
Come on.

496
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,880
Ready? One. Two. Three.

497
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,160
There are a lot of food trucks.

498
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,680
What do you guys have for me?

499
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,640
Which one?

500
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,440
Wow!

501
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,800
Just a little touch up.

502
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,880
How do I look?

503
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,160
Nice. You’re perfect.

504
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,120
Of course.

505
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,960
That’s why they chose me as a presenter.

506
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,040
You’re good to go.

507
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
I’ll go to the set now.

508
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,600
Okay. See you there.

509
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,000
Please take care of Fueang, sir.

510
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,160
Thank you.

511
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,520
Please take care of Fueang, sir.

512
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,720
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

513
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,200
Please take care of Fueang, sir.

514
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,280
Thank you.

515
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,600
This is for you, sir.

516
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Please take care of Fueang, sir.

517
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,520
Thank you.

518
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,480
Please take this. Good luck.

519
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,400
Thank you.

520
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,080
Our appointment is at 10:00 a.m.

521
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,040
Please share #KorFueangOnScene and DVNMxKorFueang. Let them rank No. 1 in worldwide trends.

522
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,120
Only five minutes left!

523
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,280
Um. Which one should I pick?

524
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,160
Strawberry or Caramel?

525
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,520
I cannot choose one.

526
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,480
Gosh.

527
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,120
I give you both.

528
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,960
It’s a promotion. Take them and try.

529
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,720
Please leave us feedback on which one you like. Bye.

530
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,440
That’s our car.

531
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,400
Oh, wait. You can go.

532
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Get the phone ready.

533
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,680
Ready!

534
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,520
Get your mind ready.

535
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,400
Ready!

536
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
We can do it!

537
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,680
Five.

538
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,880
Four.

539
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,840
I can wait for other cars

540
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,760
but Fueang can’t wait for me.

541
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,159
Three.

542
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,239
Two.

543
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:15,960
One.

544
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,159
Let’s share their hashtags. Now!

545
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,760
Come on guys!

546
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,840
Let’s go!

547
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,320
Get them a higher rank!

548
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,199
Fueang is giving an interview.

549
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,920
How did you feel on the first scene’s shooting?

550
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,840
It was good.

551
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,920
I’m always happy every time I work with Fueang.

552
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,719
This movie

553
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,480
and The Devil's Nightmare

554
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,280
give us the opportunity to get back to work together.

555
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,840
They’re also a joint venture

556
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,320
between Thailand and China

557
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,639
with a budget of 300 million.

558
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,679
- Huge amount.
- Whoa!

559
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,160
We did the action scenes ourself.

560
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,840
Hold on.

561
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,400
Oops!

562
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,240
OMG!

563
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
So cute. Hugs.

564
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,360
- No. 3 on trend.

565
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,040
I play as Fei Ling.

566
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,080
- It’s the greatest.
- Yes.

567
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,680
and the best.

568
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,200
We’ll give our all to this movie.

569
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,880
- No. 2 on trend.
#KorFueangOnScene #DVNMxKorFueang
- No. 2 now!

570
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,120
We hope our hashtags will be No.1 on trend

571
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,840
today.

572
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
Thank you.

573
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,120
Thank you.

574
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,600
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

575
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
This post is for KorFueang’s fans.

576
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,200
Come on.

577
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,240
It trends no. 1 worldwide.
#KorFueangOnScene #DVNMxKorFueang

578
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,600
They trend no.1 worldwide!

579
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,880
Yes!! They are on trend now. We did it!

580
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,600
It trends no. 1 worldwide.
#KorFueangOnScene #DVNMxKorFueang

581
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,800
Oops! They trend No. 1

582
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,480
since the first shooting day.

583
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,880
That’s a sure thing.

584
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,440
They have very mighty fans like us

585
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,120
and we are very strong.

586
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,240
We also made a promise that

587
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,520
whatever Fueang and Kor do

588
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,800
we will support them til the end.

589
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,520
That’s great.

590
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,360
Fueang is a hardworking man

591
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,560
Encouragement is the most important thing.

592
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,840
Right.

593
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,240
By the way

594
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,960
Krom must be tired of taking care of him.

595
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,000
What did you say, Mhai?

596
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,360
I mean…

597
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,920
You didn’t take good care of the stocks.

598
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,680
Look at this.

599
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,800
Isn’t it almost expired?

600
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,600
Pay more attention.

601
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,280
How about the promotion?

602
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,160
Check them very well!

603
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,200
Put your phone down. You’re on duty.

604
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,960
Put it down and check the stocks.

605
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,040
I’ll go now.

606
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,720
You’re mean!

607
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,280
Here. Let me give you this.

608
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,640
It is very yummy.

609
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,200
- Thank you.
- This one is also good.

610
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,440
- Chef Pom’s fried rice.
- Crab fried rice?

611
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,640
- Yes. It’s so tasty.
- It’s my favorite.

612
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,720
This one is from Chef Ian. Good one.

613
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,320
You can bring it for your mother.

614
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,240
Thank you.

615
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,480
Hey! Krom!

616
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,680
Aw! Jong.

617
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,240
How did you get here?

618
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,720
I’m Fueang’s temporally manager.

619
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,120
Really? How come?

620
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,960
Do you mean that showoff guy?

621
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,840
He doesn’t show off?

622
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,160
It’s a long story. I’ll tell you later.

623
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,120
What about you? Why are you here?

624
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
What an odd question?

625
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,520
I’m working here.

626
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,000
I’m asking about your duty?

627
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,600
I came here for photographs.

628
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,720
Can’t you take photos somewhere else?

629
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,640
Well, they have lots of foods.

630
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,080
That's why I got here.

631
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,840
Ptui!

632
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,560
I am a photographer here.

633
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,000
I just do my job.

634
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,640
You never told me

635
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,160
that you work with Fueang.

636
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,600
They asked me to keep it secret.

637
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
I can’t tell anyone.

638
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,000
Do you want some?

639
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,800
No.

640
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,320
Can you help me something?

641
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,400
What?

642
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,920
My hands are full. Can you feed me?

643
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,680
I’m here for work, not to take care of you.

644
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,800
It’s yummy. Try this.

645
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,760
Is it good?

646
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,800
Um. Good.

647
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Lin Lan.

648
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,960
I… I can only go this far.

649
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,440
No.

650
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,080
Thank you for always being beside me all along.

651
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,200
I made terrible mistakes with you

652
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,360
but you still help me.

653
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,800
I know that you are good

654
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,920
Even though your face is not as handsome as mine

655
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,720
What?

656
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,440
Is that a script?

657
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,880
(Shh! They are filming)

658
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,800
Lin Lan.

659
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,400
No!

660
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
No!

661
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,800
Cut! Good job! Change the scene.

662
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,280
Come and check the actors.

663
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,080
Kung. Is Krom here?

664
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,120
Are you Krom’s friend?

665
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,240
Can’t you remember me?

666
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,960
Krom’s friend…

667
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,400
We haven’t seen each other for 7 years. Try thinking.

668
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,400
7 years…

669
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,920
That kid! You’re…

670
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,120
Yayee

671
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,840
Yes.

672
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,720
Wow. You grew up so pretty.

673
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,600
Oh! You’re pretty too!

674
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,880
Did you eat anything? Have some snacks.

675
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,040
Not yet. I’m so hungry.

676
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,600
I’ve been tweeting KorFueang for the entire morning.

677
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,800
KorFueang!

678
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,120
Don’t tell me..

679
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,080
That you like KorFueang too!

680
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,520
You too!?

681
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,120
Oh My God!

682
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,280
- Let’s exchange our contact.
- Good!

683
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,640
He has many personalities

684
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,440
and often do things without his awareness.

685
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,360
One of them was kidnapping his own sister.

686
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,880
Huh! What kind of script is this!?

687
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,640
Go on!

688
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,720
Prepare a bomb.

689
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,360
Hey! Over there, Medform.

690
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,000
At the center.

691
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,880
Open the slate.

692
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,640
Whoa! That’s too much!

693
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,680
Do it good.

694
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,600
Aw! Jong.

695
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,000
Look at your boy! Say it.

696
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,320
Say it!

697
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,040
Err… The devil’s nightmare.

698
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,360
13th scene 2nd cut 1st take.

699
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
Ac… Action!

700
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
Hey. Did he say action?

701
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,560
Lin Lan.

702
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Lin Lan.

703
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,040
Lin Lan.

704
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,920
We have to get out of here.

705
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,000
Leave me here.

706
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,680
No.

707
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,560
No.

708
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,200
Lin Lan. We have to hurry!

709
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,560
Lin Lan!

710
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,840
Lin Lan!

711
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,280
I won’t leave you here.

712
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,280
Get out!

713
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,120
The bomb!

714
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,640
I’ll go with you Krom.

715
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,720
Fueang.

716
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,720
You didn’t need to call an ambulance.

717
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,800
I’m so worried about you.

718
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,960
Don’t worry.

719
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,600
It’s just a tiny.

720
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,960
I’ll call my dad

721
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,560
to pick me up at the hospital.

722
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,040
Please go back.

723
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,840
They’ll be in trouble

724
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,680
if you aren’t there.

725
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,200
Please.

726
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,640
Please listen to me.

727
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,920
They’re gonna hate me

728
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,640
and wouldn’t allow me to come again.

729
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,640
All right.

730
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,520
Sir. Please take good care of him.

731
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,640
Thank you.

732
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,760
Fueang. I think

733
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,160
You should go with him.

734
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,960
No.

735
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,920
He was right. If I go

736
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,800
they will be in chaos.

737
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,000
You must help me

738
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,080
and stop flirting with those trainees.

739
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,920
So we can finish it real fast.

740
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,400
What are you saying?

741
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,320
I always focus on every scene! Whoa!

742
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,680
Hey!

743
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,240
Alright! What next?

744
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:57,960
Come on!

745
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,680
Let’s continue. Ready!

746
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,960
I’m with my dad now.

747
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,160
Don’t worry.

748
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,360
The doctor said I’ll be all right.

749
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,200
These are a lot.

750
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,840
Painkiller.

751
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,960
Come in.

752
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,880
Oh, Fueang! How was it going?

753
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,040
Did you achieve all the scenes?

754
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,200
Krom.

755
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,400
Hmm?

756
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,640
Let me help you change the bandage.

757
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,040
It’s already stained.

758
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,000
Oh, okay.

759
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,320
A little hurt.

760
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,880
What do you have here?

761
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,880
Is it much hurt?

762
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,040
I’m sorry that I took you there.

763
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,640
Please don’t. It was the accident.

764
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,920
Well. I’ve been wondering.

765
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,960
Why did you ask me to be your manager?

766
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,480
I was useless.

767
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,640
No. You were not.

768
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,800
You were really helpful.

769
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,240
Tell me. What did I do?

770
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,320
Have you ever had a lover?

771
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,800
A lover..

772
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,720
A few. Only somebody to talk to.

773
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,160
But I’ve never been serious with anyone yet.

774
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,920
What kind of person do you like?

775
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,680
Why do you ask?

776
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,480
In case if I find someone

777
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,400
you may like.

778
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,800
I don’t have a type.

779
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,240
I’ll just know it.

780
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,240
What kind of person do you like?

781
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,400
Can I be that one?

782
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,800
Why do you ask me?

783
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,200
You don’t know?

784
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,960
I ask you because…

785
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,160
Fueang! Krom! Come to eat.

786
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,040
Yes.

787
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,000
Are you hungry?

788
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,520
You can go. I’ll see you later.

789
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Hurry.

790
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,280
You’re done.

791
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,040
Yes, mom.

792
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,080
Let me keep them.

793
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,280
I have to leave now.

794
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,720
I’ll join your dinner again next time.

795
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,160
Let me know in advance what you want to eat.

796
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,040
Okay.

797
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,560
Hi.

798
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,080
Bye.

799
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,960
See you.

800
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,280
Fueang.

801
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,880
Please let me know

802
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,720
if you want an accompany again.

803
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,640
I’ll go with you.

804
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,080
So you really like my world then.

805
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,320
Um. So much.

806
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,280
It’s fun.

807
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,920
Your fans are lovely too.

808
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,760
That what I want you to see

809
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,880
with you own eyes

810
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,240
that my world is not that scary.

811
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,640
I’m not scare

812
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,360
I kinda like it.

813
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,440
What about what you said to me earlier?

814
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,920
Something that I don’t know and what my type is.

815
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,360
What did you want to say?

816
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,480
Can I ask you something?

817
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,960
What is it?

818
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,440
If you like my world

819
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,640
will you like me too?

820
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,680
Happy birthday, Kung.

821
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,400
You look so shock!

822
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,760
If he does something that irritated you.

823
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,400
Be patient.

824
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,360
Sorry?

825
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,480
Do you want to put this button?

826
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,160
I like you.

827
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,920
How about you? Do you like me too?
