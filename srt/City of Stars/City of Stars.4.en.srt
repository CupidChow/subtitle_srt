1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,240
If he does something that irritates you

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,400
just endure.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,280
I do believe that you’ll make your dream come true

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,640
as Angun said.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,560
Thank you.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,640
Hah! You want to eat Fueang!

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,680
Thank you for accompanying me that day.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,920
Fueang likes him.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,680
Really?

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,840
He likes me.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,800
What! Fueang likes you!

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,560
When did he tell you?

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,800
Why did he tell you?

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,480
After he told you…

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,000
Did you make it after that?

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,600
Easy man. He didn’t tell me,

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,200
but I overheard it from his friend.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,440
Aw! How can you be happy with that?

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,039
Why can’t I?

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,600
Listen to me.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,560
Hmm?

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,000
His friend might imagine it by himself.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,520
As you said that day,

24
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,400
he always comes to your house

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,960
treats you nicely and makes you assume he likes you.

26
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,960
But he was there too.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,120
He should have refused it

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,840
if it’s not true.

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,200
How do you ensure that

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,000
he won't refuse it later?

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,479
Right…

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,800
Hey. Krom.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
You seem so off.

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
Well.

35
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,720
I’m trying to figure it out.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,440
It doesn’t make sense

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,880
if he did all of that to get close to my parents.

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,400
I can feel something too special in his doings.

39
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
How special?

40
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,560
Is it your favorite?

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,480
Let me help.

42
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,760
Be careful. You’re about to fall again.

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,560
Why did you call the ambulance?

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,040
Because I’m so worried about you.

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,760
I’ll replace you with a new plaster.

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
It’s already soaked. Still hurt?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,400
If he wouldn’t like me,

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
then why did he do that?

49
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,120
He may be one of the Casanova.

50
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,360
Casanova?

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,280
Yes.

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,040
I found many of them.

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,640
They like to play with your feelings

54
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,720
then turn you down when you like them.

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,800
Do you want to check on him?

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,880
Check? Can I do that?

57
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,079
Of course!

58
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,240
There are five ways to check

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
if he is a Casanova.

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,640
How?

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,080
First, was he so generous and passionate to solve your problems

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
as if they were his?

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,440
They’ll increase the rental fee by 20%

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,720
on the next contract renewal.

65
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
Isn’t that cheating?

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,760
I can advise you to a lawyer.

67
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,480
My brother has many good lawyer friends.

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,320
Don’t worry, Fueang. I don’t want to disturb you.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,120
Not disturbing at all.

70
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
Your problems are mine, too.

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,320
First, Being (too) generous.

72
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,880
Yes.

73
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,720
Second, he's too friendly

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
and likely to make people flutter

75
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
with skin-to-skin contact.

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Second, likely to have skin-to-skin contact.

77
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Yes!

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,200
Third, keep making eye contact.

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,760
Don’t you want to eat?

80
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,600
I do.

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,800
Dry fish. It’s been on your lips for a while.

82
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,080
Oh.

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,680
One more bite. Here.

84
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,200
Yum!

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,720
Don’t tease me!

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
All right. I’ll stop playing.

87
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
One. Two. Three.

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,320
You eat it.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
Come on. You eat.

90
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,800
One, two…

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,960
Third, keep making eye contact.

92
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,440
Yes again!

93
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,320
Fourth, smiling for unknown reasons.

94
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,840
Ur.. Fueang. Why are you smiling?

95
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,680
Fourth, smiling for unknown reasons.

96
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
Not again!

97
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
The last one,

98
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
always ask you for help on something unnecessary?

99
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,960
Can you help me with rehearsal?

100
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,320
I still can’t remember it.

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
Sure.

102
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,680
Don’t you know who I am?

103
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,640
No.

104
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,920
I am the son of whom you ordered his death!

105
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,560
No.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Remember my face! I’ll make you hurt like hell

107
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,040
as long as you still breathe!

108
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
Nooo!

109
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,680
You only have to say one word?

110
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,680
Oh. I was paralyzed in this scene.

111
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,040
Um! You’re teasing me again!

112
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
I'm not.

113
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,320
They didn’t say that here!

114
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,760
Where did they write about being paralyzed?

115
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
They did! It’s in the next chapter.

116
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,880
Fifth, asking for help on something unnecessary.

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
All are yes!

118
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
Yes! I knew it!

119
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
He is the real Casanova!

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,360
What should I do?

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,560
Do you want to know the five steps to move on?

122
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,600
Oh, Gosh! Why do I have to move on so soon?!

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,640
You can cut a paper with scissors.

124
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,960
But what if I have to cut my relationship with him

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
what should I use?

126
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,520
-

127
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,600
Today

128
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,320
I’ll teach you how to check the stocks

129
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,680
if it is the same with these incomes.

130
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,000
Jeez, mom! If I have to work on these numbers,

131
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
I’d instead return to work.

132
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,320
Be patient, Krom.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,920
You eventually need to do it

134
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,000
once you return to Thailand for good.

135
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
Return for good? Huh!

136
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,200
Why?

137
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,760
Are you going to stay in America forever?

138
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,400
Hmm, mom! I’m not going to be there forever.

139
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,360
I am still having fun working there.

140
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Come on.

141
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,960
Fueang!

142
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,040
Mom.

143
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,200
Please tell Fuang that I’m not around if he’s here.

144
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,040
Why?

145
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,160
Because I can’t move on

146
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
if he’s still close!

147
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,120
Please, Mom.

148
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,000
I promise I’ll do what you want.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,440
Okay?

150
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
- Krom.
- Excuse me!

151
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
What’s wrong with him? Why is he rushing?

152
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,960
Don’t ask me. I have no idea.

153
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,560
I need a med.

154
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,600
You’re overacting!

155
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
That can’t be hurt.

156
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,160
It’s hurt.

157
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,040
Fueang!

158
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,440
Hello, mom.

159
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Hello honey.

160
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,480
You’re sweating.

161
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,280
It’s alright.

162
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,800
I came to ask Krom to go to the gym with me.

163
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,920
Is he here?

164
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,400
He’s not here.

165
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,600
Yes! There… He just Ouch!

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,560
He just ran inside.

167
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
He's at the back.

168
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,640
You can catch him. Oops!

169
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,680
Excuse me.

170
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,640
That’s okay.

171
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Fueang!

172
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,320
Fueang!

173
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,280
Check this mess!

174
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,880
Fueang!

175
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,320
Do your job!

176
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,720
Fueang!

177
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,160
Did Mom tell you that I’m here?

178
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,040
No, it was Kung.

179
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,560
Kung?

180
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,760
What were you doing here?

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
I…

182
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,160
I…

183
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,000
I was about to call my friend here.

184
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,120
Call your friend?

185
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,240
Oh… I forgot my phone inside.

186
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,360
By the way, why are you here?

187
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,760
I’m free today.

188
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,440
Why don’t we go to the gym together?

189
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,600
I’ll be your personal trainer.

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,680
Let’s start with your upper body.

191
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,680
I remember you’re worried

192
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,080
about your stomach is big,

193
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,040
like you’re pregnant.

194
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,280
I’ll help sculpt six-pack abs for you.

195
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,760
Is it good?

196
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,480
Stay strong! You must overcome his cuteness!

197
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,760
Last one!

198
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,040
Here. Let me help.

199
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
Thanks.

200
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
Are you tired?

201
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,480
Good job, my boy.

202
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
Next. Let’s go to the sauna room

203
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,880
Sauna?

204
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,160
They have a very big sauna room here.

205
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,440
Only a few people. There would be only us.

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
Only us!

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,960
It’s only two of us!

208
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,120
How can I give up on him?

209
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,280
I have some work to do.

210
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,400
I need to go now. Thank you very much.

211
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,520
work?

212
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,920
What work?

213
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,360
Mom!

214
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,240
What happens, baby?

215
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,440
Fueang.

216
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,760
What were you doing?

217
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,840
I…

218
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,160
I heard some noise from the outside.

219
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,200
Well. What’s going on?

220
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,360
Fueang is worried about you.

221
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,760
He called you from the window, but no response.

222
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,720
You didn’t answer his chat and phone calls, either.

223
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
It’s got me worried, too.

224
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,800
You ate like a cow at the dinner.

225
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,200
I was scared that you might have an emergency.

226
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,400
I am okay.

227
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,520
I didn’t hear his calls because…

228
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,320
Because…

229
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,640
I was wearing the headphones.

230
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Headphones…

231
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,960
Your headphones are unplugged.

232
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh. I just removed it.

233
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,000
I don’t want to leave it like that.

234
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,640
Ah.

235
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,000
Honey. My back is hurt. Please massage me.

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
Okay. I’ll be there.

237
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,600
Take your time.

238
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,640
Okay.

239
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,840
Are you sick?

240
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
I’m fine.

241
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,720
Uh.. I have work to do.

242
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
You can go home.

243
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,480
Sorry, Fueang.

244
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,920
It’s a good lighting time.

245
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,240
Tilt the lens down here and then shift the perspective.

246
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,839
Got it.

247
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,880
Keep it master.

248
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,720
I’ll tell you their script later.

249
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,800
Okay.

250
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,119
Good luck.

251
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,319
- Okay.
- Very good.

252
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,480
Are you still here?

253
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,600
I bought you a water, Jong.

254
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,800
Thanks.

255
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,280
Well. What’s your name?

256
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,320
My name’s Jay.

257
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,960
Um. Jay.

258
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,600
Why did you choose to be a trainee here?

259
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,440
Our job is stressful, and we work in the intense sun.

260
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,720
Urh…

261
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
Come on, Jay. Tell him.

262
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,240
Tell me…

263
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,320
Tell me what?

264
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
Hurry.

265
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,920
I.. I like you.

266
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,920
What did you say?

267
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,440
Oh, I mean. I like your work.

268
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,760
I want to learn from you.

269
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,080
Can you teach me?

270
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
Alright. I’m glad you like it.

271
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,840
But, first…

272
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,160
Take off your glasses.

273
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
Look around.

274
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,280
Did you see anyone wear it?

275
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,960
Take it off! Hurry!

276
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,200
Second, look at you.

277
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,880
No one dresses like this.

278
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,200
It’s already tough working in the strong sun,

279
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,400
and your white shirt is easy to get dirty.

280
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,400
Just wear casual when you come to work.

281
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,840
Like me. Understood?

282
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,040
Chillax.

283
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,480
Okay? You got?

284
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
Are you worried about me?

285
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Just get change!

286
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,680
Hey! They're working!

287
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,040
Get out of here! Don't disturb!

288
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,800
You ask for it. You idiot!

289
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,080
I’m here.

290
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,360
Go! Leave me here!

291
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
No! I’ll never leave you.

292
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,880
I will not let a traitor

293
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,680
like you get away easily,

294
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,760
Lew Yang!

295
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,840
Okay, cut!

296
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,480
Good job.

297
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,240
Okay.

298
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Change the scene.

299
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,000
Great, Jong.

300
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,480
Okay.

301
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,280
What are you dressing up?

302
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
John Wick?

303
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,720
Next is the action scene.

304
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,680
Someone helps me untie the rope.

305
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,960
Good! Good! Good!

306
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,280
Clear the set. Check the actors.

307
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,400
I got the scratch.

308
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
Not too tight next time.

309
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,720
Got it?

310
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,280
Come on, hurry!

311
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,880
Let me help.

312
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,520
Just another two scenes.

313
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,000
Go.

314
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,320
You did very well today.

315
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,080
Do you think so?

316
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,280
I’ll reward you.

317
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
The set is ready, Mim.

318
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
I’m going.

319
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,640
They’re waiting for me.

320
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:06,920
Alright.

321
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,760
I gotta go.

322
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,640
Mim.

323
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes?

324
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,200
I’ll call you later.

325
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,040
Okay. Don’t forget.

326
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay.

327
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,960
Hey.

328
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,320
Didn’t Madam Aoi warn you about her?

329
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,560
What! What do you want me to do?

330
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,800
She was the one who started it.

331
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,800
I’m just playing along with her. Just acting.

332
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Understood?

333
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,840
What? Say it.

334
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
Hey, Bro!

335
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,680
Give me back!

336
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,160
Hey!

337
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,080
Stop it!

338
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,280
You’ve kept checking your phone since morning.

339
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,680
Who’re you waiting for?

340
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,440
Krom’s chat.

341
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,000
Well. Are you guys fighting?

342
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,840
He is changing.

343
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,560
He’s kept hiding from me.

344
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,680
Hiding?

345
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Why?

346
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,840
I have no idea what I did.

347
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,840
He might want to return

348
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,920
to living his normal life.

349
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,320
Away from me

350
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,800
who works with the chaos.

351
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,160
You must check all the stocks

352
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,840
to see if the numbers are the same.

353
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,480
If they are not, you need to refill the shelf.

354
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,320
Didn’t you tell him?

355
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,400
Don’t be lazy!

356
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,800
- I already did.
- You must explain to him.

357
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,280
What happens?

358
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,960
It’s Kor!

359
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
Ayy! It’s him!

360
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,680
Calm down! Are you all right?

361
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,280
Take a deep breath.

362
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,520
Let’s talk outside.

363
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Should we?

364
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,200
Not you.

365
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,800
What do you want to talk to me?

366
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,480
Are you angry at Fueang?

367
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,280
Hah?

368
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
What had he done to you

369
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,000
to make you run away from him?

370
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
I didn’t run away from him.

371
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,840
Don’t bother to deny it.

372
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,040
You can’t lie to me.

373
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,640
What did he do?

374
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,880
He did nothing.

375
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,560
It’s just….

376
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,120
If I stay too close with him,

377
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,800
it'll be hard for me

378
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,840
to get back to America.

379
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,120
Really?

380
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
That is good.

381
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,560
He must be so happy that you won’t go back.

382
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,200
Listen. He likes you so much.

383
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,040
But he never told me.

384
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,880
Don’t you know? Actions speak louder than words.

385
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,960
Got it?

386
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,920
But sometimes…

387
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,280
Words are as important as actions.

388
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
I want to be sure..

389
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,000
that I didn’t imagine it myself.

390
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,400
Are you free tomorrow? Let’s go somewhere with me.

391
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,280
Where will you take me to?

392
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,880
Hmm? Why are you smiling?

393
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,000
You’ll see.

394
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
But you always can't be trusted.

395
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,760
#KorFueangSarai

396
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,960
#KorFueangSarai
 No.1 trending worldwide.

397
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,400
The event hasn’t start yet

398
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,880
but your hashtag already ranked No.1 worldwide.

399
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,240
Our clients are happy.

400
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,720
Thank you.

401
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,040
Um. You’re here?

402
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,000
Get in. Tell the security that you came to see me.

403
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,800
Who is that?

404
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,560
My assistane.

405
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,560
Hmm? Your assistance?

406
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,400
Who?

407
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,160
When did you have an assistance?

408
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Here he comes.

409
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,880
Hello. Hello. Hello.

410
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Krom!

411
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,040
Sand, give him the staff badge.

412
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,120
He’ll take care of me today.

413
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,200
Wait! What?

414
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,640
What’re you?

415
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,400
He was in the neighborhood

416
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,560
and free, so I just offered him this job.

417
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,360
He did very well as your manager.

418
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,280
I was envious.

419
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,360
Don’t standing here. Come on.

420
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,200
Sand.

421
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Okay!

422
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,000
You must be in a rush.

423
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,400
Fueang. Get yourself ready.

424
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,240
I have to take care of those VIP guests.

425
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,840
Don’t forget to pay him.

426
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,920
But we won’t refund you.

427
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,080
Play along with me. You’ll see something clearly.

428
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,560
Did you eat?

429
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,160
Hmm?

430
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,080
Not yet.

431
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,360
Good. I’ll treat you a meal after this.

432
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,960
I want to know more about Zendaya.

433
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,840
Your office is in another country, right?

434
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,680
Yes.

435
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,600
You must speak English fluently.

436
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,800
What about You-are-so-cute.

437
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,560
What does cute mean?

438
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It means pretty.

439
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,560
It means you.

440
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,200
Hilarious, right? I like it.

441
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,120
Right.

442
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,160
Krom.

443
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,120
Fueang.

444
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,360
What are you guys trying to do?

445
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,000
You heard him.

446
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,040
I’m his assistance.

447
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,640
But you are mine.

448
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,800
Why didn’t you tell me

449
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,360
that you’ll work with him.

450
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,880
Hmm? When did I become yours?

451
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,080
Well..

452
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,240
Well..

453
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,840
Oh, you’re here.

454
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,160
You must help me on rehearsal.

455
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,600
I want to put the seaweed in his mouth correctly on the stage.

456
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,240
Okay.

457
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,600
Hey, it is so easy.

458
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
You can do it with me.

459
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,200
No. I want to practice with someone else.

460
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,920
Let’s go. Come with me.

461
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,560
Go.

462
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,720
Do it perfectly.

463
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,800
Make it look real. Stare at me in the eyes.

464
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,840
Okay.

465
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,400
What are you doing?

466
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,640
- Calculating.
- Stop it now!

467
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,200
It’s not the time. They’re on live!

468
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,920
- My gosh! What time is it?
- Check it now!

469
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,320
This is the moment you have all been waiting for.

470
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,680
Let’s welcome our presenters

471
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,880
Koradit and FuangNakhon!

472
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,320
Hello everyone.

473
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,000
Honestly,

474
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,240
seaweed has been one of my favorites.

475
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,240
I can’t remember what flavor this one is.

476
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,480
I forgot my script.

477
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,160
You’re funny.

478
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,880
It is the mayo spicy prawn eggs.

479
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,120
I wonder what it will taste like.

480
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,800
Wow.

481
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,280
Fuang. Do you want to try it first?

482
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:53,080
Feed him! Feed him! Feed him!

483
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,000
This is it. The flavor that I’m looking for.

484
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,360
He was looking for the flavor,

485
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,240
but I’m looking for someone to feed me.

486
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,960
Let me be that one.

487
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,400
We already fed each other,

488
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,240
let’s do it again at the same time.

489
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,040
Sure.

490
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,560
One. Two. Three.

491
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,520
They’re so sweet!

492
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,800
You’re drooling. Here, take it.

493
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
For me?

494
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,040
Uh Hmm! So yummy!

495
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,120
Right?

496
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,200
Can I eat all?

497
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
No!

498
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,160
Move!

499
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,640
Whoa! The lighting is so intense!

500
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,600
He’s right. My eyes hurt.

501
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,240
Sand. Give me the eye drops.

502
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,000
Here.

503
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,040
Thanks.

504
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Can you wipe my face?

505
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,040
Just do it.

506
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,520
Let me move closer.

507
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,760
That’s it.

508
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,160
Here too. Good.

509
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Uh Hmm.

510
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,760
Well, I want to see if someone is jealous.

511
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,520
Wait and see.

512
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,720
Over here. Here.

513
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,680
Oh! What are you looking at?

514
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,480
You jerk! Stay away from my man!

515
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,600
Sand.

516
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,000
Stop it!

517
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,640
Fueang. Fueang!

518
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Oh. Ah.. Yes?

519
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,640
Are you alright? I called you many times.

520
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,920
I’m alright.

521
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,280
How about your eyes?

522
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,680
See? I told you someone is jealousy.

523
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,840
Should I continue?

524
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,760
Good.

525
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,960
How was today? Tired?

526
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,080
I like it.

527
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,239
Not too difficult, right?

528
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,360
It was fun.

529
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,760
Thank you for taking care of Kor.

530
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,400
Where are you going after this?

531
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,080
I’m meeting up with my friend nearby.

532
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,880
Okay.

533
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,199
Uh.. I have to go now.

534
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,280
Alright.

535
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,760
Hi, Yayee.

536
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,800
I’m going.

537
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,480
How about you? Are you there?

538
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,000
Oh, you arrived.

539
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,360
Come on. Don’t be mad.

540
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,600
I’ll buy you an ice cream.

541
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,239
See you.

542
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,159
Oh, you haven't got inside.

543
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,840
I’m sending you off.

544
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,360
Oh. Goodbye.

545
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,600
- Okay. Bye Bye.
- Bye.

546
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,720
Get home safe.

547
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,800
Jong.

548
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,400
Um.

549
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,160
Where's the others?

550
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,720
Yayee went to bring something from her car.

551
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,640
Um.

552
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,960
Thoo said he almost arrive.

553
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,760
I guess he just woke up.

554
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,640
Sure.

555
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,880
She's been gone quite a while.

556
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
- Right.
- I'm here.

557
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,120
Whoa! Speaking of the devil.

558
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,800
Uh.

559
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,720
Aw. Thoo hasn't arrived yet?

560
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,480
He has always been late.

561
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,480
He just woke up.

562
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,200
What?

563
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,320
There's no surprise.

564
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Go ahead.

565
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,400
Go.

566
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,880
Yayee?

567
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,680
Who is Yayee?

568
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,160
How about Fueang?

569
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,720
He's still on interviewing.

570
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
I have something to tell you.

571
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,880
Ouh! Maybe I shouldn’t.

572
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,760
I’d rather not!

573
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,440
Whatever.

574
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,160
Aw! Don’t you want to know?

575
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,400
You didn’t want to talk.

576
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,080
I was just pretending!

577
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,400
Uh.

578
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,480
I overheard Krom talked to someone by phone.

579
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,760
He called that person Yayee, darling,

580
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
honey, babe. Something like that!

581
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,960
He was so buttering up during the call.

582
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,040
They can't be only friends.

583
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,640
That must be his lover.

584
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,640
Lover?

585
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,120
I’ll check it.

586
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,240
Can you do that?

587
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,760
Do what you can. I’ll go to see Fueang.

588
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Find it out.

589
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,880
He has a lover?

590
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
Yes, what’s up?

591
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,320
Have you had a lover?

592
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,160
Hmm?

593
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,440
Sand told me

594
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,440
she overheard you talking with your darling.

595
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,280
I was talking to my friend.

596
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,000
Friend? What’s the name?

597
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,040
Her name is Yayee.

598
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,800
Yayee? Really?

599
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,760
Yes. If you don’t believe me.

600
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,400
I’ll send her account to you.

601
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
I changed my mind. She’s pretty.

602
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,720
You better send it quick!

603
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,920
I won’t.

604
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,680
Don’t forget to explain it to Sand.

605
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,960
Explain...

606
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,200
Why? It won’t be fun.

607
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,200
Fun?

608
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,320
Well, what have you got?

609
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,600
I got something.

610
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,640
Well… It is like what you think.

611
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,440
Ayy!

612
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,440
Are you sure?

613
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,120
Mark my words.

614
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,040
I won’t let my good boy like Fueang

615
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
be cheated!

616
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,480
He is not you.

617
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,160
Hmm?

618
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,240
I mean…

619
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,120
He isn’t master about this stuff like you.

620
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,440
I want you to wait

621
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,600
and tell Fueang about it.

622
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Aw! Huh?

623
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,400
Please, I’m counting on you.

624
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,840
What! Why me?

625
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,520
Wait! Me?

626
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,600
Where is Kor?

627
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,520
He just left

628
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Are you tired?

629
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,200
Have a seat.

630
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,440
Sand?

631
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,120
Hmm?

632
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,160
What is the matter with you?

633
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,000
Please tell me straight.

634
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,680
Hang on tight.

635
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
Krom already has a lover.

636
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Huh!

637
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,120
What did I do?

638
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,840
Mom.

639
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,520
Hi, honey.

640
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,480
Is Krom back yet?

641
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,480
Not yet. Is there anything happen?

642
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,840
Nothing.

643
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,640
Do you need a hand?

644
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,360
It’s alright. I’m almost done.

645
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,440
Thank you.

646
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,200
Krom.

647
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,480
It wasn’t him.

648
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,800
Krom!

649
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,280
Are you alright?

650
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,480
Feel better?

651
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Why did you sit alone outside?

652
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
I was waiting for you.

653
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,840
Why didn’t you accept my call?

654
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,480
You didn’t answer my chat, either.

655
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,200
Oh…

656
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,400
I kept my phone silence.

657
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,840
What do you want to talk to me?

658
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,560
Sand said she heard you talked with your lover.

659
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,720
Hi, Yayee. Don’t be mad.

660
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,960
I’ll buy you an ice cream.

661
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,400
She misguided.

662
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,000
I think she overheard me talking with my friend. Yayee.

663
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Here’s her account.

664
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,720
Look.

665
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,120
My girlfriend wouldn’t post her photo with another guy

666
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,600
and call him husband.

667
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,360
Jeez! That silly Sand!

668
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,000
She made me go crazy!

669
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Well…

670
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,800
Why do you have to be crazy if I had a lover?

671
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
Because I like you.

672
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,240
Is it true?

673
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,120
Yes.

674
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,360
I’ve liked you since the first time I saw your photo.

675
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,040
Your boil rice is ready.

676
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,400
Is he your son?

677
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,440
Yes. His name’s Krom.

678
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,840
I like to come to your house

679
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,560
not only because your mom is a good chef

680
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,920
but I also want to listen to your stories.

681
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,480
As your only child, did he bring you some headaches?

682
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,360
Um. Not likely.

683
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,040
But he is a kind of picky person.

684
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,200
Do you remember the first time we met at the airport?

685
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,840
That wasn’t the coincident.

686
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,120
I just got back from Japan.

687
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,760
Waited for Madam Aoi.

688
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,960
Call me when you arrive.

689
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,080
That’s alright. I’ll find somewhere to sit

690
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,680
Drive safe.

691
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,640
You walked by me.

692
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,720
So, I followed you.

693
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,280
Are you free next week?

694
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,680
My son is coming back to Thailand.

695
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,920
I want to invite you to his welcome party.

696
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,040
Really?

697
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,440
What about that script?

698
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,960
Were you teasing me?

699
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,920
Hey, no!

700
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,040
I was not.

701
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,840
I didn't know that being with you was so excited

702
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,520
and I couldn’t help myself.

703
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,520
So, I pretended to play that role.

704
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,240
I see.

705
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,800
Did you have a Zendaya account because of me?

706
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,160
No, it wasn’t.

707
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,600
I didn’t know that you’ve worked there

708
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,960
until your mom told me

709
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,680
after I had an account

710
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,880
and uploading those posts.

711
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,320
Oh, such a coincident.

712
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,840
Maybe it is…

713
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,360
a destiny.

714
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,640
Yes, it is.

715
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,840
It must be our destiny

716
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,960
that makes me even more like you.

717
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,200
I am so happy

718
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,600
that I've been crushing on you.

719
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,600
Please keep pretending you didn’t know it.

720
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,600
You too.

721
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,200
Please do the same.

722
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,200
Hey! Wait!

723
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,040
Does this mean you like me too?

724
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You heard it.

725
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,240
Please keep pretending too.

726
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,440
He likes me.

727
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,680
Hmm!

728
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,560
Fueang's secret.

729
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,200
Do you have work today?

730
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,000
Yes. But I'll be so worried if you go with me.

731
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,680
He didn't want me to go.

732
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,520
You must be patient. He's not likely a good person.

733
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,600
You haven't told me that you can cook.

734
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,640
I'll give you everything from now on.

735
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,320
I kiss my boyfriend.

736
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,280
Wait. When did I start becoming your boyfriend?

737
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,000
Since now.
