1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,440
Are you crazy?

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,240
You can’t do that.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
Say goodbye to your career If you confess that you are homosexual!

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,080
I like men.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,280
I want to say sorry to my fans who have protected me.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,160
Who is the guy’s name, Sarut?

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,120
and my first love.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,240
I hope he’s watching this interview.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,520
I really want to tell him.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,680
Thank you.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
It’s gone. I’m sorry.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,440
But you promise that you'll get it!

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,240
I’ll stay beside you

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,720
even if you can’t make it.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
I can’t go with you now.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,120
I need to end my vacation

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,720
Do you have to go immediately?

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,960
Good!

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
One. Two. Three.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,680
One. Two. Three.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,920
Be natural.

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,040
One. Two. Three.

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,280
Okay.

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,920
Why do you need pictures with window?

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,600
This window inspires me

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,760
in the plots of my new fiction.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,800
Sweet love occurres at the window.

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,960
What?

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,960
Do you wanna know the story?

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Right?

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,400
I'll tell you.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,880
The story is about a young actor who just lived it.

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,160
He liked to throw bottle caps at his neighbor's house,

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,360
the nerd who just returned from his trip.

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
One night,

36
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,000
that nerd

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
left the window open and waited for his neighbor to enter.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,759
He pretended he was sleeping

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,080
when he heard someone climbing up.

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,039
He was unaware

41
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,120
it wasn't the one he expected,

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,320
but it was a thief!

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
A young actor in the opposite room saw it.

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,840
He jumped out of his own window to help.

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,720
In the end, he was stabbed to death by a thief.

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,280
- Death!
- Death!

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,520
What a crap!

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,920
How is that romantic?

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,880
It isn't finished!

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,040
Chillax!

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,880
Eighteen years have passed.

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,360
A young star is reborn as a teenager.

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,280
He's a new neighbor of that nerd kid

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
who now becomes a middle-aged man.

55
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,720
And the love of different aged couples begins

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,880
at the same window.

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,520
Am I a genius?

58
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,800
What a crazy!

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,720
That's wild! I like it!

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,680
You're all madmen.

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,760
Hey, Krom.

62
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,600
Don't you feel lonely that you're far away from your boyfriend?

63
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:59,640
Why? We can chat or make a video call.

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,880
But it wouldn’t be the same as when you’re together.

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,280
Especially when you’ve just started a relationship,

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,680
You’re gonna miss him badly!

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,960
When I started dating my boyfriend,

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,920
I cried so hard when we were away for only a few days.

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,200
How about now?

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,000
She doesn't even feel anything when he's gone for three months.

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,680
That's not true!

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,079
You must tell him now.

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Faster is better for him.

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,200
I don’t have any worries. He’s FueangNakhon.

75
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,720
The one who can turn all bad situations

76
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,920
to be good.

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,520
I’m sure he’ll make our relationship

78
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,960
seem like we're never apart.

79
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,400
I know so.

80
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,520
Where are you going? You're fully dressed up.

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,280
I have an appointment

82
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,920
for a contract renewal.

83
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,040
Hello Sand.

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,760
You don’t need to come now, Fueang.

85
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,760
Why?

86
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,080
They decided to have a new presenter.

87
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,159
Your current image doesn’t meet

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,920
their product's needs anymore.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,680
Are you all right?

90
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,280
I’m okay.

91
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,480
I understand.

92
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,880
All right.

93
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,520
Okay, bye.

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,240
What's wrong?

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
They refused to renew my contract.

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,520
Isn’t their slogan a perfume for gentlemen?

97
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,280
Why?

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,520
You don’t look gentlemen enough if you are gay?

99
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Calm down.

100
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,880
You must understand.

101
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
It’s the business world.

102
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,840
They must choose the best for their brand.

103
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,680
Where’re you going?

104
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,080
Changing my dress. I’m sweating.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,320
Fueang needs you now!

106
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,120
Fueang.

107
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,240
Krom.

108
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,880
It's my free day.

109
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,320
I’m about to go see you.

110
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,080
Let’s go somewhere good.

111
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,320
Are you trying to get something from me?

112
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,520
Nothing

113
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,720
I just want to hug and kiss you.

114
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,280
Here.

115
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,680
Kor told you about that contract,

116
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,160
didn’t he?

117
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,440
Yes. Are you okay?

118
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,640
No.

119
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
I’m not okay.

120
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,720
I’ve always done my best

121
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
every time they hired me.

122
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,760
I’d never disappointed them

123
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,360
when they gave me chances.

124
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,440
But everything has gone because I’m gay.

125
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,840
In fact, I'm not mad at anyone.

126
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,440
They have their own reasons.

127
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
I’ll get used to it.

128
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,920
Everything will be all right.

129
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,640
Eh… Should I stay sad.

130
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
So, you can keep comforting me like this.

131
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Come on.

132
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,280
Even if you didn't have any issues, you’d still get me.

133
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,920
I mean..

134
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Get my support.

135
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,280
Are you giving me a signal or not?

136
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,960
Um, I don’t know.

137
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
I want to get you now.

138
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Fueang.

139
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
No, Fueang.

140
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,920
I told you no.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,360
A guy who came yesterday,

142
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,920
is he FueangNakhon,

143
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,120
Kor's friend?

144
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
Yes, he is.

145
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
Why did he come to see you?

146
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,200
He talked to me about Kor

147
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,520
He said I should give him a chance.

148
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,600
Then why don’t you?

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,160
I think…

150
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,280
He deserves someone better.

151
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,360
Honey… When your dad passed away,

152
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,280
it made me realize that

153
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,680
life is uncertain.

154
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,960
People will never know when death will come.

155
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,800
If you still love each other,

156
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,400
then don’t let time pass by.

157
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,080
Otherwise, you’ll regret it later,

158
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,920
like I do.

159
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Imagine If you had someone who could love you,

160
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,480
fight alongside and protect you

161
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,720
with goodwill.

162
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,480
The one you could trust

163
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,880
to keep your secret.

164
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,200
Not easy to find one, right?

165
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,920
But I found that person.

166
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,080
You should keep him close.

167
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Take care of him as I’ll do to Krom.

168
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,000
Forever.

169
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,920
then don’t let time pass by.

170
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,360
Otherwise, you’ll regret it later,

171
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
like I do.

172
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,000
Let’s find something to eat.

173
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,720
Okay.

174
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,920
Fueang. Namsom calls you.

175
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,480
Namsom?

176
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,680
Hi, Namsom.

177
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,200
Fueang. Can we talk?

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,920
Sure. What’s wrong?

179
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,280
I called Kor earlier, but he didn’t respond.

180
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,520
Is he working?

181
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,920
No. He’s here with me.

182
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,720
Can you tell him something for me?

183
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,160
Yes. What do you want to tell him?

184
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Hey, are you still mad at Namsom?

185
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,760
Why didn’t you pick up her calls?

186
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,000
I don’t want to talk with her

187
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,960
But she does.

188
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,320
She asked me to tell you that

189
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,920
she wants to meet.

190
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,360
Why?

191
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,160
No idea. She might have an important thing to tell you.

192
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,320
Go to see her if you want to know.

193
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,720
I told you. I don’t want to talk!

194
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,880
She wanted us to be over!

195
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,560
So, I did what she asked!

196
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,920
Got it?

197
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,680
Clear this table for me.

198
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,120
Hey. 2 p.m. at the temple.

199
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
Tell me for what?

200
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,200
Should you call and tell Namsom

201
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,840
that he won’t go?

202
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,480
No need. He’ll go.

203
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,920
Really?

204
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,840
Trust me. I know him well.

205
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,400
You didn’t tell him

206
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,080
which temple.

207
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,560
Will he go to the right place?

208
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,920
Yes. It’s the one near Namsom’s house.

209
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,240
They liked to go to this place when they were dating.

210
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,120
It was the place they first met.

211
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,560
At the temple?

212
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,960
Many people think

213
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,160
they met at the event.

214
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,760
No.

215
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,720
During Kor’s dad’s funeral.

216
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
Her dad just died, too.

217
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,080
That was how they met.

218
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,160
Sit here, mom.

219
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,720
Your father has gone.

220
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,119
What should we do now?

221
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,680
From now on

222
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,040
I’ll take care of us.

223
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,960
Hello auntie. He’s inside.

224
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,360
We’ll get back shortly.

225
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,120
Will you ordain a monk for your father?

226
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
I’ll go to the restroom.

227
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,040
Okay.

228
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,200
I’m sorry for you and your husband.

229
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,240
You only have one child.

230
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,800
And he can’t ordain

231
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,880
because of his sexuality.

232
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,360
Namsom! Namsom! Help me with this.

233
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,440
I’ll take the rest.

234
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,560
Over here.

235
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Okay.

236
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,160
Let me help you.

237
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,600
I’m going that way.

238
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,760
Thank you.

239
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,600
You can put them here.

240
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,760
Thank you.

241
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,920
That’s my dad.

242
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,640
It must be difficult for you.

243
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,120
Yes.

244
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,040
Please be strong.

245
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Thanks.

246
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,280
He’s the actor.

247
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,840
I have to go.

248
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,680
What are you doing here?

249
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,920
My dad just passed away, too.

250
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
Well, excuse me.

251
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,200
They met at the event after that.

252
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,120
Whoa, Fuang!

253
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,920
We have another guest to join us today.

254
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,920
Who?

255
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,440
Are you going on stage with us? Look.

256
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,800
So stunning!

257
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,760
Nonsense! It's just my everyday look.

258
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,880
You look nice.

259
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,000
I know.

260
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,480
I really mean it.

261
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,360
Yeah!

262
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,080
I'm not kidding.

263
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,440
Kor. Fueang.

264
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,960
Are you ready for the briefing with MC?

265
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,520
- Yes.
- All right.

266
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,720
Hello, I’m Namsom.

267
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,800
He always gets stunned by beautiful girls.

268
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,080
Sand. They've met before.

269
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,720
At his dad’s funeral.

270
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,880
Really? Oh!

271
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,880
Here is the list of questions.

272
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,760
These questions are all right.

273
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,160
But we must rehearse them together.

274
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,720
Sure.

275
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,120
So. Are you good now?

276
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,040
Yes.

277
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,320
Happy to hear that.

278
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,480
Can I have your Line ID?

279
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,720
In case I can recommend a job to you.

280
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,560
Oh, sure.

281
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,960
Hello, what are you doing?

282
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,320
I just arrived home from work.

283
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,640
You’re hard-working.

284
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,920
When are you free?

285
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,120
Let’s hang out.

286
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,320
Okay. I’d love to.

287
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,840
When did he know

288
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,400
that Namsom is not a woman?

289
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,320
Thank you for your time to join us today.

290
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,480
See you again soon.

291
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,560
Thank you.

292
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,520
Kor.

293
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,440
The gift for your hard work.

294
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,400
You shouldn’t do this.

295
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,520
Someone might see and write about us.

296
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,280
That I’m trying to hit on you?

297
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,880
Whatever. I want to be honest with you.

298
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,280
I don’t care about them.

299
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,960
But I do.

300
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,280
Why?

301
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
No matter how hard you try

302
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,160
we still can’t make it.

303
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,560
Namsom.

304
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,280
Talk to me.

305
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,160
Why can’t we make it?

306
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,400
I told you.

307
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,280
I don’t like you.

308
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,120
I didn’t buy it.

309
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,320
We’ve been together for a while.

310
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
I know how you feel.

311
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,680
Tell me the truth.

312
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,120
What do you think of me?

313
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,160
And why can’t we be together?

314
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,400
I… I have someone else.

315
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,800
He’s curious

316
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,560
that we’re having an affair.

317
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Give me your phone.

318
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,160
Huh?

319
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,960
If that guy exists.

320
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,280
Then call him now.

321
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,200
I want to ensure that you aren’t lying.

322
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,520
Call him. Do it.

323
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,440
Why not? If you don’t do that, then tell me.

324
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,520
Why can’t we be together?

325
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,920
I’m not a woman.

326
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,960
I’m a ladyboy.

327
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,760
Mr. Natee Wongsopa.

328
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,000
Now you know why we can't be together.

329
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,320
I don’t care who you are.

330
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,520
I like you.

331
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
And I won’t stop chasing you.

332
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,520
Please accept my love.

333
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,920
That’s all right.

334
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,320
We’re good.

335
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,720
Don’t cry.

336
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,880
They’d been together after that.

337
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,400
But you know,

338
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,720
they never make out.

339
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,960
Really?

340
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,440
Are you talking about a Casanova like Kor?

341
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,200
Yes. They were just almost.

342
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,480
Namsom told him that

343
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,880
she wanted to do

344
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,520
the sex reassignment surgery first.

345
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,640
That made me realize.

346
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,000
He really loves her.

347
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,760
He wouldn’t wait if she weren’t the right one.

348
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,040
Okay.

349
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,920
Come on. Let’s sneak on them.

350
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,440
Okay.

351
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,080
There, Namsom.

352
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,480
Why isn’t Kor here yet?

353
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Fueang. Are you sure about him?

354
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,280
Yes. I never get wrong before.

355
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,280
But it’s already an hour late.

356
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,360
All right. Let me call him.

357
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,880
Um.

358
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,720
Fueang! That’s Kor!

359
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,640
It's all right. I'm with her now.

360
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,560
You are late.

361
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,000
I’ve been here for a while.

362
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,080
Just want to see if you’ll wait for me.

363
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,000
You’re so mean.

364
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,040
If you call me here and chase me later,

365
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,880
I’ll throw you into this canal.

366
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,960
Kor.

367
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,480
I want to have you back in my life.

368
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,240
But we must improve ourselves

369
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
if we want our love to last long.

370
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,320
I can do anything to make you stay with me.

371
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,680
Please.

372
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,320
I promise!

373
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,120
Just tell me what to do!

374
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
I’ll do it!

375
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,640
If you’re worried about other women. I promise.

376
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,600
I won’t have anyone else.

377
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,080
Trust me.

378
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,120
Okay.

379
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,640
Thank you.

380
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,160
We’re at the temple!

381
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
You refuse me again.

382
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,640
All right. Let’s make merits.

383
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,520
We’re done here.

384
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,640
It’s our time now.

385
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,880
Where are we going?

386
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,680
Where are you taking me?

387
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Just come.

388
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,280
Are you okay?

389
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,560
I knew this day would come.

390
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,120
The day they replaced me with a new guy.

391
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,080
I just feel so blank

392
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,680
when it comes.

393
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,720
Fueang.

394
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,080
Krom!

395
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,960
See. There are people who support you as you are.

396
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,120
Krom is so cute!

397
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,840
He’s lovely, like a bunny!

398
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,680
Can we have photos with you?

399
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,840
Sure.

400
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,920
Of course.

401
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,080
- Of course.
- Thanks.

402
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,680
Sure.

403
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,120
Let’s take pictures.

404
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,560
A little closer.

405
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,360
Bunny post.

406
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,480
Bunny.

407
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,280
One. Two. Three.

408
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,480
Thank you.

409
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,920
Thank you.

410
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,679
You’re welcome.

411
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,679
Let’s go.

412
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,480
I have something to show you.

413
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,639
Okay.

414
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,760
Hello Fueang.

415
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,280
He came to choose the ring as arranged, right?

416
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,239
Yes.

417
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,120
Please wait.

418
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,159
Ring?

419
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,280
Um.

420
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,280
I want to give it to you.

421
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,320
You must wear it with you all the time.

422
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,360
I’ll do the same.

423
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,239
They’re the couple rings.

424
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,080
Here you go. The one you chose.

425
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,480
This is a Satin finish ring.

426
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,280
Its outer surface is lustrous but doesn’t reflect.

427
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,240
What do you think? Is it nice?

428
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,680
I don’t know.

429
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,520
You can change

430
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
if you prefer a more reflective one.

431
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,160
Or if you like a brighter color.

432
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,560
I recommend the rose gold. It’s our popular one.

433
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,320
Rose gold is good.

434
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,760
Can we have a look?

435
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,160
Sure. Please hold on.

436
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,760
You must try them to find out

437
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,040
which one you like.

438
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,120
I’m sorry.

439
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,760
Am I rushing you too much?

440
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,280
We can leave if you feel uncomfortable.

441
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,520
It’s not like that. But I…

442
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,040
I’m too shy.

443
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,680
I never did something like this before.

444
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,240
Oh. But we can get those rings.

445
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,320
I don’t want to ruin your intention.

446
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,400
Are you sure?

447
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,080
Um. Yes.

448
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,920
Here is the Rose gold.

449
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,720
It’s gorgeous.

450
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,840
But I wonder if it’ll match yours.

451
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,040
We can make the models to help you make your decision easier.

452
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,960
But it’ll take two days.

453
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,040
Two days?

454
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,480
Yes.

455
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,240
You can do it.

456
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,040
We’ll get back to see them.

457
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,120
Fueang.

458
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,280
What?

459
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,680
Well…

460
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,280
I must return to America tomorrow.

461
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,560
No one told me about it.

462
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,760
I’m sorry.

463
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,640
Fueang.

464
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,040
I didn’t want to hide it from you.

465
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,360
I just couldn’t find a chance.

466
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,200
Please don’t be mad at me.

467
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,680
I'm thinking about

468
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,560
what I should do

469
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,400
so that you don't forget me

470
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,880
when you go to America.

471
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,920
Seriously?

472
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,720
Yes.

473
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,840
I can swear to God.

474
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,760
You'll ditch me if I lie to you.

475
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,880
You jackass! I was worried all along.

476
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,440
So, have you figured it out?

477
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,400
Not yet.

478
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,680
I’m thinking of giving you my perfume.

479
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,240
You can use it whenever you miss me.

480
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,560
This one.

481
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,800
They said it'll give a unique scent

482
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,920
depending on the user's skin.

483
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,480
Awesome!

484
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,040
Never used it before.

485
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,080
Let’s have a test.

486
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,960
Okay.

487
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,160
Fueang. What are you doing?

488
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,280
I bet.

489
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,560
It must smells better on your skin.

490
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,040
Hey. Is this how you test it?

491
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,000
What?

492
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,640
I want to test it on your skin.

493
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,080
Let me smell you, Navy.

494
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,400
Stop it, Fueang. Hey.

495
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,880
Someone might see us.

496
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,400
Do you want me to stop?

497
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,760
We are in the parking lot!

498
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Isn’t it thrilling?

499
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,720
Are you lying about the perfume?

500
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,120
You planed it, didn’t you?

501
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,280
Yes.

502
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,800
You’re right.

503
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,120
This will be our unforgettable moment.

504
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,520
Honey.

505
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,280
Come on, mom. Why are you always crying?

506
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,240
This is too urgent!

507
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,680
I know.

508
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,240
I haven’t finished packing

509
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,120
those food supplies for you.

510
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,680
I have more than enough.

511
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,240
Whoa! Do you mean these are not all?

512
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,920
They're huge!

513
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,680
These are so few! Are you sure they’re enough?

514
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,280
They’re all right, mom.

515
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,160
Don’t forget to call us

516
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,040
when you arrive America.

517
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,840
Sure.

518
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,120
Call us soon.

519
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,320
It’s a twelve-hour flight.

520
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,560
I’ll wait for your call.

521
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,360
I gotta go.

522
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
We’ll miss you.

523
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,480
Take care of yourself.

524
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,080
I love you.

525
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,080
All right.

526
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,480
Fueang.

527
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,640
Surprise!

528
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,560
Fueang.

529
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,240
Don’t you have to go to work?

530
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,080
Yes. But I ask them out for an hour

531
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,560
to send you off.

532
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,520
Right!

533
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,320
Yayee just changed the oil in her car’s engine.

534
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,120
Should we warm it by riding around the village?

535
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,880
Come on.

536
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,840
You said who?

537
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,960
Yayee!

538
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,080
Okay. Let’s go!

539
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,720
Good!

540
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,640
Hurry.

541
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,160
Right.

542
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,440
Will you come with us?

543
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,440
Yes, we will.

544
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,760
Come on, honey.

545
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,600
Okay.

546
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,280
I’m going to miss you so much.

547
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,880
You must text me often.

548
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,480
Make sure to eat on time.

549
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,480
Don’t get sick.

550
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,520
I’ll miss you.

551
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,080
Krom.

552
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,840
Don’t cry.

553
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,760
Listen to me.

554
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,560
Go live your life.

555
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,200
Work your best.

556
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,480
Don’t worry about anything here.

557
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,240
I’ll love you.

558
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,480
Be faithful to you.

559
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,240
I’m always yours.

560
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,240
Please don’t cry.

561
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,840
I don’t want to cry.

562
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,320
I love you, too.

563
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:10,240
Sorry that you have to see me cry on our last day.

564
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,080
You must give me a hug when I get back.

565
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,120
I won't go too long.

566
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,920
I love you.

567
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,120
Oops!

568
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,160
Are you okay?

569
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,400
Hurry, honey!

570
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,240
Let me check your dad!

571
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,440
Run fast!

572
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,680
Do you want us to go another round?

573
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,960
It’s all right. I have a flight to catch.

574
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,760
I’m going.

575
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,240
Please take care.

576
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,760
I’ll give you a signal

577
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,880
before entering this door into your house.

578
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,440
Okay.

579
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,120
Nice to officially meet you.

580
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,360
Huh!. Nice to meet you, too.

581
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,480
Don't forget to check my post on Zendaya.

582
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,640
Hey, I can give you a ride.

583
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,840
Okay.

584
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,360
Are you free these days?

585
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,880
Why?

586
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,280
In case you’re bored

587
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,880
and want to find something to do by being my manager.

588
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,680
Huh? Your manager?

589
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,120
First, you must talk to me casually.

590
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,760
Okay, Fueang.

591
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,640
Krom.

592
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,920
What’s wrong?

593
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,320
I like you.

594
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,360
Please pretend that you don't know it.

595
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,560
You too.

596
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,080
He likes me?

597
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,080
I’ll stay beside you

598
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,520
even if you can’t make it.

599
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,920
The past three months have flown by so fast.

600
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,000
Many things happened.

601
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,600
One of them is…

602
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,760
Why did you decide to tell the public?

603
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,760
Nothing much.

604
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,000
I just love her.

605
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,880
Kor and Namsom got back together officially.

606
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,960
So much.

607
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,520
More than I can explain.

608
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,080
I invested a lot of time and money on them.

609
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,240
And then they left.

610
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,120
Sand. Who else do we have now?

611
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,920
As Fueang said.

612
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,600
Time will change everything.

613
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,480
There are always new rising stars.

614
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,160
It’s simple.

615
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,760
But no matter how much time pass by,

616
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,040
there's something that never changes.

617
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,680
It’s us.

618
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,400
I had to work this morning.

619
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,840
Just got home now.

620
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,600
Although we’re living in different time zones,

621
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,320
but we always find time to talk

622
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,640
and make video calls as often as possible.

623
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,680
He has more jobs now.

624
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,160
The set is ready, Fueang.

625
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,120
Yes.

626
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,000
Even though it's not a leading role,

627
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,120
that seems to be a new challenge for him.

628
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,680
For my part.

629
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,120
After my team and I have put our efforts

630
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,360
for three months,

631
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,840
Zendaya has been in shape.

632
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,960
We successfully deleted all foreign languages.

633
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,040
Every user can use only English in this application.

634
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,360
One day, we got good news.

635
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,800
Simon said.

636
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,880
Zendaya will be merged with a big company soon.

637
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,840
All employees will receive vacation

638
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,000
before returning to work in the new office.

639
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,560
Navy.

640
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,800
Hmm.

641
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,040
What do you want to talk to me about, sir?

642
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,200
I need to tell you.

643
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,480
You’re not gonna have a vacation.

644
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,600
Why?

645
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,680
What happened?

646
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,280
Why?

647
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,920
Because I.. I need you to work.

648
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,960
That’s why.

649
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,520
How is the feedback after you and Namsom got back together?

650
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,080
They're better than we expected.

651
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,160
What's wrong with you?

652
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,680
I miss Krom.

653
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,560
Krom.

654
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,720
I think I saw him!

655
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:41,920
Krom.

656
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,600
Aw!
