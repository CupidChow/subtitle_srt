1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,000
Morning.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,160
Morning.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,800
Namsom and I are back together.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Wait.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,400
Get in the car, Namsom.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,360
Come on.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,400
Aren’t you in a hurry?

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,520
Mom. Mom!

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,880
I’ll call you

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,320
when I reach home.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,120
Namsom.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,080
I call you only tonight.

13
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,240
Will your boyfriend upset about me?

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,439
I have no one.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,560
Such a pity that I couldn’t be there

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,480
to take care of you.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,560
What do you want to eat? I’ll make it for you.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,400
Omelet.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,440
Honestly, I can be anything.

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
Just for you.

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,880
Well. I already love to be your bottom.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,880
Mr. Lee.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,720
He wants to support Fueang to be as famous

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,960
as Korean superstar.

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
Under one condition.

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,840
He must stay single.

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,320
Is he dating anyone?

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,160
Hmm?

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,800
I have to shoot many love scenes

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,400
with him.

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
FueangNakhon isn’t date anyone.

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,240
Don’t tease her, Krom.

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
We already knew about you guys

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,600
Smiling for what?

35
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,240
Sory, my bad.

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,160
Stop!

37
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,760
Let go off me!

38
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,440
I don’t want to ruin your life again.

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,280
I’m sorry, Namsom.

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,720
Luckily,

41
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,600
that you just start dating.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
You guys won’t be serious that much

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
I don’t date with him for fun.

44
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,680
But he told me that

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,759
it hasn’t that serious.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,880
Yes. That’s what I told her.

47
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,840
I’m going back to America soon.

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,880
You can find someone else

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,640
when your contract has finished.

50
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,720
I’ll let you sleep on it

51
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,080
whether you really love me

52
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,400
or not.

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,640
But if you ensure that

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
you don’t want me.

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
I’ll let you go.

56
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,520
Did you know him enough

57
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,240
to criticize him?

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,880
I’m not surprised

59
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
that he faded from social media.

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,440
You poor man. I want to hug him.

61
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,280
I miss you.

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,240
You must accept that job.

63
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,240
How about us?

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,640
I decided.

65
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,200
We'll keep it secret.

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,720
They said

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,840
Our brains won’t work correctly when we have love.

68
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,440
I would be like that

69
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,240
if I didn’t date with a superstar

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,440
who’s having a bright future like FueangNakhon.

71
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,880
You’re another part of my life.

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,200
Only having you beside me.

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,880
I won’t ask anything for more.

74
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,080
With this moment…

75
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,920
Maybe it was destiny

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,480
that put us together.

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,400
You’re another part of my life.

78
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,280
You’re always beside me.

79
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,840
I won’t ask anything for me.

80
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,520
Just holding our hearts together.

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,200
It’s paradise. Our moments are beautiful.

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,600
We belong to each other.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Because all my life is you.

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,280
Morning.

85
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
Our love

86
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,280
won't go far if we let it rule

87
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,480
by our hearts alone.

88
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,880
It needs to use the brain

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520
to figure out what we need to deal with.

90
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
After we decided

91
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,200
that we’ll keep our date a secret.

92
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
The first thing we need to do is

93
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,320
deal with our conspirators.

94
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,040
If I reveal Fueang and Kromatha’s secret

95
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,800
to someone else…

96
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,160
- If I reveal Fueang and Kromatha’s secret
- If I reveal Fueang and Kromatha’s secret

97
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,880
- to someone else…
- to someone else…

98
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,440
Let me…

99
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,520
- Let me…
- Let me…

100
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,640
Lose my job.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,840
Say it.

102
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,240
Say it.

103
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520
- Lose my job.
- Lose my job.

104
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,120
Louder!

105
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,080
- Louder!
- Louder!

106
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,640
I told you to speak louder!

107
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,240
Repeat me!

108
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Lose my job.

109
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,400
- Lose my job.
- Lose my job…

110
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,400
I beg…

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,480
If they lie to me.

112
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
Let their lives fail,

113
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,920
Getting fired and losing their job.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,600
Amen!

115
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,720
- Lose my job!
- Lose my job!

116
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,920
You satisfied?!

117
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,120
Put it!

118
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,920
Alright! Alright!

119
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
Come on, Thoo. Yayee.

120
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
Fueang will be famous worldwide!

121
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,800
I knew it! He’s just as I thought!

122
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,160
He’ll become a global superstar one day!

123
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,360
Fueang! Just come to our house any time.

124
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,360
I’ll make all of your favorite dishes.

125
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,159
Let’s celebrate!

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
I’m not sure

127
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,400
if she listened to me well.

128
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
But I won’t worry at all.

129
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,760
She’s always good at keeping secrets.

130
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
She could hide a secret from me for months

131
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,200
that we have a superstar

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,560
as our neighbor.

133
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,920
I’m dating with Krom now.

134
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,840
Hey! Really?

135
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,920
That’s good!

136
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
His brother is happy with us.

137
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
But he said

138
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,360
there’s no need to talk

139
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
to his mom.

140
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,120
She’ll never talk to anyone about us.

141
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
I have something to tell you.

142
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,840
Madam Aoi allows us to date.

143
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,000
With only one rule.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,480
I can’t follow Fueang to his workplace again.

145
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,800
Promise me! Don’t let anyone knows it!

146
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,280
and we aren’t allowed

147
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,480
to hang out together outside.

148
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,040
Everything seems smooth.

149
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,440
But I forgot one person…

150
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,600
Focus on what you do…

151
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
and everything will be alright.

152
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
I like it.

153
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,160
Where are you?

154
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
I’m at the store.

155
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,560
Gotta go to work in an hour. I’d love to see you.

156
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,440
Okay. I’m coming..

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,480
I’m out of bag. Kor’s room is locked too.

158
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,240
It’s alright. I just want to hug you.

159
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,760
Don’t worry. I’ll bring them.

160
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,040
Which one he uses?

161
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Let’s bring all.

162
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,960
What are you doing?

163
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,400
Aw, Kung!

164
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Nothing!

165
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,640
I’m going home.

166
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
Isn’t it too early?

167
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,400
Ouch! I’m so hungry.

168
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,000
Stop.

169
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,640
You just ate three big bowls of noodles.

170
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,400
I saw it.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
I’m feeling unwell.

172
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,040
I might be sick.

173
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,240
- I don’t think so.
- I need some rest.

174
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
You look fine.

175
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,760
I’m not.

176
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,640
I have to go.

177
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,600
Krom!

178
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,600
What’s up, dad?

179
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,320
Kung said you stole something from our store.

180
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,040
Wait. Calm down.

181
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Don’t be mad at me yet.

182
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,280
I’m just worried about you.

183
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,240
I heard that

184
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,040
some rich kids

185
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,240
like to steal things

186
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
that they don’t actually want,

187
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,120
which is reactive to their mental illness.

188
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,280
I didn’t see you for quite a while.

189
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,840
I’m afraid you have some kind of that sort.

190
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,440
So we can get you a cure in time.

191
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,240
I didn’t steal anything.

192
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,360
I saw you took something.

193
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,400
and you were skulking too.

194
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,000
I took something, but…

195
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
I’ll pay it later.

196
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,520
See.

197
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
Show me.

198
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,480
What were you taken?

199
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,320
Open it.

200
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,920
Aw.

201
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,440
Krom.

202
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,360
Yes.

203
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,600
I forgot to talk to my dad about it.

204
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,920
Krom.

205
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,800
I gotta go.

206
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,520
Where’re you going?

207
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,960
Home!

208
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,840
See you later.

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,840
Bye Bye, Kung.

210
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
Krom!

211
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,640
What was in his bag?

212
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,000
Ah… I…

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,520
You take care of the store!

214
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,720
I have to hurry!

215
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,920
Sorry!

216
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,440
What are they hiding from me?

217
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,920
Snacks?

218
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,760
This one?

219
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,760
No! He doesn’t like it.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,480
Aw! I just refilled them recently.

221
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,040
Is it Valentine’s Day?

222
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,240
No! This is all we got left?

223
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,120
Who is he going to use them with?

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
I’ll refill them back for you.

225
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,520
Aw. You’re back so early.

226
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,840
Your mom isn’t well.

227
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
So I got some food for her.

228
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,320
Is that her food?

229
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,880
How about you? Are you going somewhere?

230
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,160
I’m going out with my friend.

231
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,520
He should be here now.

232
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,960
See you later.

233
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,360
Her food looks weird.

234
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,560
So do you, dad.

235
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,480
See you around!

236
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
What are you doing?

237
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,760
He stole the condoms to use with Fueang.

238
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,960
Safety first. Good boy!

239
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,760
That’s our son!

240
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,120
He’s not a kid anymore, honey!

241
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,280
Let them live their lives.

242
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
Come on, get inside.

243
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,920
Did you skip your work?

244
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,280
Are you hungry?

245
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,000
Get in!

246
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
Honey. Leave them alone.

247
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Okay, Madam Aoi.

248
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,280
Alright. I won’t take him outside.

249
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,040
Don’t worry.

250
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,800
Okay. Bye.

251
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,520
Good news. All of my events today were canceled.

252
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,600
I’ll stay with you all day.

253
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,560
Really?

254
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,800
So nice.

255
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,920
Where are they? Didn’t you bring them?

256
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,640
They’re in here.

257
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,080
Let me see.

258
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,360
These are a lot.

259
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,400
I don’t know which one you like.

260
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,360
So, I took every type.

261
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,000
We don’t need to steal from Kor anymore.

262
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,720
Well. Give me a kiss.

263
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,840
Just ensure that the curtains are closed.

264
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,480
I closed them.

265
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,240
Did you lock the door?

266
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,920
Krom. Tell me.

267
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,520
What are you afraid of?

268
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,200
Hmm?

269
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,520
I’m scared that my dad would follow me here.

270
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,920
Did he know too?

271
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,160
Hello, sir.

272
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,040
Can I have some time to talk to you?

273
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,680
Fuang!

274
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,640
You become a real superstar!

275
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,640
Finally! You can do it!

276
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,680
I’m happy for you!

277
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,120
I told him about it.

278
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,520
I also told him

279
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
that you guys need to keep your dating secret.

280
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,640
What I am doing

281
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,800
is not because I wasn’t serious with him.

282
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,920
Please don’t get me wrong.

283
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,760
Relax.

284
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,640
If your love doesn’t ruin your guys career.

285
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,800
Then I’m fine with it. Okay?

286
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,720
Okay.

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,720
Well, so this is your official introduction.

288
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,800
Thanks, sir.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Since that day,

290
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
we don’t have any anymore pressures.

291
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,480
We can spend our quality time

292
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,760
together

293
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,400
Although

294
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,720
we can’t stroll around outside

295
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
like other couples

296
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,960
but we have home

297
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,160
as our safe place,

298
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,720
where we can share our loves.

299
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,320
and he

300
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,880
never forget to fill

301
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,720
my heart.

302
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,960
I still work in Thailand.

303
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,520
But it may less than before

304
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,440
as I have to work abroad, too

305
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,320
We heard that they aren’t allow you to date.

306
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,800
Is it true?

307
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,880
It’s not that strict as you think.

308
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,200
They just want me to focus on the jobs.

309
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,280
How about KorFuang’s fans?

310
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,800
Will they still get some vibes from both of you?

311
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,680
Of course. They will.

312
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,400
How about the rumor

313
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,440
about you and Kromatha,

314
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,000
your temporary manager.

315
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,280
They said

316
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,640
you’re dating with him.

317
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
Is it true?

318
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
It’s just a rumor.

319
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
There is no such a thing.

320
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,000
They were just getting along pretty well.

321
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Right, Fueang?

322
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,440
Please answer.

323
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,440
What about it?

324
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,680
It’s true, right?

325
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,320
Yes.

326
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,600
Well, excuse us.

327
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,440
He needs to go to the set now.

328
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,240
Excuse me, please.

329
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,520
There’s nothing.

330
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,080
Come on, Sand.

331
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,360
You see! People are talking about their relationship.

332
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
It’s just a fan’s talk.

333
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,560
Nothing to worry about.

334
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,280
You should put more effort asking them.

335
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,320
Cee.

336
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Hi, Madam Aoi.

337
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,360
Hi, Cee.

338
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,480
Hi. What are you doing here?

339
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,200
I need to monitor my trainees.

340
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,600
Oops! Big boss like you,

341
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,920
has to supervise them yourself?

342
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,360
I knew it’s unneeded.

343
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,160
But I want them to be good faster.

344
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,200
By the way, Congratulations

345
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,480
about FueangNaknon.

346
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,560
Thank you.

347
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,760
They are gossiping

348
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,200
that he looked uncomfortable

349
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,080
with the answer about

350
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,560
his temporary manager.

351
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,920
Nonsense.

352
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,720
He just got bored with this kind of question.

353
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,560
It’s been ages since he started his career.

354
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,520
It wasn’t hard for him

355
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,880
to handle any difficult interviews

356
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,720
from those dipshits!

357
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,880
Those unethical reporters

358
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,680
are so annoying.

359
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,000
Don’t worry. I’m talking about those bad ones.

360
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,520
Not you.

361
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,520
Or are you one of them?

362
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,440
You’re fierce as always.

363
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,000
She’s just kidding.

364
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,280
Let’s go. It’s stinky here!

365
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,280
Bye, Cee.

366
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,320
Be careful, Sand! You’ll get stinky!

367
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,160
I can’t wait for my turn!

368
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,200
You look a mess.

369
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Are you hangover again?

370
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,760
There are many presses today.

371
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,400
You’ll get in trouble.

372
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,960
Screw them!

373
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,320
Aw. You silly!

374
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,640
So, did you make up with Namsom?

375
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,760
For what?

376
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,080
I’m this good, but she still doesn’t care about me.

377
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
I don’t care for her, either.

378
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,080
Oh Ho! Why don’t you show her

379
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,480
that the love between you and her

380
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,880
can't ruin anyone’s life.

381
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
Give your positive energies

382
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,400
to someone else!

383
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,480
Before I throw up to your face!

384
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,920
and come out of your ass!

385
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,040
Leave me alone!

386
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,600
I’m headache here!

387
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,280
Fueang.

388
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,960
Director said.

389
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,080
The next scene that you have to shoot with Cheesecake,

390
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,240
she wants to do a real kiss.

391
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,880
Wait.

392
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,720
I remember she said

393
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,840
she wanted a fake kiss, didn’t she?

394
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
We just got the update from her.

395
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,520
She needs a real kiss

396
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,240
to awaken her spirit as an actress

397
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,320
Get ready.

398
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,640
Hey.

399
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,040
If you do it.

400
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,240
Krom will kill you.

401
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,680
Don’t you go on a date today?

402
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,720
How do you know that I’m dating?

403
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,600
That wasn’t hard.

404
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,240
You wouldn’t take… (condoms)

405
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,960
just for blowing.

406
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
You knew it!

407
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,480
Stop acting! Tell me who.

408
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,840
I want to see that person.

409
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,440
I won’t tell anyone if it’s not you.

410
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,880
I’m Ready.

411
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,720
I’m dating with

412
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,280
the one who you knew.

413
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,880
Who I knew?

414
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,720
Tell me more.

415
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,200
You’ve known this guy for a long time.

416
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,080
I knew him?

417
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,520
Give me the name!

418
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,880
He’s very close!

419
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,400
Come on!

420
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,920
It's not hard to guess!

421
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,320
Fueang.

422
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,600
Hello.

423
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,520
Long time no see. Where have you been? I miss you.

424
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,520
I was busy.

425
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,240
Really?

426
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,640
But I miss you too.

427
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
You make me blush!

428
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,120
Sweet talker!

429
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,840
I want to talk to you about tomorrow’s scene.

430
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,920
Let me grab my bag.

431
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,000
No rush.

432
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,680
Any drinks?

433
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,640
Tea, coffee, or me?

434
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,400
Which one you like?

435
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,880
I’m alright.

436
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
Only seeing you is fulfilling me.

437
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,280
Are you doing well?

438
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,240
Yes.

439
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,680
Please come here more often.

440
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
Okay.

441
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,840
You came too fast!

442
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,120
I’m going home.

443
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,600
Goodbye.

444
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,960
Bye Bye.

445
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,280
See you soon. Please come again.

446
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,600
Where is your car?

447
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,680
Over there.

448
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,080
Let’s go.

449
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,400
We haven’t done yet!

450
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,760
I’ll tell you later.

451
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,840
Aw, Kung.

452
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,000
Hi.

453
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,240
Hi, Thoo.

454
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,400
Is Krom here?

455
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,760
He just left with Fueang.

456
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,000
They need to talk about work.

457
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,880
Work?

458
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,960
Um.

459
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,120
Work again!

460
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,720
Why’re you frustrated? Did you jealous of him?

461
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,960
What jealous? I’m mad!

462
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,960
He asked me out for dinner.

463
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,760
Look at what he did! He left me for Fueang!

464
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,680
Alright…

465
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,080
I’m leaving.

466
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Goodnight.

467
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,680
Goodnight. Such a hot-headed

468
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,880
Why was he so furious?

469
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,040
There’s something strange.

470
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,320
I’m dating with someone you knew

471
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,440
for a long time.

472
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,440
Thoo and Krom! Are they dating?

473
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,880
Why didn’t I know about it?

474
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,880
Why?

475
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,440
He’s cute though.

476
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,680
What’s going on?

477
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,760
I shot a kiss scene with Cheesecake today

478
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,360
and they wanted a real kiss.

479
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,720
Those presses will put it in their contents.

480
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,320
And…

481
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,560
I’m afraid that

482
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,680
you might be upset

483
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,720
once you see the news.

484
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,680
So, I decided to play that scene

485
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,320
with you personally.

486
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,560
Here is how I kissed in that scene.

487
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,320
But this is how I kiss who I love.

488
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,320
You got it?

489
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,480
Not exactly

490
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,360
I think

491
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,760
I need more round.

492
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,560
How is it?

493
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,639
Do you know the difference now?

494
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,679
Yes.

495
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,000
clearly.

496
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,920
Who is that?

497
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,440
Jong.

498
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,960
He asks me out.

499
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
He complains that

500
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,720
I haven’t had time for him

501
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,000
since I was back.

502
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,520
You have to go back to America

503
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,880
in two weeks, haven’t you?

504
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,720
Yes.

505
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,440
Please don’t break up with me

506
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,560
when you leave.

507
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,920
You're the one who’ll break up with me.

508
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,640
Soon enough, you'll go to work abroad.

509
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,040
Meet a lot of people.

510
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,320
I met many kinds of people

511
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,040
and never clicked with anyone.

512
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,280
What made you click with me?

513
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,080
I can’t explain that.

514
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,080
I just click

515
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,760
and love you.

516
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,960
Do you think

517
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,080
the feelings between us

518
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,080
is love?

519
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,760
Why do you ask me that?

520
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,360
Well.

521
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Everything seemed so fast to me.

522
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,280
Sometimes I confuse

523
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,280
whether it’s love or I’m just lost.

524
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,160
Don’t think too much.

525
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,720
I had love before.

526
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,240
I knew that my feelings for you

527
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,040
is love.

528
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,720
You loved someone before?

529
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,560
Why?

530
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,600
Are you jealous?

531
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,760
No need to ask.

532
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,440
Oh, darling. It was since my high school days.

533
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,760
Please remember that

534
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,600
from now on

535
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,120
you’re my future.

536
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,240
Got it?

537
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,920
I don’t believe you.

538
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,080
You must prove it to me.

539
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,920
Sure.

540
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,640
Cheers!

541
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,720
Hey! Hey! Hey! Easy, dude!

542
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,880
You’ll high!

543
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,640
I can’t get drunk with this!

544
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,440
You silly!

545
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,120
Do you wanna know their slogan?

546
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,400
Sweet, smooth, easy drink, and easy drop!

547
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,480
Whoever I took here,

548
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,440
never walked home himself.

549
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,520
Cheers!

550
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,440
Come on.

551
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,520
Well, how about you and Fueang?

552
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,320
It’s okay, but we didn’t get to meet often.

553
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,280
He’s so popular

554
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,160
and will be even more soon.

555
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,080
Do you think it’ll work out for you?

556
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,240
Why do you ask me that?

557
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,080
The nature of his work and your schedule.

558
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,800
Especially, when you return to America.

559
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,080
They seem to be the problems.

560
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,640
I don’t know. Whatever.

561
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,560
Let just think of today.

562
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,960
Come on. Cheers!

563
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,480
Aw, cheers!

564
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,080
Bottom up!

565
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,800
I like to keep my life private.

566
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,600
I don’t like to socialize.

567
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,280
They call people like me an introvert.

568
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,520
But I’ll be a different person whenever I was drunk.

569
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,960
I’ll be so wasted.

570
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,960
Hey.

571
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,200
How was it?

572
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,000
Great! Like its slogan.

573
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,560
Sweet, swoon?

574
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,280
Swoosh?

575
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,120
Smooth…

576
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,640
Yes.

577
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,640
Smooth! Easy…

578
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,400
I have to carry you home for sure.

579
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,640
More! More! More!

580
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,320
Empty the glass!

581
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,240
Here you go.

582
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,120
Can I take photo with you?

583
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,520
Thank you.

584
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,280
Go. Sit down.

585
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,200
Hi, Jong.

586
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,960
Hey, Art! What’s up?

587
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,040
You came too.

588
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,600
Is he your friend?

589
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,520
Oh, this is Krom. He is my friend.

590
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,520
Hey, Krom. This is my boss.

591
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
Your boss?

592
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,880
Hello, sir!

593
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,000
Jong’s boss.

594
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,640
Nice to meet you.

595
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,720
Please take good care of my friend.

596
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,680
Just worry about yourself.

597
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,760
What do you do?

598
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,760
Oh, I’m a photographer.

599
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,640
We work together.

600
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,800
Did you forget me?

601
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,760
I asked your friend.

602
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,680
He works in America.

603
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,760
It’s his vacation time. He’ll get back in two weeks.

604
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,440
Let’s cheers.

605
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,240
Come on!

606
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,640
Cheers!

607
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,160
I’m so cold, Fei Lin.

608
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,480
Let me keep you warm, Lin Yang.

609
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,120
Okay. Cut!

610
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,080
Pass!

611
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,640
Good job.

612
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,160
Okay.

613
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
Mim got.. got…

614
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Calm down. What is it?

615
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,800
Mim got cramps.

616
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,360
and she already left.

617
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,280
She got cramps and already left!

618
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,080
She couldn’t make it.

619
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,440
Go! Talk to the producer.

620
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,200
What should we do?

621
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,840
It’ll be hard if she’s gone.

622
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,720
Next shooting is the emotional scene

623
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,240
It’s the long scripts.

624
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,880
I can’t do it alone.

625
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,720
It won’t work.

626
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,000
What do you think?

627
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,320
We have been working for four days.

628
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,320
The team might be exhausted now.

629
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,280
They look very tired.

630
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,920
Please. I beg.

631
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,080
Alright.

632
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,880
Everybody! Let’s give it a day!

633
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,280
Krom is cute.

634
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,080
Can you introduce me to him?

635
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,320
Krom.

636
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,440
He has taken now.

637
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,400
I want one night.

638
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,840
Come on. Get here!

639
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,320
Why do you leave me alone?

640
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,280
Tell him. I already have a boyfriend.

641
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,160
He’s FueangNakhon.

642
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,920
Do you want me to tell him that?

643
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,160
Hmm?

644
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,360
No.

645
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,480
You can’t. Madam Aoi will kill me.

646
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,600
Tell him that

647
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,520
my boyfriend is so handsome

648
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,000
and cute. His name is FNK.

649
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,760
Whoa! Just shut up!

650
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,280
Stay here. I’ll block him for you.

651
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,240
Okay.

652
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,160
Excuse me! One more, please!

653
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,280
You want more?

654
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,160
That’s enough!

655
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,880
I’m not drunk yet.

656
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,520
You are.

657
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,080
I’ll keep it in your car.

658
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,720
Hey! Hey! Fueang!

659
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,560
Look. Did you see this?

660
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,760
What?

661
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,800
Is this Art?

662
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,520
The guy that we met before.

663
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,280
Yes. He’s the real Casanova!

664
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,760
I tell you what.

665
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Whoever got photo with him

666
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,080
never slip away!

667
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,720
He likes to get his targets drunk

668
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,240
before taking them to the motel.

669
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,440
Very dangerous guy!

670
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,880
Call him now!

671
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,040
Hurry!

672
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,680
Fueang calls me.

673
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,560
Accept it!

674
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,680
Hello.

675
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,880
Yes, Fueang?

676
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,680
Where are you now?

677
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,280
Oh, I’m at Gari Gari! Whoa!

678
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,400
Are you drunk?

679
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,680
How many glasses you drank?

680
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,040
Only three.

681
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
You drank their top three.

682
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,440
Jong!

683
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,920
Don’t worry. I’m strong.

684
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,200
Chillax!

685
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,000
When will you go home?

686
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,800
Go home? I don’t know

687
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,320
But not that late.

688
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,960
Listen. Stop drinking and go home.

689
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,440
Okay.

690
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,000
I do that.

691
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,840
Krom. Art keeps stare at you.

692
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,680
He likes you for sure.

693
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,040
See! I knew it!

694
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,360
This guy is evil!

695
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,480
Well. I have a connection.

696
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,560
I’ll get someone to beat him

697
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,760
Beat him up for me too!

698
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,440
You’re wasted!

699
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,120
I’m not yet drunk.

700
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,640
Come on. Let’s go!

701
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,040
Ride me home, Jong.

702
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,640
Hey! Hey!

703
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,440
I didn’t bring car today.

704
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Let me call a cab for you.

705
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,720
A cab?

706
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,760
Hold on.

707
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,800
Sure. I can take care myself.

708
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,880
I can give him a ride.

709
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,680
I…

710
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,920
Did you get a car?

711
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,640
Come on, Krom.

712
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,560
Let’s go.

713
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,080
Are you alright? You’re so drunk.

714
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,120
Don’t worry. I’ll take him home.

715
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,520
Krom.

716
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,840
Fueang!

717
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,120
Low your voice.

718
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,480
It’s really you.

719
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,960
How could you get here? Did Madam Aoi know?

720
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,400
Let’s talk later.

721
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,960
You look good today.

722
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,320
The bed sheet is going to get messed up again.

723
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,040
Hey. Silence.

724
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,640
Come on.

725
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,080
Get on my back.

726
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,360
Okay.

727
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,600
Get home safe. See you.

728
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,360
I better go. Goodbye.

729
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,320
Sorry. I got some engagements.

730
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,520
It’s alright. They’re just starting.

731
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,600
I saw you talked to FueangNakhon.

732
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,880
Oh. I just greeted him.

733
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,040
Well. Didn’t they say

734
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,800
he's a good guy

735
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,320
who doesn’t like clubbing?

736
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,920
He wasn’t here for a drink.

737
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,600
He came to pick up his partner.

738
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,080
Partner…

739
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,080
Let’s go.

740
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,800
Okay.

741
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,160
Almost there.

742
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
Sit here.

743
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,400
Hands up.

744
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,480
Hands up!

745
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,360
Lay down.

746
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,000
Come on, Krom.

747
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,640
Shift up—a little more.

748
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,320
Fueang.

749
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,120
Sleep here with me.

750
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,080
I like to hug you the most.

751
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,280
I’ll miss you so much when I leave.

752
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,080
Fueang.

753
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,160
Krom.

754
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,520
Don’t worry, Krom.

755
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,840
I’ll make you feel like

756
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,560
we’re never apart.

757
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,160
Okay.

758
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,720
I love you, Navy.

759
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,720
Who is that?

760
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,640
Out of battery.

761
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,320
What were you doing?

762
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,320
Why didn’t you accept my calls or answer the chat?

763
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,560
I was showering.

764
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,800
Is there something wrong?

765
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,800
Fueang needs your support.

766
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,040
He needs my support… What happened?

767
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,680
Aw. Where are you going?

768
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,480
You should know better that it was a risk!

769
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,400
It’d cause you problems.

770
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,640
What made you do that?

771
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,880
Why?!

772
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,480
But he was so drunk!

773
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,760
You could send someone else there.

774
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,640
Anyone but you!

775
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,080
You have many people

776
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,360
who could help you whenever you want.

777
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,040
Did I cause him trouble?

778
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,080
Aw. You didn’t know anything?

779
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,280
About what?

780
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,640
A good villain actor has gone bad.

781
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,800
He ran off the set for his man

782
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,280
who fakes to be his manager.

783
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,600
What!

784
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,680
He just came to pick me up.

785
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,560
Does it have to be that issue?

786
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,160
The famous fansite

787
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,560
is attacking you with many hates

788
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,440
They're trying to dig up

789
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,680
about you too

790
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,680
Aw. Are you coming for Krom?

791
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,080
Don't worry about me. I'm okay.

792
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,760
You must be strong.

793
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,120
Cheer up.

794
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,240
Everything will be fine.
