Who? Taeyoon?

35
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,335
Yes.

36
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,381
-The Taeyoon I know wants to work with me?
-Yes.

37
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,384
-Why?
-What do you mean, "why?"

38
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:00,847
You've now joined the ranks of lyricists
who produce guaranteed hits.

39
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,349
You should be more proud of yourself.

40
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:08,730
Jay Jun apparently spoke very highly
of you to Taeyoon.

41
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,981
They're close friends.

42
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,566
Uh...

43
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:17,488
I'm a really big fan of Taeyoon.

44
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,743
It was my life's dream to work
with Taeyoon.

45
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,787
But please keep that a secret
from Jay Jun.

46
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,705


47
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,708
Isn't it too soon to have
your life's dream fulfilled?

48
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,626


49
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,586
Let's get everyone together soon.

50
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,339
We need to get another song of ours
on top of the charts.

51
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,467
Yes, of course! Yes!

52
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,801
Wow.

53
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,637
 This is amazing.

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,556


55
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,474


56
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,683
I'm so sorry.

57
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,643


58
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,146
Taeyoon?

59
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,483
I mean, he's beyond human.

60
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,611
He's a god of music. A music god!

61
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:00,406
And that Taeyoon said
he absolutely has to work with me

62
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,034
even though he already has
his in-house lyricists!

63
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,120
Can I tag along when you go to work?

64
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,414
Let me just see his face from a distance.

65
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,584
Why do you need to go and see a face
that's all over the Internet?

66
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,336
I don't want to see faces
that I want to hit.

67
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,797
I want to see faces
that get hits on the Internet. That's why.

68
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,007
No one's ever on my side.

69
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,427
Man, it would have been nice to have
Sunwoo around on a day like this.

70
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,679


71
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,597
-Yeah…
-Does he keep in touch often?

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,434
Maybe once or twice a week? Not so much.

73
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,103
Gosh.

74
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,897
I miss our Mr. Han.

75
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,483
-GYEOLHAN: I wonder if he's doing well.
-I'm sure he is.

76
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,778
He's the type to enjoy himself
even in the middle of a desert.

77
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,571


78
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,656
That's true.

79
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,741
CUSTOMER: Excuse me.

80
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,535
Yes, coming!

81
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,789
Where are you going?

82
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,377
Come on, you're closer.

83
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,628
Hey.

84
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,006
Now you are.

85
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,674
She's on a total power trip.

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,801
GYEOLHAN: Seriously.

87
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,928
-Jeez.
-Did you have another fight?

88
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,680
MARI: You're not truly married
if you don't.

89
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,850
Even all the scuffles
are a part of married life.

90
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,934


91
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,644


92
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,156
EUNSOO: <i>I'm writing lyrics
for Taeyoon now.</i>

93
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,825

94
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,661

SUNWOO: Ms. Lee Eunsoo!

97
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,736
How does it feel to have officially
debuted as a lyricist?

98
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,987
(<i>We'll Shine Brighter
than Any Star</i> plays on cellphone)

99
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,655
Well…

100
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,866

-It is…

101
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,744

-...a beautiful night.

102
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,830
-Me, a lyricist… Can you believe it?

103
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,249
<i>♪ Had I held you more often in my arms ♪</i>

104
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,462
How do I set this song to repeat all-day?

105
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,798
I want to keep listening to it,
but it doesn't work.

106
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,092
-There should be a way.
-Is it this?

107
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,428
-You like it that much?
-<i>♪ I regret ♪</i>

108
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,389
I need to play it so you can get rich.

109
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,765
<i>♪ The way things ended ♪</i>

110
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,684
-That is an excellent idea.
-I know.

111
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:40,775

-I now have another goal.
-<i>♪ Are you listening? ♪</i>

114
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,115
What is it?

115
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,658
Taeyoon.

116
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,828
-<i>♪ If you're listening ♪</i>
-He's your favorite singer.

117
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,872
-<i>♪ Will you think of me? ♪</i>
-I'll write lyrics for him one day.

118
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,917
Then it would be nice to listen
to it all-day long.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,212
That's not just nice. It would be awesome.

120
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,296
Right?

121
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:03,965
Good.

122
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,092
My next goal is Taeyoon.

123
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,094
EUNSOO: Please help me.

124
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,721
I'll put the song on loop 24 hours a day.
Please do it.

125
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,974
-EUNSOO: All-day long.
-Definitely.

126
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,103


127
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,689
That sounds so nice.

128
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,899
-I know, right?
-SUNWOO: Yeah.

129
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,942


130
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,988

00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,379


133
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,688


134
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,422


135
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,465
FINAL EPISODE

136
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,966
What is all this?

137
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,843
Enjoy them.
I can bring you more every day.

138
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,470
DONGHYEON: Nice!

139
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,848
Mandarins are in season.
They're very sweet. Super delicious.

140
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,892
Mmm, mmm...

141
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,227


142
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,937
Oh, what's the picture you wanted?

143
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,857
My ID photo from last year.
I have to submit one to some association,

144
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,068
but I don't want to take the picture
anywhere else.

145
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,112
You can't go anywhere else
once you've seen what Sunwoo can do.

146
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,822
DONGHYEON: Let's see.

147
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,574


148
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,590


149
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,093


150
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,928
Even you find yourself beautiful,
don't you?

151
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,265


152
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,435
When did he take a picture like this?

153
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,777


154
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,496


155
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,958


156
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,460


157
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,714
Hey, Sunwoo!
You're finally getting a signal?

158
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,759
Yeah. Oh, is that right?
Eunsoo's here with me.

159
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,095
Okay. All right, take care!

160
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,138


161
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,848
-What?
-He got a signal for a brief moment,

162
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,224
so he couldn't talk for long.

163
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,976
-Too bad. Yes.
-Is that so?

164
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,146


165
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,608
Found it. This one, right?

166
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,901
-Yes.
-DONGHYEON: Okay. I'll email it to you.

167
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,902
Okay.

168
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,573


169
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,075
It must be Sunwoo!

170
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,621
I knew he would call me.

171
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,289
PRODUCER KANG WOOIL

172
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,876


173
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,338
Yes, Mr. Kang.

174
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,131


175
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,134

00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,769


177
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,401


178
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,195
Enjoy your dinner.

179
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,905
WOOIL: Yes, thank you.

180
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,909


181
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,745
How's the view?

182
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,831
WOOIL: It was hard reserving a table
by the window.

183
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,085
Yes. The view is lovely.

184
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,048
So, when are the agency people arriving?

185
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,217
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,177
WOOIL: I lied.

187
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,597
-Sorry?
-I postponed the celebration party.

188
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,849
I want to talk about something else today.

189
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,103
WOOIL: It's a bit hard
waiting indefinitely.

190
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,315
I'm sure you know,
and it's nothing new, but…

191
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,652
I want to go out with you, Eunsoo.

192
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,615
I want to hear your voice every day,
buy you all the good food in the world,

193
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,076
and make you smile.

194
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:48,207
When I find one sad line in your lyrics,
I spend all-day wondering if you're okay.

195
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,793


196
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,087
That's how I feel.

197
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,258


198
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,427
How about you, Eunsoo?

199
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,763


200
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,766
EUNSOO: Mr. Kang.

201
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,103
I also lied.

202
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,523
Actually...

203
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,482


204
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,151
...I don't like wine.

205
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,530


206
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,992
I couldn't have come this far without you,
and I'm really thankful.

207
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,494
There was also a time…

208
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,540
when my heart fluttered being around you.

209
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,296
Even when I'm sitting across from you

210
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,009
in this beautiful, fancy place.
Yet for some reason,

211
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,929
I feel no excitement in my heart.

212
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,893


213
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,687
I thought I would hate wine less

214
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,857
if I kept drinking it.

215
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,736
But it just never got better, Mr. Kang.

216
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,950
Even as we're having this conversation,

217
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,620
my mind is somewhere else. And I…

218
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,746


219
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,040


220
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,419
I don't really know why.

221
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,717
So that's what he meant.

222
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,262
WOOIL: Your friend.

223
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,183
When we met last time,

224
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,020
he asked me if you were enjoying the wine.

225
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,982
That bitter expression on his face…

226
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,610
I didn't know what it meant then.

227
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,033
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

228
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,205
Then,

229
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,666
we…

230
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,085
Can't work together anymore?

231
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,671


232
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,592


233
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,928
Who in the world would do that?

234
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,392
Lose a talented lyricist like you
just so I won't have to feel awkward?

235
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,102
WOOIL: Then I'd be a fool.

236
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,521
Don't worry about it.

237
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,692
Thank you for being honest with me.

238
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,487
It does sting a little,
but I do feel relieved.

239
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,325
Let's forget the wine
and have some beer instead.

240
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,286
They have a good selection
of draft beer here.

241
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,745


242
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,039


243
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,583
Well…

244
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,334
You do like beer, right?

245
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,172
Yes, I do.

246
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,300


247
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,637


248
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,722
Gosh.

249
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,142


250
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,235


251
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,740


252
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,289
Sunwoo?

253
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,835
You should have called me first!

254
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,045
My goodness!

255
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,338
You scared me.

256
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,925
Can't you please call
before you come, Mom?

257
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,177
Why are you looking for Sunwoo?
He's not even in Korea.

258
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,261
Are you seeing things?

259
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,513
Where did you even find this?

260
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,223
I found it upstairs while I was cleaning.

261
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,142
It seemed to be Sunwoo's,
so I brought it down.

262
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,227
EUNSOO'S MOM: You should keep things tidy.

263
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,147
You turned the dumplings
in the freezer into fossils.

264
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,608
They're frozen, so they should be fine.

265
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,778
Is Sunwoo in good health?

266
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,321
Well…

267
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,573
I'm sure he is.

268
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,994
-Oh, right. Mom.
-EUNSOO'S MOM: Hm?

269
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,497
-Did you bring them?
-Bring what?

270
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,791
You know what I'm talking about.
Ones that look like this.

271
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,293
This?

272
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,295
-Do you smoke?
-EUNSOO'S MOM: No…

273
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,006


274
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,841
Go ahead.

275
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,011
Choose three cards, from your heart.

276
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,680
It will be your future.

277
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,431
-Left hand, right?
-Yeah.

278
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,727
EUNSOO: This one.

279
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,898


280
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,525
And this one.

281
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,029
And this.

282
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,078


283
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,415
New opportunities.

284
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,045
Determined heart.

285
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,255
Oh, my.

286
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,756
EUNSOO: Mom…

287
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,758
This is unbelievable.

288
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,761
I was just offered to write
for a new song.

289
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,846
Really?

290
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,848
It's for a big star.

291
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,016
Guess who.

292
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,769
Lim Youngwoong.

293
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,312
Keep going.

294
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,439


295
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,110


296
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,279
EUNSOO: This card.

297
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,573
This is the one that
Sunwoo picked out before.

298
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,742
So you were the one who gave it to him?

299
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,536
What did it mean again?

300
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,166
Someone very far away or something?

301
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,668
-It was a lie.
-What?

302
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,505
That card.
It doesn't mean someone far away.

303
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,591
It means someone close.

304
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,593
A very close connection.

305
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,011


306
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,346
What? Then why did you say the opposite?

307
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,347


308
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:42,102
Because. When I saw his face then,
I just felt like I needed to.

309
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,980
EUNSOO'S MOM: He looked like someone
who had a secret found out,

310
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,899
so I wanted to cover for him. That's why.

311
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,984


312
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,739
New opportunities

313
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,075
can always come by again,

314
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,203
but a determined heart is uniquely bound
to a single moment.

315
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,624
When the right moment comes,
seize it, whatever it is.

316
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,667
If it feels true to your heart, that is.

317
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,422


318
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,802
Why? Do you want one too?

319
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,680
Yeah.

320
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,390
Pick one.

321
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,728
I want…

322
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,106


323
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,568
This one.

324
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,196


325
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,910
I told you to seize it.

326
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,500


327
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,470
CARESSING ME WITH ALL YOUR BURDENS HIDDEN

328
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,098
YOUR HAND IS FILLED WITH
YOUR PRECIOUS HEART

329
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,311


330
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,367
EUNSOO: <i>Are you kidding me?
Why aren't you reading your messages?</i>

331
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,911
<i>You're dead when you come back.</i>

332
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,539


333
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,924


334
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,055
I MISS YOU…

335
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,475


336
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,779


337
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,589


338
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,426


339
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,639


340
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,518


341
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,981


342
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:33,982


343
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,903


344
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,322


345
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:51,541
IN EVERY MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE,
I WISH I COULD BE BY YOUR SIDE

346
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,836


347
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,347
EUNSOO'S MOM: <i>Seize it, whatever it is.

00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,409


363
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,254


364
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,800


365
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,977
Hi.

366
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,064
Here.

367
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,858
SUNWOO: I bought all the chocolate
I could find.

368
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,652
And…

369
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,700
What is this?

370
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,998
-SUNWOO: So you can write your lyrics.

371
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,337


372
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,301
Couldn't you have texted back
at least once?

373
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,347
I was worried about you.

374
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,266
I tried, but it just wouldn't send.

375
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,477
I thought about calling you
as soon as I landed.

376
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,648
But I decided not to,
so I could see that face right now.

377
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,149
Tss...

378
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,653
I guess Donghyeon's acting was good,
seeing that he managed to fool you.

379
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,905
Yeah, he really got me.

380
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,906
SUNWOO: Gosh.

381
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,449


382
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,910


383
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,704


384
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,292
So what happened?

385
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,336
I thought you'd spend another year.

386
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,548
Benzema had some personal issues,
so the schedule changed a bit.

387
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,843
We're meeting back up again
in Prague, in ten days.

388
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,971
SUNWOO: So I came back briefly
to work on the photos I took.

389
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,306
I see.

390
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,350
For ten days.

391
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,022
Oh, right. Taeyoon!

392
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,110
I heard you're writing for Taeyoon.
That's really crazy, Eunsoo!

393
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,654
I shouted in the streets
when I heard the news.

394
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,032
You promised
that you would listen every day.

395
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:11,950
Yes.

396
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,869
-Keep it on even when you're asleep.
-Of course.

397
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,538
Contribute to the royalties.

398
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,664
I vow to do so.

399
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,332


400
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,461
I'm so proud of you.

401
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,088
I knew you could do it, friend.

402
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,757


403
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,012


404
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,847
Get dressed. We have to get going.

405
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,932
What? Go where?

406
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,020
Hurry up.

407
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:46,526
The restaurant is glowing
now that you're back.

408
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,903


409
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,071
But why did you come back so suddenly?

410
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,366
Well, that's because…

411
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,161
I came back to give you this. Ta-da!

412
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,621
What is this?

413
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,665
-What?
-Happy birthday!

414
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,668
-Thank you.
-EUNSOO: We got it together.

415
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,586


416
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,172
MARI: I was giving up on receiving
any gifts this year.

417
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,673
Thanks, guys.

418
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,009
Is Gyeolhan going to be late?

419
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,220
He went to see his parents today.

420
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,596
MARI: He's coming back tomorrow.

421
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,097
Though he really doesn't need to.

422
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,893


423
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,520
-Hello?
-MARI: My gosh.

424
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,107
-SUNWOO: Oh, yes.
-So pretty.

425
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,029
Eunsoo, you should never get married.

426
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,448
I'm a textbook example
of why you shouldn't.

427
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,951
Don't be like that on your birthday.

428
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,203


429
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,871
What?

430
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,415
-What's going on?

431
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,046
-GYEOLHAN: <i>♪ Your every word ♪</i>

432
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,552
<i>♪ Your every smile means a lot to me ♪</i>

433
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,970
MARI: Hey!

434
00:25:55,887 --> 00:26:00,392
<i>♪ I, Gyeolhan, am forever your egg ♪</i>

435
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:05,981
<i>♪ And, Choi Mari,
you are forever my roll ♪</i>

436
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,404
<i>♪ Today's your birthday ♪</i>

437
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,784
<i>♪ I've prepared
this little surprise for you ♪</i>

438
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,579
<i>♪ Please take this ♪</i>

439
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:23,999


440
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,585
Ta-da!

441
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,378
Happy Birthday.

442
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,213
-Wow, what a surprise.

443
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:34,259


444
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,845
So how many installments
do we have on this?

445
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,096
I used my mom's card.
We can talk about that later.

446
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,806
-Tell me.
-Hurry up and blow.

447
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,057
-The candles are going out.
-MARI: Okay.

448
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,684
-One, two, three.
-SUNWOO: ...two, three.

449
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,311


450
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,563
-Happy Birthday, Mari!
-SUNWOO: Happy Birthday!

451
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,815
Thank you!

452
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,985
Come on! When did you plan all this?

453
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,613
I'm sorry it had to be
in the restaurant again.

454
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,323
Next year, let's go to Jeju Island.

455
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,782
All right. Since I'm in the mood,

456
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,118
I'll get you a new fishing rod!

457
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,494
-Wow.
-Gyeolhan.

458
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,123
-<i>♪ Everything you do ♪</i>
-MARI: Jeez.

459
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,751
Okay, I'll get you new sneakers too!

460
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:12,047
-GYEOLHAN: <i>♪ Everything you do ♪</i>
-Hey, stop it. Stop.

461
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,466
-GYEOLHAN: I can do this forever.
-MARI: Stop it.

462
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,384


463
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,553
SUNWOO: Gosh. This is nice

464
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,847
walking with you after such a long time.

465
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,057


466
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,602
EUNSOO: I got so much better at driving
while you were gone.

467
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,021
I can drive to get groceries
by myself now.

468
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,856
SUNWOO: Wow. Congratulations.

469
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,276
EUNSOO: And my mom came over to organize
my fridge a few days ago.

470
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,903
You know the dumplings we got?

471
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,197
They were almost expired.

472
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,240
Remember? The ones we bought together.

473
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,534
My mom almost slapped my back for it.

474
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:42,911


475
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,664
SUNWOO: You have a good memory.
You still remember that?

476
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,709
EUNSOO: Because I never bought
any dumplings after that.

477
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,879
-That's why I remember.
-SUNWOO: You should've just eaten them.

478
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,923
EUNSOO: But they'd be gone if I ate them.

479
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,633
I just couldn't eat them.

480
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,388
SUNWOO: Don't let the mandarins go bad.
Make some preserves.

481
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,682
EUNSOO: I never felt like doing it.

482
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,600
I'll give it a try.

483
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,728
Oh, Eunsoo.

484
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,022
You said you had something to tell me.

485
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,023
What was it?

486
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,983
Ah...

487
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,987
Well…

488
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,907
What is it? Did something happen?

489
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,538


490
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,879
Public safety isn't the best abroad.

491
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,632
So just be safe.

492
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,175


493
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,136


494
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,680


495
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,099


496
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,477
Hey, you should put something
around your neck.

497
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,396
I'm fine.

498
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,355
Stay still.

499
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,816
You've already forgotten
how cold winter is in Korea.

500
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,652
Take it.

501
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,739
You'll freeze to death
trying to be fashionable.

502
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,532
That's my line.

503
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,411


504
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,705


505
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,959
Thanks. It's warm.

506
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,212
EUNSOO: Yeah.

507
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,758
I'm going in now.

508
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,594
-Okay, bye.
-Okay.

509
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,729


510
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,816


511
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,119
What brings you here?

512
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,288
Ta-da!

513
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,333
There's a new dessert shop down the street
and they're apparently super popular.

514
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,543
I thought I might bring you some…

515
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,254
But you already have some.

516
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,548
Sunwoo's friend from college
brought some earlier. It's fine.

517
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,008
DONGHYEON: The more the better!

518
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,260
Of course. Take a seat. Have some with us.

519
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,304


520
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,141
I'm glad you brought more.
He ate them all by himself.

521
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,893
Eunsoo brought the exact same stuff.

522
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,562
-She brought a lot.
-DONGHYEON: I'm not complaining.

523
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,606


524
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,528
Sunwoo!
One of the rolls is totally ruined!

525
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,571
I think I made a mistake.
You need to come and see.

526
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,781


527
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,325
-DONGHYEON: No way.
-I'll be back soon.

528
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,409
Where…

529
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,495
Gosh, she's a handful.

530
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,667
What's going on? Who's that?

531
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,086
Oh. Sunwoo's junior from art school.

532
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,089
She's here to help with the shots
Sunwoo took with Benzema,

533
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,465
but she's really something else.

534
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,467
She and Sunwoo seem to be cut
from the same cloth.

535
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,845
I see.

536
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,556


537
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,770
You know the ones we checked together?

538
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,105
Yeah.

539
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,566
SUNWOO: I think we can choose
from one of those.

540
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,276
I put those somewhere here…

541
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,154
-Hey, Eunsoo, come here.
-Huh?

542
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,533
Let me introduce you.

543
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,244
-Okay.
-This is Lee Eunsoo.

544
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,580
-You know Jay Jun and Taeyoon, right?
-Of course.

545
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,124
She's a famous lyricist
who writes lyrics for them.

546
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,877
SEOYEON: Really? That's amazing.

547
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,920
And you're so pretty.

548
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:21,963
-Me?
-SEOYEON: Yes.

549
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,299
Oh, I'm not.

550
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:28,011
She's not your girlfriend, is she?
She's way too pretty to be with you.

551
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,597
-No, she's my best friend.
-I see. Best friends.

552
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,016
Yes, we're best friends.

553
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,183


554
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,271
-And this is...
-My name is Kim Seoyeon.

555
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,481


556
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,775
Oh...

557
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,069
Of course!

558
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,740
I'm helping Sunwoo.
And following him around.

559
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,033
Mm...

560
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,826
Yeah, she's exhausting.

561
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,871
-Hey, stop.
-Come on, what would she think of me?

562
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,749
-I just said the truth.
-You can just say I'm here to help...

563
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:01,085
Nice to meet you! I mean it, really.

564
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,921


565
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,341
Hey, I'm going to merge the second file
and put it aside then, okay?

566
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,801
-Okay, thanks.
-Please sit.

567
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,012
Okay, please don't mind me.

568
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,348
-You're not going to eat those?
-You can have them.

569
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,599
I'll be back soon.

570
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,145
Okay.

571
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,190


572
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,734


573
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,987


574
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,906
Eunsoo, can you pass me those cookies?

575
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,492
-Can you help me with this?
-SUNWOO: Well, first…

576
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,826
How did you do that?

577
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,119


578
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,666


579
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,876
What about about here?

580
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,587
-SUNWOO: No, not there.
-SEOYEON: Okay.

581
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,839
SEOYEON: Not this either.

582
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,930
HAN SUNWOO
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

583
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,102


584
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:03,022
DON'T DO ANYTHING, EUNSOO. PLEASE!
NO, DO SOMETHING!

585
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,067
EUNSOO: <i>In for some French food
and rice wine for dinner?</i>

586
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,819


587
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,073


588
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,119


589
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,710
SUNWOO: <i>We'll be drinking
at the studio tonight. Want to join us?</i>

590
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,379


591
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,177
Darn.

592
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,887


593
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,019


594
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,898
Hair up?

595
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,818
SEOYEON: I put these together here…

596
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,364
-SEOYEON: Not this one. Too much noise.
-SUNWOO: This much should be fine.

597
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,700


598
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,493
SUNWOO: There's too much noise...

599
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,495
Hey, you're here.

600
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,457
Can you wait for a little?
We just need to finish this.

601
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,667
SUNWOO: We'll join you soon.
Make yourself comfortable.

602
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,003
No problem. Take your time.

603
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,923
SEOYEON: How about this one?
It's good, right?

604
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,176
-SUNWOO: No, the next one.
-SEOYEON: This one's okay too.

605
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,260


606
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,012
-No?

607
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,263
-This one?
-SUNWOO: Next.

608
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,182
-This one?
-SUNWOO: No.

609
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,224


610
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,977
-You don't like any of these. This?
-SUNWOO: We can't use these. Next.

611
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,145


612
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,521
This is the one.

613
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,608
SEOYEON: When I took it,
it had really nice lighting.

614
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,984
-It came out nicely.
-Gosh.

615
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,320
-I see.
-We can try this again later.

616
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,405
SEOYEON: And then…

617
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,783
-This one?
-Nope, next.

618
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,701
-SUNWOO: What was this one?
-What was what?

619
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,163


620
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,873
-SEOYEON: This one looks pretty.
-Okay.

621
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:44,916
SEOYEON: And this one?

622
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,085
-SEOYEON: This one…
-EUNSOO: Why can't I see anything?

623
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,755
Eunsoo, I'm so sorry to ask,
but that camera is quite expensive.

624
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,548
It's really fragile.

625
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,926
-SEOYEON: Can you put that down, please?
-SUNWOO: It's okay.

626
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,094
No, it's expensive.

627
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,303


628
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,014
-Thank you.
-Hey, write this down.

629
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,642
-Okay, next.
-This one.

630
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,395
SEOYEON: Eunsoo.

631
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,190
I'm so sorry, but that's our work.

632
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:10,983
Yes.

633
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,360
Thank you.

634
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,238
Don't worry. Focus on this.

635
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,739


636
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,659
-This one looks good.
-Yes, this is it.

637
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,746
-Okay, then. Let's take this one.
-You are really good. I give you that.

638
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,457
Right? Sunwoo is talented.

639
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,709
SEOYEON: Yes, his photos
are surely different.

640
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,919
-Right?
-SEOYEON: Yes.

641
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,879
-I see.

642
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,172
This one was here?

643
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,217
-I told you to delete it.
-Why? This one looks good.

644
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,094
SEOYEON: I like this one.

645
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,889
Let's eat!

646
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,391
SEOYEON: Hey, Donghyeon.

647
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,101
Okay, then.

648
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,687
-SUNWOO: Let's send these over email.
-SEOYEON: Okay. Sounds good.

649
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,231
Earlier…

650
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,859
SEOYEON: Attention.

651
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,444
Onion soup with rice wine?

652
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,196
DONGHYEON: That's a new combination.

653
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,700
Am I falling behind with the trends
or is this a mistake in the order?

654
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,411
They pair better than you think.

655
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,829
SUNWOO: This is soul food
to me and Eunsoo.

656
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,746
That's right.

657
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,831
Trust me.

658
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,124
-Doesn't sound good.
-Exactly.

659
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,750
DONGHYEON: Gosh, these two.

660
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,835


661
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,044
I can do it.

662
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,215


663
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,300
Want some?

664
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,261
Mm-mm... I've tried once,
but it wasn't for me.

665
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,513
-SEOYEON: I'll have a beer.
-Did it give you a headache?

666
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,850
Yeah, it gave me a horrible hangover
the next morning.

667
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,186
That's because
you drink like there's no tomorrow.

668
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,147
True, I do have the tendency to do that.

669
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,482
-SUNWOO: It's good when you try a little.

670
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,984


671
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,611
-Just this, okay?
-Okay.

672
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,613
-SEOYEON: I'll try.
-Try.

673
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,574
ALL: Cheers!

674
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,701
SEOYEON: Cheers!

675
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,870


676
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,456
Mmm...

677
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,500
-SUNWOO: This is it.

678
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,420
SUNWOO: Donghyeon, did you check
what I asked for?

679
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,796
DONGHYEON: It looked really good.

680
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,006
-SUNWOO: Really?
-DONGHYEON: Yes.

681
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,175
DONGHYEON: I'm already making contacts
with a few galleries.

682
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,760
It's definitely on trend.

683
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,680
SEOYEON: But I think
it needs some correction.

684
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,058
SEOYEON: We can make
some corrections and then…

685
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,184
SUNWOO: Yes, I agree.

686
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:13,606
STUDIO RED

687
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,652


688
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,618


689
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,080


690
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,165
SUNWOO: Is your taxi almost here?

691
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,459
SEOYEON: Yes, it will be here
in five minutes.

692
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,377
SUNWOO: Okay.

693
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,171


694
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,927
I had fun today.

695
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,095
Get home safely.

696
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,054
I will.

697
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,555
But Sunwoo.

698
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,724
Is your answer no today as well?

699
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,352
SUNWOO: How long are you going
to keep this up?

700
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,479
Until you say yes, I told you.

701
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,147


702
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,858
-I'll be good to you.

703
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,903
-SUNWOO: What?
-SEOYEON: Go out with me.

704
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,781
SEOYEON: I'll be so good to you
that you'll forget all about your exes.

705
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,075
SUNWOO: Don't be silly.

706
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,453
-We just went to school together.
-Oh, come on.

707
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,080
You're so old school.

708
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,125
Can't you just be cool about things?

709
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,626
SEOYEON: Jeez.

710
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,545
This is what makes me tired of you.

711
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,588
But I like you for this too.

712
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,966
This is what makes me like you.

713
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,635
-Your taxi is here. Get home.

714
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,472
Okay, but you have to say yes tomorrow.

715
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,725
-SEOYEON: Okay?
-SUNWOO: Go home.

716
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,184
-SEOYEON: I'll go.
-Yes.

717
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,227
SEOYEON: Bye!

718
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,564
-SEOYEON: Say yes tomorrow.
-Bye.

719
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,526


720
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,112
SUNWOO: You can come out now.

721
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,365


722
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,577
You saw me?

723
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,996
SUNWOO: Why are you squatting there?

724
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,497


725
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,750
Nothing…

726
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,876
...just instinctively.

727
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,294


728
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,920
Go and get your things.

729
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,547
SUNWOO: I'll call a cab. Let's go.

730
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,466
Oh, hey. Wait.

731
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,302
Let's walk a little.

732
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,347
I'm too full to even fall asleep.

733
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,642


734
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,609
EUNSOO: I think we should keep French food
and rice wine between us.

735
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,864
The world isn't ready
for our ultimate soul food pairing.

736
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,700
Yeah. They just don't get it.

737
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,871
EUNSOO: By the way, Seoyeon…

738
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,041
She seems to like you a lot.

739
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,586


740
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,629


741
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,214
EUNSOO: It wouldn't be weird
for someone to say,

742
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,342
“Okay, fine! Let's see where it goes!”

743
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,595
But as expected from Han Sunwoo.
These girls just don't stand a chance.

744
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,807
SUNWOO: She's someone I work with.
I have to stay professional.

745
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,231
EUNSOO: Then what if I asked?

746
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:02,900
What?

747
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,819


748
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,613
EUNSOO: Let's date, Sunwoo.

749
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,408
Yes or no?"

750
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,201
What if I asked you that?

751
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,622
Of course,

752
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,167
that's a no. You don't even need to ask.

753
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,671
Why?

754
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,339
You said so yourself.

755
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,092
If we don't want to break up forever,
we have to stay friends forever.

756
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,178


757
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,596


758
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,848
I did, didn't I?

759
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,020
But like Mari and Gyeolhan,

760
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:45,067
friends can become lovers
and live happily ever after, right?

761
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,070
Gyeolhan and Mari are exceptionally lucky.

762
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,823
There are more relationships
that don't work out.

763
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,702
Go in.

764
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,621
You can sleep now, right?

765
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,790


766
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,042
Yeah.

767
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,252
Good night.

768
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,589
-Bye.
-Bye.

769
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,721

00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,557
-I'm holding on to it.
-EUNSOO: It's wobbling so much.

795
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,434
EUNSOO: I'm going!

796
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,978
-I get it now.
-Step on the pedals steadily.

797
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,730
-EUNSOO: Steadily, got it.
-Yes, keep going.

798
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,440
Steadily.

799
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,735
-Don't let go!
-I won't.

800
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,237
-SUNWOO: You have to keep going.
-Steadily you said.

801
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,864
-Don't let go.
-SUNWOO: I won't.

802
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,490
-Seriously, don't let go.
-Okay.

803
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,409
-Okay, good.
-Okay.

804
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,078
-Don't let go.
-I didn't.

805
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,873
-Oh, no! Don't let go.
-You're doing fine.

806
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,416
-You let go, didn't you?
-I didn't.

807
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,543
I won't let go until you tell me to.

808
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,086
-Don't worry. Just go.

809
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,171


810
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,255
-Now!
-Okay, now.

811
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,548
-Oh, gosh!
-No, it's okay.

812
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,384
-I'm going!
-Good!

813
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,345
-Don't let go!
-You're doing great!

814
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,304


815
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,778


816
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,617
EUNSOO: <i>Sunwoo.
What are you up to tonight?</i>

817
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,912
<i>Let's hang out.</i>

818
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,539


819
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,339


820
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,512


821
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,063
MARRIED COUPLE

822
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,440


823
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,569


824
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,448


825
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,908
-Hey.
-SUNWOO: Hi.

826
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,912
Where are Gyeolhan and Mari?

827
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,665
Today is their off-day, dummy.

828
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,250
Oh...

829
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,919
Then how did you get in?

830
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,131
I asked Mari to let me borrow
the restaurant for a night.

831
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,425
Why?

832
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,218
Because I have something to tell you.

833
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,932


834
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,813
These are the lyrics
that I'm working on now.

835
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,777


836
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,160
But I just can't seem to come up
with the last line to finish.

837
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,454
I'VE BECOME MORE LIKE YOU
I WILL PROTECT YOU

838
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,705
EUNSOO: Because of you.

839
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,415


840
00:45:56,044 --> 00:46:00,215
I've thought about it all night.
Again. And again.

841
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,679
And I've finally reached a conclusion.

842
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,269
I can't swallow it.

843
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,399
If I hold it in any longer,

844
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,405
I think I'm going to be sick
unless I say this out loud.

845
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,575


846
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,244
The day you went off to the military.

847
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,375
To tell you the truth,

848
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,544
I cried…

849
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,550
I cried a lot. You didn't know, right?

850
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,888
Back then,

851
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,142
it was because I didn't have
anyone to eat late-night noodles with.

852
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,981
Or because a friend who put a scarf
around me on cold days was gone.

853
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:05,739
Or because a friend to vent to was gone.
I thought that was why I cried.

854
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,746
But on the day you left last year,
I realized.

855
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,253
That it was love.

856
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,340
That this is love.

857
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,389
I thought unrequited love was supposed
to be something cute like a little crush.

858
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,019
But every time I thought of you,

859
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,480
my heart ached so much

860
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,651
that I barely had any energy left
when I came home.

861
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,324
But what made it most painful was…

862
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,580
to think how lonely

863
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,833
it must've been for you to do this
for the past eight years.

864
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,086


865
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,802


866
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,304
EUNSOO: To think…

867
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,141
you must have
taken glimpses of me in secret

868
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,730
and stared into my back for a long time…

869
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,279
That I didn't realize it for so long
is what hurt the most, Sunwoo.

870
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,117
I'm sorry.

871
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,664
For looking you in the eyes far too late.

872
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,337
For not realizing it sooner.

873
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,558
That's what I had to tell you.

874
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,313
That's all.

875
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,784


876
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,255


877
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,015


878
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,610


879
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,238
I wrote in the last line.

880
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,036
I couldn't finish it
because I had to leave a year ago.

881
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,498
Now I finished it.

882
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,418


883
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:15,762
PLEASE STAY BY MY SIDE, I LOVE YOU.

884
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,807


885
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,875


886
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,937


887
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,453


888
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,916
BONUS TRACK

889
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,543


890
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:31,963
MARI: Gosh.

891
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,633
What was it they say
about how fickle the human heart is?

892
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,551
I knew this was going to happen.

893
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,386
GYEOLHAN: If they were going
to be together anyway,

894
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,138
why did they go through all that trouble?

895
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,350
I guess a guy and a girl really
can't be just friends.

896
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,853
GYEOLHAN: There's only one situation
where that's possible.

897
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,232
It's only when both feel
zero attraction to each other.

898
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:55,654
We couldn't stay friends
because we were both so attractive.

899
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:56,988


900
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,365


901
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,826
You have to go out with me
if you drink this.

902
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,661
MARI: What's with your eyes?

903
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,664
Is it one of those nights?

904
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,584
-Please raise your glasses now.
-GYEOLHAN: Okay.

905
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,712
DONGHYEON: You did a great job.

906
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,674
MARI: Yes, we worked hard
to make this happen.

907
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,593
DONGHYEON: By the way,
why are they doing that here?

908
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,928
MARI: I know, right?

909
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,473
They're always like that…

910
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,059
GYEOLHAN: By the way, who are you?

911
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,477


912
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,355
