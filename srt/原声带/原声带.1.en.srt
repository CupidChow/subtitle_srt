534
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:21,530
Tonight, we're going to fold a squid.

535
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,492
(SIGHS) Two people.

536
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,789
WOMAN: First, fold your paper in half.

537
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,334
SUHO: Do you truly find this fun?

538
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,380
WOMAN: You'll know
when you fold the paper yourself.

539
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,715
It calms your soul.

540
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,135
Even paper that was lying in your drawer

541
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,888
becomes a fond memory
if you fold it with all your heart.

542
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,515
HYEONSEO: This is so cute.

543
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,934
It really does heal the soul.

544
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:56,065
It feels good to hang out together
at this hour.

545
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,694
SUHO: It does? I'm glad.

546
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,201
HYEONSEO: The folding paper sounds
like pleasing whispers,

547
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,996
as if wishing me goodnight.

548
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,213
SLEEPLESS NIGHT, FOLDING A SQUID

549
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,474
(IN KOREAN) Indeed.
