3
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,240
Boss.

4
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,920
Lu.

5
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,440
Tell her

6
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
what turndown service means.

7
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,880
Got it, Boss.

8
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:40,600
Turndown service is done

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,520
in the evening,

10
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,440
before the guest goes to bed.

11
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,760
It involves a personalized
touch-up of the room.

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,200
For example, making the bed,

13
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,560
placing the complimentary gifts,

14
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,800
and dimming the lights.

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,240
You should've said that earlier.
I embarrassed myself for nothing.

16
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,840
No worries, go on.

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,280
Make sure you train her properly.

18
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:01,088
I'll be back tomorrow for an inspection.

19
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,440
Yes, Boss.

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
As for you...

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,440
What now?

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,920
After your training tonight,

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,640
you need to memorize all nearby

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,640
bus routes,

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,600
their stops,
and the landmarks they pass.

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,320
Also, the distance from the hotel

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,120
to the train station,
airport, and docks,

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,720
including what transport options
are available.

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
So, I don't get to sleep?

30
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:24,680
This is just personal revenge!

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,320
Think whatever you want.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
Fine! So be it! Bring it on!

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,900
=The Quirky and The Charming=

34
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,380
(Head of Design Department)

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,240
Where is the proposal for

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,600
the multifunctional design hall?

37
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
Don't give me excuses.

38
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,000
And don't even mention the budget.

39
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,040
If you can't handle it,

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,640
then stop wasting everyone's time.

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,920
Any other issues?

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,600
It takes them forever to solve it.

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,600
Ms. Ling, Spring Sea
just sent out a notice.

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,640
They're hosting
a thank-you event in three days.

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,400
Three days?

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,120
That's the same day as ours.

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,120
Yep, it's a bad coincidence.

48
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,880
Having both events on the same day

49
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,360
will definitely cut
into our guest turnout.

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,040
It'll weaken our event's impact too.

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
Send out a notice.

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,720
We're moving our event up by 24 hours.

53
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,720
I want the press release
ready in an hour.

54
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:19,040
All materials must be prepared

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
by 10 AM tomorrow.

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,240
The event must start at 2 PM sharp.

57
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,720
Changing the schedule now?

58
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,640
We might not have time
to set up the venue

59
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:27,066
and coordinate materials.

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,680
Not to mention,
we still need to inform our partners.

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
This event was scheduled a month ago.

62
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,480
It's just one day.

63
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,600
How can you not manage that?

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,480
Besides,

65
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
the venue is Bright Platinum's ballroom.

66
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,111
Who do we coordinate the setup with?

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,440
With me?

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,480
I'll handle the partners.

69
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:44,439
They will thank me

70
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,760
once I lay out the pros and cons.

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,480
Anything else?

72
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,600
Nope.

73
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:51,760
Either get it done
and get a raise, or get fired.

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,080
The timer starts now.

75
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,320
Boss.

76
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,520
Why do you look so drained?

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,240
Rough night?

78
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,080
By the way,

79
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,440
Bright Platinum launched
a flash sale overnight.

80
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:11,920
They got ahead of us by a day.

81
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,640
The invitation just came in.

82
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:15,540
(Bright Platinum Hotel)

83
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,999
(To Mr. Xiao Mucheng: Bright Platinum &
Perfect Writing Product Launch Event)

84
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,840
Thanks.

85
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,280
Well...

86
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:26,880
Next time, it's my treat.

87
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,720
You've said that a dozen times.

88
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,480
Anything else?

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,200
Nope.

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,680
We launched a flash sale,

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,080
and then they did the same.

92
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:40,600
And they're partnering
with TY Cosmetics for a joint promo.

93
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,600
Boss,

94
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,280
do you think

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,840
we have a corporate spy?

96
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,720
Spy!

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,040
Spy!

98
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,000
If there was one,

99
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:52,560
it'd definitely be you.

100
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,400
Boss, come on.

101
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,480
I can take an insult from you,

102
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,600
but I won't stand for being accused.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,440
Go away.

104
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,160
Morning, Mr. Xiao.

105
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,320
Why do you look so pale?

106
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,040
You must be exhausted
from working so hard for the hotel.

107
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
Make sure to get some rest.

108
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,720
Here, I got you some coffee.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,640
It's refreshing.

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,720
Thanks, Mr. Yan.

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,880
I appreciate it.

112
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
Excuse me, this is my stop.

113
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,520
HR isn't in this direction.
It's that way.

114
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,840
Thanks.

115
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,800
Don't be upset.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,120
You'll get

117
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,622
a full-time position soon enough.

118
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,400
I memorized everything he asked.

119
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
The bus stops, routes,

120
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,600
and where each one goes in the city.

121
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
I got them all.

122
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Even the distances from the hotel

123
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,088
to the train station,

124
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:02,880
airport, and docks,

125
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,240
plus the major transport options.

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,240
Even Ms. Man said
I passed the assessment.

127
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,720
So, why is he blocking me now?

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,040
That's out of line!

129
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:09,680
Does he think

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,066
the hotel belongs to his family?

131
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,240
Actually, it does.

132
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:18,720
Keep that confidential.

133
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:26,240
So what if he's a rich kid?

134
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,680
He can't mistreat me!

135
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,160
Come in.

136
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,040
What is it?

137
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,560
You asked for me.

138
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,600
Right.

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,840
I have a task for you.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,320
I need you to handle something.

141
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:56,960
Bright Platinum is hosting an event.

142
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,977
I want you to check it out
this afternoon.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,444
Take some photos and report back.

144
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
I have training this afternoon.

145
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,400
Send someone else.

146
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,440
No. The others are too recognizable.

147
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,000
You're the best fit for this.

148
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:08,200
What do you mean?

149
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,560
What do I mean?

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Enough questions.

151
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,360
Just follow orders, will you?

152
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,600
I work here, and I'm not your servant.

153
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,280
Even if your family owns this hotel,

154
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
you can't boss me around.

155
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,080
Oops.

156
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,040
I guess I let
your little family secret slip.

157
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Good thing it's just the two of us here.

158
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,800
Say it louder, I don't mind.

159
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,440
Oh, I was just saying how dashing

160
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,560
and modest you are.

161
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,840
Not bad.

162
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,600
Cut the flattery.

163
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,240
By the way,

164
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,080
for this afternoon,

165
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,440
put on this outfit.

166
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,920
The event is formal.

167
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,320
Dress appropriately.

168
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:49,755
What are you doing?

169
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,920
Is there

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,040
an extra allowance?

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,840
Out.

172
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,240
Maybe I should wait and see.

173
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:24,999
(Facial Bar,
Specializing in Hydrating Skincare)

174
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,660
(Yi Ran: I'm here.)

175
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,500
(Yi Ran: The place looks nice.
Big crowd. There's free food!)

176
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,640
You don't have to
report everything to me.

177
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,560
Just send me some photos, okay?

178
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm just following your order!

179
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
What's with the attitude?

180
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,160
What's wrong with this guy?

181
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,760
(No alcohol at work.)

182
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,280
Oh no.

183
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,400
This is really bad.

184
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,460
(Yi Ran)

185
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,980
(Yi Ran)

186
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,000
Hello?

187
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,960
Can you just say everything at once?

188
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,640
Stop texting

189
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,040
and calling me constantly.

190
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,920
Hello?

191
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:24,880
What's going on? What happened?

192
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,480
Hello?

193
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,800
Give me one.

194
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,520
Me too.

195
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120
Excuse me, move aside.

196
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,200
Coming through!

197
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,320
Move aside.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,360
This trip was totally worth it.

199
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,840
Give me one, thanks.

200
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,720
What are you doing here?

201
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,040
Fieldwork plus grabbing some freebies.

202
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
What about you?

203
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,000
A friend invited me.

204
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:57,920
Just checking it out.

205
00:12:58,422 --> 00:12:59,440
You want one of these?

206
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
I can get you more.

207
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,600
Nice.

208
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,400
Mr. Lin Jr.?

209
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:06,688
My friend's looking for me.

210
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:07,320
Wait here.

211
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,711
Go ahead. Don't worry about me.

212
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,422
Wait for me.

213
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,760
Ms. Ling will be here soon.

214
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,000
What will you tell her?

215
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,160
Mr. Han!

216
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,880
Welcome to Bright Platinum.

217
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,140
Ms. Ling, congratulations.

218
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,333
You two know each other?

219
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,000
We just met.

220
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,440
Ms. Ling, the event is really well done.

221
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,360
Thank you.

222
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,200
Mr. Lin Jr.'s support made it possible.

223
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,960
I'm sure you've noticed
Bright Platinum's strengths.

224
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,080
If we partner up,

225
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,920
not only can we lead the industry,

226
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,760
but we can also leverage
our partner brands

227
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,977
to unlock more opportunities.

228
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,160
That goes without saying.

229
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,640
We've received
the due diligence documents.

230
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,080
The headquarters is reviewing them.

231
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,560
We should have feedback soon.

232
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,560
I look forward to it.

233
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,800
I'll leave you two to it.

234
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,400
Alright.

235
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,360
See you later.

236
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,320
Looks like I picked the right partner.

237
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,120
Of course.

238
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
At Bright Platinum,

239
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,120
we only collaborate with our equals.

240
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,640
Excuse me.

241
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,800
Make yourself comfortable.

242
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,840
Oh, right.

243
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,800
Why not stay at Bright Platinum tonight?

244
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sure our lunch won't disappoint you.

245
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,600
Are you okay?

246
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm fine.

247
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,400
Seriously?

248
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,019
You were wailing on the phone!

249
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,600
You didn't answer my calls. I'm so wo...

250
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,640
There was a huge flash sale just now!

251
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,920
I got carried away.

252
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:54,960
Since you're here too,

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,422
I can use your spot to grab another!

254
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:57,333
Hand me my shoe.

255
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Don't be so clumsy.

256
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,520
Get up.

257
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,280
Alright, let's go.

258
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,280
We're leaving already?

259
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,840
They're about
to announce the grand prize!

260
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,880
Wouldn't it be a waste not to stay?

261
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,200
Let's wait a bit.

262
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,920
I don't like repeating myself.

263
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,040
Wait, you sent me here.

264
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,560
And now you're dragging me away?

265
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,760
What's your deal?

266
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,840
Is this a joke?

267
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,080
I never sent you here. Let's go.

268
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,280
Did you hit your head or something?

269
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,800
You told me to come!

270
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,240
I did not. Are you leaving or not?

271
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,440
Nope.

272
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,688
Unapproved absence.

273
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,679
One-day salary deduction.

274
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,550
Now, go back
and write a self-reflection report.

275
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:01,380
You're picking on me.

276
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,800
Fine. Mark me absent.

277
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:03,720
What's the big deal?

278
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:14,920
Where are you going?

279
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:16,680
You consider me absent.
Why does it matter?

280
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
How nice of you

281
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,520
to bring your staff here
to support my event.

282
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,680
Though, she doesn't seem
too eager to leave.

283
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
(Brand Launch Event)
Welcome, everyone!

284
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,040
We're about to start

285
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,720
our grand finale!

286
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,600
We'll be playing a game.

287
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,680
Pair up. One man and woman in each team.

288
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,600
Where did you go?

289
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,740
I've been looking for you!

290
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,640
Don't even ask.

291
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,960
I ran into a total lunatic.

292
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,400
Where?

293
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,680
Come on.

294
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,040
What?

295
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,920
I have to win the grand prize.

296
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,520
Let's do it!

297
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:00,955
Excuse me, coming through.

298
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,120
Why are you up here?

299
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,040
Come with me.

300
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,840
I'm already marked absent.
I'm not leaving.

301
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,120
She says she's staying.

302
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,960
Mr. Xiao, don't make things
difficult for her.

303
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
You two know each other?

304
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,920
Can we not make a scene?

305
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,880
Let go of my hand.

306
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,480
Well, you all seem enthusiastic.

307
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,400
Mind if I join?

308
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
Hello, I'm Ling Yishu.

309
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,720
Yi Ran.

310
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,920
So, you're Yi Ran.

311
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,080
What game are you playing, Mr. Lin Jr.?

312
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:45,360
I can't quite figure it out.

313
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
They paired up.

314
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,840
I'll partner with you.

315
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, really?

316
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,600
Are you planning to ditch your boss?

317
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,120
It's just a game.

318
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,320
No need to risk my career over it.

319
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,520
Pair up with me now,

320
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,680
and we might reconsider
that absence report.

321
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,680
No thanks.

322
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,720
How about a raise?

323
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,400
This is not just another prank, right?

324
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
I promise.

325
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,400
Tiny Yi.

326
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,360
You dragged me up here.

327
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,720
Are you ditching me?

328
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,880
Cut it out, he's my boss.

329
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,120
I can't afford to cross him.

330
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,320
All of you are in pairs.
Let the game begin!

331
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:33,000
Players on stage,
listen to your teammates' instructions.

332
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,840
The first to hit the opponent wins!

333
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,040
Ready?

334
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,280
You don't wanna lose, do you?

335
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,080
I don't even know

336
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,280
how to spell "defeat."

337
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,040
The game starts now!

338
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,480
Come on! Let's go!

339
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Go, go, go!

340
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,080
- Nice!
- Keep going!

341
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:52,200
Move forward, to the right!

342
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,866
- Hit him!
- You walked right past him!

343
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,840
Behind you!

344
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,040
Turn around!

345
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,360
Hurry up and turn around!

346
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,800
Hit him!

347
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
- Go!
- Behind you!

348
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,560
Don't just stand there! Move!

349
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,240
Hit him!

350
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,800
Yes!

351
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,560
Behind you!

352
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,240
Turn around!

353
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,560
No peeking!

354
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,120
Hit him!

355
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,880
Left! Left!

356
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,920
Get up!

357
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,880
You are really bad at this.

358
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
A round of applause!

359
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
Well played!

360
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:22,266
I've never seen anyone this slow.

361
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,280
Watch and learn.

362
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,200
Go for it!

363
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,280
Go for it!

364
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,280
Go for it!

365
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,840
Go for it!

366
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,960
- Keep pushing!
- Go, go!

367
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,240
Round two begins!

368
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,360
In front of you!

369
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,920
That was fast!

370
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,760
Right on target!

371
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,880
What just happened?

372
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,040
I didn't even start!

373
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:56,360
Better luck next time.

374
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:58,155
That was a sneak attack! You cheated!

375
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,960
You lost.

376
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,240
I'm not letting this slide.

377
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:01,920
One more round!

378
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,240
I'll win the next one for you.

379
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:10,040
I got the chance back for you.

380
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,360
Now, don't blame it on luck.

381
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,960
Go! Go! Go!

382
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,720
Move forward!

383
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,680
Straight ahead! Keep going!

384
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,600
Behind you! Behind you!

385
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,720
Turn around!

386
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,480
Yes!

387
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,280
Hit him!

388
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,880
Go for it!

389
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,333
What do you wanna eat?

390
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:48,280
Anything's fine.

391
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,600
Same.

392
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
I'm not picky.

393
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,080
Waiter, we'd like to order.

394
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,120
Please get this gentleman a serving of

395
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,280
"Unsportsmanlike BBQ."

396
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,800
Extra spicy.

397
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,640
And for Mr. Lin,

398
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,960
"Loser Lobster."

399
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,960
Oh! And "Gassy Fish."

400
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,200
Bring a serving for Mr. Xiao.

401
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,200
Thanks.

402
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,360
I remember your restaurant
serves a dish called

403
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,160
"Petty Chicken."

404
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,240
Mr. Lin will have one too.

405
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,520
Ms. Ling.

406
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,600
Go ahead. Take their order.

407
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
Let's have a drink together.

408
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:45,777
Prosperity comes with harmony.

409
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,360
Waiter!

410
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,960
A serving of "Random Crab."

411
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,000
Got it!

412
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,280
Here.

413
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,280
Yi Ran.

414
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,000
The crab is your favorite.

415
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,320
Thanks.

416
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,320
You have it.

417
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,560
And sweet and sour ribs.

418
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,080
Lobster.

419
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,880
I can do it myself.

420
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,320
The game is over.

421
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,600
Can you two show some respect
for the food?

422
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,160
I've got some work back at the hotel.

423
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,920
Enjoy your food. I'll head out.

424
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,760
What's the hurry?

425
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,320
I've got something to do too?

426
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,440
What exactly?

427
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,480
I can handle it myself.

428
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,120
Don't flinch.

429
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,360
Relax, I'm a professional.

430
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,520
Don't move.

431
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,840
I wasn't flinching.

432
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,840
Alright.

433
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,040
I'll head back on my own. You go ahead.

434
00:24:57,355 --> 00:24:58,600
You're not coming with me?

435
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,800
Forget it.

436
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,400
You've messed with me enough today.

437
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,320
That was a special situation.

438
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,440
So?

439
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,800
You think you can just brush it off

440
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,644
with one sentence?

441
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,080
If you're apologizing, make it sincere.

442
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:17,520
What do you want then?

443
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,040
You don't usually take the bus, do you?

444
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,920
Shouldn't you explain something to me?

445
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,280
Explain what?

446
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,000
The girl named Yi Ran,

447
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,480
what kind of rare talent is she?

448
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,840
Why are you two fighting over her

449
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,880
and getting so worked up earlier?

450
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,240
Getting worked up?

451
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,360
Why are you so upset?

452
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,640
As your business partner,

453
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,600
I should warn you of something.

454
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,200
Xiao Mucheng's moves

455
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,680
with great shrewdness.

456
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,560
As the heir of Spring Sea Resort Hotel,

457
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,000
he's got money, looks,

458
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,680
and he plays hard-to-get
game like a master.

459
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,080
Especially

460
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,800
when it comes to naive little girls.

461
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,200
They fall for it every time.

462
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,040
You're in danger.

463
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,280
Yi Ran is different from other girls.

464
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:26,040
And you're in danger too.

465
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,120
Oh, I wouldn't

466
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,000
just stand by and watch

467
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,520
as someone else takes what I like.

468
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,560
Let's a song.

469
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,640
The air is bad,
and the place is cramped.

470
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:06,080
Nothing comfortable about this.

471
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,040
You know why people work hard for money?

472
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,440
For a better life.

473
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,280
Wrong.

474
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
People work hard so they have options,

475
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,960
so they don't have
to squeeze onto a bus.

476
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,760
What's wrong with taking the bus?

477
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,320
It's eco-friendly.

478
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,680
It comes with a personal driver.

479
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,760
This bus alone costs over a million.

480
00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:33,360
More expensive than your puny car.

481
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,080
And the best part?
Only two yuan for a ride.

482
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,360
How you see the world

483
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,880
depends on the lens
you're looking through.

484
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,840
How many stops are left?

485
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,160
Ten.

486
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,920
That long?

487
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,320
Bus survival kit.

488
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,720
Seriously? It's 2024,

489
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:25,333
and you're still using wired earphones?

490
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,600
They work, don't they?

491
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Why are you so picky?

492
00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:29,520
Why don't you just nap?

493
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,560
Quit yapping.

494
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:34,177
This seat is rock-hard.

495
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,540
- The ride is bumpy.
- Keep it down.

496
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,244
How can I sleep here?

497
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,800
- Lower your voice.
- What was that?

498
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,360
Keep it down!

End of the line. Wake up.

508
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:49,880
- Why is no one here?
- We missed our stop.

509
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,920
You chose a bus ride over a car.

510
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,840
To make it worse,

511
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,977
we slept through the stop.

512
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,520
You dozed off first.

513
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,920
That's because of your so-called

514
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,920
bus-survival headphones.

515
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,960
Is it my fault now?

516
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,800
You should be thanking me
for curing your insomnia.

517
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:11,240
You should be grateful

518
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,680
I didn't just leave you here alone.

519
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,080
Now what?

520
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,840
My feet hurt. I can't walk.

521
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,360
Alright, let's go.

522
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,080
Are you messing with me

523
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,280
or yourself?

524
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
Hey, at least we got a ride.

525
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:03,444
Who said I wasn't going to take it?

526
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,280
Honestly...

527
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,680
You look way better like this

528
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,640
than when you're all cold

529
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,480
and stuck-up.

530
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,960
Aren't you tired?

531
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,960
Why don't you hop on?

532
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,160
If I get on, can the old guy

533
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,240
even handle it?

534
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,280
You're up.

535
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,120
I got you breakfast. Eat up.

536
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,360
Why am I tied up?

537
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,800
What did you do to me? Let me go!

538
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,880
Oh, right.

539
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,320
Be quick!

540
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,040
Let me untie you. Don't move.

541
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,600
Stay still.

542
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,480
You look normal and sane.

543
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,440
I can't believe you're such a creep!

544
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,600
Me? A creep?

545
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:21,160
Do you even know
how drunk you were last night?

546
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,040
You tried to strip in here!

547
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,000
If I hadn't tied you up,

548
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,400
I would've been tied up instead!

549
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,320
Next time I get drunk,

550
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,000
don't let me sleep in a place like this.

551
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,080
You're still going to drink?

552
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,760
I'm back at the hotel.

553
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,440
I'm not feeling too great.

554
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,040
My eye keeps twitching.

555
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:50,280
Maybe I've been too exhausted lately.

556
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,360
Miss, can you press
the elevator button for me?

557
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,400
I don't have hands.

558
00:33:28,844 --> 00:33:30,160
They checked the security footage.

559
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,360
Turns out, there was no one else.

560
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,880
Just a little girl

561
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,160
running frantically in the stairwell.

562
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,400
Please, stop it.

563
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,600
You're freaking me out.

564
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,160
She's totally making it up.

565
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,400
Do you actually believe her?

566
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,120
No.

567
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,920
When I was on night duty,

568
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,880
I really did hear some strange noises.

569
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,200
Me too.

570
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,320
It sounded like a child crying.

571
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,800
No, it was chuckling.

572
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,000
You heard it too?

573
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,760
So, it wasn't just in my head.

574
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,240
I heard it too.

575
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,120
It was coming from the sixth floor.

576
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,120
Are you guys serious?

577
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,520
But our hotel

578
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,160
has never had any haunting before.

579
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,600
Any hotel with a bit of history

580
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,120
is bound to have some spooky rumors.

581
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,560
If there weren't any at all,

582
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,080
it'd be even scarier?

583
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,400
Look at you guys...

584
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,720
Miss!

585
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,000
I could've had a heart attack!

586
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,840
You're a grown man. Don't be so timid.

587
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,520
What's up?

588
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,680
Hey,

589
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,360
we think the hotel is haunted.

590
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,440
Haunted?

591
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,240
What do we do now?

592
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,200
I'm on night duty tonight.

593
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,200
Could my luck get any worse?

594
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,760
Yi Ran, you've got nerves of steel.

595
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,760
How are you still eating?

596
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,240
What's scarier

597
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
than ghosts in this world?

598
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,560
Being broke.

599
00:35:31,555 --> 00:35:33,329
I'm already broke, what could be worse?

600
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,222
So lame.

601
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,720
You're leaving now?

602
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,240
Hey, finish your food!

603
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,244
Wait for me!

604
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm done eating!

605
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,390
Action!

606
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,000
Welcome to Bright Platinum.

607
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,080
Come on, get ready.

608
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,000
Action.

609
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,380
Don't block.

610
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,500
Action.

611
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,260
Move backward!

612
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,100
Move forward.

613
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,560
Extremely accurate.

614
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,840
Let me do it again!

615
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,400
