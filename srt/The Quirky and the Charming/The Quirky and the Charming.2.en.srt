00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
Happy birthday.

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,420
(Star Hotel Industry Development Summit Reception)
Hello.

7
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,200
- We finally met. Over here, please.
- Hello.

8
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,111
Mr. Song.

9
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:39,840
Hello, Ms. Ling.

10
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,640
Hello.

11
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
Hello.
Please check your attendance here.

12
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,480
Alright.

13
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,120
Over here, please.

14
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,120
You're very beautiful.

15
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,200
My foot!

16
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,400
That hurts!

17
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,160
(Reception)

18
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,880
Sorry about that.

19
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,080
It was too crowded.

20
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,920
I had nowhere to place my foot.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,520
Security.

22
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,680
Get rid of this indecent old man.

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,480
I'm one of the guests here!

24
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,680
How dare you?

25
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
Now, you're not.

26
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,400
You!

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,480
Drag him out.

28
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:18,280
(Reception)

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,840
Let go!

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,000
Let go!

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,520
Let go! I'm one of the guests!

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,600
Let go of me!

33
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,720
Jerks always find a way

34
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
to show up in our lives.

35
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:29,290
As women, we need to learn
how to protect ourselves.

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,880
Let go of me!

37
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,880
Vincent.

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,400
You're back, huh?

39
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,920
I came back half a month ago.

40
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,040
You didn't even call me.

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,320
I was busy.

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
You're playing hard-to-get, huh?

43
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:49,222
I knew that you couldn't sleep
because you missed me too much.

44
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:50,688
You still don't dare to admit it.

45
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,240
You wanted me to call you first, huh?

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,120
You must be hallucinating
after being single for too long.

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
Alright. I got the message.

48
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,511
I'll contact you when I'm free.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,519
You've devoted a lot of effort

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,440
to Spring Sea's publicity
and investment, huh?

51
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,000
We're in the service industry.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
It's all about service and reputation.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm merely doing publicity work

54
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:08,733
so that more people
can know about it.

55
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,520
You're exactly right.

56
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,320
Recently, Spring Sea
has been a hot topic of discussion.

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,920
You must share your experience with us

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,840
on stage later.

59
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:26,920
(Three-Year Comparative Analysis)

60
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
According to our data,

61
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,520
the domestic
five-star hotel market has seen

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,080
a 5.5% growth compared to last year.

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,240
Both Spring Sea Resort Hotel
and Bright Bright Platinum Hotel

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,520
have played major roles
in its development.

65
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,320
They've been highly praised by all,

66
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,880
especially Spring Sea.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,840
As an established enterprise,

68
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
it has redefined the hotel brand

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,520
(Spring Sea - PR Department)
and set a great example.

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,000
Next,

71
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,240
let's welcome Ms. Ling
of Bright Platinum Hotel to the stage.

72
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:08,620
(Bright Platinum Hotel)

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
Although Bright Platinum Hotel
is a latecomer,

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,640
we've stayed true to our principles
since our inception.

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
That's precisely how

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,360
we accumulated a large
and loyal customer base.

77
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
To us, changing
isn't a difficult process.

78
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,200
However, our goal
is to stay true to our initial goals.

79
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,320
I've prepared data from last year.

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,080
Yanan.

81
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:38,780
(Five-star disappointment. Overpriced.
Even inferior to some homestays.)

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,400
How could you be this careless?

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,360
Sorry about that.

84
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,620
(Five-star Negative Review)

85
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
Got it.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,920
Our meeting is still in progress.

87
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,400
We can discuss unrelated topics

88
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,520
after this.

89
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,560
Chairman Liu,

90
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,680
the industry summit is held

91
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:04,250
to discover issues within the industry.

92
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,920
Since there's a controversy now,

93
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
shouldn't we discuss it?

94
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,720
He's right.

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,200
Let's begin with our hotel.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
You guys weren't mistaken.

97
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,800
The negative review was targeted
at Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
Actually, this was a recent experiential
event we held for our customers.

99
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,800
We recruited part-time sleepers

100
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,640
to participate in a sleep trial
and provide feedback on our hotel.

101
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:35,760
We wanted them to give us reasonable

102
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,720
and objective suggestions

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,960
and upload them to social media.

104
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:41,040
This way, the sleepers

105
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,680
can fulfill their duty.

106
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,800
At the same time,

107
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,760
this allows the public
to monitor our standards too.

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,320
The content shown in the pictures

109
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,480
was indeed something we didn't notice.

110
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,120
But on the other hand, it also proved

111
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,960
that the reviews
were authentic and unbiased.

112
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,160
At the same time,
I want everyone to know

113
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,680
that Spring Sea
isn't afraid of negative reviews.

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
With negative reviews as such,

115
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,880
they'll help us to improve
our services and standards.

116
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,040
Thank you, everyone.

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,440
The situation occurred
between 1 and 1:30 P.M.

118
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
One of our guests overheard

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,520
our work-related exchange.

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,977
Work-related exchange?

121
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,720
She complained that the beverages here
were too expensive.

122
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,600
I...

123
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,480
I merely made a casual remark about her.

124
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,800
Making casual remarks?

125
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,690
Does it comply with
your professional standards?

126
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,760
Do you know that the negative review

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,040
is affecting more than just our hotel?

128
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,200
A specific group of people

129
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,130
is targeting the entire industry
because of this.

130
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,380
Your contribution is invaluable.

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
Mr. Xiao, I'm sorry.

132
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,600
I truly know my fault now.

133
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,220
(Breach of Discipline
Termination Notice)

134
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,880
You don't belong here.

135
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,840
Sorry, Mr. Xiao.

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm begging you.

137
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,440
I really need this job.

138
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,180
That person you met last night
was my bosom friend.

139
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,280
Her name is Yi Ran.

140
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,040
I think she's shooting a scene
at the parking lot

141
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,120
on Chunfeng Road today.

142
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,000
Sorry about this.

143
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,800
I'll hand her number to you.

144
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,560
Alright. Thank you.

145
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,600
Cut!

146
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,520
Cut!

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,880
Who is that?

148
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:00,680
Director, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:01,355
Sorry about that.

150
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:02,160
Director, I'm sorry.

151
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,800
Stop him.

152
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,040
Where's the executive director?

153
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,777
Where is he?

154
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,320
Coming.

155
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,920
Over here!

156
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,666
Sorry about that.

157
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:08,711
What are you guys doing?

158
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,560
Who hired him?

159
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,600
Come!

160
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,760
Come back!

161
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,920
Return to your positions!

162
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,120
Director, our meals have arrived.

163
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,733
Forget it. Let them eat first.

164
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:19,866
It's lunchtime.

165
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Guys, time to eat.

166
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,120
Eat faster, okay?

167
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,920
Yi Ran?

168
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,080
Boss, have you found her?

169
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
Nope.

170
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,360
Could you be mistaken?

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,080
How could she be an actress?

172
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,320
Judging from her looks and air,

173
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,240
she fits right in
with demons and spirits.

174
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,240
However...

175
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,680
(How did he find me?)

176
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,760
It's not like she has no expertise.

177
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,000
She's exceptionally talented

178
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:59,177
when it comes to causing trouble
for other people.

179
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:00,520
(Who? Is he referring to me?)

180
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,000
It's fine.

181
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
I think she lacks money.

182
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
Worse comes to worst,

183
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,440
we can bribe her with money.

184
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,280
(What?)

185
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
(He wants to bribe me with money?)

186
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,688
- (What a scum.)
- Time to shoot.

187
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,400
Time to shoot.

188
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm sure I can find her here.

189
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:32,600
That's mine!

190
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
That's my head!

191
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,520
Return my head to me!

192
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,960
Return my head to me!

193
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,480
You dealt with her already?

194
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:48,840
After giving it some thought,

195
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,890
I think we should change our strategy.
Drive the car.

196
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,920
I was sincere in apologizing to her.

197
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,040
But it's as if she has misunderstood me.

198
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,680
She didn't answer my calls.

199
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,240
She wasn't willing to meet me
even though I went to the set.

200
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,360
I'm truly out of choice.

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,960
That's why

202
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm seeking your help.

203
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,960
What about this?

204
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,360
I'll explain it to her on your behalf.

205
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,960
Hello.

206
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,880
The number you have dialed
is switched off.

207
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,080
I think the shoot isn't over yet.

208
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,280
I can't rest at ease

209
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,000
until Ms. Yi forgives me.

210
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,800
Why don't you find her at her house?

211
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:01,555
That's what I was intending to do.

212
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,920
I mean,

213
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,160
I was intending to find her
and apologize to her.

214
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,000
Alright.

215
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,120
I'll send her home address to you.

216
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,320
By the way,

217
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,560
today is her birthday.

218
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,880
Remember to buy

219
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,600
a birthday gift for her
when you visit her.

220
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm sure she'll be happy.

221
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,680
I'll definitely
apologize to her sincerely.

222
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,320
(Birthday cake)

223
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,520
Why are they so expensive?

224
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:02,620
(128 yuan, Express Payment)

225
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,740
(Payment Successful)

226
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,540
(Payment Successful,
Classic Teddy Bear Cherry Cream Cake)

227
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,240
Where's the contract with TY?

228
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,920
Mr. Yu and I
have reached an agreement.

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,040
Where is it stuck again?

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,160
Don't keep telling me

231
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,266
that Spring Sea's banquet hall
is cheap and spacious.

232
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,111
People's Park is even bigger.
And, it's free.

233
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,080
We poured real money into
our furnishings and facilities.

234
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,555
Don't tell me they're no match

235
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,088
for the 20-year-old relics they use?

236
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,280
I don't care how.

237
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,177
I want to see the contract on my table

238
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:30,880
by this Friday.

239
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,600
That's all.

240
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I'll take this.

241
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,560
Okay.

242
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,644
Bring me a new bottle
of this concealer as well.

243
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,955
Alright. Please wait a moment.

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,840
Usually, I don't even
meet you once per month.

245
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,960
But today, I bumped into you twice.

246
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,080
I know.

247
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:07,120
You set up this
accidental encounter, didn't you?

248
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,160
All men are the same.

249
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
I use more expensive ones usually.

250
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,639
Who are you buying them for?
I can choose them for you.

251
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,130
Expensive ones
might not be suitable.

252
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,088
You're right. You're quite thoughtful.

253
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,280
Since you've already
prepared gifts for me,

254
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,320
let me buy you a meal.

255
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:22,400
I have an appointment with my client.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
You're still playing hard-to-get, huh?

257
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,500
- So childish.
- Mister, your bill is ready.

258
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,750
I'll go and foot the bill first.

259
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:30,240
Okay. See you next time.

260
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,360
Hello?

261
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,480
Have you arrived?

262
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,920
I'll be there soon!

263
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:52,155
Why did you press the "Delivered" button
when you haven't delivered it?

264
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,760
I'll be there in a second!

265
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:55,155
Please do me a favor here!

266
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,120
Thank you!

267
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,180
(May Everything Be In Your Favor)

268
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,400
Sorry about this.

269
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,560
Here's your order.

270
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,920
I waited half an hour
after the call, you know?

271
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,400
It's too windy out there.
I have plenty of orders to deliver too.

272
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,400
I'm truly sorry about this.

273
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,160
Can you please give me
a five-star review?

274
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,160
Do you know how to do it?

275
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,320
Take out your phone.

276
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,720
I'll show you how to do it.

277
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,880
Are you done?

278
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,711
You didn't even accomplish
your task on time.

279
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,066
Now, you want a five-star review?

280
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,000
Mom.

281
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,160
Didn't I tell you to wait downstairs?

282
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,080
Why did you come here?

283
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,960
Wait here.

284
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,900
(HAPPY BIRTHDAY)

285
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,280
Take it. It's for your daughter.

286
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,480
This is inappropriate.

287
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,177
Do you want a five-star review or not?

288
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,480
Alright.

289
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,680
Hurry. Thank her.

290
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
Thank you, miss.

291
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,800
Here.

292
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,400
We'll make a move first.

293
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,920
Goodbye.

294
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:29,200
What are you doing here?

295
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,560
I think there's
a misunderstanding between us.

296
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,490
No misunderstanding!

297
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,240
Just leave.

298
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,920
You're dead meat! Just leave!

299
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,280
You're pretty good at this, huh?

300
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,040
Get out!

301
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,880
Let me explain!

302
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,520
No way!

303
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,866
I'll call the cops if you stay here.

304
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:42,888
You want to call the cops?

305
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,520
Go ahead.

306
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,080
The cops can find out

307
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,800
who knocked my head with a glass bottle.

308
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,120
But I...

309
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,720
Hey! Who said you could come inside?

310
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,920
Get out!

311
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,680
Hurry and get out.

312
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm not leaving.

313
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,640
Get out.

314
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,760
What's wrong with you?

315
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,640
Are you sure you're a woman?
You're too strong.

316
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,440
So, do you live in this dumpster?

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,640
You're not welcome here.

318
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:10,200
You better return to your palace.

319
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,640
What are you doing?

320
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,960
You're Yi Ran, right?

321
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,080
Let me introduce myself again.

322
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm Spring Sea Resort Hotel's
head of Housekeeping Department.

323
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
My name is Xiao Mucheng.

324
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,440
You can call me Vincent as well.

325
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,640
You mean the god of plague?
[*Sounds alike.]

326
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:43,933
Vincent.

327
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:45,733
(Xiao Mucheng,
Head of Housekeeping Department)

328
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,360
Regarding the negative review
you left on our hotel,

329
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,560
I've investigated the incident.

330
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
Our employee was at fault.

331
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
As one of her superiors,

332
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,120
let me apologize to you sincerely.

333
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,480
But since you've taken advantage of me,

334
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,800
we're even now.

335
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,480
Who said I took advantage of you?

336
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,440
You're saying this

337
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,933
all because you want me
to remove my negative review, right?

338
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,520
I hope that we can collaborate.

339
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,840
Aren't you afraid that I might cause
endless trouble for you?

340
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,600
Why should I collaborate with
a shady hotel like yours

341
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,133
that extorts money from their guests?

342
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,044
Are you done?

343
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Leave immediately.

344
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,520
I hope

345
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,400
that you can be
a professional sleeper at our hotel.

346
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,560
You will receive

347
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
the full VIP experience

348
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,760
at no expense.

349
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,400
I'll also pay you
according to the market wage.

350
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,360
I get paid for this?

351
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,840
How much?

352
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,160
200 per day.

353
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,360
See yourself off.

354
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,520
USD.

355
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
You see, I'm too busy with work usually.

356
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,866
I had no time to clean up the unit.

357
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,840
Please don't mind it,

358
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,960
god of plague...

359
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,840
No.

360
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,280
Sorry about that.

361
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,080
Your name is?

362
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,080
Xiao Mucheng.

363
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,840
Mr. Xiao, please don't take it to heart.

364
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,600
I'll get you some tea.

365
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:12,600
No need for that.

366
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
So,

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,960
what exactly

368
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,520
does a professional sleeper do?

369
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,920
To put it simply,

370
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,480
you'll live in our hotel

371
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,480
and post

372
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,640
your real hotel experience
on social media.

373
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,800
You must post your honest experience
no matter if it's good or bad.

374
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,120
Is that all?

375
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,000
That's all.

376
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,420
So, I don't need
to remove my negative review?

377
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:38,177
No, you don't.

378
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,840
Let me straighten this out.

379
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,160
So, you're saying

380
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,240
that I can live in your hotel for free,

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,520
receive 200 USD daily,

382
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,560
and I don't even need
to remove my negative review?

383
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,720
Is this a joke?

384
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,720
I never joke when it comes to work.

385
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,840
I'll be honest with you, then.

386
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,400
I've never tried being
a professional sleeper before.

387
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,360
I don't know what to do.

388
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,720
I'll tell you what to do
when it's necessary.

389
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,000
How long is my employment duration?

390
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,600
Three days.

391
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,840
Only three days?

392
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,920
I mean, three days aren't enough

393
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,360
for me to experience
all of your facilities

394
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,800
and services fully.

395
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,600
Say,

396
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,360
what about seven days?

397
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,360
Deal.

398
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
Mr. Xiao, have a seat.

399
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:33,022
I'll clean this up in five minutes.

400
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,520
Hey...

401
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,040
What are you doing here?

402
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,760
I came back to pack my belongings.

403
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,022
Let me help you out.

404
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,760
No need for that.

405
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
There's nothing to pack.

406
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:22,520
I just can't bear to leave the place.

407
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,040
If so,

408
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,680
what's your next plan?

409
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,800
You know the rules in the industry too.

410
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,933
Now that my reputation is tainted,

411
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:40,120
it's difficult to find a job
in the same industry.

412
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,440
Seems like I have
to be an insurance agent now.

413
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,560
Hey.

414
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,760
Why don't you make a plea
in front of Ms. Yi?

415
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,760
Ms. Yi?

416
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
It's the guest
who left a negative review.

417
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,980
The one who was upset with
the 600 yuan charge.

418
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,066
I do want to make a plea.

419
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,880
But where can I find her?

420
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,400
Don't you know?

421
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:02,920
Boss invited Ms. Yi to our hotel again

422
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,920
as a professional sleeper.

423
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,920
Mr. Chen

424
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,480
just notified us

425
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,520
to set up VIP access for Ms. Yi today.

426
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,680
We have to serve her

427
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,400
according to the highest standards.

428
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,880
Ms. Yi,

429
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,400
welcome back to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

430
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,360
Let's go.

431
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,280
Do your hotel employees
earn a high salary?

432
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,520
That's confidential.

433
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,400
I just want to see

434
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,430
if their salaries match
the level of their service.

435
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,760
Fine. Keep it to yourself.

436
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,800
How is it?
Are you satisfied with the room?

437
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,120
Yeah.

438
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,040
I'm very satisfied.

439
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,520
Alright.

440
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,040
If there's nothing else,

441
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
sign the contract.

442
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,240
I think the duration is wrong.

443
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,400
Wasn't it supposed to be seven days?

444
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:47,920
You gave me your promise.

445
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,880
Deal.

446
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,960
Mr. Xiao, please wait a moment.

447
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,680
I meant three days.

448
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,222
How dare you say
that you're sincere, then?

449
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,200
Is paying you 200 USD per day
not sincere enough?

450
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:00,666
I hope you won't refuse my request.

451
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,720
Fine.

452
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,320
Three days it is, then.

453
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,640
So, from now on,

454
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,280
am I officially on duty?

455
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,680
The bed is soft.

456
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,520
I have a bad waist.
I like beds that are harder.

457
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,200
Negative review.

458
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,111
(Negative review)
You...

459
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,160
What kind of language is this?

460
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,200
I can't even understand it.

461
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,730
It's cultural discrimination.

462
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:25,459
Negative review.

463
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,155
(Negative review)

464
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
This is the worst.

465
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,360
Golden Fried Rice for 198 yuan?

466
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,120
Are you guys frying rice or gold?

467
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,580
I'll leave the worst review for that.

468
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:37,266
All of our ingredients are imported...

469
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:37,711
Stop.

470
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,955
Maybe you have
your own reasons for doing so.

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,920
But I'm only here
for a three-day experience.

472
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,480
You better jot down my review.

473
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,920
I'll do my best to share my thoughts

474
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,880
with the netizens.

475
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,533
I'll check that area...

476
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,200
Okay.

477
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,800
Seven days.

478
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,200
Deal.

479
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,320
You said that yourself.

480
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,040
I didn't force you to do so.

481
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,760
I won't take advantage of you.

482
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,680
Since I've accepted the job,

483
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,680
I'll definitely work seriously.

484
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,240
That's for the best.

485
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,160
If there's nothing else, rest early.

486
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,840
Wait.

487
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,400
I'm hungry. Do you have instant noodles?

488
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,480
I want a Michelin five-star one.

489
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,120
Sorry. We don't have that.

490
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:27,555
- Negative...
- The maximum number of stars

491
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,311
is three for a Michelin-starred cuisine.

492
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,160
I mean,

493
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,840
you can leave now.

494
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,200
Ms. Yi, I hope
we're not interrupting you.

495
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,155
What's the matter? Do you need anything?

496
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,600
Happy birthday to you.

497
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,080
Happy birthday to you.

498
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,160
Happy birthday to you.

499
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,000
Happy birthday to you.

500
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,960
Ms. Yi,

501
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
Mr. Xiao said today's your birthday.

502
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,040
We prepared this especially for you.

503
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,640
Ms. Yi, happy birthday.

504
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,800
Thank you.

505
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,600
Thank him for me.

506
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,360
Welcome back to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

507
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,120
May you have a wonderful night.

508
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:57,120
He's pretty considerate.

509
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,200
It's a shame
that it's already past midnight.

510
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,160
Negative review.

511
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,480
Do you know how much he's paying me?

512
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,440
How much?

513
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,560
200 USD per day.

514
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,080
And, I'm living here for free.

515
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,640
Seems like he's pretty nice.

516
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,440
It's good as long as
the misunderstanding is resolved.

517
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,800
Stay sharp, and focus on the money.

518
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,640
His personality
has nothing to do with us.

519
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,844
It's fine as long as
he doesn't stop me from making money.

520
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,200
Continue with your live stream.

521
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,066
I'll hang up first.

522
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,680
Look after yourself out there.

523
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,360
You too.

524
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,920
You can do it.

525
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,480
Today is the birthday of Yi Ran,
my only best friend.

526
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,880
I'll dedicate this song to her.

527
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,800
Yi Ran.

528
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,640
Happy birthday.

529
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,440
Thank you.

531

(Dad.)

535
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,960
(I'm doing pretty good now.)

536
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,560
(Although I'm very lonely,)

537
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:45,000
(it's not that bad.)

538
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
(At least no one is stealing my share.)

539
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,120
(Don't worry up there.)

540
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,400
(Birthday is like an alarm.)

541
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,640
(Every year)

542
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,480
(is a wake-up call for you.)

543
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,760
(Growth means experiencing
hardships from all aspects.)

544
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,200
(I suppose that's reality.)

545
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,720
(Everyone has to face it eventually.)

546
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,240
(Yi Ran.)

547
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,800
(Happy birthday.)

548
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,520
This is my first day
as a professional sleeper.

549
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,000
(What are the details of my job?)

550
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,280
(It consists of four terms.)

551
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,000
(View, check, try, and write.)

552
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:16,400
(For the term "view,")

553
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,929
(you'll view the hotel's furnishings,)

554
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,550
(the design of the hall and the corridors,)

555
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,850
(the layout of the restaurant,
the locations of the elevators,)

556
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,820
(the structure of the guest rooms
and their designs,)

557
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,870
(the placement of facilities
and electrical outlets,)

558
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,549
(the positions of the switches...)

559
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,333
(And even the placement
of certain decorations)

560
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:30,320
(should be jotted down.)

561
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,000
(For "check,")

562
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,560
(you'll check
the electrical appliances' functions,)

563
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,800
(if the kettles
have water or tea stains,)

564
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:37,720
(if there are missing hangers
in the closets,)

565
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,040
(if there are stains
on the newly changed)

566
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,133
(sheets and blankets,)

567
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:44,640
(and if there's any dust or hair
at the bottom of the bed.)

568
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,400
(Our hotel)

569
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:47,640
(has provided three types
of pillow with varying softness)

570
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,680
(to our guests.)

571
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,240
(An instruction card
is at the bedside.)

572
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,840
(Rest Beautifully, Sleep Exquisitely)
(Check if)

573
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,000
(the drainage in the bathroom
is working properly,)

574
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:55,666
(the speed and pressure of the water,)

575
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,730
(the amount of time needed
to fill up the bathtub,)

576
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:00,200
(check if the body and hair shampoo
are nice and easy to use,)

577
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,840
(the speed of Wi-Fi in every room,)

578
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,800
(the signal of the TVs,)

579
00:31:02,866 --> 00:31:05,360
(the efficiency of ice-making
and cooling systems, and so on.)

580
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,079
(Check if the ingredients of
the cafeteria are fresh.)

581
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,444
(Check if the plating
and the placement of the food carts)

582
00:31:12,488 --> 00:31:13,840
(are 100% perfect,)

583
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,440
(and if the wine glasses and tableware
have stains or chips.)

584
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:18,120
(Check the name tag of every employee)

585
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,080
(and assess)

586
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,400
(whether their services
were up to standards.)

587
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,960
(You have to take photos
for all segments.)

588
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,222
(Photos are crucial
for professional sleepers to express)

589
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:28,880
(their experiences and share insights.)

590
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,111
(The last term is "share.")

591
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,000
(You have to share
the highlights and issues)

592
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,733
(of the hotel.)

593
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:34,688
(90% of it is based on
standardized criteria)

594
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:37,000
(while the other 10%
is your personal experience.)

595
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,880
(I hope you can wield
your weapon wisely)

596
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:40,977
(and take responsibility
for every word you type.)

597
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440
Can you respect me for once?

598
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,920
I said,

599
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,400
I want a double shot.

600
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,240
Double!

601
00:32:08,422 --> 00:32:10,777
Forget about your bonus
if you commit this mistake again.

602
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,880
Understood.

603
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,520
Can you respect me for once?

604
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,840
Mr. Xiao.

605
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,360
Mr. Xiao, over here.

606
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,600
Over the past year,

607
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,960
through the joint efforts
of all departments,

608
00:32:42,022 --> 00:32:44,280
the hotel's performance
and reputation have improved.

609
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,160
However, our hotel's outdated equipment

610
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,680
needs continuous upgrades.

611
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,520
The overall
financial condition is worrying.

612
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,280
Just a couple of days ago,

613
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,120
the hotel received

614
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,360
its most damaging negative review
in the past year.

615
00:32:57,488 --> 00:32:59,000
It was due to my negligence of duty.

616
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
But I promise

617
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,640
that such incidents won't occur again.

618
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,760
We've also dealt
with the related personnel.

619
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:06,666
As for the HR Department,

620
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:07,200
I think...

621
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,844
I'll make sure to improve
staff training and development.

622
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,080
That's not the point.

623
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Regarding the issues we're facing now,

624
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,933
do you think there's a need to downsize
certain departments and staff?

625
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Mr. Sun, you're right.

626
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,111
I'll deliver a report
on personnel adjustments

627
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:23,888
to you tonight.

628
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,640
In my opinion,

629
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,640
instead of downsizing the hotel,

630
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,200
why not focus
on boosting employee motivation?

631
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,680
While enhancing service quality,

632
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,640
we should also
consider creative approaches

633
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,080
to elevate our guest's experience.

634
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,880
Mr. Xiao, you have a point.

635
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,240
I'll jot that down.

636
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,133
I hope everyone
will keep up the great work

637
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,440
and help our hotel
achieve even greater success.

638
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,920
Meeting dismissed.

639
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:14,111
Is there no tissue paper
in the meeting room?

640
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:15,479
Go and get changed.

641
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,844
Don't affect the hotel's image.

642
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,733
I'll request someone to prepare it.

643
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,377
This fig-flavored one is pretty good.

644
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
How's the progress with TY's contract?

645
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,920
They're still hesitating.

646
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,800
I wonder if it's related

647
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,690
to the scandal
generated by the negative review.

648
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,288
We were very close to securing the deal.

649
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,960
Now, we still have the advantage.

650
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:54,022
Ms. Ling will be flying
to Shanghai today.

651
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,560
Will Bright Platinum Hotel
try to intercept our deal?

652
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,360
Now, we only have two tasks.

653
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:01,200
The first task
is to quell the controversy.

654
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,240
The second task

655
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:04,177
is to clinch a deal with TY
as soon as possible.

656
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:08,155
How's the progress with the venue
I told you to find?

657
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,600
I found it.

658
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,680
I worked really hard

659
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,360
to track down this private music lounge.

660
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,960
I never expected Mr. Lin
to have such a hobby.

661
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,560
If so, let's cater to his preference.

662
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,040
Perhaps

663
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,280
we can also launch
a special service in the hotel.

664
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,520
Time to let our professional tester
experience it herself.

665
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,240
It's a simple favor

666
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,920
that costs nothing.

667
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,777
This way, you're looking after
several parties all at once.

668
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,520
Boss, you're amazing.

669
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,760
You'll join her.

670
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,120
Ms. Yi.

671
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,600
Can you please find Mr. Xiao

672
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,240
once you're done with your meal?

673
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,040
Got it.

674
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,040
Ms. Yi...

675
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,040
Is this from the beginning?

676
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,730
Yes.

677
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,350
OK.

678
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:23,750
Let's go!

679
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,450
Get closer.

680
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,200
Action.

681
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,430
Action.

682
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,220
This is better.

683
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,030
These...

684
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,080
=The Quirky and The Charming=
