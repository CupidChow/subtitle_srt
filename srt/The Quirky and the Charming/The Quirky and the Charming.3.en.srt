2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Listening to music?

4
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,720
No way.

5
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,640
Music makes me sleepy.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,920
Let someone else go.

7
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,800
Ms. Yi.

8
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
You are our hotel's
esteemed professional sleeper.

9
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,720
So your feedback

10
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,760
is very important to us.

11
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,880
Mr. Xiao will accompany you.

12
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,120
Alright then.

13
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,960
I suppose I have no choice.

14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,160
This is a chance to study

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,355
the differences
between Eastern and Western music.

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,440
You actually research this topic?

17
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
Which one makes me sleep better?

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,760
Ms. Yi, I like your humor.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,120
Very amusing.

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,760
I need to talk to you.

21
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,720
She said that besides
being pretty and knowing English,

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
she has no other skills.

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,000
As long as she isn't fired,

24
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,288
she will work night shifts

25
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:17,488
without any complaints.

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,720
Are you pleading for her?

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,200
Not pleading.

28
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:22,640
Just passing on the message.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,600
I refuse.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
She was responsible

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,200
for the worst review
we've ever received.

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,490
She's completely unprofessional.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,160
She is not suitable for this job.

34
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:31,555
When it's the staff's mistake,

35
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:33,355
do those in charge
bear no responsibility?

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,840
I'm directly involved in this matter.

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm angry too.

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,160
She can't be fired.

39
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,120
What kind of logic is that?

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,720
The logic is

41
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,390
that I don't want
someone losing their job

42
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,800
and their future because of me.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,960
Then, end up resenting me every day.

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
At this rate,

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,360
I'd never sleep soundly again.

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,960
So, are you punishing her, or me?

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,000
If I'm not mistaken,
you have quite a few enemies.

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,920
What's one more?

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,360
One less is still a win.

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
To put it simply,

51
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,040
if your guest made a request,

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,480
would you grant it too?

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,640
How did you come back?

54
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
You didn't want me back?

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,640
Getting fired by the Boss
and returning?

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,600
You're the first.

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,840
Come on, tell us.

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,120
What trick did you pull?

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,920
Yeah!

60
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
What did you do?

61
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,640
We could use some advice too.

62
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
What trick could I possibly pull?

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,840
The hotel needs me.

64
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,800
I beg your pardon?

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,200
Boss said that?

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,640
Vincent realized his own mistakes.

67
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,560
I decided to give him another chance.

68
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
What can I say?
I'm attached to this place.

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,600
Hello?

70
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:54,440
I'm in the parking lot.

71
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:57,680
White suit...

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
Shoulder-length hair.

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Handle it yourself.

74
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
Don't report these things to me.

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,320
I see you.

76
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,600
What's wrong? Not leaving yet?

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,840
If your destination is the hospital,

78
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,960
I can take you there.

79
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,280
Why would I go to a hospital?
I'm not sick.

80
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,040
I'm not so sure.

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,080
Given your current state,

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,840
you could still get hurt very badly.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
It all depends on how hard I hit.

84
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Are you okay?

85
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:49,040
This is our first meeting.

86
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,080
That joke was quite inappropriate.

87
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,200
No matter how inappropriate,
you're the worst.

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,080
Getting into a stranger's car
on the first meeting?

89
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
That's quite bold.

90
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,044
You're not here to pick me up?

91
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:02,680
Me? Pick you up?

92
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:10,960
Hello?

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,720
Mr. Lin, where are you?

94
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,120
I can't find you.

95
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,120
Get out of the car.

96
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,600
Sorry, my mistake.

97
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,760
Hello, good day.

98
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm Ling Yishu, Bright Platinum.

99
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,800
I'll be in Shanghai in three hours.

100
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Not bad. Sounds good.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,880
Very relaxing.

102
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Do you two have any suggestions?

103
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,680
Suggestions?

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,960
Maybe add a pillow.

105
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,080
The acoustics are great.

106
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
The experience is immersive.

107
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
The sound quality is beyond expected.

108
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,120
My staff will follow up

109
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
on the collaboration.

110
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:20,520
Understood, Mr. Xiao.

111
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,600
We'll leave you to it.

112
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,040
Could you take a picture for us?

113
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,960
Of course.

114
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,560
Why take a picture?

115
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,088
You said every experience

116
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:30,888
should be photographed and shared?

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,240
Come on.

118
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,200
Stand a little closer.

119
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,520
Relax your expressions a bit.

120
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,720
Smile.

121
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,520
Great.

122
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,080
Thanks.

123
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
What do you think?

124
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,760
I think it's nice.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,880
Very sleep-inducing.

126
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:03,280
I mean, very captivating.

127
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,320
Since you like it,

128
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,320
then it's settled.

129
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,240
Settled what?

130
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
I plan to open

131
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,120
two private music halls

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,560
as part of our signature services

133
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,360
to cater to guests
with a high demand for music.

134
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,640
That's going to cost a lot, isn't it?

135
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,240
The tricky part

136
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,600
is collecting rare records.

137
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,320
That's something
money alone can't solve.

138
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Must be nice to be rich.

139
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,520
You get to spend time on useless things.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,160
Unlike us regular folks.

141
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,200
The moment we open our eyes,
we have to hustle to survive.

142
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm not the type

143
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,680
who likes owing favors.

144
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,320
You treated me to a concert,

145
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,888
so I'll buy you a meal.

146
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm hungry.

147
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,240
Let's go.

148
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,280
Now that you're on my turf,

149
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,760
take a look. See what you want.

150
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,800
You sure about this?

151
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,200
Don't worry.

152
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,880
I guarantee a top-tier experience.

153
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,440
Ran is here! It's been a while!

154
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,480
I've been busy. Work's been hectic.

155
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,520
Come, try today's skewers.

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,840
I've got a new seasoning mix.

157
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,520
Alright.

158
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,640
Too much salt.

159
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,240
The meat is so fresh,

160
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:17,400
but the salt overshadows it.

161
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,360
No good.

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,520
No way!

163
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,680
I'll tweak the recipe.

164
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,440
Alright.

165
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,320
Over here.

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,880
Ran!

167
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,840
Try my stinky tofu.

168
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:26,977
Fresh out of the fryer.

169
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,360
How is it?

170
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,880
The taste is pretty good.

171
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,320
Just not stinky enough.

172
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,840
It needs some tweaks.

173
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,400
Alright, I'll do just that.

174
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,560
Try this. It's pretty good.

175
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:46,920
This isn't stinky enough?

176
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,840
Hello.

177
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:51,600
Long time no see.

178
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,240
Ran!

179
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,480
Grandpa Guo!

180
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,120
Try today's crispy pork.

181
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,040
Not bad!

182
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,360
Crispy outside, tender inside.

183
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,480
I considered your feedback
and made some adjustments.

184
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,160
Young man.

185
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,320
Try one.

186
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,520
I'm good, thanks.

187
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,600
Have a bite.

188
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,600
What would you like today?

189
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:18,840
Today, I want to treat my friend...

190
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,840
(Beijing Dumpling King)

191
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,480
Don't be fooled by the simple setup.

192
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,320
On this street,

193
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,000
very few places earn my approval.

194
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,720
This is one of them.

195
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,720
How does one earn your approval

196
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:44,680
without a bad review?

197
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,800
I don't hand out bad reviews
for no reason.

198
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Besides,

199
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,320
when I leave bad reviews,

200
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,880
I just hope this world

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,560
has more truth, kindness, and beauty

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,240
instead of fraud, evil, and ugliness.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,680
Welcome, Yi Ran.

204
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,280
Same as usual?

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,240
Two servings.

206
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,880
Got it!

207
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Stop playing around.

208
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,311
It'll get cold soon
and won't taste as good.

209
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,520
Look at this.

210
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,640
Some are big while some are small.

211
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,800
Some have torn wrappers.

212
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,160
Bad review.

213
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,680
These are handmade,

214
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,880
not machine-made.

215
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:32,622
Of course, they have different sizes.

216
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,000
A customer earlier

217
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
forgot their vinegar dish.

218
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,960
It's fine, sir.

219
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,360
Slow service.

220
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,720
Poor presentation.

221
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
Damaged tableware.

222
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,400
How did this place pass
your review system?

223
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:53,920
When it comes to food,

224
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,680
it all comes down
to fresh ingredients and great taste.

225
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,200
Service should be
thoughtful and sincere.

226
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,120
See?

227
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,422
The owner remembered
he had forgotten our vinegar dish.

228
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
That proves he's always thinking

229
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
about his customers.

230
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,680
Try it.

231
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,880
Convinced now?

232
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
Food is my life.

233
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,360
I never settle for less.

234
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,560
Actually,

235
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,840
you and I are kind of
in the same business.

236
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,040
How so?

237
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,960
My family used to run a homestay.

238
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
It was small,

239
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,760
but it was always packed.

240
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,480
Anyone who stayed there

241
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,360
would only choose our place after that.

242
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,080
And this plate

243
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,560
you just complained about

244
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,920
witnessed the peak of our business.

245
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,920
That was the first time
we hosted a tour group.

246
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,840
After we barely managed
to arrange the beds,

247
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,680
their meals became another challenge.

248
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,920
In the end, my dad just brought everyone

249
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,000
here to eat.

250
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,000
With so many people showing up at once,

251
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,120
the owner couldn't keep up.

252
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:16,711
Dishes weren't coming out fast enough.

253
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,760
The older folks got impatient.

254
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,240
So, they rolled up their sleeves

255
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,640
and started cooking themselves.

256
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:47,688
They made the meal themselves?

257
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:48,400
That's right.

258
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,880
Everyone cooked and ate together,

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
just like a big family.

260
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
It was really fun.

261
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,480
I joined in too.

262
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,560
This plate

263
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,400
was the one
I accidentally broke back then.

264
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,360
Luckily, only a part of it chipped off.

265
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:01,640
Because of this plate,

266
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,440
every time I eat here,

267
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm reminded of those happy times.

268
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,800
Why didn't you

269
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,880
keep it going?

270
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,240
Then, chain hotels started booming.

271
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,960
Many small inns couldn't survive.

272
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,680
It's all in the past.

273
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,680
Forget it.

274
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:24,400
Do you eat garlic?

275
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,160
No.

276
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,240
Just try one.

277
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,120
You talk too much.

278
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,400
Dumplings without garlic

279
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,320
is only half as good.

280
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,030
I'm not eating it.

281
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,320
- Sir, bring some garlic!
- No way!

282
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,600
- Eat it.
- No.

283
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:36,920
Eat.

284
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,622
- No.
- Eat it.

285
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:38,790
- No, I'll eat it...
- Eat it.

286
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,920
As you all know,

287
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,440
hotel kitchens

288
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,160
are usually not open to customers.

289
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,200
But we're willing to break the norm.

290
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,920
At select times and events,

291
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,440
such as your company's

292
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:09,577
anniversary or banquets,

293
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
we will invite
our chefs and pastry chefs

294
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,040
to prepare dishes in front of guests.

295
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,600
Considering that your company

296
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
also works
with international businesses,

297
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,200
we've also invited

298
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,600
chefs from Malaysia
and India to join us.

299
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
Most five-star hotels

300
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,120
rarely hire Indian chefs.

301
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,880
Indeed.

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,760
Our ultimate goal

303
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,440
is to create more interaction

304
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,800
and engagement between
the hotel and our guests.

305
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,800
Let's all try flipping some roti!

306
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:36,755
Just last year,

307
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,600
we expanded

308
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,200
our multi-purpose banquet hall.

309
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:40,600
It can now hold over 1,000 guests.

310
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,920
Let me show you around.

311
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,400
Great.

312
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,160
Alright.

313
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,000
What's wrong?

314
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,480
Did someone bully you?

315
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
No, I'm fine.

316
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,800
You're crying.
Something must be up.

317
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,360
I bought my mom

318
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,760
an expensive set

319
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,520
of skincare products online.

320
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
But after using it,

321
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,240
her face had
a really bad allergic reaction.

322
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,480
I went to confront the seller,

323
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,480
but they claimed
it wasn't their product's fault.

324
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,640
And they refused
to do anything about it.

325
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,080
Look at you,

326
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,733
you're so upset you can barely talk.

327
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm still just an intern.

328
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,920
I barely make any money.

329
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,440
And that skincare set was so expensive.

330
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,320
Alright.

331
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,080
I'll take care of this for you.

332
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,640
Did room 8808 look for you?

333
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,600
Nope.

334
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,920
Lu handled housekeeping there today.

335
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,120
I heard Boss
made a big move last night.

336
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,000
What big move? Spill the details.

337
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,440
You know what?

338
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,640
Last night, Boss...

339
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,840
Does she even understand anything?

340
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,480
Does she strike you
as someone artistic?

341
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,240
Don't be ungrateful.

342
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,400
We all heard.

343
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,800
She pleaded for you.

344
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,280
That's why Boss let you come back.

345
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,000
Whose side are you on?

346
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,280
It's Vincent who needs me.

347
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,040
Why don't you just take this chance
and marry him?

348
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,680
You've been drooling over Boss's looks

349
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,160
for who knows how long.

350
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,000
But in reality,

351
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,520
all you can do is keep drooling.

352
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,560
Laugh all you want.

353
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
Every hero is mocked

354
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
before they succeed.

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But seriously,

356
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,400
she leaves bad reviews,

357
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:49,920
yet she eats and stays here for free.

358
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:51,640
If it weren't for that top ranking,

359
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,600
why would Vincent waste time on her?

360
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,520
Where did you even hear that from?

361
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,600
Isn't it obvious?

362
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,360
Anyone can be

363
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,720
a professional sleeper.

364
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,640
Let me tell you something even funnier.

365
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,840
She almost ate a hand towel,
thinking it was cotton candy.

366
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,280
For real?

367
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,120
Seriously.

368
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,200
Where did you hear that?

369
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,200
I saw it myself.

370
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,360
Where did you see it?

371
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,320
Right over there.

372
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,688
The hand towel was sitting there.

373
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,840
I'm asking for your help.

374
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,160
You can refuse.

375
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,840
Ms. Yi,

376
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
you've helped me so much.

377
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,280
I haven't even had
the chance to thank you.

378
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,560
Helping you

379
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
would be my honor.

380
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,360
You said it yourself.

381
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm not forcing you.

382
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,720
Absolutely voluntary.

383
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,320
Then, let's begin.

384
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,480
Ms. Yi,

385
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,320
could I have a mirror?

386
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,120
I'd like to check.

387
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,520
No need to check.

388
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,760
Besides, I've got clumsy hands
and a slow brain.

389
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,400
No artistic talent whatsoever.

390
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,880
If you don't want to do it, forget it.

391
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,360
Ms. Yi,

392
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,400
I just...

393
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,360
I can't control my mouth sometimes.

394
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,760
I swear I meant no harm.

395
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,800
As long as you don't tell Mr. Xiao
what just happened,

396
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,600
I'll do whatever you ask.

397
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Then, hurry up.

398
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,560
It's fine.

399
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,880
Done.

400
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,200
Hey,

401
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
is this really going to work?

402
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,720
Just wait and see.

403
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,240
Can I take a look?

404
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,520
Never mind.

405
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,500
(Prone to allergies)

406
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,800
Thank you both.

407
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,800
That will be all.

408
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,440
Mr. Liu, about our contract,

409
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,760
can we move forward with it?

410
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
Mr. Xiao, you should be aware

411
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,160
that we previously worked
with Bright Platinum.

412
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,640
Though we're here
for an inspection today,

413
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,920
ultimately,

414
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,720
it'll be up to Mr. Lin Jr.

415
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,680
Mr. Lin Jr.?

416
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,840
Yes.

417
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:37,800
Headquarters has officially
appointed Mr. Lin Jr.

418
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,600
to take over our branch operations.

419
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,720
Thank you both
for your hospitality today.

420
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,800
Rest assured,

421
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,640
we will report our findings

422
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,880
to our superiors exactly as they are.

423
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,720
We appreciate you taking the time

424
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,920
to welcome us at Spring Sea.

425
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,360
We look forward to working
with your company.

426
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,360
Absolutely.

427
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,200
Of course.

428
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,480
This way.

429
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
Where did this "Mr. Lin Jr." come from?

430
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,680
They already know our advantages.

431
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,920
A new leader won't change anything.

432
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,080
After all, TY is a major client
we need to secure.

433
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,120
Boss.

434
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,080
Should we do something more?

435
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,840
Of course.

436
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:24,040
Come here.

437
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,040
Have Qiao Yu

438
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,133
make me some noodles.

439
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,120
Take your time, I'll wait.

440
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,240
Thank you.

441
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,440
Sorry,

442
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,760
but could you wait a moment?

443
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,280
He's just a janitor.

444
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,320
Why should I wait for him?

445
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,800
Hurry up, I have things to do.

446
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,520
He's coming right now.

447
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,040
He's an elder.
Just be a little understanding.

448
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,520
Come on, this is a hotel,

449
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,640
not public transport.

450
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,160
Why should I care about an old man?

451
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,520
Why you...

452
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,840
You all go ahead.
I'll take the service elevator.

453
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,040
You're so nosy.

454
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,577
If a manure truck passed by,
you'd probably taste it too.

455
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,200
Do you plan to live a short life?

456
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,160
Who are you cursing? Say that again!

457
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,680
If I weren't busy today,

458
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,840
I'd rip your mouth apart.

459
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,720
Just you wait!

460
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,440
Sorry about that.

461
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,760
Sorry for the trouble.

462
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,760
It's fine, sir.

463
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,560
Try this.

464
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,760
This little gadget

465
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,680
is pretty useful.

466
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,480
Alright.

467
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,080
Miss,

468
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
if it weren't for you,

469
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:11,440
I'd be stuck in the service elevator.

470
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:13,760
I never thought I'd get to ride
the guest elevator.

471
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,480
Thank you.

472
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,880
You're welcome. Take care.

473
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,720
Goodbye.

474
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
Don't stop me.
I want to intoxicate myself.

475
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
Who's stopping you?

476
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,200
But drinking water this way

477
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,800
won't solve anything.

478
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,800
I don't care!

479
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,960
I didn't expect this 8808

480
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,440
to be even worse than Boss.

481
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,720
If you want to talk about 8808, fine.

482
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,866
But don't bring up Boss.

483
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,520
Alright.

484
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,080
You should've kept your mouth shut.

485
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:52,360
A bottle or two should do it.

486
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,760
I just needed to vent.

487
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Stop crying. I'll drink with you.

488
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,480
Miss!

489
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,600
They actually refunded my money!

490
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,640
They should

491
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:08,177
if they want to stay in business.

492
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,200
Look.

493
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,360
Now, the seller is begging me

494
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,680
to delete my review.

495
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,520
You got your money back.

496
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,920
Deleting the review is up to you.

497
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,520
You're amazing.

498
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,360
That was impressive.

499
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,200
Thank you!

500
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,920
That's just how the world works.

501
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,720
The more of a pushover you are,

502
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,120
the more people will push you.

503
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,140
(Kangyi Nursing Home)

504
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,860
(Kindness and goodwill
bring warmth to life!)

505
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,480
Madam Qin?

506
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,360
Madam Qin?

507
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,680
Your granddaughter is here to see you.

508
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,080
Ran!

509
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,720
What are you doing here at this time?

510
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,840
No classes today?

511
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,360
You actually remembered me today.

512
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
Not bad.

513
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,880
Is it good?

514
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,640
Do you want to grow up

515
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,520
and work here with Mom someday?

516
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,520
Yes!

517
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,680
Good boy.

518
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,960
So?

519
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:02,760
Still the familiar taste.

520
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,200
Familiar taste

521
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,320
brings comfort and a sense of security.

522
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,840
You know,

523
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,840
over 300 million people in China

524
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
struggle with sleep disorders.

525
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,320
It's practically a modern epidemic.

526
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,040
Don't put too much stress on yourself.

527
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
When you feel anxious,

528
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,280
try to calm yourself down.

529
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,640
Think of something happy.

530
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,280
But lately,

531
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,480
nothing really makes me happy.

532
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Then, call a friend and talk to them.

533
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,160
Find a little joy.

534
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,880
After this,

535
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,880
I'll get you some vitamins
and supplements

536
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,720
to help with your nerves.

537
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,760
I'm really curious.

538
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,160
Why didn't you become a doctor?

539
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,440
Is there much of a difference?

540
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:40,640
Both professions use knives.

541
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,840
Both heal people.

542
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,840
So cold.

543
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,560
What did you just say to me?

544
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,400
Say it again.

545
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,840
Bed partner?

546
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,640
Bed tester.

547
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,240
It's totally different.

548
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,520
A tester?

549
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,880
You can make money from that?

550
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,120
Of course!

551
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,280
Times have changed.

552
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,760
Some people

553
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,000
just take a few deep breaths
and money rolls in.

554
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,440
Seriously?

555
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,640
I'm getting old.

556
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,520
Too old to keep up anymore.

557
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:37,520
What are you looking for?

558
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,440
The money I saved for you.

559
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,480
Don't tell your dad.

560
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,360
I'm plenty capable.

561
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,560
I don't need a little old lady
to support me.

562
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Check this out.

563
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,520
I remember it now.

564
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,360
I never forgot.

565
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,760
See?

566
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,240
Take it.

567
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,800
Here.

568
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,920
What can I even do with this little bit?

569
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,640
I don't want it.

570
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,040
Every little bit adds up.

571
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,840
No thanks.

572
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,320
Not good enough for you?

573
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:10,280
I don't want it.

574
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,480
- Take it.
- I don't want it.

575
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:11,911
No.

576
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,320
Take it.

577
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,560
Take it.

578
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,200
You have to take it!

579
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,280
(Yi Ran, hurry up!)

580
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,600
Hello.

581
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,920
Is this Ms. Yi Ran?

582
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,800
Yes, speaking.

583
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,680
We received your resume.

584
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,720
Hello.

585
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,640
Yes.

586
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,360
I'd like to apply for a position.

587
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:12,320
Do you have experience?

588
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
I can learn.

589
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,240
Apologies.

590
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,760
We require relevant experience.

591
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,400
Thank you.

592
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,600
(Life is full of contradictions.)

593
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,840
(Even when we let things
take their course,)

594
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,520
(deep down, it's often
just an expression of helplessness.)

595
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,600
(Living in this restless,)

596
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,480
(familiar yet distant city,)

597
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,400
(our greatest hope)

598
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,280
(might just be)

599
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
(that when we crave
a bowl of instant noodles,)

600
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,960
(someone is waiting
to welcome us with a smile.)

601
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,360
Do you have time for love?

602
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,460
Action.

603
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,560
What's wrong?

604
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,950
Did someone bully you?

605
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,370
Just wait and see.

606
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,710
Ran is here!

607
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,970
It's been a while!

608
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,420
Grandpa Guo!

609
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,360
Ran!

610
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,355
Well, you want me
to feel when I eat this

611
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,620
that it tastes a little good

612
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:02,110
or just don't feel anything...?

613
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,860
Action.

614
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,320
