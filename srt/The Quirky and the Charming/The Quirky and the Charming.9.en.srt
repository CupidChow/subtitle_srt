=Episode 9=

3
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,840
Cheers!

4
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,920
How is it?

5
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
It's just the two of us.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,480
We could've gone to a food stall.

7
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,850
Why come to a place like this
just to get ripped off?

8
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,160
It's an important occasion.

9
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,440
It deserves something special.

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,880
What's the occasion today?

11
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,560
I have something very important

12
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,440
to tell you.

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,760
Yi Ran.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,680
- Yi.
- I...

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,560
Hi.

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,680
Hey.

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,080
May I help you?

18
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,640
Is this wine any good?

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,920
It's not bad.

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,800
Good.

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,200
Good?

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,760
Good.

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
Can I have this?

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,960
OK.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,080
OK.

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,560
You made an international friend?

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,480
No.

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
He's a guest at our hotel.

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,080
David.

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,920
You said the wine wasn't good enough

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,640
and refused to sign a deal.

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,880
But you're still selling
the sample wines.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
Why?

34
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,920
Sorry, but our partnership is over.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,560
Please either pay for the wines
or return them to me.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,200
What are they talking about over there?

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,120
He's saying that this restaurant
is selling his sample wines,

38
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,680
but they don't want to sign a deal
or pay for them.

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,080
Isn't that robbery?

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,920
Business is business.

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,822
How much is this bottle of wine?

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,640
1,888 yuan.

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,960
Well, they're robbing me!

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,440
Get your phone out.

45
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:05,680
Please leave.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Please don't make a scene.

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,960
In that case, you should just pay up.

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
Miss, what does this have
to do with you?

49
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,240
Yi.

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,280
Of course it's my business.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,560
You're taking his free sample wine

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,000
and charging me 1,888 yuan for it.

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,440
Do you know what that is?

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,120
What is it?

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,480
Robbery! You're committing a crime!

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,240
Please stop talking nonsense.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,320
Fine. Pretend it's nonsense.

58
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll just make a call.

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,120
Please.

60
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,920
Don't do that.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Miss.

62
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,288
You don't have to escalate this.

63
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
How does this sound?

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,840
I'll comp your bill today, all right?

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,800
Let's drop this matter.

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
Comp the bill?

67
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,960
All right!

68
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,160
But it's not enough
to just comp my bill.

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,840
You have to comp the bill
for everyone here today!

70
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,659
Yes, I sold your sample wine.

71
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,044
But you gave it to me.
It's mine to do whatever I want with it!

72
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:04,560
Go ahead and sue me if you want!

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
Did you get all of that?

74
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,160
Tell him to delete that!

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,280
No.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
And I'm going to put this video online

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
and give you some free publicity.

78
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,360
I'll make some money off the traction.

79
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
Let's see if your restaurant

80
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,320
can stay open after that.

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
Give me back my wine!

82
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,340
=The Quirky and The Charming=

83
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,280
Front desk speaking.

84
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,822
The next room is knocking on the wall.

85
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:55,760
Do something about it!

86
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,760
You're saying someone in the next room
is banging on the wall?

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,080
Yes! In the middle of the night!

88
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,222
What's going on over there?

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,320
I'll send someone over right away.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,120
Housekeeping Department.

91
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,560
Listen to that!

92
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:13,000
All this banging
in the middle of the night!

93
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,200
How am I supposed to sleep?

94
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,000
Doesn't anyone have any manners anymore?

95
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,480
I'm so sorry.

96
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,880
Please stay in your room and rest.

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,960
I'll go speak to the guest right now.

98
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
No! Just make them leave!

99
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,160
Hello.

100
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,920
Room service.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,266
My apologies for disturbing you.

102
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,080
Hello.

103
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,000
Housekeeping Department, please respond.

104
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,160
Go ahead.

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,000
My system shows that 9032 is unoccupied.

106
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,222
No one's staying there.

107
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,520
Excuse me. I'm coming in.

108
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,560
Hey.

109
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,760
Are you all right?

110
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,560
I... I'm not sure either...

111
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,440
Last night, I...

112
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,320
Did you see it too?

113
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,240
No wonder Cui took a leave of absence.

114
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,320
He was on the night shift last night.

115
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,280
Did he see something creepy

116
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
and get scared out of his mind?

117
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,760
Cui took a leave yesterday?

118
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,720
This is bad.

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm on the night shift for him tonight.

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,480
What do I do?

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,720
Where are you going?

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,777
To request for time off!

123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,080
Cui and Xu Yuan saw it!

124
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
That girl's face

125
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,920
was pale as a sheet.

126
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,120
Her eyes were this big.

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
She had eye sockets, but no eyeballs.

128
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,000
And she made this strange noise

129
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,680
from her throat.

130
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,360
Like she was laughing and crying
at the same time.

131
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,000
What are you doing?

132
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,040
Get to work!

133
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,320
What's wrong?

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
Be careful these days.

135
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Why?

136
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,040
I heard that every night,

137
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,440
those things all come out

138
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,680
in swarms!

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh, dear!

140
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,200
We mean no harm...

141
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
That's so eerie.

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,720
Yes.

143
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,666
It gives me the creeps.

144
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:29,720
Let's just be careful.

145
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,880
Come here.

146
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
Our hotel is haunted.

147
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,488
Nonsense
There's no such thing as ghosts!

148
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:37,488
Believe it or not.

149
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,920
A lot of hotels are built
on old burial grounds.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,440
The land is cheap because it's haunted.

151
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,680
Take this.

152
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,180
You're always working the night shift.

153
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,760
Keep this with you for protection.

154
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
Haunted at Spring Sea?

155
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:51,640
You believe that kind of thing?

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,280
A lot of people have been saying

157
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,080
that you can hear
a little girl crying at night.

158
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,520
It's a detailed story, too.

159
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,400
They even say that place
used to be a burial ground.

160
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,200
Nonsense.

161
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:02,866
It used to be
old residential buildings.

162
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,180
There was no burial ground there.

163
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,720
I don't think it's ghosts.

164
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:07,120
Someone's probably up to no good.

165
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
Stop spreading these rumors.

166
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,800
It's bad luck.

167
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,600
Got it.

168
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,360
What should we do
with the flowers Mr. Xu sent?

169
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:15,933
Do whatever you think is best.

170
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,560
Wait.

171
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,880
Still have to post it on social media.

172
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,920
This wine has a bold aroma.

173
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,800
Notes of citrus, yuzu, and white peach.

174
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,880
Well-balanced body.

175
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,440
The tannins are a bit aggressive,

176
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,800
but very fine.

177
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,320
Smooth, with a lingering finish.

178
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
How many bottles do you have in stock?

179
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,120
2,000 cases. 12,000 bottles.

180
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
If our hotel signs a long-term contract,

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,240
can you give us a discount?

182
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,560
The price is negotiable,

183
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,822
but I have one condition.

184
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,120
What is it?

185
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,200
Can we sign a contract first?

186
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,350
Pleasure doing business with you.

187
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,200
Thank you.

188
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,200
Thank her.

189
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,720
She's the one who introduced us

190
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,800
to such a fine wine.

191
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
Thank you, Yi Ran.

192
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,240
You're welcome.

193
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,120
Cheers.

194
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,960
Yi Ran, I really have to thank you.

195
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,840
If it weren't for you,

196
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
our winery would close down.

197
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,800
Thank you.

198
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,960
You're welcome.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,560
Come back anytime.

200
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,680
China welcomes you.

201
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,480
I will.

202
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:52,244
Chinese people are more reserved
when expressing emotions.

203
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,960
She received your thoughts.

204
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,680
Yi Ran is a good woman.

205
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,440
Cherish her.

206
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,320
I will.

207
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,600
What were you two talking about?

208
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,360
He said you should study French

209
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,280
to better serve the guests.

210
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,200
I haven't even mastered English yet,

211
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,777
and now you want me to learn French too?

212
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,000
Is this a hotel or a school?

213
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,222
You made a good recommendation
this time.

214
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,680
I'll consider giving you a raise.

215
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,960
Really?

216
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,320
Yi Ran!

217
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,720
I...

218
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,800
Yi Ran!

219
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,755
Yi Ran, wait for me!

220
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,520
I've been hearing rumors

221
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,200
about ghosts in the hotel lately.

222
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,320
But I know you're all hotel staff

223
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,280
and adults.

224
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,560
I trust that you wouldn't
believe in superstitions.

225
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,440
If something like this happens again,

226
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,040
please handle it professionally

227
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,600
and actively work to fix the problem.

228
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
Let's avoid spreading rumors.

229
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,640
If anyone continues
to spread false information,

230
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,920
they can go pick up
their resignation letter from HR.

231
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,120
Xiao Mucheng?

232
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,000
What if he doesn't see it
if I leave it here?

233
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,160
What were you doing?

234
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,080
(The Overthinking Pig)

235
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,911
Borrowing a book.

236
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,720
The pig who's lost

237
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,400
and confused in life

238
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,520
is the main character of this book.

239
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,320
That book suits you perfectly.

240
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,160
I'm not as childish as you.

241
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:57,100
(Pain Relief Patch)

242
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,080
Mr. Lin, how can I help you?

243
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,200
Come in.

244
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
What?

245
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,360
I'm working.

246
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,488
Just tell me what you want.

247
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,880
I want to show you something.

248
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,040
Come in.

249
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,520
Please?

250
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,920
Why is this patch so itchy?

251
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:30,933
Did she give me this to mess with me?

252
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:31,700
(Pain Relief Patch)

253
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,800
Why are you here?

254
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,120
Boss, the Huanke banquet tonight
has been canceled.

255
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:48,520
Where's Yi Ran? Tell her to come see me.

256
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,440
Mr. Lin Jr.

257
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,920
requested her
to service him in his room.

258
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,920
I prepared all of this for you.

259
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,480
This steak looks good.

260
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:21,511
I had them prepare it just for you...

261
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,240
It's overcooked. It's too tough to eat.

262
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,120
I'll let the kitchen know.

263
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,400
What's this?

264
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,200
Well...

265
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,440
Try the cake.

266
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,040
I picked it out just for you.

267
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,400
It's a heart-shaped cake.

268
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,720
Here.

269
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,040
The cake is nice!

270
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
Yi Ran...

271
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,320
I...

272
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,880
Who is it?

273
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:19,555
I'm here to clear the table.

274
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,111
No need.

275
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:24,977
I didn't say you could come in!

276
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,040
It's not what you think.

277
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,560
Mr. Lin, Yi Ran is a hotel employee.

278
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,200
She only provides standard room service

279
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,022
and nothing else.

280
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,120
I hope that's clear.

281
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,520
I'm a guest here.

282
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,360
I have the right to choose

283
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
who serves me, don't I?

284
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,840
We are a professional hotel.

285
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:47,533
We don't provide named services.

286
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,444
Please don't waste
our hotel's resources.

287
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,800
What are you doing?

288
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,840
Helping you.

289
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,640
You...

290
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,120
I don't need your help!

291
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,160
I'm still here, you know?

292
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:05,177
We won't disturb
your rest any further, Mr. Lin.

293
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:06,600
Come with me.

294
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,080
We're leaving.

295
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
I wasn't finished!

296
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,900
(Staff Only)

297
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,480
I'm already stuck
cleaning the storage room,

298
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,800
and now you're dumping
inventory counting on me too?

299
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,400
You're taking it out on me personally.

300
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,440
Everyone in Housekeeping Department
is busy,

301
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,560
but you're having a party
in a guest's room.

302
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:46,155
So what if I give you some extra work?

303
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,440
Yes, I went to Lin Youjia's room.

304
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
But strictly speaking, I was working.

305
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,000
If you have a problem with that,

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,133
why don't you throw him out?

307
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,244
Don't take it out on me!

308
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,080
What was that?

309
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,000
It sounds like that crying noise
they were talking about.

310
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,600
Come on! Let's check it out!

311
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,777
You're not going anywhere!

312
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,955
No! I have to find out
what this mysterious entity is!

313
00:18:06,977 --> 00:18:08,288
Why? It's not your concern...

314
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Are you scared?

315
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:13,640
What do I have to be scared of?

316
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:16,180
If you're not scared, then come on!
Don't let it get away!

317
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,600
- Come on!
- Don't go!

318
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,680
Slow down. My back still hurts.

319
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,440
The sound definitely came
from here just now.

320
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:26,844
Why is it quiet all of a sudden?

321
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,280
Let's go back, then.

322
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,120
I think it's in here.

323
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,920
There's a door!

324
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,160
Don't open it.

325
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,933
I'll get someone
to check it out tomorrow.

326
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,880
Get up!

327
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,880
Who are you?

328
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
Why were you sleeping here?

329
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,760
Mr. Xiao.

330
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,400
I didn't mean to!

331
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,080
I'm at my wit's end!

332
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,560
You know me?

333
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,880
I used to be a security guard here.

334
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,680
I got fired last month

335
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,560
for sleeping on the job.

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,760
I couldn't find a new job,

337
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,560
so I've been crashing here.

338
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,080
I was just trying to sleep.

339
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,160
I... I didn't do anything else!

340
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,000
Case solved.

341
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,600
I knew

342
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,460
there was no such thing
as ghosts or monsters.

343
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,200
I never believed it either...

344
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Stop! Don't run!

345
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,560
See you!

346
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,520
Happy now?

347
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:06,666
Why are you still here?
Planning to sleep here tonight?

348
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,280
What?

349
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,400
Not scared anymore?

350
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,920
I was never scared.

351
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,080
Take your time, then.

352
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,840
I'll head out first.

353
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,240
Yi Ran!

354
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,555
Yi Ran! Wait for me!
Don't leave me alone!

355
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:26,888
We've verified everything.

356
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,160
The security guard

357
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,480
was fired last month

358
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,080
for repeatedly sleeping on the job.

359
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:33,600
The Engineering Department

360
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:34,755
has already installed a camera

361
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:35,844
at the warehouse entrance.

362
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,311
The Security Department

363
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:39,240
will also tighten control
over unused areas.

364
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,520
This incident was a major security risk.

365
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:43,288
If it hadn't been discovered in time,

366
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:44,820
the consequences could've been severe.

367
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:45,400
Yes, sir.

368
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,711
I'll emphasize this
to Security Department again.

369
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,320
Go on.

370
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:52,560
Also, there's the issue
with unoccupied reserved rooms.

371
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,480
This time, it was a tour group,

372
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
and we ended up
with significant financial losses.

373
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,640
Now the Sales Department is trying
to pass the blame around.

374
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
If this isn't resolved,

375
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,933
there will be more issues down the line.

376
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,680
That's definitely a problem.

377
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:07,440
I'll think about it.

378
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,440
If there's nothing else, I'll head out.

379
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,960
All right.

380
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,960
Yishu?

381
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,760
Do you have time tonight?

382
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,040
I have something important to tell you.

383
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,680
I thought he was calm and composed.

384
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,250
But one bouquet of flowers
was enough to make him lose his cool.

385
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,400
If I don't give you a little pressure,
you'll never make a move.

386
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,360
Ms. Ling, it's almost time
for your dinner

387
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,480
with Mr. Xu.

388
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:55,360
Find a reason to cancel it for me.

389
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:57,288
Come with me to pick out
a dress afterward.

390
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,280
All right.

391
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,840
Have a seat.

392
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,320
Mr. Xiao, get straight to the point.

393
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,280
I'm a busy woman.

394
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,720
I need you.

395
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,360
(So direct?)

396
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,080
(Is this a confession?)

397
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,880
Go ahead. I'm ready.

398
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,200
Great!

399
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,120
Then let's talk about
the proposal details.

400
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,760
You need a plan for this kind of thing?

401
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,160
You already know what I like.

402
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Just do as you see fit.

403
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,488
Why did you call me here so late?

404
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:14,600
Is there anyone else around?

405
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,320
If not, I'm starting.

406
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,760
Who are you talking to?

407
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,640
I just wanted to make sure

408
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:21,960
no one would interrupt us.

409
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,720
Is there actually a reason
you called me here?

410
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,960
But we still need to clarify

411
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,680
some specific details.

412
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,280
I'll be frank.

413
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,960
What do you think of me?

414
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:48,088
You're all right.

415
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,480
Just all right?

416
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm handsome, rich, in good shape,

417
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,440
loyal to my friends, funny,

418
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,320
and charming.

419
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,760
And all I get is an "all right"?

420
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,200
If you know yourself that well,

421
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
why ask me?

422
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,240
I guarantee

423
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,280
you'll make a profit.

424
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,520
What profit?

425
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,000
If we work together,

426
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,080
we can resolve the issue
of unoccupied bookings

427
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,840
at Bright Platinum and Spring Sea.

428
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,711
So this is what you meant
when you said you needed me?

429
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,880
So you weren't...

430
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,200
Weren't what?

431
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,800
Fine. Xiao Mucheng.

432
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,600
You win this round.

433
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,360
So you don't have any feelings
for me at all?

434
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,560
I do.

435
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,160
Right now, I feel like giving you

436
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,760
a full combo punch.

437
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,760
I like you.

438
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,120
Are you done?

439
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,160
I said

440
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,760
I like you.

441
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,880
I know.

442
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,960
I don't think
this is how it's supposed to go.

443
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,480
Shouldn't you be a little excited,

444
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,560
touched, or at least flustered?

445
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,160
Even just a little bit of heart racing?

446
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,480
Not even the slightest bit.

447
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,160
I've known you liked me since I was six.

448
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,520
I just didn't think
you'd hold on for this long.

449
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,800
So, are you touched now?

450
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,000
Don't you dare!

451
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,840
I've always seen you as a brother.

452
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,200
You...

453
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
If you cross that line, we're through!

454
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:02,311
Looks like tonight wasn't the right time
for a confession.

455
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:03,844
If I can't even get you to say yes,

456
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,160
there's no way she will.

457
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,320
What do you mean?

458
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,000
So you were messing with me too?

459
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,400
I wasn't messing with you.

460
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,080
I was just practicing.

461
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,920
But you were pretty confident just now.

462
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,733
It was attractive.

463
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,280
Lin Youjia.

464
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,240
If I can't swear right now,

465
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,120
I have nothing to say to you.

466
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,800
Go back and get some rest, then.

467
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,311
So you really aren't going to tell me
who she is?

468
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,720
I can give you some advice.

469
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,800
Xiao Mucheng,
how dare you make a fool of me!

470
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,400
Just you wait!

471
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,888
I'll get back at you for this one!

472
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,040
I can't believe him!

473
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:08,440
(You can hear
a little girl crying at night.)

474
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,400
They even say that place
used to be a burial ground.

475
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,200
Miss, your earring.

476
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,440
Tell me! Do I know her?

477
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,533
Do you have a photo of her?

478
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,280
Ling Yishu?

479
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,560
Is that her?

480
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,440
She's a fast runner.

481
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:49,760
Why are you still standing here?

482
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,080
Go after her

483
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,422
before you miss your chance!

484
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,560
Go!

485
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,960
If she says no, just push harder!

486
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,760
If she calls the police,
I'll bail you out!

487
00:28:59,320 --> 00:28:59,840
Go!

488
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,400
Little girl,

489
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,680
what are you doing here so late?

490
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,120
Did someone bully you?

491
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,520
I'm waiting for my mom.

492
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,840
Why not wait in your room?

493
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
I'm scared to be alone.

494
00:30:30,644 --> 00:30:31,600
Don't be scared.

495
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,360
Stick with me from now on.

496
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,480
Pick anything you like.

497
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,320
It's on me.

498
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,520
It's all right.

499
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
You're my friend now.

500
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,044
Pick whatever you like!

501
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,680
Black forest?

502
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,360
Tiramisu?

503
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,520
Mango mousse?

504
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,080
Great choice.

505
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,520
The most expensive one.

506
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,244
One slice of the mango mousse cake.

507
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:06,520
All right. A moment, please.

508
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,680
Wait.

509
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,000
Do we get employee discounts?

510
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,560
That day,
I cut my hand with a fruit knife.

511
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,280
I wanted to ask that lady
to press the elevator button for me,

512
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,320
but for some reason,

513
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,200
she ran away the moment she saw me.

514
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,960
So all this fuss

515
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
was because

516
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,360
you were the little "ghost"
making all those noises.

517
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,720
Do you know this?

518
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,600
Because of you,

519
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,480
two people from the Housekeeping
Department have taken sick leave!

520
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,180
Your mom shouldn't be bringing you out

521
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,840
when she's this busy.

522
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,200
Where's your dad?

523
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,800
They're divorced.

524
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,560
That's OK.

525
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,760
I'm just like you.

526
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,160
It's not a big deal.

527
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,640
Here.

528
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,120
Your mango mousse cake.

529
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,040
Eat up!

530
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,880
I've never had a mango cake before.

531
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,360
Well, it's your lucky day!

532
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,000
Eat up!

533
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,960
Is it good?

534
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,960
Eat.

535
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Slow down.
No one's going to take it from you.

536
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,400
Little girl?

537
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,040
Are you all right?

538
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,560
Yes?

539
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,920
Boss, it's an emergency!

540
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,400
Niu!

541
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
What's wrong with you?

542
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,920
What happened to you?

543
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,240
Don't worry! Mommy's here!

544
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,600
Hurry!

545
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,880
If anything happens to my daughter,

546
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,480
I won't forgive you!

547
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,960
Niu!

548
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,520
Don't worry, Niu. I'm here.

549
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,240
Take me to the hospital too.

550
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,800
I'll take responsibility for this.

551
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,760
How?

552
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,120
This is why we have rules.

553
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,360
Rules are meant to be followed.

554
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,800
I'm sorry.

555
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,640
I didn't know
she was allergic to mangoes.

556
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,840
I'll take care of this.

557
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,100
Action!

558
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,100
I've never...

559
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:11,822
You know what? Her makeup artist,
