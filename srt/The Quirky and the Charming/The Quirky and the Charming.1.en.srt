00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 1=

3
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,511
Are you done touching me?

4
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,800
Free love balloons
if you purchase our chocolates.

5
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:23,422
(30 hours ago)
Free love balloons

6
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:25,111
(30 hours ago)
if you purchase our chocolates.

7
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,360
Free love balloons
if you purchase our chocolates.

8
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,000
Check out our Valentine's Day program.

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,880
Thank you.

10
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,000
Free love balloons
if you purchase our chocolates.

11
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:41,040
(Nutritious meals three times a day
keep you healthy every day.)

12
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
Free love balloons
if you purchase our chocolates.

13
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:45,555
Free balloons
if I purchased your chocolates, right?

14
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,240
Thank you.

15
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,820
(I want to be with you.)

16
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,820
(Jiang Chen)

17
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,420
(Are you free today?)

18
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,860
(I'm working overtime.)

19
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,320
But today's Valentine's Day.

20
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,600
Yi Ran, come and arrange the goods.

21
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,560
Coming.

22
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,140
(Production Date, 12th November 2023)

23
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,400
Sir,

24
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,880
I don't think you should do this.

25
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:48,040
(Production Date, 16th November 2023)
They have expired.

26
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,088
How could you sell them?

27
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,880
So what if they're expired?

28
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:54,111
You still take them home
and eat them every day.

29
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,680
It's not like you fell sick.

30
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,520
I didn't take them home for nothing.

31
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:59,440
You said it was a benefit
for your employees.

32
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,560
Besides,

33
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:02,711
if I do fall sick,
I'll bear responsibility for it.

34
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,560
You might be punished
by the heavens...

35
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:11,320
You'll have a stomach ache
if you have this.

36
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,120
Take this.

37
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,360
I want the sweet one.

38
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,160
The sweet one?

39
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,280
Your teeth will rot if you have that.

40
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,120
What are you doing?

41
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
It wasn't me.

42
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,040
That boy was being unreasonable.

43
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,760
You...

44
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,920
You're the unreasonable one here.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
What's wrong with...

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
Tell me. Who was it?

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,240
Right there!

48
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,960
Shameless fool!
How dare you bully my boy?

49
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,560
I'll never buy stuff from you again!

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,755
What a shady shop!
Your business will definitely fail!

51
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:50,066
I...

52
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,066
Come! Son, let's go home!

53
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:51,600
Wait...

54
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,760
Yi Ran!

55
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
My shop has no place

56
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,400
for someone as important as you. Leave!

57
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,120
Fine. I quit.

58
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
Settle my salary for this month.

59
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,019
Consider yourself lucky
that I'm not demanding compensation.

60
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,355
You still dare to ask me for it?

61
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:09,720
Did I hear you wrongly?

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Our society is ruled by law now.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,840
Do you understand what that means?

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
Since we didn't sign a contract,

65
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:18,440
there's no labor relationship
between us.

66
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Hurry and leave!

67
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,280
I bought a lunch box here two days ago.

68
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,480
I had a stomach ache after finishing it.

69
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,320
I sent it for a test.

70
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,200
This is the test report.

71
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,840
The total bacterial count
had exceeded the limit significantly.

72
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,560
And,

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,533
the CCTVs in the shop had filmed you

74
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:41,080
changing all the labels in secret.

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,920
I wonder who I can report this to.

76
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,044
You want to extort money from me, huh?

77
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:49,244
You said you would bear
responsibility for it yourself.

78
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:50,400
I paid for the lunch box.

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,520
Besides,

80
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,480
there's no labor relationship
between us.

81
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:54,930
I don't bear responsibility for it.

82
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:55,266
You!

83
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,200
What's wrong?

84
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,222
I'll send a copy of this
to the Health Bureau,

85
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:01,880
the Market Supervision Administration,
and the Urban Management Bureau later.

86
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,200
Guess how much you'll be fined?

87
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,880
You!

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,680
You...

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
Fine. You win.

90
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:15,000
(You've received 3,000 yuan
from Convenience store.)

91
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:18,200
Why is it only 3,000 yuan?

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,240
I deducted the meals
you took from my shop.

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,480
I've already paid you extra.

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,080
But all of them were expired.

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Who said expired ones don't cost money?

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,222
(Free love balloons
if you purchase our chocolates!)

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,120
Yi Ran!

98
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,120
(My name is Yi Ran.)

99
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,680
(I'm a stubborn failure.)

100
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,000
(I spent almost half of my life)

101
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,960
(fighting against life.)

102
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,044
(But I ended up
getting beaten by it all the time.)

103
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
(Life can hit me hard,)

104
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,560
(but it can't take away
my right to fight against it.)

105
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:05,920
(Giving it a negative review
is the way I live.)

106
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,400
(Perhaps you'll say
that I like to argue over details.)

107
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
(If so, I'll provide it
with a sense of ceremony.)

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
(After all, you only live once.)

109
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,080
(If you don't defend it,
it will cease to exist.)

110
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,700
=The Quirky and The Charming=

111
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,340
(Spring Sea Resort Hotel)

112
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,640
Today is my first day here.

113
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,360
I'll give a longer speech than usual.

114
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
You see,

115
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,320
I prioritize mutual respect the most.

116
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,560
In the future, I hope that we can...

117
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:04,511
Where are you guys going?

118
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:09,949
Just the head of the Housekeeping
Department. What's with the disrespect?

119
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,120
What's the deal with Mrs. Liu?

120
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:12,440
Mrs. Liu said she found stains

121
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,320
on the shower head
when she was taking a bath.

122
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,059
We said we would
change her room for her,

123
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,240
but she still wasn't satisfied.

124
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,155
She didn't let us off.

125
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:20,560
We couldn't do anything about her.

126
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,040
Mrs. Liu is hard to serve.

127
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:23,533
Even you guys can't deal with her.

128
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:24,480
Is there anything else?

129
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:27,040
Yes. After the guests at Room 503
checked out of their rooms,

130
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,879
a bathrobe and two cloth hangers
went missing.

131
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,844
Have you contacted them?

132
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,079
Yes, but they didn't pick up.

133
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,240
We've recorded the occurrence.

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,466
Mr. Chen wants to check out
of his room in two days.

135
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:36,709
But the button that fell off his suit
in the laundry room

136
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,620
has not been found.

137
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,400
Boss.

138
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,840
Regarding Mrs. Liu...

139
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:47,160
Have you gained weight recently?

140
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,800
Who said so?

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Boss,

142
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:53,755
Chairman Liu is the new chairman
of the Cuisine Association.

143
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,400
If we offend his wife,

144
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,355
I'm worried about
the zero negative review...

145
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,480
You should lose some weight.

146
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,280
Your image is the same
as the hotel's image.

147
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,440
Boss,

148
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,040
today's Valentine's Day, you know?

149
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,466
What has that got to do with you?

150
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:08,977
Let's go boxing tonight.

151
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,280
Again?

152
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,880
Vincent, you're finally here.

153
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,244
Take a look at the shower head yourself.

154
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,120
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
I've always trusted your hotel.

156
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,440
I never expected it
to be this unhygienic.

157
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,640
I even took a shower with it.

158
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,000
Who knows if I'll get infected

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
by the germs or viruses?

160
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,480
The thought of it makes my body itch.

161
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,160
You have to give me an account.

162
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,760
Our water purification system
is imported from Germany.

163
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,680
It meets the standard
for high-quality water.

164
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,800
Please rest assured.

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,880
If so...

166
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,040
What about the stains?

167
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
As for this,

168
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,800
these aren't stains.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,920
It's just that the metal
is slightly discolored.

170
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,760
You know this too.

171
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,200
Spring Sea is a hotel
that has operated for over 20 years.

172
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,560
Just like humans,

173
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,360
it's more captivating
when it's seasoned and experienced.

174
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,520
Don't you agree?

175
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,720
You do have a point.

176
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,360
Over here, please.

177
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,160
It's our negligence to allow
an esteemed guest

178
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,360
to experience such discomfort.

179
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,880
By the way,

180
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,760
we're holding

181
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,630
a room upgrade promotion
for Valentine's Day.

182
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,760
We've already selected

183
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,240
the most luxurious ocean-view suite
with the best view for you.

184
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,840
This is a free upgrade from us.

185
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,840
Vincent, you're too courteous.

186
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
It's not that I want a room upgrade...

187
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,960
Our mission at Spring Sea

188
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,240
is to provide
the perfect service to our guests.

189
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,280
Moreover,

190
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,280
you're our VIP.

191
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,760
By the way, our head chef

192
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,720
has been trying out
some new recipes lately.

193
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,160
I heard that you were
an expert in cuisines.

194
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,880
Would you be willing to help us

195
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,888
with a tasting session
if it's convenient for you?

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,120
It's my honor.

197
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,920
Alright.

198
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,980
I'll contact you after
making the arrangements, then.

199
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
If there's nothing else,

200
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:24,444
we shall not bother you any longer.

201
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,240
Boss.

202
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
Are you okay?

203
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,880
Cut to the chase.

204
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,200
I have bad news.

205
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,200
The button for Mr. Chen's suit

206
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:03,533
belongs to a new model
Shop B introduced this year.

207
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,080
We don't have something like that.

208
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
What's the solution?

209
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,160
This is the list

210
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
of factories that can process this deal.

211
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,600
I've contacted them.

212
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:15,640
At the fastest rate,
molding and production

213
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
will take seven days.

214
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,911
Mr. Chen is checking out in two days.

215
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,777
Do you expect him
to wait for seven days?

216
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,280
Boss.

217
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,920
Stop putting me on the spot here.

218
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,120
Do you have a solution?

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,760
A friend recommended
a boutique shop to me.

220
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:32,360
They said they found the same button.

221
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,150
Go and retrieve it
once the meeting is over.

222
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,120
Me?

223
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,240
I went boxing with you last night.

224
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,888
I only slept for three hours, you know?

225
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,120
Not everyone is like you.

226
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,680
I need sleep, you know?

227
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,880
Alright, then.

228
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,760
Go back and rest after the meeting.

229
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:49,280
What about the button, then?

230
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:51,360
There have already been
many issues before this.

231
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,777
Nothing else must go wrong again.

232
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,550
I'll retrieve it myself
after the meeting.

233
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,320
Why did you do that?

234
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,880
So, by working overtime,

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,511
you meant you were together with her?

236
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,440
Don't do this.

237
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,040
You're still defending this vixen?

238
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,920
That's not it. I...

239
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,960
I've truly overestimated you.

240
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:26,840
I thought you were a human.

241
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,510
I never expected you
to be worse than a dog.

242
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,044
You follow everyone with your leash on.

243
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,355
Who are you calling a dog here?

244
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,720
Just take it as my fault.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
There's nothing to apologize about.

246
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,640
I don't plan on forgiving you anyway.

247
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,960
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

248
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,120
You scum.

249
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,120
You scum.

250
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,200
That scum!

251
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,320
He was lucky
that it was only two cups of water!

252
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,280
You're right.

253
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,840
I should've castrated him.

254
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:11,288
You don't need to go that far.

255
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
Think of it like this.

256
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,760
The heavens are on your side.

257
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,960
At least you're leaving a scum like him.

258
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,880
Maybe a better man
is already waiting for you.

259
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,520
If the headwind understands my heart,

260
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:27,680
I'm willing to sacrifice
the life of my ex

261
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,520
for the prosperity of everyone.

262
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:33,280
Let's drop the topic.
Where's the button?

263
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,840
It looks the same indeed.

264
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
Yi Ran, you're amazing.

265
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:53,355
They don't call me
All-Rounder for nothing, you know?

266
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,066
Let me give you something nice.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,760
Open it.

268
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,440
A room card?

269
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,360
That's a room card
for a five-star hotel room.

270
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,360
I'll be honest with you.

271
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,200
This is a birthday gift for you.

272
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Before this, you told me

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,239
that you wanted to open
a small hotel like your father

274
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,080
and make profits
without doing any work, right?

275
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,240
As your bosom friend,

276
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm giving you a chance to enjoy

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,160
the most luxurious five-star hotel
in the city.

278
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,920
May you achieve your dream soon.

279
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,800
I changed my dream long ago.

280
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,560
I'll wait for you to...

281
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,160
Hurry and fill your cup.

282
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,520
I'll wait for you to strike it rich
and support me.

283
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,280
All the more
should your dream come true.

284
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Hello?

285
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,040
Boss?

286
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,960
Yes.

287
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,360
I've retrieved the button.

288
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:00,155
Shall I have it delivered to you
via express delivery service?

289
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,240
I'm at the roadside stall
at Wenxing Road.

290
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,240
Alright.

291
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,760
I'll send you my location.

292
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,800
See you later.

293
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,920
Who's that?

294
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,600
The buyer of the button.

295
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,440
He said he wanted
to retrieve it himself.

296
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
The above is the summary report
of the Valentine's Day event.

297
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,440
Overall, it's quite successful.

298
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,160
The occupancy rate has increased by 15%

299
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,800
compared to the same period last year.

300
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,360
(Performance Data and Analysis)

301
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,320
I'll cut it short.

302
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,160
For this year's Valentine's Day event,

303
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,120
I plan to extend it to one week.

304
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
We can call it Valentine's Week.

305
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,240
During this period,

306
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,480
successfully matched couples

307
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,760
can enjoy a 50% discount

308
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,040
on our VIP suite stay.

309
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,680
At the same time, they can also

310
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:43,422
enjoy the romantic candlelit
couple's dinner

311
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,160
prepared by the head chef himself.

312
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,840
Alright.

313
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,410
I'll request Planning Department
to come up with a new proposal.

314
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,355
Each lounge area
in the Housekeeping Department

315
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,555
should have
a dedicated emergency rose box.

316
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,960
I like that idea.

317
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,720
(Smash the glass
if you encounter the love of your life.)

318
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,240
Each of the crew

319
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,440
has to carry a rose with them
at all times

320
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:06,400
so that the guests
won't run out of roses.

321
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,160
We have to flood
every corner of the hotel

322
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,960
with romance.

323
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Does anyone have any objections?

324
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,000
Since there are no objections,

325
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,180
I'll make a move first
since I have something to do.

326
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,320
Alright. Meeting dismissed.

327
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,600
What's with the head
of the Housekeeping Department?

328
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,422
Does he think his father owns the hotel?

329
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:32,888
He has no respect for me at all.

330
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,280
I can see why you're
in the HR Department.

331
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,133
You're pretty good at judging people.

332
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:46,044
Is his father truly
the owner of the hotel?

333
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,560
That's not even a secret.

334
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:50,750
All of the experienced
employees here know about it.

335
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,400
It's almost time.

336
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,280
Why isn't he here yet?

337
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:05,066
Do you have a live stream to do tonight?

338
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,240
Yeah.

339
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,600
I've already promised my fans.

340
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:08,666
I can't afford to be late.

341
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,533
Why don't you leave first?
I'll wait for him.

342
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,960
Really?

343
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,880
I'll leave it to you, then.

344
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,040
Don't worry. I'll accomplish the task.

345
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,880
Go now.
Don't make your fans wait for you.

346
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,880
My good friend,

347
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,440
you're the best.

348
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,800
Try it.

349
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,480
Be careful. It's hot.

350
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,480
Pan Yiyi?

351
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,920
Pan Yiyi?

352
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Come out.

353
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,320
Pan Yiyi left in advance
because she was busy.

354
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Look at the time.

355
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,440
Why are you only here now?

356
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,888
Where's the item I requested?

357
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:23,000
Are you done confirming it?

358
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:25,200
Payment settled, goods delivered.

359
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,400
Thanks for your purchase
at Pan Yiyi's boutique.

360
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,600
Is there a restroom nearby?

361
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,360
Not here. There's no light.

362
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,390
Let's find somewhere else.

363
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,000
Why don't I find a bush for you?

364
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,680
Wait for me at the entrance.
Don't leave me.

365
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,520
Just hurry up.

366
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,240
Don't leave.

367
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,266
You're not allowed to leave.

368
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,760
Wait for me at the entrance!

369
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:39,760
Are you still there?

370
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,240
Have you left?

371
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,680
Are you there?

372
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,888
You didn't keep your promise.

373
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,640
It's not that I don't want
to keep you company.

374
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm just too busy with work.

375
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,577
(I want to go shopping,
play the claw machine...)

376
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:04,888
Can you grow up for once?

377
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,240
Fine. It's my fault, okay?

378
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:09,360
Of course I missed you.

379
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,320
I swear.

380
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't have an affair...

381
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,920
What a scum.

382
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,700
(Jiang Chen)

383
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:21,622
(Delete)
Scum.

384
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,000
(Delete contact)
Don't let me see you again. Go to hell.

385
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,560
Mr. Xiao.

386
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,600
What is this?

387
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:47,520
Don't ask questions.

388
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:48,400
Hand this to Ms. Man.

389
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,590
Tell her to sanitize it
before handing it to the guest.

390
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,560
Hello, miss.

391
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,720
Do you need any help?

392
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,240
It's fine. I live here.

393
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,120
Alright.

394
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,360
That untrustworthy woman.

395
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:46,120
Someone must be cursing me.

396
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,866
(Mini-Bar Charge Notice)

397
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,600
This is the life.

398
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,600
Hello?

399
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,560
Mr. Xiao.

400
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,360
Someone complained about the noise
Room 8020 is making.

401
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,000
They said someone was screaming.

402
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,400
Tell Ms. Man to deal with it.

403
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,920
Ms. Man is fixing the suit.

404
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,120
I'll go, then.

405
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,880
Alright.

406
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,960
Who's there?

407
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:45,320
Hello. I'm the head
of the Housekeeping Department.

408
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:46,439
Sorry for the interruption.

409
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,360
I'm in a bad mood. Stop bothering me.

410
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:52,320
Hello. I'm the head
of the Housekeeping Department.

411
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:53,511
Sorry for the interruption.

412
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,240
What are you doing here?

413
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:03,480
That's right.

414
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,040
What am I doing here?

415
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,120
Dear guest, one of our guests
complained about you.

416
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,311
They said you were too loud.

417
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:12,355
Please keep it down.

418
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:16,440
What are you doing?

419
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,440
She's a guest.

420
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,520
Calm down.

421
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,560
Don't leave.

422
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,960
Don't leave.

423
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,920
What are you doing?

424
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,840
You...

425
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,040
I bought this necktie for you!

426
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,240
Remove it!

427
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,480
Take it off!

428
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,800
Hey, you!

429
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,200
Hey, you!

430
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,040
Jiang Chen, you scum!

431
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,040
Boss?

432
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,600
Boss.

433
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,480
Boss...

434
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,600
Boss?

435
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,160
Strange.

436
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,760
Where is he?

437
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:09,240
Are you done touching?

438
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,480
It's you?

439
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:17,720
What are you doing here?

440
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,760
Let's have a chat.

441
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,600
About what?

442
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,440
Don't tell me you...

443
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,440
Since you're one of our guests,

444
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,720
I have to explain this to you.

445
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,111
Yesterday, someone complained

446
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,840
that you were too noisy.

447
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:43,480
That's why I came here to check on you.

448
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,200
But you fell into my arms

449
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,760
after opening the door.

450
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,200
The hotel's CCTV has recorded
the interaction.

451
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,600
I dragged you to your bed
out of kindness.

452
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,600
However, you assaulted me
with a glass bottle,

453
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:55,000
causing me to faint.

454
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,960
Regarding that,

455
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,000
the injury on my head is the best proof.

456
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,120
Do you remember now?

457
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:09,480
What kind of expression was that?

458
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,320
What do you mean?

459
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,200
Get out!

460
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,200
Right now!

461
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,840
Hello, miss.

462
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,960
What do you need?

463
00:30:33,977 --> 00:30:34,800
I want to check out.

464
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:35,955
Alright. Please wait.

465
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,240
Miss.

466
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,240
The computer shows

467
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,920
that your room was paid for.

468
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,480
But there's an extra fee of 600 yuan.

469
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,480
What extra charge?

470
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,880
It's the amount you spent
on the beverages in the room.

471
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,320
Do they cost money?

472
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,920
No one gave me a reminder.

473
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,280
The notice is on the table.

474
00:30:58,377 --> 00:30:59,420
(Mini-Bar Charge Notice)

475
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,280
But,

476
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,280
it was only a few bottles of alcohol.

477
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,200
Don't you think 600 yuan is too much?

478
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:09,920
Can I get a discount?

479
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,720
Miss, I'm sorry.

480
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
This is a five-star hotel.

481
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,280
We don't have such a rule.

482
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,960
Good afternoon, Mr. Jiang.

483
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,720
Miss, excuse me.

484
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:24,422
There are other guests
waiting behind you. Why don't you...

485
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:28,800
I'll pay with my card.

486
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,800
Alright. Please wait a moment.

487
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,000
Alright, miss.

488
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,360
Boss, where did you go?

489
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,800
Mr. Xu was online long ago.

490
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,440
I overslept.

491
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:55,920
What?

492
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,120
Did you sleep on a bed?

493
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,280
Did you say you overslept?

494
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,760
Something's off.

495
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,400
There's no bed in your house.

496
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,000
Where did you spend the night?

497
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,000
Must I report my daily schedule

498
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,520
to you?

499
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,000
No need for that.

500
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,920
Actually, you can.

501
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,240
It's rare that you're late.

502
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,480
Something cropped up.
But I've dealt with it.

503
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
I heard that the event
was pretty successful.

504
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:29,480
You've maintained
an almost year-long record

505
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,520
of zero negative reviews.

506
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,600
Seems like you have hopes of

507
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,879
coming in first place this year.

508
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,000
What other instructions
does Chairman have for me?

509
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,640
Vincent, you should know your father
has his bitter reasons for doing so.

510
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,800
As for the board...

511
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,000
Please tell Chairman

512
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,777
that I'll definitely
come in first place.

513
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,320
I hope that he can keep his promise

514
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:47,377
and change his plan
of relinquishing Spring Sea.

515
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,800
Why is she living at a five-star hotel
when she's that poor?

516
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:58,440
It's like we're killing her
by charging her a few hundred yuan.

517
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Enough already.

518
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:02,311
You'll behave the same
if you incur the same fee.

519
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,080
Don't insult people like this.

520
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:06,640
Leave some wiggle room for yourself.

521
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,000
For what?

522
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,320
A poor person like her

523
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,160
would never live here again anyway.

524
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,560
Hello.

525
00:33:17,044 --> 00:33:18,422
Please don't misunderstand me.

526
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:19,560
I wasn't referring to you.

527
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,040
The supermarket near my house

528
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,880
sells chicken drumsticks
for 10 yuan per 500g.

529
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,840
Vegetables cost around two to five yuan.

530
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,160
Even premium rice is only
a bit more than 8 yuan per 500g.

531
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,440
With 600 yuan,

532
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,000
I can buy 30kg of meat,

533
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:37,920
and more than 50kg
of rice and vegetables.

534
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,220
That's enough to cover
most of a regular family's expenses

535
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:41,088
for over half a month.

536
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,720
Street cleaners

537
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,080
begin their work
as early as 4 or 5 in the morning.

538
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,920
Many workers can't even make 600 yuan

539
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,840
in a week.

540
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,760
For rich people like you all,

541
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,320
I suppose you won't even care

542
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,840
if you see 600 yuan on the ground.

543
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,280
That's not what I mean.

544
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
One star for service,

545
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,560
one star for living experience,

546
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
one star for management,

547
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:04,760
one star for facilities,

548
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,240
and one star for overall experience.

549
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,320
That's what you mean
by a five-star hotel, huh?

550
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,480
Five-star hotel, my foot.

551
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,360
I'll give you
a negative five-star review.

552
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,920
You!

553
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,240
Jiang Chen, you scum!

554
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,320
I mustn't drink that much again.

555
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,840
(I'll prove that it's Spring Sea.)

556
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:07,729
(I'll check out right now.)

557
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,733
(Insulted after paying them.)

558
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,180
(Five-Star Negative Review)

559
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,180
(Five-star hotel with such employees?)

560
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,380
(I was lucky that I was poor.)

561
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,822
(I'll visit it next time "for sure".)

562
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,840
(This is life.)

563
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,400
(Each corner)

564
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,920
(and each moment)

565
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,960
(are filled with baffling surprises.)

566
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,320
(You don't know what will happen next.)

567
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,800
(You might strike the lottery.)

568
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,920
(Who knows)

569
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:41,480
(what will happen next?)

570
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:47,960
Ms. Ling.

571
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,640
Speak.

572
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:50,720
Someone gave Spring Sea
a negative review online.

573
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,911
She even published a post.

574
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,840
It has sparked some minor interest.

575
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,320
This is a rare chance.

576
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,960
We should help Vincent

577
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,200
promote the hotel

578
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,520
so that more people

579
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,430
will hear about
the way they treat their guests.

580
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,120
Understood.

581
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,450
Action!

582
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,290
Watch it for me.

583
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,780
Okay.

584
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,900
Right hand, up!

585
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,540
Forward!

586
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,147
To the right.

587
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:20,970
A bit lower.

588
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,870
What?

589
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,920
Filming the shadows.

590
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,740
Is there a toilet nearby?

591
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,540
It's only fun if it's live.

592
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,860
It's no fun with a phone's camera.

593
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,690
I'm filming it.

594
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,410
The splashes will be everywhere.

595
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,090
Cut.

596
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,750
Okay. Halt it.

597
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,800
