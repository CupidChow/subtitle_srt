2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,680
Madam, another!

4
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:48,560
Coming right up!

5
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,079
I know you're in a bad mood,

6
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,370
but eating like this
will cause you internal injuries.

7
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,080
I'm fine. Perfectly fine.

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Well, I'm not.

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,440
It reeks!

10
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:07,200
You've been like this
since you were a kid.

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,680
Stress eating whenever you're upset.

12
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:10,380
It's just a professional sleeper job.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,520
Let it go.

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,880
If you need a new job,

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
I can get you one.

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,840
It's not about the job.

17
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,200
This was the closest
I've ever been to my dream.

18
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,320
Over the years,

19
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,360
I've done all kinds of jobs,

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,720
but this was my first time

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,800
working in a hotel.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
Have you ever felt that before?

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,680
When a once unreachable dream

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,760
starts shining right in front of you...

25
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:41,990
The moment you get close to it,

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,440
it feels like a jolt
straight to your head.

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
Did your dream get electrocuted?

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,840
You're right.

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,000
It was too good to be true.

30
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,888
What are you doing?

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,320
I'm...

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,960
touching the halo.

33
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,440
What halo?

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
Dreams don't shine on their own.

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,640
The one shining is you,

36
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:21,880
because you're chasing your dream.

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,560
Are you all right?

38
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,555
I was just messing with you.

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,360
I'm fine.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,260
=The Quirky and The Charming=

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Boss.

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,640
I don't think

43
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,360
Yi Ran is entirely to blame.

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,160
Right?

45
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:02,720
Don't bring her up.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,040
As if that would make you stop
thinking about her.

47
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,400
You don't look tired enough.

48
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,822
Let's run another five kilometers.

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,880
I can't!

50
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,533
I can't run anymore!

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,920
Spare me, Boss!

52
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,800
What a coincidence.

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,960
Why are you everywhere I go?

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,400
So disciplined.

55
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,733
As expected from Mr. Xiao.

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,755
Aren't you the same?

57
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,000
Of course.

58
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,800
I have to keep my body in shape

59
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,800
to serve the hotel better.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,240
Take a break if you're tired.

61
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,480
I'll run a lap with Mr. Xiao.

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,080
Who said I was tired?

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,560
I can run another five kilometers!

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,040
Morning, Nurse Chen!

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Family members aren't allowed

66
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,911
to stay overnight in the rooms.

67
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
I know.

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
I haven't been here for days.

69
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,760
Madam Qin missed me.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,440
I came early this morning.

71
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,000
Didn't stay overnight.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Besides,

73
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,800
the bed is too small for me
to sleep in anyway.

74
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
Don't step on me!

75
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,040
I...

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,640
I had a dream.

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
Dreamt that someone stepped on me.

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,760
You snored

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,480
so loud last night.

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,840
I barely slept.

81
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,600
Is the paper stuck again?

82
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,840
Have Ms. Yi come over to fix it.

83
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,960
Fix what?

84
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,240
She's gone.

85
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,320
I forgot.

86
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,680
It feels strange not having

87
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:33,355
our professional sleeper around.

88
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,511
We have an engineering department,
don't we?

89
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,520
Call Liu!

90
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,688
(Take care of yourself,
go easy on the alcohol!)

91
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,120
There's more in this!

92
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,200
Yi Ran!

93
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,560
Why did you dilute

94
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,480
my expensive wine with water?

95
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,440
Yes?

96
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
Mr. Chen.

97
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,600
Is Mr. Liu with you?

98
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,560
Yes. Why?

99
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,640
Send him down
to the reception after he's done.

100
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,840
The printer's down again.

101
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,360
All right.

102
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,040
Mr. Liu.

103
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,200
The reception needs your help.

104
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,840
All right.

105
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:57,822
It's busy days again
for the Engineering Department

106
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,288
after All-Rounder left.

107
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,000
Right?

108
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,480
Here.

109
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Yes, Hua?

110
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,200
Now?

111
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,120
OK. Got it.

112
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,200
Boss, Mr. Liu and Mr. Lin Jr. are here.

113
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm sorry I'm late,

114
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,120
Mr. Liu.

115
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,800
Mr. Xiao.

116
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,000
That's all right.

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,520
Allow me to introduce you.

118
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,520
This is Mr. Lin Youjia from TY Group.

119
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,400
Mr. Lin Jr.

120
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,400
This is Mr. Xiao.

121
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,080
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Xiao.

122
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,333
The pleasure's mine, Mr. Lin Jr.

123
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,400
We're here today

124
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
to discuss the potential collaboration.

125
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,600
Mr. Liu has been here before.

126
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:57,390
You should have
some idea of the proposal.

127
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
This is Mr. Lin Jr.'s first visit.

128
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,360
Allow me to brief you.

129
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,266
I heard that Mr. Xiao is not only
the head of the Housekeeping Department

130
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:05,280
but is also involved
in the overall operation

131
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:06,480
and planning of the hotel.

132
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,080
He must have
impressive operational skills.

133
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
Why don't we have Mr. Xiao
introduce the details of the hotel?

134
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,960
The details should have

135
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
already been covered by Mr. Liu.

136
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
For the past 20 years,

137
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:19,866
Spring Sea has been
an industry benchmark

138
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:22,200
in terms of service, quality, and scale,

139
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,120
making it a perfect match with TY.

140
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,160
Mr. Liu mentioned

141
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,320
that your company is expanding
its staff this year.

142
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,360
Spring Sea's banquet halls
and meeting rooms

143
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
are well-suited
for your company's needs.

144
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,360
I heard

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,440
there was a bad review about your hotel?

146
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,720
Bad reviews are inevitable in any hotel.

147
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:40,080
You can't satisfy everyone.

148
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,000
But over the past year,

149
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,280
our reputation has become

150
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,480
one of the best in the industry.

151
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,760
Let's not be so serious.

152
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
I've been staying at Spring Sea
these past few days.

153
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,760
Service has been...

154
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
satisfactory.

155
00:09:57,844 --> 00:09:59,355
Let me get straight to the point.

156
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,466
TY is willing to partner with you,

157
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,933
but I have one condition.

158
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,080
Bring Yi Ran back
as your professional sleeper.

159
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,360
If you rehire Yi Ran,

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
I'll personally cover

161
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,520
all of her expenses.

162
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:16,080
And I can sign the contract right now.

163
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,320
For the next three years.

164
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,880
Mr. Xiao.

165
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:23,911
You're not going to refuse

166
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:25,400
such an offer, are you?

167
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,155
I'll have the contract
drafted immediately.

168
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:27,844
I refuse.

169
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,160
We're very sincere about partnering

170
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,280
with your company.

171
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,440
But Yi Ran's trial period is over,

172
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,360
and we have no intention
of rehiring her.

173
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,200
Your methods for pursuing women
are none of our business.

174
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:48,222
But please show some respect.

175
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,400
Also,

176
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,360
Yi Ran is not a bargaining chip
for negotiations.

177
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,040
Boss!

178
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
We worked so hard

179
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,520
to secure TY's contract!

180
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:10,333
And now you're just throwing it away?

181
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,000
You...

182
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,840
What's your problem?

183
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,755
Can't you see what's happening here?

184
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,200
They're using the contract
to humiliate us.

185
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,800
I wouldn't mind being humiliated
if the price is right.

186
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
This is the guest reception plan.

187
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,280
Please confirm it.

188
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,512
Also, here's the trial report

189
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,640
that Ms. Yi left for me.

190
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,920
Recent feedback shows

191
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,960
that even for a five-star hotel,

192
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,040
it's impossible to satisfy everyone.

193
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:21,640
Here's one comment worth noting.

194
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,800
"My child dirtied the hotel wall,

195
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
but the staff didn't make us

196
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
pay for it.

197
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,840
Instead, they comforted my child.

198
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,880
As a regular of this hotel,

199
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,600
this was one of the best
stay experiences we've had."

200
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,840
We've gotten
an unexpectedly positive response.

201
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

202
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,040
That was my oversight.

203
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:52,079
Leverage this

204
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,066
for secondary promotion
and amplify the impact.

205
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,200
Yes, sir!

206
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,720
All right.

207
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440
Check out, please.

208
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,880
All right. A moment, please.

209
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,240
Mr. Li.

210
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,680
Thank you for staying with Spring Sea.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Were you satisfied with our service?

212
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Very satisfied.

213
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,720
Oh, right.

214
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,520
Can you pass this

215
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,800
on to someone for me?

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,920
May I ask who you're referring to?

217
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,320
I don't know her name.

218
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,200
I think she's one of your staff.

219
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,280
A few days ago, she saved my life.

220
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,480
Before I leave,

221
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,888
I'd like to thank her one more time.

222
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,040
We look forward to serving you again.

223
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,200
(I don't know her name.)

224
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,200
(I think she's one of your staff.)

225
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,600
(A few days ago, she saved my life.)

226
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,920
(Before I leave,)

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,488
(I'd like to thank her one more time.)

228
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
(I'm just a burden to you!)

229
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,911
(What the guests are paying for)

230
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:19,760
(isn't how big the TV is,)

231
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,800
how fancy the decor looks,

232
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,200
or how fake the smiles are.

233
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,320
It's about whether they leave

234
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,720
with a feeling that makes them
want to come back.

235
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,520
Sorry.

236
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,880
The number you dialed is currently busy.

237
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,520
Please try again later.

238
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,280
Stop it already.

239
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,120
Didn't I tell you?

240
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,644
Put the fresh flowers in the front,

241
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:11,022
and hide the wilted ones in the back.
Mix them together.

242
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,280
I'm losing money
with the flowers you arrange.

243
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,820
(QH Flower)

244
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,200
Wait.

245
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,280
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't think
you're the right fit for us.

247
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,920
Please look

248
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,040
for another job elsewhere.

249
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,560
The exit's that way.

250
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,920
Just leave that way.

251
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,440
Pretty lady.

252
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,080
Want to date me?

253
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,040
Pretty lady...

254
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,040
I quit!

255
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,760
Madam Qin, what now?

256
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,720
Nothing really.

257
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,560
I just wanted to ask

258
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,280
if you're coming over tonight.

259
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,640
We'll see.

260
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:47,720
I don't even know
how late I'll be working.

261
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,400
Did you eat yet?

262
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
I did.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,360
Our boss treated us today.

264
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,840
It was a lavish meal.

265
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,520
Really?

266
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,920
But I have to remind you.

267
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,760
No matter how good the food is,
don't gorge yourself.

268
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,240
You have a weak stomach.

269
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,360
Got it?

270
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,080
Got it.

271
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm still busy here.

272
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,800
I have to go.

273
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,280
You've got quite the temper.

274
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,800
I quit! Find someone else!

275
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,240
Boss.

276
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,680
Can I have the job?

277
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,920
Weren't things improving?

278
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,760
Did something happen at work?

279
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,000
You know.

280
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,920
I meet all kinds of people

281
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,480
at the hotel every day.

282
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
I always thought

283
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:56,355
that as long as we provided good service

284
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,760
and did everything perfectly,

285
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,640
we could meet
the customers' needs and expectations.

286
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,480
So I've always held my team

287
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,240
to those standards too.

288
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,240
Until I met

289
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,440
someone recently.

290
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,720
A woman?

291
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,680
That's not the point.

292
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,360
The point is that even though

293
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,560
I can't fully understand her...

294
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,000
She's carefree, unpredictable,
and doesn't play by the rules.

295
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,600
But what she says

296
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
has made me wonder

297
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,619
if everything I thought was right

298
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,866
is actually not right after all.

299
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:32,577
You two have different perspectives,

300
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,866
so you see things differently.

301
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:35,800
Maybe you should try to look at things

302
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
from another side.

303
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,280
Including the things

304
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:40,800
you previously couldn't understand.

305
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,520
Cut yourself some slack.

306
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:48,880
New coffee, buy one get one free!

307
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,066
Come and give it a try.

308
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,440
New coffee, buy one get one free!

309
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,760
Come and give it a try.

310
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160
(Principles?)

311
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:57,422
(I'll work hard to improve.)

312
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,600
Can you really stick to them
for the rest of your life?

313
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,100
Maybe you should try to look at things

314
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
from another side.

315
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,400
Including the things

316
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
you previously couldn't understand.

317
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,600
New coffee, buy one get one free!

318
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,760
Come and give it a try.

319
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:15,800
Hello. Please try our new coffee...

320
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,040
Ran.

321
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,440
It's cold out here.

322
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,480
Come inside and warm up.

323
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,960
It's fine. I'm not cold.

324
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,000
You already did me a favor
by paying me in advance.

325
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,360
I can't slack off.

326
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,360
Money

327
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,640
means nothing to me.

328
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:31,577
Don't worry about it.

329
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,560
Let me know if you need more...

330
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
I'll try my luck over there.

331
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,840
There's still a lot of coffee left.

332
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,840
Hello.

333
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,266
New coffee, buy one get one free!
Come and give it a try.

334
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I'll take two bottles.

335
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,160
All right. Just scan this QR code.

336
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,840
OK.

337
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,600
A girl should

338
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,120
take care of herself.

339
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,080
Done.

340
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,560
I'm not buying anything...

341
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,520
It's free.

342
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,520
Then why are you doing this?

343
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,440
Just think of us as Cupids.

344
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,400
Here. Put that on.

345
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,920
Thank you.

346
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,640
Thank you.

347
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,040
Young people
are so generous these days.

348
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,120
New...

349
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,280
Give us two bottles.

350
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,480
I don't think
you should drink that much.

351
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,160
It's for my kids.

352
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,320
I... I'm trying to lose weight.

353
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:25,240
All right.

354
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,680
Please scan this QR code.

355
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,120
All right.

356
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,800
New coffee, buy one get one free!

357
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
Come and give it a try.

358
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,080
Miss.

359
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,480
We're back for more.

360
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,400
Oh, you enjoyed it that much?

361
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:41,755
How many would you like?

362
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:42,133
Two.

363
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:42,640
All right.

364
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
We'll take six more.

365
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,360
Do Cupids drink that much coffee?

366
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,960
You don't know the joy of being cupids!

367
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,480
Thank you!

368
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,560
All right.

369
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,280
Thank you.

370
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

371
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Here you go.

372
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,439
Let's exchange contact information.

373
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,120
Hit me up if you need help again.

374
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,120
No need.

375
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
I'll transfer the money to you.

376
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,040
All right.

377
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,320
Done.

378
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,200
We got you six bottles, sir.

379
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,440
Sir?

380
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,960
I feel bad for you.

381
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,600
She has no idea you're doing this.

382
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:30,755
I transferred the money.

383
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:35,222
Did you have fun?

384
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,640
If you're waiting to see me fail,

385
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,040
then just watch from the side.

386
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,320
Stop messing with me!

387
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,280
Yi Ran...

388
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,160
No drink?

389
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,360
You're here.

390
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,000
How did your interview go?

391
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,360
Don't even mention it.

392
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,280
It's getting harder by the day.

393
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
These companies are only looking

394
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
for entertainment streamers

395
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,400
or beauty streamers.

396
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,920
No one cares how well

397
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:20,044
you can actually sing.

398
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,840
True.

399
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,560
You scroll through any platform now
and it's all about looks.

400
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,466
Who's actually listening to the music?

401
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,000
How's our shop

402
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,320
doing lately?

403
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,600
Oh, yeah.

404
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,240
We barely make anything a month.

405
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,520
I was thinking maybe
we should just shut it down.

406
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,720
Let's hang in there.

407
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,360
What if things turn around?

408
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,320
If you really need help with cash flow,

409
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,160
just tell me.

410
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm a shareholder too.

411
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,888
I'm not going to let you
carry the burden alone.

412
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,600
So,

413
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:51,022
how are things on your end?

414
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,200
Me?

415
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,920
I'm doing fine.

416
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,960
Found a new job.

417
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,680
Already? What kind of job?

418
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,880
To put it simply,

419
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,960
my job

420
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,800
is to analyze customer needs,

421
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,200
coordinate brand placement,

422
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,840
and integrate market resources.

423
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,080
I collect user feedback

424
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,920
to make strategic adjustments

425
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
and regional targeting

426
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,360
more effective.

427
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,000
So you're a marketing director.

428
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,600
A coffee shop employee.

429
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,720
What about the hotel?

430
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,480
That's over.

431
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,120
Back to reality.

432
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,440
Yiyi.

433
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:37,240
You've been drifting around for a while.

434
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,040
Don't you feel tired?

435
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,640
Of course.

436
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,120
But there are things you can't give up

437
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,320
just because you're tired.

438
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:54,080
It's like climbing a mountain.

439
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,755
Focus on imagining
the beautiful view at the top.

440
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,760
Never think about

441
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,480
how much ground you've covered.

442
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,840
I know I'm pretty ordinary.

443
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,120
And I don't have a gift for singing.

444
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
But I still want to give it a try.

445
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,600
Like you said.

446
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,960
Maybe I just might make it one day.

447
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,440
Oh, right.

448
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:22,733
It's almost time.

449
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,020
I promised my fans I'd go live.

450
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:24,688
I have to go.

451
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,880
Take care.

452
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,120
Dress warm!

453
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,800
Got it! You too!

454
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,920
See you!

455
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:39,340
(Youke)

456
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,088
Don't give up, Yi Ran!

457
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,760
See you at the top!

458
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Welcome...

459
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,800
Order, please.

460
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,600
What would you like?

461
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,040
One iced Americano.

462
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,600
Anything else?

463
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,560
Anything else you'd recommend?

464
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,640
One iced Americano.

465
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,040
Oh, sorry...

466
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
Don't worry about it.

467
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,760
Don't get your hands dirty!

468
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,280
Stop!

469
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,200
What are you doing?

470
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,360
Why are you hitting me?

471
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,640
You...

472
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,040
Who are you?

473
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:19,680
He's taking advantage of you!

474
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:20,866
That's none of your business!

475
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:22,800
Hear that?
She said it's none of your business!

476
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,800
Shut up!

477
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:25,555
Or do you want to end up
in the hospital?

478
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,840
Please get rid of him!

479
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:30,360
Come with me.

480
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm not going.

481
00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:32,840
Do you want to see me lose my job?

482
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,911
Would that make you happy?

483
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:35,244
Stop... stop yelling at him.

484
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,680
Calm down.

485
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,960
Calm down.

486
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:39,440
How much did he pay you

487
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,760
to make you so loyal to him?

488
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,520
I...

489
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,220
I just gave her
one month's advance salary.

490
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:44,280
It's not much.

491
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,120
Is that enough?

492
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,320
Come with me.

493
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,760
I'll say it one more time.

494
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:53,760
I don't need you
to meddle in my affairs!

495
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,760
Just leave!

496
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,520
Come on,

497
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,040
please go with him!

498
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,320
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

499
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,720
I'll find a way to pay you back.

500
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:07,644
You don't have to go through
all that trouble.

501
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:08,840
I can help you find a new job.

502
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,240
I'll figure that out myself.

503
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
I don't need your help.

504
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
You were right.

505
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,866
When guests pay to stay at a hotel,

506
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,400
they're not paying for how big the TV is

507
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,555
or how fancy the decor looks.

508
00:27:21,977 --> 00:27:24,355
What they're really buying is
an unforgettable experience.

509
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,960
A feeling that makes them
want to come back.

510
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
You were right.

511
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,000
Yi Ran.

512
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,880
I'm officially inviting you
to join our hotel.

513
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,960
Mr. Xiao.

514
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,960
I don't need your charity.

515
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,400
You have your principles.

516
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,640
I have my pride.

517
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,280
I don't want

518
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,120
to cause you any more trouble.

519
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:55,933
Let's just leave it at that.

520
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,280
From here on out,

521
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,200
we go our separate ways.

522
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,111
Maybe we'll cross paths again someday.

523
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:34,222
He left just like that?

524
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,160
He's not sincere at all.

525
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,920
That part looks beautiful.

526
00:28:53,288 --> 00:28:54,177
And that part too.

527
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:54,560
Yes.

528
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,360
That side too.

529
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,040
Look at that!

530
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,640
Yi Ran!

531
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,080
I'm sorry!

532
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,240
I'm sorry for what I did!

533
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,680
(I'm sorry for what I did!)

534
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,360
Yi Ran!

535
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,440
I'm sorry!

536
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm sorry for what I did!

537
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,120
That's a confession!

538
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,640
It's a confession!

539
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,400
Is that handsome guy
trying to ask you out?

540
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,640
I'll say yes for you!

541
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,600
I'll reflect on myself seriously

542
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,720
and work hard to improve!

543
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
(I'll reflect on myself seriously
and work hard to improve!)

544
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,288
Just say yes!

545
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,680
I'll reflect on myself seriously

546
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,440
and work hard to improve!

547
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,960
I want her to say yes.

548
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,560
Crazy guy.

549
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
(Thank you...)

550
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,960
All right.

551
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,160
How much can you pay me?

552
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,060
(Thank you for forgiving me!)

553
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,480
Take a look, Mr. Lin Jr.

554
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,680
Spring Sea's finances aren't
looking great right now.

555
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,680
It's the perfect time for us
to get involved.

556
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,720
All right.

557
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:21,955
Tell Lin Sr. not to worry.

558
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,600
I'll complete the task
he assigned to me.

559
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,933
You can head back now.

560
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,480
All right.

561
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,480
Ms. Ling, you're looking well.

562
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,200
Thanks to you.
I'm doing better than ever.

563
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,280
Here's the contract. Please review it.

564
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,760
If there are no issues,

565
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,120
you can have it signed and stamped.

566
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,920
You work efficiently.

567
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,760
About Yi Ran...

568
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,760
Rest assured.

569
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:04,280
Once we finalize the contract,

570
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,080
I'll send Yi Ran a job offer at once.

571
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,080
I think I have a new appreciation
for you every time we meet.

572
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,720
Take your time.

573
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,600
You'll discover even more to appreciate.

574
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,244
Looking forward to working with you.

575
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,720
Same here.

576
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,840
Hey.

577
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,800
Are you free for dinner tonight?

578
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,040
I have good news to share.

579
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:31,720
I have good news to share too.

580
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:33,120
I'm going back to Spring Sea.

581
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,600
I'm sorry, sir.

582
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,911
We're sorry, but our hotel
does not provide a hot pot.

583
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,640
A five-star hotel this big!

584
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,320
And you can't even serve hot pot?

585
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,640
I want hot pot today!

586
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Right now!

587
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,320
Sir, this is not a hot pot restaurant.

588
00:31:48,444 --> 00:31:49,866
If you continue making a scene,

589
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:51,066
we'll have to call security.

590
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,640
Everyone, come and see this!

591
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,280
This hotel can't even
provide basic service!

592
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,000
Mr. Chen, I checked.

593
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,480
He is not a guest at our hotel.

594
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
- Sir...
- Stay away!

595
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,244
- Sir...
- Don't come closer!

596
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:04,133
Stay away from me!

597
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:04,860
Sir, please stop.

598
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,760
Stay away from me!

599
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:06,977
- Sir!
- Stay away from me!

600
00:32:07,044 --> 00:32:07,666
Stay away!

601
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,760
You're all ganging up on me!

602
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,240
Where's the justice?

603
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,000
You're bullying me!

604
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,880
Sir...

605
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,680
Where's the justice?

606
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,720
You're all ganging up on me!

607
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,160
This is unjust!

608
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,760
Sir...

609
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
You chose the wrong place
to pull a scam.

610
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,720
I'm back.

611
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,450
(Luosifen Restaurant)

612
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,320
Madam, another.

613
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,580
I'll find a way to pay you back.

614
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,040
What are you doing?

615
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,880
Why?

616
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:48,022
But it's actually good.

617
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:49,600
Better to have
someone fighting for it.

618
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,466
The lighting is a bit better now.

619
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:57,950
Okay.

620
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,790
It's good.

621
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,600
(I'm sorry for what I did!)
It's not easy for me to come up here.

622
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,511
I'll just stand here.

623
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,030
I can do this.

624
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,120
