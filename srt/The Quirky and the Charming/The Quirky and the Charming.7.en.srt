00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,880
=The Quirky and The Charming=

2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,660
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,680
So you came all the way here

4
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,800
just to pick on us?

5
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:35,440
Of course I have to be cautious
when picking a business partner.

6
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,240
Sorry about this.

7
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,600
We intended to let you all
clinch a deal with TY.

8
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
But you know this too.
They have high standards.

9
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,270
They insisted on
working with Bright Platinum Hotel.

10
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,800
I couldn't refuse their invitation.

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,360
But don't worry.

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,880
With our ties, I'll make sure you
do good when I'm doing good.

13
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,600
The tea here is pretty nice.

14
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,160
Next,

15
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,600
they have a three-week training.

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,760
I plan to hold it here.

17
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,040
So, you intend to work
with your competitor?

18
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,520
Competitor?

19
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:06,720
To put it more accurately,
it's a rival who has lost to us.

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,160
Alright.

21
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,640
Reserve the banquet hall for me.

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,240
The details of the collaboration
are documented here.

23
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:13,866
Tell your legal department to review it.

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,720
There's one thing

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
I don't understand and am curious about.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,160
Since Bright Platinum is so great,

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
why did Mr. Lin Jr.

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,960
choose to stay at Spring Sea, then?

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,480
Alright.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,440
You can talk to Ms. Man
regarding the collaboration.

31
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:41,666
I have something else to do.
I'll make a move first.

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm not done yet.

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,440
I...

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,160
The coffee here is pretty special.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,680
I prefer the texture of the coffee here.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
It's slightly sour.

37
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,800
It's not too bitter too.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,880
It's...

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Mr. Lin Jr., you have
a unique preference indeed.

40
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:08,400
You chose to collaborate
with Bright Platinum,

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,733
yet you're staying at Spring Sea.

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,440
What's wrong?

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
Are you keeping your mistress here?

44
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,440
That's right.

45
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,680
How did you find out?

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,200
I guess so.

47
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:20,220
After all, Bright Platinum
is grand and glamorous.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,400
You can't hide anyone there.

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,400
You can have it.

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,400
Don't tell me he's going to jump?

51
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,240
Why don't we help him out?

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,240
We mustn't.

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
We should wait for Boss.

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
No one is as much
of a laughing stock as me!

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,960
She was actually a divorcee!

56
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,520
Ran?

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,520
Why did that happen?

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,080
Why me?

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,800
Why?

60
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:00,680
Do you know the era you're in?

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
Divorce isn't that big of a deal.

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
You shouldn't dwell on it.

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,760
Don't try anything silly.

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,840
She deceived me!

65
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,160
To think that I trusted her.

66
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,720
I...

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
I should take my own life!

68
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,177
You want to take your life
because of this?

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,080
Don't stop me!

70
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,711
You should let me take my life instead.

71
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,560
Your wife was just a divorcee.

72
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,240
But me?

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,400
I only found out
that my husband has a wife

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
on our wedding day.

75
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:38,360
Impossible.

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,560
Who said so?

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,280
That darned Li Lei.

78
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
Not only does he have a wife,

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
but he also has twins.

80
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,080
They're old enough to run errands now.

81
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,960
I served him for so many years.

82
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,760
I devoted my youth to him.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,560
Everything was in vain!

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,800
That's what you called being deceived!

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,520
Is your fate worse than mine?

86
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,280
Just let me die!

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,640
You mustn't.

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,520
If you die now...

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,280
Don't stop me!

90
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,970
- Just let me die!
- It's not worth it.

91
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
You mustn't do it.

92
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,920
Think about it.

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,080
If you jump off because of a scum,

94
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,120
it's not worth it at all.

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Come. You should get down for now.

96
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:23,369
Let's talk this over.

97
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,933
I won't jump. You shouldn't jump either.

98
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:25,840
Let's talk this over.

99
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,933
I'm sure there's a way
to overcome the obstacle.

100
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,080
Tell me.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,400
Why are we so pitiful?

102
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
We share the same fate.

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,360
How can you compare to me?

104
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,360
You're so lucky.

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,560
You see, a divorce

106
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:42,511
is a negative review left
on one's life when they choose partners.

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
She still chose to get married to you

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,080
after getting divorced

109
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,360
because she trusted you.

110
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,240
She trusted you.

111
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
That's why she believed in love again.

112
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,680
You have no idea how much
she has been through

113
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
during this process.

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,000
But...

115
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
She could've told me
about it earlier, right?

116
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,520
She should've...

117
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:02,800
You were together for so long.

118
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,960
Don't you understand why?

119
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:06,920
Was she afraid
that I might take it to heart?

120
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
Maybe it's because

121
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
she doesn't want to lose you.

122
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,040
Back then, I proposed to her

123
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,560
in this very room.

124
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160
I truly love her.

125
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
I love her a lot, you know?

126
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
He's married, he has twins,

127
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:31,755
and they're old enough to run errands?

128
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,360
Isn't she describing Boss?

129
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,400
Did Yi Ran jump off the building?

130
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,960
She's so pitiful.

131
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,040
Let go of him.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,960
Let go of him!

133
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm not talking to you.

134
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,120
Who told her to mess around?

135
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,120
This mister suffered a breakdown

136
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,600
because of his relationship.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Now, he's fine.

138
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:02,977
I was referring to you.

139
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:05,577
Did you say I was messing around?

140
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:12,222
Did you guys actually take alcohol?

141
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Sometimes, we need different methods
to resolve issues.

142
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,040
Don't mind the details too much.

143
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,080
You've let me down utterly.

144
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,760
Get out.

145
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
I'm helping you
to resolve the issue here.

146
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,840
Alright. Guys.

147
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,720
Please be appeased.

148
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,160
There's no need to resort to this.

149
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
Lu, take her outside.

150
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:31,511
No need for that.

151
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,520
I can leave by myself.

152
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,480
You!

153
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,280
Hello. I'm Xiao Mucheng,
head of Housekeeping Department.

154
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
Can I take another sip?

155
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,844
Yi Ran is a member
of the Housekeeping Department now?

156
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,920
Yeah.

157
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:06,777
The issue would've gone out of hand

158
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:08,160
without her intervention.

159
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,311
It would go out of hand
with her intervention.

160
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,920
You're mistaken.

161
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,520
It was an urgent situation.

162
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:15,560
Yi Ran was bold enough
to persuade the guest.

163
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,320
If it were me,

164
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,840
I would've cowered in fear.

165
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,720
I never expected Yi Ran
to be that pitiful.

166
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,520
A playboy cheated on her.

167
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,080
And, she almost got married to him.

168
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,880
Dingdang, say something.

169
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
Yi Ran is so pitiful.

170
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm annoyed. Don't mess with me.

171
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,600
Who offended you again?

172
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,800
You.

173
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm sure it's the God of Plague.

174
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:54,960
He never appreciated my kind intentions.

175
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
If you hate him that much,

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,040
why are you working here?

177
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,880
That God of Plague hired me
with a high salary.

178
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:04,200
He apologized to me sincerely

179
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
for what he did previously.

180
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,680
He insisted on hiring me.

181
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,320
I thought he looked pitiful.

182
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,444
That's why I came back.

183
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,880
If you're unhappy with your job,

184
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,160
I'll arrange other jobs for you.

185
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:15,280
This isn't the only hotel in the city.

186
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,120
What gives?

187
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,280
Why must I be the one
to escape every time?

188
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,680
I want to see what else he's capable of.

189
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Bring it on, then.

190
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,160
I like challenges.

191
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,880
Someone's calling for me.

192
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:32,888
I'll make a move first.

193
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,040
I've understood the situation.

194
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,480
It wasn't your fault.

195
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,040
It's all Li Lei's fault.

196
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Who's Li Lei?

197
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,000
I thought you had
an ex-husband called Li Lei.

198
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
Buddy, don't tell me you fell for it?

199
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,320
Weren't we the ones who got married

200
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,560
and had twins?

201
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Seems like you're fine now.

202
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,111
If so, you have to attend the training.

203
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,688
Report for duty at 9 A.M. tomorrow.

204
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,480
What training?

205
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,466
An employment training.

206
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,755
You need to understand
the hotel's rules, regulations,

207
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,310
and the specific job responsibilities.

208
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,355
Before that, you can only
work here as a part-timer.

209
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,960
There's no need for that.

210
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,520
We're close, aren't we?

211
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,022
Why don't you pull some strings?

212
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,040
I did.

213
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,040
That's why you're here.

214
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,000
Fine. I'll attend the training.

215
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,480
Yi Ran.

216
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,000
I trust you.

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
You can pass it.

218
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,760
God of Plague, thanks for trusting me.

219
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,822
I mean, Vincent.

220
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
This will be your dorm in the future.

221
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,960
It's small,

222
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,160
dark,

223
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,840
and has poor space efficiency.

224
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,560
As for the lighting,

225
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,520
it's not that good.

226
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
Who said so?

227
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,120
Are you okay?

228
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:56,800
We have to clean it.
If not, it'll get infected.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,400
Sit down.

230
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,120
Thank you.

231
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,160
What are you doing?

232
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,600
It wasn't good enough. I'm redoing it.

233
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,320
That's more like it.

234
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:58,160
You should seek treatment.

235
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,840
My poor finger.

236
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,880
The view is great tonight.

237
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,560
Ms. Yi.

238
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,040
Mr. Xiao told me
to call you at this hour.

239
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,177
He said he has arranged
a training for you.

240
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:55,850
Your wage will be deducted
if you're late.

241
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:00,400
I'll be there in a second.

242
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,440
And, stop calling me
Ms. Yi in the future.

243
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:03,422
Just call me Yi Ran.

244
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,800
Alright, Yi Ran.

245
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:07,844
I'll stop bothering you, then.

246
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,600
Great.

247
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:16,000
Now, you two will be
running into each other all the time.

248
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,520
What goes around comes around.

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,400
I'll be honest with you.

250
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,440
You're only able to keep your job
all thanks to Yi Ran.

251
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,240
In the future, we'll be colleagues.

252
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,840
It's better to make another friend
than make another enemy.

253
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,822
You're almost late
on your first day of training.

254
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,320
I'm two minutes early.

255
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,200
I don't care what kind of relationship
you have with Mr. Xiao.

256
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,760
Since he requested me
to train you personally,

257
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:07,288
I have to clarify several things here.

258
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,720
In our hotel,

259
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:12,079
you can pretend to be dumb,
but you cannot be dumb for real.

260
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,700
You're not allowed to waste time,
which is more precious than life.

261
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,400
Do not try to find excuses.

262
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
And, do not reveal your flaws.

263
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,840
Understood?

264
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,000
Understood.

265
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,400
Good.

266
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,880
Let's begin.

267
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:31,790
Monitor room status information
in real time.

268
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,000
(Room Status Information)
You should fully understand

269
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:36,755
the room numbers, names,
and preferences of long-stay guests,

270
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,520
foreign guests, and VIPs to ensure

271
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,840
quick and timely communication
to the floor

272
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,155
and the management personnel.

273
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
You should track VIP receptions,

274
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:44,577
important guest receptions,

275
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,520
and conference receptions.

276
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,760
Notify relevant personnel
to make necessary arrangements

277
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,160
and promptly report
the situation to our Mr. Xiao.

278
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:52,680
What are the specific procedures

279
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,400
for conference reception services?

280
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,380
(Spring Sea Resort Hotel)

281
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,160
What are you writing?

282
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,560
All of you have English nicknames.

283
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,280
I gave myself one as well.

284
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:28,140
(Spring Sea Resort Hotel)

285
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:31,040
What do you think about Anna?

286
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:33,800
Only official employees
need an English nickname.

287
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,960
That'll happen eventually.

288
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,240
Why don't you come up with one for me?

289
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,160
First, you have to pass the assessment.

290
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,880
It's just a test.

291
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,600
Who are you belittling here?

292
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,560
English is an important segment
within the test.

293
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,120
I've returned what I learned
to my teacher long ago.

294
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,840
Aren't we in the service industry?

295
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,920
Silent service is the trend nowadays.

296
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,480
We should just keep quiet
and do our job.

297
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,560
Professional duties,

298
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,040
basic hotel knowledge,

299
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,230
and daily English communication
are essential skills

300
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,360
that must be mastered

301
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,955
and are also required by the hotel.

302
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,720
Are you picking on me on purpose?

303
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:16,960
Since that's the case,

304
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,960
from tomorrow onward,

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,530
you should come to my office at 8 P.M.

306
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:21,160
for an English test every day.

307
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,920
You must be joking.

308
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,320
You said I was picking on you, right?

309
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,440
Of course I need
to fulfill that obligation.

310
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
See you tomorrow night.

311
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,360
Got it.

312
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:46,619
You haven't finished your meal.

313
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,650
Ms. Man doesn't like it
when people waste her time.

314
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,920
I was looking for you.

315
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,600
Come with me.

316
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,280
Where are we going?

317
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,880
You'll know when you come with me.

318
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:14,760
Let's go.

319
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,800
Ran,

320
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,960
without you,

321
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,800
we would have no way
to deal with Mr. Hao.

322
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:25,266
We would've been criticized

323
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:26,644
if Yi Ran didn't intervene.

324
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,660
You took the blame for us
and bought us a meal.

325
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,711
I feel really bad about it.

326
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
That was a piece of cake.

327
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,320
Come. Let's have a toast.

328
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,280
Cheers.

329
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,320
Cheers.

330
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,360
Yi Ran.

331
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,720
I admit.

332
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,960
I wasn't serious enough
during work before this.

333
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,360
I kept badmouthing you as well.

334
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,840
We started off on the wrong foot,
but here we are.

335
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,520
Let me apologize to you officially.

336
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,080
I'll apologize to you too.

337
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,240
Why are you apologizing to her?

338
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,400
What have you done to let me down?

339
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,320
Nothing.

340
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,680
If so, don't just join her for fun.

341
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,040
You want me to forgive you, huh?

342
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,280
I won't, unless

343
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:09,920
we drink until we drop!

344
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,400
Cheers!

345
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,240
Cheers!

346
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,760
- Cheers!
- Drink until we drop!

347
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,640
Strange.

348
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:13,800
Why do I keep dreaming about him lately?

349
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I can't even sleep well.

350
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,560
This is our initial funding plan.

351
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:31,733
Our city has been developing rapidly

352
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:32,800
in recent years.

353
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,840
At present,
the permanent non-local population

354
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,560
is around 12 million.

355
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,560
We have plenty
of development space and potential.

356
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:41,133
According to my knowledge,

357
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,520
Bright Platinum Hotel

358
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:44,266
is one of the top five-star hotels here.

359
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,560
There's a stable customer base

360
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,000
even during slow season.

361
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,120
What's wrong?

362
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:50,177
Do you guys lack capital as well?

363
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,520
Our goal

364
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
is not to be one of the city's
top five-star hotels.

365
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,955
Our goal is to be
the top five-star hotel.

366
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,440
We aim to maintain a stable cash flow

367
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,120
while utilizing this round of funding

368
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,240
for the expansion
and renovation of the hotel.

369
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,320
Understood.

370
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,160
Ms. Ling, I'm sure
you know our company well.

371
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,640
Although Beisiman

372
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,720
doesn't invest in many projects,

373
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,760
all the companies
involved in our investment

374
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,760
are leading domestic enterprises.

375
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,920
Although our hotel isn't considered
a leading domestic enterprise yet,

376
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,280
we have our advantage.

377
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,160
I'm confident that Bright Platinum Hotel

378
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,200
is the company
with the greatest potential for you.

379
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:31,911
We're confident in your company

380
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:32,977
with regards to that.

381
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,560
But I need to get back to the point.

382
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,320
ROI is important for investments.

383
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,600
Four years isn't a short period.

384
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:42,540
Further due diligence
is required on our part.

385
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,040
Ms. Ling,
I hope you can understand that.

386
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,640
No problem.

387
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,488
I look forward to our collaboration.

388
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,600
Likewise.

389
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,480
Alright.

390
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,240
I'll make a move first.

391
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,080
Alright. Take care.

392
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,880
Okay.

393
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,000
You heard that, right?

394
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,120
We've only engaged Spring Sea initially.

395
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:09,444
I don't know where Bright Platinum
heard the news from.

396
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,320
But judging from her attitude,

397
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,880
I think they're sincere in securing

398
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,440
a collaboration with us.

399
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,920
Ling Yishu is truly interesting.

400
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,600
She's trying to compete with Spring Sea

401
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,400
in everything.

402
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,640
Since they're sincere,

403
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,000
let's lend her a hand.

404
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:34,000
But do you still intend
to collaborate with Spring Sea...

405
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:35,088
The plan is unchanged.

406
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:36,955
I'll explain it
to Bright Platinum Hotel.

407
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,480
To Lin Sr.,

408
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:40,311
whether it's a restaurant or a hotel,

409
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,288
the goal is to connect
with more consumers.

410
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,480
No amount of jewelry or luxury goods

411
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,480
can take over their lifestyle.

412
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,680
Securing a 365-day lock-in

413
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,200
is the only way

414
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,911
to reach our ultimate goal
of cross-industry market domination.

415
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:54,840
By the way,

416
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,480
it's inconvenient for TY and Lin Sr.
to make an appearance now.

417
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,040
You shall represent Beisiman entirely.

418
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,080
I know what to do.

419
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,920
No one will expect you

420
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,680
to be the owner

421
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,960
of Beisiman.

422
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,822
The game is more fun
if you have more participants.

423
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,680
Mr. Xiao?

424
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,400
There's nothing
this man is incapable of.

425
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,760
Everyone has the same 24 hours per day.

426
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,200
But what he does is decent

427
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,640
while I'm barely scraping by.

428
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,480
I hate him for being so outstanding.

429
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
How dare you pick on me?

430
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,360
Arrange lessons?

431
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,480
Being so outstanding?

432
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:17,960
(Murphy's Law)
I'll deal with you.

433
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,980
(Thoughts on Life)

434
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,360
Why were you sneaking around?

435
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:26,911
It's nothing.

436
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:28,555
I was helping you
to organize your books.

437
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:30,600
They're already organized.
I don't need your help.

438
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,160
Alright.

439
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:34,711
Get one question wrong,
and you have to stay for evening study.

440
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,520
Bring it on.

441
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,800
Please go ahead.

442
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:39,333
What's the meaning
of excellent service?

443
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,280
Excellent service includes
good etiquette and manners,

444
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
neat attire, and refined speech.

445
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,840
Mister, please have a seat.

446
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,760
An excellent service attitude
also includes

447
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,000
kindness, enthusiasm,

448
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,640
honesty, and a humble approach.

449
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,160
Mister,

450
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,560
may I help you?

451
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,840
The third point is to proactively
consider the needs of guests.

452
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,920
Mister, please have some coffee.

453
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,880
The fourth point is to be considerate.

454
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,080
Mister,

455
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,480
you just drooled a little.

456
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,480
But it's fine.

457
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,960
I've already wiped it clean.

458
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,240
Do not place coffee on my books.

459
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,480
And,

460
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,680
do not mess up my order.

461
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:06,466
Study hall for you.

462
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,560
But why?

463
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,040
Haven't I recited everything?

464
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:11,200
Yes, you have.
But your demonstration was wrong.

465
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,800
Boss.

466
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,680
Speak.

467
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,200
I folded one of the pages in your books.

468
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,280
What did you say? Which book?

469
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
I don't know.

470
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:23,511
Why don't you find out yourself?

471
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,360
Stop right there.

472
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:25,440
Stop right there!

473
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,000
You!

474
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,120
That's not a smile.

475
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:17,260
First, you need to smile.

476
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,000
Make sure the corners
of your mouth turn up.

477
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,640
Your eyes should look down.

478
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,320
And keep your expressive eyes open.

479
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,160
This way.

480
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,240
Give me a smile, then.

481
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,320
Look. It's very simple.

482
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,000
Hello, mister.

483
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,040
Welcome to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

484
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,840
Do you have a reservation?

485
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,240
Yes. Please check it for me.

486
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,920
Alright, mister. Please wait a moment.

487
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,320
Okay. Welcome.

488
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:04,800
"Qian Tai" in English.

489
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,720
Reception?

490
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:14,800
What about "Yu Ding"?

491
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,920
"Yu Ding"...

492
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,600
Can I help you?

493
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,440
No smoking.

494
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,440
My brain isn't working anymore.

495
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,760
Ran, please memorize them.

496
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,720
If not, Mr. Xiao
will summon me again.

497
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,080
If so,

498
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,320
why don't I just quit?

499
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
He's not helping me out here.

500
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,280
He's trying to kill me.

501
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:05,320
He just wants you

502
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,520
to handle guests
and assume your position earlier.

503
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,320
How long do I have to wait, then?

504
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:11,880
What about this?

505
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,680
I'll teach you some
basic English phrases.

506
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,940
They're more than enough
for daily conversational uses.

507
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,800
Really?

508
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,560
Don't worry.

509
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,640
Once you learn them,

510
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,600
I promise you can show off
in the hotel no matter where you are.

511
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,760
Why didn't you bring out
this trump card earlier?

512
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,440
Hurry up.

513
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:29,200
Come. Let me teach you.

514
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:30,280
This is the first phrase.

515
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,800
Hello.

516
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,600
Can you help me to take the package?

517
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,320
Sorry. My English is not so good.

518
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,800
Okay.

519
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,640
Done.

520
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,440
Hello.

521
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,120
Hi. Are you busy now?

522
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,320
The English phrases you taught me
worked like a charm.

523
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,320
Of course.

524
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,520
You can show off no matter where you go.

525
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,640
Go now.

526
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,200
Can I help you?

527
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,200
Yes. I reserved a room for tonight.

528
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,240
Okay. Come here.

529
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:18,480
He wants to do his check-in.

530
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,120
Hello.

531
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,360
Okay. Please wait a moment.

532
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,840
Welcome to Spring Sea Resort Hotel.

533
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,000
Thank you.

534
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,640
This way, please.

535
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,080
This way, please.

536
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,320
I need a morning call service at 8 A.M.

537
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,240
Sorry.

538
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,080
My English is not so good.

539
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,040
Me too.

540
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
I need a morning call service at 8 A.M.

541
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,000
Morning call?

542
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,133
- Yes.
- Morning call, right?

543
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:52,680
Yes.

544
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,440
At 8 A.M.?

545
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,280
Yes.

546
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,000
Okay.

547
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,000
No problem.

548
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,120
You're cute.

549
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,640
You're welcome.

550
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:02,933
Do you understand what I said?

551
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:03,600
Okay.

552
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,920
Can you be my girlfriend, then?

553
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,560
Yes. Okay.

554
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,160
Sorry. She has a boyfriend.

555
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,640
Don't misunderstand me.
I just thought she was cute.

556
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,360
You can find us anytime
if you need anything.

557
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,680
Alright. Thank you.

558
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,320
You can speak Chinese?

559
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,280
A little.

560
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,920
Thank you.

561
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,480
Who taught you English?

562
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,960
I think I've dealt with it well.

563
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,480
It's just that he speaks with an accent.

564
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,200
He's French. He spoke French just now.

565
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,920
I was wondering

566
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:47,760
why the English phrases
Cindy had taught me

567
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,280
didn't work.

568
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,769
Just now, he asked you

569
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,349
if you were willing
to be his girlfriend.

570
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,780
I said you already have a boyfriend.

571
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,333
You can't just answer "yes" and "okay"

572
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,760
to every question, you know?

573
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:03,320
But I don't have a boyfriend.

574
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,280
You...

575
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:07,600
I'll return to work first.

576
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,600
Come here.

577
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,360
After two days of serious training,

578
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,844
I'm now familiar with the basics

579
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:25,600
of housekeeping and work procedures.

580
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,222
I can give it a five-star review.

581
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:28,990
Is this what you mean
by a five-star review?

582
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,680
Come with me.

583
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
The toothbrush labels
are placed differently.

584
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,400
The labels have not been
aligned to the same level.

585
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,440
The soap box isn't centered.

586
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,440
There are water stains
and marks all over the basin.

587
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,600
There are fingerprints on the tap.

588
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,000
Negative review.

589
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,977
(Negative Review)

590
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,440
There's hair on the floor

591
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,920
and dust in the air.

592
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,120
Boss, that's your hair.

593
00:34:31,577 --> 00:34:33,000
You didn't clean the refrigerator.

594
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,160
Negative review.

595
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,960
I did forget about that.

596
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,080
I was nervous because you were here.

597
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:41,560
I acknowledge your effort.

598
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,500
But you saw the result.

599
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,350
I can only give you...

600
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:44,160
A negative review.

601
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,440
I know that.

602
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,240
But aren't you being too strict

603
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:48,777
for judging the efforts of an intern

604
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,240
with such high standards?

605
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Everyone has the right to question.

606
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,639
In Spring Sea,
everything has to be perfect.

607
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,720
We can't just make do with everything,
like your English.

608
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,560
Yes, sir.

609
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,560
There's no perfect service in the world.

610
00:35:01,555 --> 00:35:03,920
In that case, you should
start with the turndown service.

611
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,720
Wait. Why is there a new task?

612
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,880
What service?

613
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,320
Turndown service.

614
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,760
I'll inspect your work tonight.

615
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,040
Turndown service?

616
00:35:37,777 --> 00:35:39,111
Is there something on your mind?

617
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,120
Nothing.

618
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,680
I just want to ask you

619
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,760
if our hotel provides
any special services

620
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,880
to our guests at night?

621
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,840
You mean turndown service?

622
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,480
Lower your volume.

623
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,440
That's normal.

624
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:06,066
Even if no guests request us to do so,

625
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:07,720
we should do it every day.

626
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,120
It's normal?

627
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,840
We should do them every day?

628
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,480
We start from 8 P.M.

629
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,760
It usually ends at 8:30 P.M.

630
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,560
Who are you providing the service to?

631
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,160
Have you reached that stage already?

632
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:21,222
What were you two chatting about?

633
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Let me ask you something.

634
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,760
Have you done a turndown service before?

635
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,800
Yeah.

636
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,400
You too?

637
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,311
Did the God of Plague
force you to do so?

638
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
I don't think so.

639
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,720
It's all part of work.

640
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,840
It's only been a few days.

641
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:57,400
I can't believe I have to go through
the industry's unspoken rules.

642
00:36:57,888 --> 00:36:59,400
How dare he mention it in front of me?

643
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,800
Do I look like that sort of person?

644
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,720
I don't think he's someone like that.

645
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,880
I think you should clarify it first.

646
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,480
It might be a misunderstanding.

647
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,880
I've already inquired about it.

648
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,040
Everyone was already used to it.

649
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,560
He's so despicable.

650
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,080
What an animal.

651
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,160
I can't believe that your hotel
would do such a thing.

652
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,280
What do you plan to do, then?

653
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,680
I need to expose them.

654
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,720
Later, I'll use
the procedure to my advantage.

655
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,880
I'll record the entire process

656
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:31,480
and post it for the world to see.

657
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,080
Stop. It's too risky for you
to head there alone.

658
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,320
I have to join you.

659
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,600
Don't worry.

660
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,880
I'll be super cautious.

661
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,760
What do you think I should do?

662
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:44,200
Should I play some music?

663
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,640
Should I wear

664
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,720
something revealing?

665
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,880
Or should I prepare some tools?

666
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:53,840
Stop right there.

667
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,400
Why do I feel like

668
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,000
you're looking forward to it?

669
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:01,222
Don't spout nonsense.

670
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:02,440
That's not true.

671
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,880
Stop lying.

672
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:04,960
That's not true.

673
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,040
You're still denying it?

674
00:39:09,288 --> 00:39:11,800
I can't catch the bad guys
without sacrificing myself.

675
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,733
I have to enter
the lion's den this time.

676
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Come in. I'm ready.

677
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,960
You're finally here.

678
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,160
Come in.

679
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,440
What are you doing?

680
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,120
Didn't you request a turndown service?

681
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:41,800
I don't like it when the lights are on.

682
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,440
What are you doing, then?

683
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,120
I'm ready. Let's get started.

684
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,360
Yi Ran, what are you doing?

685
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,040
Why are you wearing so many layers?

686
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,940
There's no mirror.

687
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,760
I was told to look in the mirror.

688
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,560
Well, I know that.

689
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,040
I mean...

690
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,580
I stand here,

691
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,911
or do I still need to go over there?

692
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,490
So would you kick him at this moment?

693
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,220
Yi Ran!

694
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,870
Yi Ran!

695
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,960
You're wearing so many...

696
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,880
Cut!

697
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:43,001
=The Quirky and The Charming=
